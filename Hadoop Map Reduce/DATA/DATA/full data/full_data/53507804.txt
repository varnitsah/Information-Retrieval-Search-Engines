 strange stories   by grant allen j arbuthnot wilson   illustration   with a frontispiece by george du maurier   london chatto and windus piccadilly 1884     preface   it is with some little trepidation that i venture to submit to the critical world this small collection of short stories i feel that in doing so i owe some apology both to my readers and to the regular storytellers being by trade a psychologist and scientific journeyman i have been bold enough at times to stray surreptitiously and tentatively from my proper sphere into the flowery fields of pure fiction some of these my divarications from the strict path of sterner science however having been already publicly performed under the incognito of j arbuthnot wilson have been so far condoned by generous and kindly critics that i am emboldened to present them to the judgment of readers under a more permanent form and even to dispense with the convenient cloak of a pseudonym under which one can always so easily cover ones hasty retreat from an untenable position i can only hope that my confession will be accepted in partial extenuation of this culpable departure from the good old rule ne sutor ultra crepidam and that older hands at the craft of storytelling will pardon an amateur novice his defective workmanship on the general plea of his humble demeanour  i may perhaps also venture to plead in selfdefence that though these stories do not profess to be anything more than mere short sensational tales i have yet endeavoured to give to most of them some slight tinge of scientific or psychological import and meaning the reverend john creedy for example is a study from within of a singular persistence of hereditary character well known to all students of modern anthropological papers and reports members of barbarous or savage races trained for a time in civilized habits are liable at any moment to revert naturally to their primitive condition especially under the contagious influence of companionship with persons of their own blood and close subjection to the ancestral circumstances the tale which i have based upon several such historical instances in real life endeavours briefly to hint at the modes of feeling likely to accompany such a relapse into barbarism in an essentially fine and sensitive savage nature to most european readers no doubt such a sheer fall from the pinnacle of civilization to the nethermost abysses of savagery would seem to call for the display of no other emotion than pure disgust and aversion but those who know intimately the whole gamut of the intensely impressionable african mind will be able to treat its temptations and its tendencies far more sympathetically in the curate of churnside again i have tried to present a psychical analysis of a temperament not uncommon among the cultured class of the italian renaissance and less rare than many people will be inclined to imagine among the colder type of our own emancipated and cultivated classes the union of high intellectual and æsthetic culture with a total want of moral sensibility is a recognized fact in many periods of history though our own age is singularly loth to admit of its possibility in its own contemporaries in ram das of cawnpore once more i have attempted to depict a few circumstances of the indian mutiny as they must naturally have presented themselves to the mind and feelings of a humble native actor in that great and terrible drama accustomed ourselves to looking always at the massacres and reprisals of the mutiny from a purely english point of view we are liable to forget that every act of the mutineers and their aiders or abettors must have been fully justified in their own eyes at the moment at least as every act of every human being always is to his own inner personality in his conscience of conscience no man ever really believes that under given circumstances he could conceivably have acted otherwise than he actually did if he persuades himself that he does really so believe then he shows himself at once to be a very poor introspective psychologist the child of the phalanstery to take another case is a more ideal effort to realize the moral conceptions of a community brought up under a social and ethical environment utterly different from that by which we ourselves are now surrounded in like manner almost all the stories except the lightest among them have their germ or prime motive in some scientific or quasiscientific idea and this narrow link which thus connects them at bottom with my more habitual sphere of work must serve as my excuse to the regular storytellers for an otherwise unwarrantable intrusion upon their private preserves i trust they will forgive me on this plea for my trespass on their legitimate domains and allow me to occupy in peace a little adjacent corner of unclaimed territory which lies so temptingly close beside my own small original freehold  i should add that the reverend john creedy the curate of churnside dr greatrexs engagement and the backslider have already appeared in the cornhill magazine while the foundering of the fortuna was first published in longmans magazine the remainder of the tales comprised in this volume have seen the light originally in the pages of belgravia i have to thank the courtesy of the publishers and editors of those periodicals for kind permission to reprint

ba of magdalen college oxford will preach in walton magna church on behalf of the gold coast mission not a very startling announcement that and yet simple as it looks it stirred ethel berrys soul to its inmost depths for ethel had been brought up by her aunt emily to look upon foreign missions as the one thing on earth worth living for and thinking about and the reverend john creedy ba had a missionary history of his own strange enough even in these strange days of queer juxtapositions between utter savagery and advanced civilization  only think she said to her aunt as they read the placard on the schoolhouseboard hes a real african negro the vicar says taken from a slaver on the gold coast when he was a child and brought to england to be educated hes been to oxford and got a degree and now hes going out again to africa to convert his own people and hes coming down to the vicars to stay on wednesday  its my belief said old uncle james aunt emilys brother the superannuated skipper that hed much better stop in england for ever ive been a good bit on the coast myself in my time after palm oil and such and my opinion is that a niggers a nigger anywhere but hes a sight less of a nigger in england than out yonder in africa take him to england and you make a gentleman of him send him home again and the nigger comes out at once in spite of you  oh james aunt emily put in how can you talk such unchristianlike talk setting yourself up against missions when we know that all the nations of the earth are made of one blood  ive always lived a christian life myself emily answered uncle james though i have cruised a good bit on the coast too which is against it certainly but i take it a niggers a nigger whatever you do with him the ethiopian cannot change his skin the scripture says nor the leopard his spots and a nigger hell be to the end of his days you mark my words emily  on wednesday in due course the reverend john creedy arrived at the vicarage and much curiosity there was throughout the village of walton magna that week to see this curious new thing a coalblack parson next day thursday an almost equally unusual event occurred to ethel berry for to her great surprise she got a little note in the morning inviting her up to a tennis party at the vicarage the same afternoon now though the vicar called on aunt emily often enough and accepted her help readily for school feasts and other village festivities of the milder sort the berrys were hardly up to that level of society which is commonly invited to the parsons lawn tennis parties and the reason why ethel was asked on this particular thursday must be traced to a certain pious conspiracy between the vicar and the secretary of the gold coast evangelistic society when those two eminent missionary advocates had met a fortnight before at exeter hall the secretary had represented to the vicar the desirability of young john creedys taking to himself an english wife before his departure it will steady him and keep him right on the coast he said and it will give him importance in the eyes of the natives as well whereto the vicar responded that he knew exactly the right girl to suit the place in his own parish and that by a providential conjunction she already took a deep interest in foreign missions so these two good men conspired in all innocence of heart to sell poor ethel into african slavery and the vicar had asked john creedy down to walton magna on purpose to meet her  that afternoon ethel put on her pretty sateen and her witching little white hat with two natural dogroses pinned on one side and went pleased and proud up to the vicarage the reverend john creedy was there not in full clerical costume but arrayed in tennis flannels with only a loose white tie beneath his flap collar to mark his newly acquired spiritual dignity he was a comely looking negro enough fullblooded but not too broadfaced nor painfully african in type and when he was playing tennis his athletic quick limbs and his really handsome build took away greatly from the general impression of an inferior race his voice was of the ordinary oxford type open pleasant and refined with a certain easygoing air of natural gentility hardly marred by just the faintest tinge of the thick negro blur in the broad vowels when he talked to etheland the vicars wife took good care that they should talk together a great dealhis conversation was of a sort that she seldom heard at walton magna it was full of london and oxford of boatraces at iffley and cricket matches at lords of people and books whose very names ethel had never heardone of them was a mr mill she thought and another a mr aristotlebut which she felt vaguely to be one step higher in the intellectual scale than her own level then his friends to whom he alluded casually not like one who airs his grand acquaintances were such very distinguished people there was a real live lord apparently at the same college with him and he spoke of a young baronet whose estate lay close by as plain harrington of christchurch without any sir arthura thing which even the vicar himself would hardly have ventured to do she knew that he was learned too as a matter of fact he had taken a fair second class in greats at oxford and he could talk delightfully of poetry and novels to say the truth john creedy in spite of his black face dazzled poor ethel for he was more of a scholar and a gentleman than anybody with whom she had ever before had the chance of conversing on equal terms  when ethel turned the course of talk to africa the young parson was equally eloquent and fascinating he didnt care about leaving england for many reasons but he would be glad to do something for his poor brethren he was enthusiastic about missions that was a common interest and he was so anxious to raise and improve the condition of his fellownegroes that ethel couldnt help feeling what a noble thing it was of him thus to sacrifice himself cultivated gentleman as he was in an african jungle for his heathen countrymen altogether she went home from the tenniscourt that afternoon thoroughly overcome by john creedys personality she didnt for a moment think of falling in love with hima certain indescribable raceinstinct set up an impassable barrier against thatbut she admired him and was interested in him in a way that she had never yet felt with any other man  as for john creedy he was naturally charmed with ethel in the first place he would have been charmed with any english girl who took so much interest in himself and his plans for like all negroes he was frankly egotistical and delighted to find a white lady who seemed to treat him as a superior being but in the second place ethel was really a charming simple english village lassie with sweet little manners and a delicious blush who might have impressed a far less susceptible man than the young negro parson so whatever ethel felt john creedy felt himself truly in love and after all john creedy was in all essentials an educated english gentleman with the same chivalrous feelings towards a pretty and attractive girl that every english gentleman ought to have  on sunday morning aunt emily and ethel went to the parish church and the reverend john creedy preached the expected sermon it was almost his firstsounded like a trial trip uncle james mutteredbut it was undoubtedly what connoisseurs describe as an admirable discourse john creedy was free from any tinge of nervousnessnegroes never know what that word meansand he spoke fervently eloquently and with much power of manner about the necessity for a gold coast mission perhaps there was really nothing very original or striking in what he said but his way of saying it was impressive and vigorous the negro like many other lower races has the faculty of speech largely developed and john creedy had been noted as one of the readiest and most fluent talkers at the oxford union debates when he enlarged upon the need for workers the need for help the need for succour and sympathy in the great task of evangelization aunt emily and ethel forgot his black hands stretched out openpalmed towards the people and felt only their hearts stirred within them by the eloquence and enthusiasm of that appealing gesture  the end of it all was that instead of a week john creedy stopped for two months at walton magna and during all that time he saw a great deal of ethel before the end of the first fortnight he walked out one afternoon along the riverbank with her and talked earnestly of his expected mission  miss berry he said as they sat to rest awhile on the parapet of the little bridge by the weeping willows i dont mind going to africa but i cant bear going all alone i am to have a station entirely by myself up the ancobra river where i shall see no other christian face from years end to years end i wish i could have had some one to accompany me  you will be very lonely ethel answered i wish indeed you could have some companionship  do you really john creedy went on it is not good for man to live alone he wants a helpmate oh miss ethel may i venture to hope that perhaps if i can try to deserve you you will be mine  ethel started in dismay mr creedy had been very attentive very kind and she had liked to hear him talk and had encouraged his coming but she was hardly prepared for this the nameless something in our blood recoiled at it the proposal stunned her and she said nothing but oh mr creedy how can you say such a thing  john creedy saw the shadow on her face the unintentional dilatation of her delicate nostrils the faint puckering at the corner of her lips and knew with a negros quick instinct of facereading what it all meant oh miss ethel he said with a touch of genuine bitterness in his tone dont you too despise us i wont ask you for any answer now i dont want an answer but i want you to think it over do think it over and consider whether you can ever love me i wont press the matter on you i wont insult you by importunity but i will tell you just this once and once for all what i feel i love you and i shall always love you whatever you answer me now i know it would cost you a wrench to take me a greater wrench than to take the least and the unworthiest of your own people but if you can only get over that first wrench i can promise earnestly and faithfully to love you as well as ever woman yet was loved dont say anything now he went on as he saw she was going to open her mouth again wait and think it over pray it over and if you cant see your way straight before you when i ask you this day fortnight yes or no answer me no and i give you my word of honour as a gentleman i will never speak to you of the matter again but i shall carry your picture written on my heart to my grave  and ethel knew that he was speaking from his very soul  when she went home she took aunt emily up into her little bedroom over the porch where the dogroses grew and told her all about it aunt emily cried and sobbed as if her heart would break but she saw only one answer from the first it is a gate opened to you my darling she said i shall break my heart over it ethel but it is a gate opened and though she felt that all the light would be gone out of her life if ethel went she worked with her might from that moment forth to induce ethel to marry john creedy and go to africa poor soul she acted faithfully up to her lights  as for uncle james he looked at the matter very differently her instinct is against it he said stoutly and our instincts wasnt put in our hearts for nothing theyre meant to be a guide and a light to us in these dark questions no white girl ought to marry a black man even if he is a parson it aint natural our instinct is again it a white man may marry a black woman if he likes i dont say anything again him though i dont say id do it myself not for any money but a white woman to marry a black man why it makes our blood rise you know specially if youve happened to have cruised worth speaking of along the coast  but the vicar and the vicars wife were charmed with the prospect of success and spoke seriously to ethel about it it was a call they thought and ethel oughtnt to disregard it they had argued themselves out of those wholesome race instincts that uncle james so rightly valued and they were eager to argue ethel out of them too what could the poor girl do her aunt and the vicar on the one hand and john creedy on the other were too much between them for her native feelings at the end of the fortnight john creedy asked her his simple question yes or no and half against her will she answered yes john creedy took her hand delicately in his and fervidly kissed the very tips of her fingers something within him told him he must not kiss her lips she started at the kiss but she said nothing john creedy noticed the start and said within himself i shall so love and cherish her that i will make her love me in spite of my black skin for with all the faults of his negro nature john creedy was at heart an earnest and affectionate man after his kind  and ethel really did to some extent love him already it was such a strange mixture of feeling from one point of view he was a gentleman by position a clergyman a man of learning and of piety and from this point of view ethel was not only satisfied but even proud of him for the rest she took him as some good catholics take the veil from a sense of the call and so before the two months were out ethel berry had married john creedy and both started together at once for southampton on their way to axim aunt emily cried and hoped they might be blessed in their new work but uncle james never lost his misgivings about the effect of africa upon a born african instincts is a great thing he said with a shake of his head as he saw the west coast mail steam slowly down southampton water and when he gets among his own people his instincts will surely get the better of him as safe as my name is james berry   ii  the little mission bungalow at butabué a wooden shed neatly thatched with fan palms had been built and garnished by the native catechist from axim and his wife before the arrival of the missionaries so that ethel found a habitable dwelling ready for her at the end of her long boat journey up the rapid stream of the ancobra there the strangely matched pair settled down quietly enough to their work of teaching and catechizing for the mission had already been started by the native evangelist and many of the people were fairly ready to hear and accept the new religion for the first ten or twelve months ethels letters home were full of praise and love for dear john now that she had come to know him well she wondered she had ever feared to marry him no husband was ever so tender so gentle so considerate he nursed her in all her little ailments like a woman she leaned on him as a wife leans on the strong arm of her husband and then he was so clever so wise so learned her only grief was that she feared she was not and would never be good enough for him yet it was well for her that they were living so entirely away from all white society at butabué for there she had nobody with whom to contrast john but the halfclad savages around them judged by the light of that startling contrast good john creedy with his cultivated ways and gentle manners seemed like an englishman indeed  john creedy for his part thought no less well of his ethel he was tenderly respectful to her more distant perhaps than is usual between husband and wife even in the first months of marriage but that was due to his innate delicacy of feeling which made him half unconsciously recognize the depth of the gulf that still divided them he cherished her like some saintly thing too sacred for the common world yet ethel was his helper in all his work so cheerful under the necessary privations of their life so ready to put up with bananas and cassava balls so apt at kneading plantain paste so willing to learn from the negro women all the mysteries of mixing agadey cankey and koko pudding no tropical heat seemed to put her out of temper even the horrible country fever itself she bore with such gentle resignation john creedy felt in his heart of hearts that he would willingly give up his life for her and that it would be but a small sacrifice for so sweet a creature  one day shortly after their arrival at butabué john creedy began talking in english to the catechist about the best way of setting to work to learn the native language he had left the country when he was nine years old he said and had forgotten all about it the catechist answered him quickly in a fantee phrase john creedy looked amazed and started  what does he say asked ethel  he says that i shall soon learn if only i listen but the curious thing is ethie that i understand him  it has come back to you john thats all you are so quick at languages and now you hear it again you remember it  perhaps so said the missionary slowly but i have never recalled a word of it for all these years i wonder if it will all come back to me  of course it will dear said ethel you know things come to you so easily in that way you almost learned portuguese while we were coming out from hearing those benguela people  and so it did come back sure enough before john creedy had been six weeks at butabué he could talk fantee as fluently as any of the natives around him after all he was nine years old when he was taken to england and it was no great wonder that he should recollect the language he had heard in his childhood till that age still he himself noticed rather uneasily that every phrase and word down to the very heathen charms and prayers of his infancy came back to him now with startling vividness and without an effort  four months after their arrival john saw one day a tall and ugly negro woman in the scanty native dress standing near the rude marketplace where the butabué butchers killed and sold their reeking goatmeat ethel saw him start again and with a terrible foreboding in her heart she could not help asking him why he started i cant tell you ethie he said piteously for heavens sake dont press me i want to spare you but ethel would hear is it your mother john she asked hoarsely  no thank heaven not my mother ethie he answered her with something like pallor on his dark cheek not my mother but i remember the woman  a relative  oh ethie dont press me yes my mothers sister i remember her years ago let us say no more about it and ethel looking at that gaunt and squalid savage woman shuddered in her heart and said no more  slowly as time went on however ethel began to notice a strange shade of change coming over johns ideas and remarks about the negroes at first he had been shocked and distressed at their heathendom and savagery but the more he saw of it the more he seemed to find it natural enough in their position and even in a sort of way to sympathize with it or apologize for it one morning a month or two later he spoke to her voluntarily of his father he had never done so in england i can remember he said he was a chief a great chief he had many wives and my mother was one he was beaten in war by kola and i was taken prisoner but he had a fine palace at kwantah and many fanbearers ethel observed with a faint terror that he seemed to speak with pride and complacency of his fathers chieftaincy she shuddered again and wondered was the west african instinct getting the upper hand in him over the christian gentleman  when the dries were over and the kokoharvest gathered the negroes held a grand feast john had preached in the open air to some of the market people in the morning and in the evening he was sitting in the hut with ethel waiting till the catechist and his wife should come in to prayers for they carried out their accustomed ceremony decorously even there every night and morning suddenly they heard the din of savage music out of doors and the noise of a great crowd laughing and shouting down the street john listened and listened with deepening attention dont you hear it ethie he cried its the tomtoms i know what it means its the harvest battlefeast  how hideous said ethel shrinking back  dont be afraid dearest john said smiling at her it means no harm its only the people amusing themselves and he began to keep time to the tomtoms rapidly with the palms of his hands  the din drew nearer and john grew more evidently excited at every step dont you hear ethie he said again its the salonga what inspiriting music its like a drum and fife band its like the bagpipes its like a military march by jove it compels one to dance and he got up as he spoke in english clerical dress for he wore clerical dress even at butabué and began capering in a sort of hornpipe round the tiny room  oh john dont cried ethel suppose the catechist were to come in  but johns blood was up look here he said excitedly it goes like this here you hold your matchlock out here you fire here you charge with cutlasses here you hack them down before you here you hold up your enemys head in your hands and here you kick it off among the women oh its grand there was a terrible light in his black eyes as he spoke and a terrible trembling in his clenched black hands  john cried ethel in an agony of horror it isnt christian it isnt human it isnt worthy of you i can never never love you if you do such a thing again  in a moment johns face changed and his hand fell as if she had stabbed him ethie he said in a low voice creeping back to her like a whipped spaniel ethie my darling my own soul my beloved what have i done oh heavens i will never listen to the accursed thing again oh ethie for heavens sake for mercys sake forgive me  ethel laid her hand trembling on his head john sank upon his knees before her and bowed himself down with his head between his arms like one staggered and penitent ethel lifted him gently and at that moment the catechist and his wife came in john stood up firmly took down his bible and prayerbook and read through evening prayer at once in his usual impressive tone in one moment he had changed back again from the fantee savage to the decorous oxford clergyman  it was only a week later that ethel hunting about in the little storeroom happened to notice a stout wooden box carefully covered up she opened the lid with some difficulty for it was fastened down with a native lock and to her horror she found inside it a surreptitious keg of raw negro rum she took the keg out put it conspicuously in the midst of the storeroom and said nothing that night she heard john in the jungle behind the yard and looking out she saw dimly that he was hacking the keg to pieces vehemently with an axe after that he was even kinder and tenderer to her than usual for the next week but ethel vaguely remembered that once or twice before he had seemed a little odd in his manner and that it was on those days that she had seen gleams of the savage nature peeping through perhaps she thought with a shiver his civilization was only a veneer and a glass of raw rum or so was enough to wash it off  twelve months after their first arrival ethel came home very feverish one evening from her girls school and found john gone from the hut searching about in the room for the quinine bottle she came once more upon a rumkeg and this time it was empty a nameless terror drove her into the little bedroom there on the bed torn into a hundred shreds lay john creedys black coat and european clothing the room whirled around her and though she had never heard of such a thing before the terrible truth flashed across her bewildered mind like a hideous dream she went out alone at night as she had never done before since she came to africa into the broad lane between the huts which constituted the chief street of butabué so far away from home so utterly solitary among all those black faces so sick at heart with that burning and devouring horror she reeled and staggered down the street not knowing how or where she went till at the end beneath the two tall datepalms she saw lights flashing and heard the noise of shouts and laughter a group of natives men and women together were dancing and howling round a dancing and howling negro the central figure was dressed in the native fashion with arms and legs bare and he was shouting a loud song at the top of his voice in the fantee language while he shook a tomtom there was a huskiness as of drink in his throat and his steps were unsteady and doubtful great heavens could that reeling shrieking black savage be john creedy  yes instinct had gained the day over civilization the savage in john creedy had broken out he had torn up his english clothes and in west african parlance had gone fantee ethel gazed at him white with horrorstood still and gazed and never cried nor fainted nor said a word the crowd of negroes divided to right and left and john creedy saw his wife standing there like a marble figure with one awful cry he came to himself again and rushed to her side she did not repel him as he expected she did not speak she was mute and cold like a corpse not like a living woman he took her up in his strong arms laid her head on his shoulder and carried her home through the long line of thatched huts erect and steady as when he first walked up the aisle of walton magna church then he laid her down gently on the bed and called the wife of the catechist she has the fever he said in fantee sit by her  the catechists wife looked at her and said yes the yellow fever  and so she had even before she saw john the fever had been upon her and that awful revelation had brought it out suddenly in full force she lay unconscious upon the bed her eyes open staring ghastlily but not a trace of colour in her cheek nor a sign of life upon her face  john creedy wrote a few words on a piece of paper which he folded in his hand gave a few directions in fantee to the woman at the bedside and then hurried out like one on fire into the darkness outside   iii  it was thirty miles through the jungle by a native trackway to the nearest mission station at effuenta there were two methodist missionaries stationed there john creedy knew for he had gone round by boat more than once to see them when he first came to africa he could no more have found his way across the neck of the river fork by that tangled jungle track than he could have flown bodily over the top of the cocoa palms but now half naked barefooted and inspired with an overpowering emotion he threaded his path through the darkness among the creepers and lianas of the forest in true african fashion stooping here creeping on all fours there running in the open at full speed anon he never once stopped to draw breath till he had covered the whole thirty miles and knocked in the early dawn at the door of the mission hut at effuenta  one of the missionaries opened the barred door cautiously what do you want he asked in fantee of the barelegged savage who stood crouching by the threshold  i bring a message from missionary john creedy the barelegged savage answered also in fantee he wants european clothes  has he sent a letter asked the missionary  john creedy took the folded piece of paper from his palm the missionary read it it told him in a few words how the butabué people had pillaged johns hut at night and stolen his clothing and how he could not go outside his door till he got some european dress again  this is strange said the missionary brother felton died three days ago of the fever you can take his clothes to brother creedy if you will  the barelimbed savage nodded acquiescence the missionary looked hard at him and fancied he had seen his face before but he never even for a moment suspected that he was speaking to john creedy himself  a bundle was soon made of dead brother feltons clothes and the barelimbed man took it in his arms and prepared to run back again the whole way to butabué  you have had nothing to eat said the lonely missionary wont you take something to help you on your way  give me some plantain paste answered john creedy i can eat it as i go and when they gave it him he forgot himself for the moment and answered thank you in english the missionary stared but thought it was only a single phrase that he had picked up at butabué and that he was anxious negrofashion to air his knowledge  back through the jungle with the bundle in his arms john creedy wormed his way once more like a snake or a tiger never pausing or halting on the road till he found himself again in the open space outside the village of butabué there he stayed awhile and behind a clump of wild ginger he opened the bundle and arrayed himself once more from head to foot in english clerical dress that done too proud to slink he walked bold and erect down the main alley and quietly entered his own hut it was high noon the baking high noon of africa as he did so  ethel lay unconscious still upon the bed the negro woman crouched half asleep after her nights watching at the foot john creedy looked at his watch which stood hard by on the little wooden table sixty miles in fourteen hours he said aloud better time by a great deal than when we walked from oxford to the white horse eighteen months since and then he sat down silently by ethels bedside  has she moved her eyes he asked the negress  never john creedy answered the woman till last night she had always called him master  he watched the lifeless face for an hour or two there was no change in it till about four oclock then ethels eyes began to alter their expression he saw the dilated pupils contract a little and know that consciousness was gradually returning  in a moment more she looked round at him and gave a little cry john she exclaimed with a sort of awakening hopefulness in her voice where on earth did you get those clothes  these clothes he answered softly why you must be wandering in your mind ethie dearest to ask such a question now at standens in the high at oxford my darling and he passed his black hand gently across her loose hair  ethel gave a great cry of joy then it was a dream a horrid dream john or a terrible mistake oh john say it was a dream  john drew his hand across his forehead slowly ethie darling he said you are wandering im afraid you have a bad fever i dont know what you mean  then you didnt tear them up and wear a fantee dress and dance with a tomtom down the street oh john  oh ethel no what a terrible delirium you must have had  it is all well she said i dont mind if i die now and she sank back exhausted into a sort of feverish sleep  john creedy said the black catechists wife solemnly in fantee you will have to answer for that lie to a dying woman with your soul  my soul cried john creedy passionately smiting both breasts with his clenched fists my soul do you think you negro wench i wouldnt give my poor miserable black soul to eternal torments a thousand times over if only i could give her little white heart one moments forgetfulness before she dies  for five days longer ethel lingered in the burning fever sometimes conscious for a minute or two but for the most part delirious or drowsy all the time she never said another word to john about her terrible dream and john never said another word to her but he sat by her side and tended her like a woman doing everything that was possible for her in the bare little hut and devouring his full heart with a horrible gnawing remorse too deep for pen or tongue to probe and fathom for civilization with john creedy was really at bottom far more than a mere veneer though the savage instincts might break out with him now and again such outbursts no more affected his adult and acquired nature than a single bump supper or wine party at college affects the nature of many a gentleminded english lad the truest john creedy of all was the gentle tender english clergyman  as he sat by her bedside sleepless and agonized night and day for five days together one prayer only rose to his lips time after time heaven grant she may die he had depth enough in the civilized side of his soul to feel that that was the only way to save her from a lifelong shame if she gets well he said to himself trembling i will leave this accursed africa at once i will work my way back to england as a common sailor and send her home by the mail with my remaining money i will never inflict my presence upon her again for she cannot be persuaded if once she recovers that she did not see me as she did see me a barelimbed heathen fantee brandishing a devilish tomtom but i shall get work in englandnot a parsons that i can never be againbut clerks work labourers work navvys work anything look at my arms i rowed five in the magdalen eight i could hold a spade as well as any man i will toil and slave and save and keep her still like a lady if i starve for it myself but she shall never see my face again if once she recovers even then it will be a living death for her poor angel there is only one hopeheaven grant she may die  on the fifth day she opened her eyes once john saw that his prayer was about to be fulfilled john she said feeblyjohn tell me on your honour it was only my delirium  and john raising his hand to heaven splendide mendax answered in a firm voice i swear it  ethel smiled and shut her eyes it was for the last time  next morning john creedytearless but parched and dry in the mouth like one stunned and unmannedtook a pickaxe and hewed out a rude grave in the loose soil near the river then he fashioned a rough coffin from twisted canes with his own hands and in it he reverently placed the sacred body he allowed no one to help him or come near himnot even his fellowchristians the catechist and his wife ethel was too holy a thing for their african hands to touch next he put on his white surplice and for the first and only time in his life he read without a quaver in his voice the church of england burial service over the open grave and when he had finished he went back to his desolate hut and cried with a loud voice of utter despair the one thing that bound me to civilization is gone henceforth i shall never speak another word of english i go to my own people so saying he solemnly tore up his european clothes once more bound a cotton loincloth round his waist covered his head with dirt and sat fasting and wailing piteously like a brokenhearted child in his cabin                                       nowadays the old halfcaste portuguese rumdealer at butabué can point out to any english pioneer who comes up the river which one among a crowd of dilapidated negroes who lie basking in the soft dust outside his hut was once the reverend john creedy ba of magdalen college oxford     dr greatrexs engagement   everybody knows by name at least the celebrated dr greatrex the discoverer of that abstruse molecular theory of the interrelations of forces and energies he is a comparatively young man still as times go for a person of such scientific distinction for he is now barely forty but to look at his tall spare earnest figure and his clearcut delicate intellectual face you would scarcely imagine that he had once been the hero of a singularly strange and romantic story yet there have been few lives more romantic than arthur greatrexs and few histories stranger in their way than this of his engagement after all why should not a scientific light have a romance of his own as well as other people  fifteen years ago arthur greatrex then a young cambridge fellow had just come up to begin his medical studies at a london hospital he was tall in those days of course but not nearly so slender or so pale as now for he had rowed seven in his college boat and was a fine athletic young man of the true english university pattern handsome too then and always but with a more humanlooking and ordinary handsomeness when he was young than in these latter times of his scientific eminence indeed any one who met arthur greatrex at that time would merely have noticed him as a fine intelligent young english gentleman with a marked taste for manly sports and a decided opinion of his own about most passing matters of public interest  already even in those days the young medical student was very deeply engaged in recondite speculations on the question of energy his active mind always dwelling upon wide points of cosmical significance had hit upon the germ of that great revolutionary idea which was afterwards to change the whole course of modern physics but as often happens with young men of twentyfive there was another subject which divided his attention with the grand theory of his life and that subject was the pretty daughter of his friend and instructor dr abury the eminent authority on the treatment of the insane in all london you couldnt have found a sweeter or prettier girl than hetty abury young greatrex thought her clever too and though that is perhaps saying rather too much she was certainly a good deal above the average of ordinary london girls in intellect and accomplishments  they say arthur she said to him on the day after their formal engagement that the course of true love never did run smooth and yet it seems somehow as if ours was wonderfully smoothed over for us by everybody and everything i am the happiest and proudest girl in all the world to have won the love of such a man as you for my future husband  arthur greatrex stroked the back of her white little hand with his and answered gently i hope nothing will ever arise to make the course of our love run any the rougher for certainly we do seem to have every happiness laid out most temptingly before us it almost feels to me as if my paradise had been too easily won and i ought to have something harder to do before i enter it  dont say that arthur hetty put in hastily it sounds too much like an evil omen  you superstitious little woman the young doctor replied with a smile talking to a scientific man about signs and portents and he kissed her wee hand tenderly and went home to his bachelor lodging with that strange exhilaration in heart and step which only the ecstasy of first love can ever bring one  no he thought to himself as he sat down in his own easychair and lighted his cigar i dont believe any cloud can ever arise between me and hetty we have everything in our favourmeans to live upon love for one another a mutual respect kind relations and hearts that were meant by nature each for the other hetty is certainly the very sweetest little girl that ever lived and shes as good as shes sweet and as loving as shes beautiful what a dreadful thing it is for a man in love to have to read up medicine for his next examination and he took a medical book down from the shelf with a sigh and pretended to be deeply interested in the diagnosis of scarlet fever till his cigar was finished but if the truth must be told the words really swam before him and all the letters on the page apparently conspired together to make up but a single name a thousand times overhetty hetty hetty hetty at last he laid the volume down as hopeless and turned dreamily into his bedroom only to lie awake half the night and think perpetually on that one theme of hetty  next day was dr aburys weekly lecture on diseases of the brain and nervous system and arthur greatrex convinced that he really must make an effort went to hear it the subject was one that always interested him and partly by dint of mental attention partly out of sheer desire to master the matter he managed to hear it through and even take in the greater part of its import as he left the room to go down the hospital stairs he had his mind fairly distracted between the premonitory symptoms of insanity and hetty abury was there ever such an unfortunate profession as medicine for a man in love he asked himself half angrily why didnt i go and be a parson or a barrister or anything else that would have kept me from mixing up such incongruous associations and yet when one comes to think of it too theres no particular natural connection after all between chitty on contract and dearest hetty  musing thus he turned to walk down the great central staircase of the hospital as he did so his attention was attracted for a moment by a singular person who was descending the opposite stair towards the same landing this person was tall and not illlooking but as he came down the steps he kept pursing up his mouth and cheeks into the most extraordinary and hideous grimaces in fact he was obviously making insulting faces at arthur greatrex arthur was so much preoccupied at the moment however that he hardly had time to notice the eccentric stranger and as he took him for one of the harmless lunatic patients in the mentaldiseases ward he would have passed on without further observing the man but for an odd circumstance which occurred as they both reached the great central landing together arthur happened to drop the book he was carrying from under his arm and instinctively stooped to pick it up at the same moment the grimacing stranger dropped his own book also not in imitation but by obvious coincidence and stooped to pick it up with the selfsame gesture struck by the oddity of the situation arthur turned to look at the curious patient to his utter horror and surprise he discovered that the man he had been observing was his own reflection  in one second the real state of the case flashed like lightning across his bewildered brain there was no opposite staircase as he knew very well for he had been down those steps a hundred times before nothing but a big mirror which reflected and doubled the onesided flight from top to bottom it was only his momentary preoccupation which had made him for a minute fall into the obvious delusion the man whom he saw descending towards him was really himself arthur greatrex  even so he did not at once grasp the full strangeness of the scene he had just witnessed it was only as he turned to descend again that he caught another glimpse of himself in the big mirror and saw that he was still making the most horrible and ghastliest grimacesgrimaces such as he had never seen equalled save by the monkeys at the zoo and horridest thought of all by the worst patients in the mentaldisease ward he pulled himself up in speechless horror and looked once more into the big mirror yes there was positively no mistaking the fact it was he arthur greatrex fellow of catherines who was making these hideous and meaningless distortions of his own countenance  with a terrible effort of will he pulled his face quite straight again and assumed his usual grave and quiet demeanour for a full minute he stood looking at himself in the glass and then fearful that some one else would come and surprise him he hurried down the remaining steps and rushed out into the streets of london which way he turned he did not know or care all he knew was that he was repressing by sheer force of muscular strain a deadly impulse to pucker up his mouth and draw down the corners of his lips into onesided grimaces as he passed down the streets he watched his own image faintly reflected in the panes of the windows and saw that he was maintaining outward decorum but only with a conscious and evident struggle at one doorstep a little child was playing with a kitten arthur greatrex who was a naturally kindly man looked down at her and smiled in spite of his preoccupation instead of smiling back the child uttered a scream of terror and rushed back into the house to hide her face in her mothers apron he felt instinctively that in place of smiling he had looked at the child with one of his awful faces it was horrible unendurable and he walked on through the streets and across the bridges pulling himself together all the time till at last halfunconsciously he found himself near pimlico where the aburys were then living  looking around him he saw that he had come nearly to the corner where hettys little drawingroom faced the road the accustomed place seemed to draw him off for a moment from thinking of himself and he remembered that he had promised hetty to come in for luncheon but dare he go in such a state of mind and body as he then found himself in well hetty would be expecting him hetty would be disappointed if he didnt come he certainly mustnt break his engagement with dear little hetty after all he began to say to himself what was it but a mere twitching of his face probably a slight nervous affection young doctors are always nervous about themselves they say they find all their own symptoms accurately described in all the textbooks his face wasnt twitching now of that he was certain the nearer he got to hettys the calmer he grew and the more he was conscious he could relax his attention without finding his muscles were playing tricks upon him he would turn in and have luncheon and soon forgot all about it  hetty saw him coming and ran lightly to open the door for him and as he took his seat beside her at the table he forgot straightway his whole trouble and found himself at once in paradise once more all through lunch they talked about other thingshappy plans for the future and the small prettinesses that lovers find so perennially delightful and long before arthur went away the twitching in his face had altogether ceased to trouble him once or twice indeed in the course of the afternoon he happened to glance casually at the lookingglass above the drawingroom fireplace those were the premorrisian days when overmantels as yet were not and he saw to his great comfort that his face was resting in its usual handsome repose and peacefulness a bright earnest strong face it was with all the promise of greatness already in it and so hetty thought as she looked up at it from the low footstool where she sat by his side and half whispered into his ear the little timid confidences of early betrothal  five oclock tea came all too soon and then arthur felt he must really be going and must get home to do a little reading on his way he fancied once he saw a street boy start in evident surprise as he approached him but it might be fancy and when the street boy stuck his tongue into the corner of his cheek and uttered derisive shouts from a safe distance arthur concluded he was only doing after the manner of his kind out of pure gratuitous insolence he went home to his lodgings and sat down to an hours work but after he had read up several pages more of stuckey on gout he laid down the book in disgust and took out helmholtz and joule instead indulging himself with a little desultory reading in his favourite study of the higher physics  as he read and read the theory of correlation the great idea as to the real nature of energy which had escaped all these learned physicists and which was then slowly forming itself in his own mind grew gradually clearer and clearer still before his mental vision helmholtz was wrong here because he had not thoroughly appreciated the disjunctive nature of electric energy joule was wrong here because he had failed to understand the real antithesis between potential and kinetic he laid down the books paced up and down the room thoughtfully and beheld the whole concrete theory of interrelation embodying itself visibly before his very eyes at last he grew fired with the stupendous grandeur of his own conception seized a quire of foolscap and sat down eagerly at the table to give written form to the splendid phantom that was floating before him in so distinct a fashion he would make a great name for hettys sake and when he had made it his dearest reward would be to know that hetty was proud of him  hour after hour he sat and wrote as if inspired at his little table the landlady knocked at the door to tell him dinner was ready but he would have none of it he said let her bring him up a good cup of strong tea and a few plain biscuits so he wrote and wrote in feverish haste drinking cup after cup of tea and turning off page after page of foolscap till long past midnight the whole theory had come up so distinctly before his minds eye under the exceptional exaltation of first love and the powerful stimulus of the days excitement that he wrote it off as though he had it by heart omitting only the mathematical calculations which he left blank not because he had not got them clearly in his head but because he would not stop his flying pen to copy them all out then and there at full length for fear of losing the main thread of his argument when he had finished about forty sheets of foolscap lay huddled together on the table before him written in a hasty hand and scarcely legible but they contained the first rough draft and central principle of that immortal work the transcendental dynamics  arthur greatrex rose from the table where his grand discovery was first formulated well satisfied with himself and his theory and fully determined to submit it shortly to the critical judgment of the royal society as he took up his bedroom candle however he went over to the mantelpiece to kiss hettys photograph as he always did for even men of science are human every evening before retiring he lifted the portrait reverently to his lips and was just about to kiss it when suddenly in the mirror before him he saw the same horrible mocking face which had greeted him so unexpectedly that morning on the hospital staircase it was a face of inhuman devilry the face of a mediæval demon a hideous grinning distorted ghoul a very caricature and insult upon the features of humanity in his dismay he dropped the frame and the photograph shivering the glass that covered it into a thousand atoms summoning up all his resolution he looked again yes there was no mistaking it a face was gibing and jeering at him from the mirror with diabolical ingenuity of distorted hideousness a disgusting face which even the direct evidence of his senses would scarcely permit him to believe was really the reflection of his own features it was overpowering it was awful it was wholly incredible and utterly unmanned by the sight he sank back into his easychair and buried his face bitterly between the shelter of his trembling hands  at that moment arthur greatrex felt sure he knew the real meaning of the horror that surrounded him he was going mad  for ten minutes or more he sat there motionless hot tears boiling up from his eyes and falling silently between his fingers then at last he rose nervously from his seat and reached down a volume from the shelf behind him it was prangs treatise on the physiology of the brain he turned it over hurriedly for a few pages till he came to the passage he was looking for  ah i thought so he said to himself half aloud premonitory symptoms facial distortions infirmity of the will inability to distinguish muscular movements lets see what prang has to say about it a not uncommon concomitant of these early stagesgreat heavens how calmly the man talks about losing your reasonis an unconscious or semiconscious tendency to produce a series of extraordinary facial distortions at times the sufferer is not aware of the movements thus initiated at other times they are quite voluntary and are accompanied by bodily gestures of contempt or derision for passing strangers why thats what must have happened with that boy this morning symptoms of this character usually result from excessive activity of the brain and are most frequent among mathematicians or scholars who have overworked their intellectual faculties they may be regarded as the immediate precursors of acute dementia acute dementia oh hetty oh heavens what have i done to deserve such a blow as this  he laid his face between his hands once more and sobbed like a brokenhearted child for a few minutes then he turned accidentally towards his tumbled manuscript no no he said to himself reassuringly i cant be going mad my brain was never clearer in my life i couldnt have done a piece of good work like that bristling with equations and figures and formulas if my head was really giving way i seemed to grasp the subject as i never grasped it in my life before i never worked so well at cambridge this is a discovery a genuine discovery its impossible that a man who was going mad could ever see anything so visibly and distinctly as i see that universal principle lets look again at what prang has to say upon that subject  he turned over the volume a few pages further and glanced lightly at the contents at the head of each chapter till at last a few words in the title struck his eye and he hurried on to the paragraph they indicated with feverish eagerness as he did so these were the words which met his bewildered gaze  in certain cases especially among men of unusual intelligence and high attainments the exaltation of incipient madness takes rather the guise of a scientific or philosophic enthusiasm instead of imagining himself the possessor of untold wealth or the absolute despot of a servile people the patient deludes himself with the belief that he has made a great discovery or lighted upon a splendid generalization of the deepest and most universal importance he sees new truths crowding upon him with the most startling and vivid objectivity he perceives intimate relations of things which he never before suspected he destroys at one blow the newtonian theory of gravitation he discovers obvious flaws in the nebular hypothesis of laplace he gives a scholarsmate to kant in the very fundamental points of the critique of pure reason the more serious the attack the more utterly convinced is the patient of the exceptional clearness of his own intelligence at that particular moment he writes pamphlets whose scientific value he ridiculously overestimates and he is sure to be very angry with any one who tries rationally to combat his newly found authority mathematical reasoners are specially liable to this form of incipient mental disease which when combined with the facial distortions already alluded to in a previous section is peculiarly apt to terminate in acute dementia  acute dementia again arthur greatrex cried with a gesture of horror flinging the book from him as if it were a poisonous serpent acute dementia acute dementia acute dementia nothing but acute dementia ahead of me whichever way i happen to turn oh this is too horrible i shall never be able to marry hetty and yet i shall never be able to break it to hetty great heavens that such a phantom as this should have risen between me and paradise only since this very morning  in his agony he caught up the papers on which he had written the rough draft of his grand discovery and crumpled them up fiercely in his fingers the cursed things he groaned between his teeth tossing them with a gesture of impatient disgust into the wastepaper basket how could i ever have deluded myself into thinking i had hit offhand upon a grand truth which had escaped such men as helmholtz and mayer and joule and thomson the things preposterous upon the very face of it i must be going mad indeed ever to have dreamt of it  he took up his candle once more kissed the portrait in the broken frame with intense fervour a dozen times over and then went up gloomily into his own bedroom there he did not attempt to undress but merely pulled off his boots lay down in his clothes upon the bed and hastily blew out the candle for a long time he lay tossing and turning in unspeakable terror but at last after perhaps two hours or so he fell into a troubled sleep and dreamed a hideous nightmare in which somebody or other in shadowy outlines was trying perpetually to tear him away by main force from poor pale and weeping hetty  it was daylight when arthur woke again and he lay for some time upon his bed thinking over his last nights scare which seemed much less serious as such things always do now that the sun had risen upon it after a while his mind got round to the energy question and as he thought it over once more the conviction forced itself afresh upon him that he was right upon the matter after all and that if he was going mad there was at least method in his madness so firmly was he convinced upon this point now though he recognized that that very certainty might be merely a symptom of his coming malady that he got up hurriedly before the lodginghouse servant came to clean up his little sittingroom so as to rescue his crumpled foolscap from the wastepaper basket after that a bath and breakfast almost made him laugh at his evening terrors  all the morning arthur greatrex sat down at his table again working in the algebraical calculations which he had omitted from his paper overnight and finishing it in full form as if for presentation to a learned society but he did not mean now to offer it to any society he had a far deeper and more personal interest in the matter at present than that he wanted to settle first of all the question whether he was going mad or not afterwards there would be plenty of time to settle such minor theoretical problems as the general physical constitution of the universe  as soon as he had finished his calculations he took the paper in his hands and went out with it to make two calls on scientific acquaintances the first man he called upon was that distinguished specialist professor linklight one of the greatest authorities of his own day on all questions of molecular physics poor man he is almost forgotten now for he died ten years ago and his scientific reputation was after all of that flashy sort which bases itself chiefly upon giving good dinners to leading fellows of the royal society but fifteen years ago professor linklight with his cutanddried dogmatic notions and his narrow technical accuracy was universally considered the principal physical philosopher in all england to him then arthur greatrexa far deeper and clearer thinkertook in all humility the first manuscript of his marvellous discovery not to ask him whether it was true or not but to find out whether it was physical science at all or pure insanity the professor received him kindly and when arthur who had of course his own reasons for attempting a little modest concealment asked him to look over a friends paper for him with a view to its presentation to the royal society he cheerfully promised to do his best though you will admit my dear mr greatrex he said with his blandest smile that your friends manuscript certainly does not err on the side of excessive brevity from linklights arthur walked on tremulously to the house of another great scientific magnate dr warminster of being the first living authority on the treatment of the insane in the united kingdom before dr warminster arthur made no attempt to conceal his apprehensions he told out all his symptoms and fears without reserve even exaggerating them a little as a man is prone to do through overanxiety not to put too favourable a face upon his own ailments dr warminster listened attentively and with a gathering interest to all that arthur told him and at the end of his account he shook his head gloomily and answered in a very grave and sympathetic tone  my dear greatrex he said gently holding his arm with a kindly pressure i should be dealing wrongly with you if i did not candidly tell you that your case gives ground for very serious apprehensions you are a young man and with steady attention to curative means and surroundings it is possible that you may ward off this threatened danger society amusement relaxation complete cessation of scientific work absence as far as possible of mental anxiety in any form may enable you to tide over the turning point but that there is danger threatened it would be unkind and untrue not to warn you it is very unusual for a patient to consult us in person about these matters more often it is the friends who notice the coming change but as you ask me directly for an opinion i cant help telling you that i regard your case as not without real cause for the strictest care and for a preventive regimen  arthur thanked him for the numerous directions he gave as to things which should be done or things which should be avoided and hurried out into the street with his brain swimming and reeling absence of mental anxiety he said to himself bitterly how calmly they talk about mental anxiety how can i possibly be free from anxiety when i know i may go mad at any moment and that the blow would kill hetty outright for myself i should not care a farthing but for hetty it is too terrible  he had not the heart to call at the aburys that afternoon though he had promised to do so and he tortured himself with the thought that hetty would think him neglectful he could not call again while the present suspense lasted and if his worst fears were confirmed he could never call again except once to take leave of hetty for ever for deeply as arthur greatrex loved her he loved her too well ever to dream of marrying her if the possible shadow of madness was to cloud her future life with its perpetual presence better she should bear the shock even if it killed her at once than that both should live in ceaseless apprehension of that horrible possibility and should become the parents of children upon whom that hereditary curse might rest for a lifetime reflecting itself back with the added sting of conscientious remorse on the father who had brought them into the world against his own clear judgment of right and justice  next morning arthur went round once more to professor linklights the professor had promised to read through the paper immediately and give his opinion of its chances for presentation to the royal society he was sitting at his breakfasttable in his flowered dressinggown and slippers when arthur called upon him and with a cup of coffee in one hand was actually skimming the last few pages through his critical eyeglass as his visitor entered  goodmorning mr greatrex he said with one of his most gracious smiles indicative of the warm welcome attended by acknowledged wisdom towards rising talent you see i have been reading your friends paper as i promised well my dear sir not to put too fine a point upon it it wont hold water in fact its a mere rigmarole excuse my asking you greatrex but have you any idea my dear fellow whether your friend is inclined to be a little cracky  arthur swallowed a groan with the greatest difficulty and answered in as unconcerned a tone as possible well to tell you the truth mr linklight some doubts have been cast upon his perfect sanity  ah i should have thought so the professor went on in his airiest manner i should have thought so the fact is this paper is fitter for the transactions of the colney hatch academy than for those of the royal society it has a delusive outer appearance of physical thinking but theres no real meaning in it of any sort its gassy unsubstantial purely imaginative and the professor waved his hand in the air to indicate its utter gaseousness if you were to ask my own opinion about it i should say its the sort of thing that might be produced by a young man of some mathematical training with a very superficial knowledge of modern physics just as he was on the point of lapsing into complete insanity its the maddest bit of writing that has ever yet fallen under my critical notice  your opinion is of course conclusive arthur answered with unfeigned humility his eyes almost bursting with the tears he would not let come to the surface it will be a great disappointment to my friend but i have no doubt he will accept your verdict  not a bit of it my dear sir the professor put in quickly not a bit of it these crazy fellows always stick to their own opinions and think you a perfect fool for disagreeing with them mark my words mr greatrex your friend will still go on believing in spite of everything that his roundabout reasoning upon that preposterous squarerootofpi theorem is sound mathematics  and arthur looking within felt with a glow of horror that the theorem in question seemed to him at that moment more obviously true and certain in all its deductions than it had ever done before since the first day that he conceived it how very mad he must be after all  he thanked professor linklight as well as he was able for his kindness in looking over the paper and groped his way blindly through the passage to the front door and out into the square thence he staggered home wearily convinced that it was all over between him and hetty and that he must make up his mind forthwith to his horrible destiny  if he had only known at that moment that forty years earlier professor linklight had used almost the same words about youngs theory of undulations and had since used them about every new discovery from that day to the one on which he then saw him he might have attached less importance than he actually did to this supposed final proof of his own insanity  as arthur entered his lodgings he hung his hat up on the stand in the passage there was a little strip of mirror in the middle of the stand and glancing at it casually he saw once more that awful facehis owndistorted and almost diabolical which he had learnt so soon to hate instinctively as if it were a felons and a murderers he rushed away wildly into his little sittingroom and flung his manuscript on the table almost without observing that his friend freeling the rising physiologist was quietly seated on the sofa opposite  whats this arthur freeling asked taking it up carelessly and glancing at the title you dont mean to say that youve finally written out that splendid idea of yours about the interrelations of energy  yes i have harry i have and i wish to heaven i hadnt for its all mad and silly and foolish and meaningless  if it is then im mad too my dear fellow for i think its the most convincing thing in physics i ever listened to let me have the manuscript to look over and see how youve worked out those beautiful calculations about the square root of pi will you  take the thing for heavens sake and leave me harry for if im not left alone i shall break down and cry before you and as he spoke he buried his head in his arm and sobbed like a woman  dr freeling knew arthur was in love and was aware that people sometimes act very unaccountably under such circumstances so he did the wisest thing to be done then and there he grasped his friends arm gently with his hand spoke never a word and taking up his hat and the manuscript walked quietly out into the passage then he told the landlady to make mr greatrex a strong cup of tea with a dash of brandy in it and turned away leaving arthur to solitude and his own reflections  that evenings post brought arthur greatrex two letters which finally completed his utter prostration the first he opened was from dr abury he broke the envelope with a terrible misgiving and read the letter through with a deepening and sickening feeling of horror it was not he alone then who had distorted the secret of his own incipient insanity dr aburys practised eye had also detected the rising symptoms the doctor wrote kindly and with evident grief but there was no mistaking the firm purport of his intentions conferring this morning with his professional friend warminster a case had been mentioned to him without a name which he at once recognized as arthurs he recalled certain symptoms he had himself observed and his suspicions were thus vividly aroused happening accidentally to follow arthur in the street he was convinced that his surmise was correct and he thought it his duty both to inform arthur of the danger that encompassed him and to assure him that deeply as it grieved him to withdraw the consent he had so gladly given he could not allow his only daughter to marry a man bearing on his face the evident marks of an insane tendency the letter contained much more of regret and condolence but that was the pith that arthur greatrex picked out of it all through the blinding tears that dimmed his vision  the second letter was from hetty half guessing its contents he had left it purposely till the last and he tore it open now with a fearful sinking feeling in his bosom it was indeed a heartbroken heartbreaking letter what could be the secret which papa would not tell her why had not arthur come yesterday why could she never marry him why was papa so cruel as not to tell her the reason he couldnt have done anything in the slightest degree dishonourable far less anything wicked of that she felt sure but if not what could be this horrible mysterious unknown barrier that was so suddenly raised between them do write dearest arthur and relieve me from this terrible incomprehensible suspense do let me know what has happened to make papa so determined against you i could bear to lose youat least i could bear it as other women have donebut i cant bear this awful uncertainty this awful doubt as to your love or your constancy for heavens sake darling send me a note somehow send me a line to tell me you love me your heartbroken    hetty  arthur took his hat and unable to endure this agony set out at once for the aburys when he reached the door the servant who answered his ring at the bell told him he could not see the doctor he was engaged with two other doctors in a consultation about miss hetty what was the matter with miss hetty then what didnt he know that oh miss hetty had had a fit and dr freeling and dr mackinlay had been called in to see her arthur did not wait for a moment but walked upstairs unannounced and into the consulting room  was it a very serious matter yes freeling answered very serious it seemed miss abury had had a great shocka great shock to her affectionswhich he added in a lower voice you yourself can perhaps best explain to me she will certainly have a long illness perhaps she may never recover  come out into the conservatory harry said arthur to his friend i can tell you there what it is all about  in a few words arthur told him the nature of the shock but without describing the particular symptoms on which the opinion of his supposed approaching insanity was based freeling listened with an incredulous smile and at the end he said to his friend gently my dear arthur i wish you had told me all this before if you had done so we might have saved miss abury a shock which may perhaps be fatal you are no more going mad than i am on the contrary youre about the sanest and most clearheaded fellow of my acquaintance but these maddoctors are always finding madness everywhere if you had come to me and told me the symptoms that troubled you i should soon have set you right again in your own opinion to have gone to warminster was most unfortunate but it cant be helped now what we have to do at present is to take care of miss abury  arthur shook his head sadly ah he said you dont know the real gravity of the symptoms i am suffering from i shall tell you all about them some other time however as you say what we have to think about now is hetty can you let me see her i am sure if i could see her it would reassure her and do her good  dr abury was at first very unwilling to let arthur visit hetty who was now lying unconscious on the sofa in her own boudoir but freelings opinion that it might possibly do her good at last prevailed with him and he gave his permission grudgingly  arthur went into the room silently and took his seat beside the low couch where the motherless girl was lying her face was very white and her hands pale and bloodless he took one hand in his the pulse was hardly perceptible he laid it down upon her breast and leaned back to watch for any sign of returning life in her pallid cheek and closed eyelids  for hours and hours he sat there watching and no sign came dr abury sat at the bottom of the couch watching with him and as they watched arthur felt from time to time that his face was again twitching horribly however he had only thoughts for one thing now would hetty die or would she recover the servants brought them a little cake and wine they sat and drank in silence looking at one another but each absorbed in his own thoughts and speaking never a word for good or evil  at last hettys eyes opened arthur noticed the change first and took her hand in his gently her staring gaze fell upon him for a moment and she asked feebly arthur arthur do you still love me  love you hetty with all my heart and soul as i have always loved you  she smiled and said nothing dr abury gave her a little wine in a teaspoon and she drank it quietly then she shut her eyes again but this time she was sleeping  all night arthur watched still by the bedside where they put her a little later and dr abury and a nurse watched with him in the morning she woke slightly better and when she saw arthur still there she smiled again and said that if he was with her she was happy when freeling came to inquire after the patient he found her so much stronger and arthur so worn with fear and sleeplessness that he insisted upon carrying off his friend in his brougham to his own house and giving him a slight restorative he might come back at once he said but only after he had had a dose of mixture a glass of brandy and seltzer and at least a mouthful of something for breakfast  as freeling was drawing the cork of the seltzer arthurs eye happened to light on a monkey which was chained to a post in the little area plot outside the consultingroom arthur was accustomed to see monkeys there for freeling often had invalids from the zoo to observe side by side with human patients but this particular monkey fascinated him even in his present shattered state of nerves because there was a something in its face which seemed strangely and horribly familiar to him as he looked he recognized with a feeling of unspeakable aversion what it was of which the monkey reminded him it was making a series of hideous and apparently mocking grimacesthe very selfsame grimaces which he had seen on his own features in the mirror during the last day or two horrible idea he was descending to the level of the very monkeys  the more he watched the more absolutely identical the two sets of grimaces appeared to him to be could it be fancy or was it reality or might it be one more delusion showing that his brain was now giving way entirely he rubbed his eyes steadied his attention and looked again with the deepest interest no he could not be mistaken the monkey was acting in every respect precisely as he himself had acted  harry he said in a low and frightened tone look at this monkey is he mad tell me  my dear arthur replied his friend with just a shade of expostulation in his voice you have really got madness on the brain at present no he isnt mad at all hes as sane as you are and thats saying a good deal i can assure you  but harry you cant have seen what hes doing hes grimacing and contorting himself in the most extraordinary fashion  well monkeys often do grimace dont they harry freeling answered coolly take this brandy and youll soon feel better  but they dont grimace like this one arthur persisted  no not like this one certainly thats why ive got him here im going to operate upon him for it under chloroform and cure him immediately  arthur leaped from his seat like one demented operate upon him cure him he cried hastily what on earth do you mean harry  my dear boy dont be so excited said freeling this suspense and sleeplessness have been too much for you this is antivivisection carried ad absurdum you dont mean to say you object to operations upon a monkey for his own benefit do you if i dont cut a nerve tetanus will finally set in and hell die of it in great agony drink off your brandy and youll feel better after it  but harry whats the matter with the monkey for heavens sake tell me  harry freeling looked at his friend for the first time a little suspiciously could warminster be right after all and could arthur really be going mad it was so ridiculous of him to get into such a state of flurry about the ailments of a tame monkey and at such a moment too well he answered slowly the monkey has got facial distortions due to a slight local paralysis of the inhibitory nerves supplied to the buccal and pharyngeal muscles with a tendency to end in tetanus if i cut a small ganglion behind the ear and exhibit santonin the muscles will be relaxed and though they wont act so freely as before they wont jerk and grimace any longer  does it ever occur in human beings arthur asked eagerly  occur in human beings bless my soul yes ive seen dozens of cases why goodness gracious arthur its positively occurring in your own face at this very moment  i know it is arthur answered in an agony of suspense do you think this twitching of mine is due to a local paralysis of the inhibitories such as you speak of  excuse my laughing my dear fellow you really do look so absurdly comical no i dont think anything about it i know it is  then you believe warminster was wrong in taking it for a symptom of incipient insanity  it was freelings turn now to jump up in surprise you dont mean to tell me arthur that that was the sole ground on which that old fool warminster thought you were going crazy  he didnt see it himself answered arthur with a sigh of unspeakable relief i only described it to him and he drew his inference from what i told him but the real question is this harry do you feel quite sure that theres nothing more than that the matter with me  absolutely certain my dear fellow i can cure you in half an hour ive done it dozens of times before and know the thing as well as you know an ordinary case of scarlet fever  arthur sighed again and perhaps he said bitterly this terrible mistake may cost dear hetty her life  he drank off the brandy ate a few mouthfuls of food as best he might and hastened back to the aburys when he got there he learned from the servant that hetty was at least no worse and with that negative comfort he had for the moment to content himself  hettys illness was long and serious but before it was over freeling was able to convince dr abury of his own and his colleagues error and to prove by a simple piece of surgery that arthurs hideous grimaces were due to nothing worse than a purely physical impediment the operation was quite a successful one but though greatrexs face has never since been liable to these curious contortions the consequent relaxation of the muscles has given his features that peculiarly calm and almost impassive expression which everybody must have noticed upon them at the present day even in moments of the greatest animation the difficulty was how to break the cause of the temporary mistake to hetty and this they were unable to do until she was to a great extent convalescent when once the needful explanation was over and arthur was able once more to kiss her with perfect freedom from any tinge of suspicion on her part he felt that his paradise was at last attained  a few days before the deferred date fixed for their wedding freeling came into the doctors drawingroom where hetty and arthur were sitting together and threw a letter with a french official stamp on its face down upon the table there he said i find all the members of the académie des sciences at paris are madmen also  hetty smiled faintly and said with a little earnestness in her tone ah dr freeling that subject has been far too serious a one for both of us to make it pleasant jesting  oh but look here miss abury said freeling i have to apologise to arthur for a great liberty i have ventured to take and i think it best to begin by explaining to you wherein it consisted the fact is before you were ill arthur had just written a paper on the interrelations of energy which he showed to that pompous old nincompoop professor linklight well linklight being one of those men who can never see an inch beyond his own nose had the incomprehensible stupidity to tell him there was nothing in it thereupon your future husband who is a modest and selfdepreciating sort of fellow was minded to throw it incontinently into the wastepaper basket but a friend of his harry freeling who flatters himself that he can see an inch or two beyond his own nose read it over and recognized that it was a brilliant discovery so what does he go and dohere comes in the apologetic matterbut get this memoir quietly translated into french affix a motto to it put it in an envelope and send it in for the gold medal competition of the académie strange to say the members of the académie turned out to be every bit as mad as the author and his friend for i have just received this letter addressed to arthur at my house which i have taken the further liberty of opening and it informs me that the académie decrees its gold medal for physical discovery to m arthur greatrex of london which is a subject of congratulation for us three and a regular slap in the face for pompous old linklight  hetty seized freelings two hands in hers you have been our good genius dr freeling she said with brimming eyes i owe arthur to you and arthur owes me to you and now we both owe you this what can we ever do to thank you sufficiently  since those days hetty and arthur have long been married and dr greatrexs famous work in its enlarged form has been translated into all the civilized languages of the world as well as into german but to this moment happy as they both are you can read in their faces the lasting marks of that one terrible anxiety to many of their friends it seemed afterwards a mere laughing matter but to those two who went through it and especially to arthur greatrex it is a memory too painful to be looked back upon even now without a thrill of terrible recollection     mr chung   the first time i ever met poor chung was at one of mrs bouverie bartons thursday evening receptions in eaton place of course you know mrs bouverie barton the cleverest literary hostess at this moment living in london herself a wellknown novelist she collects around her all the people worth knowing at her delightful at homes and whenever you go there you are sure to meet somebody whose acquaintance is a treasure and an acquisition for your whole after life  well it so happened on one of those enjoyable thursday evenings that i was sitting on the circular ottoman in the little back room with miss amelia hogg the famous womansrights advocate now if there is a subject on earth which infinitely bores me that subject is womans rights and if there is a person on earth who can make it absolutely unendurable that person is miss amelia hogg so i let her speak on placidly in her own interminable manner about the fortunes of the billshe always talks as though her own pet bill were the only bill now existing on this sublunary planetand while i interposed an occasional indeed or quite so for forms sake i gave myself up in reality to digesting the conversation of two intelligent people who sat back to back with us on the other side of the round ottoman  yes said one of the speakers in a peculiarly soft silvery voice which contrasted oddly with miss hoggs querulous treble his loss is a very severe one to contemporary philosophy his book on the physiology of perception is one of the most masterly pieces of analytic work i have ever met with in the whole course of my psychological reading it was to me i confess who approached it fresh from the school of schelling and hegel a perfect revelation of à posteriori thinking i shall never cease to regret that he did not live long enough to complete the second volume  just at this point miss hogg had come to a pause in her explanation of the seventyfirst clause of the bill and i stole a look round the corner to see who my philosophic neighbour might happen to be an oxford don no doubt i said to myself or a young cambridge professor freshly crammed to the throat with all the learning of the moral science tripos  imagine my surprise when on glancing casually at the silveryvoiced speaker i discovered him to be a fullblown chinaman yes a yellowskinned almondeyed mongolianfeatured chinaman with a long pigtail hanging down his back and attired in the official amber silk robe and purple slippers of a mandarin of the third grade and the silver button my curiosity was so fully aroused by this strange discovery that i determined to learn something more about so curious a product of an alien civilization and therefore after a few minutes i managed to give miss amelia hogg the slip by drawing in young harry farquhar the artist at the hundredandtwentieth section and making my way quietly across the room to mrs bouverie barton  the name of that young chinaman our hostess said in answer to my question oh certainly he is mr chung of the chinese legation a most intelligent and welleducated young man with a great deal of taste for european literature introduce youof course this minute and she led the way back to where my oriental phenomenon was still sitting deep as ever in philosophical problems with professor woolstock a spectacled old gentleman of german aspect who was evidently pumping him thoroughly with a view to the materials for volume forty of his forthcoming great work on ethnical psychology  i sat by mr chung for the greater part of what was left of that evening from the very first he exercised a sort of indescribable fascination over me his english had hardly a trace of foreign accent and his voice was one of the sweetest and most exquisitely modulated that i have ever heard when he looked at you his deep calm eyes bespoke at once the very essence of transparent sincerity before the evening was over he had told me the whole history of his education and his past life the son of a welltodo pekin mandarin of distinctly european tastes he had early passed all his examinations in china and had been selected by the celestial government as one of the first batch of students sent to europe to acquire the tongues and the sciences of the western barbarians chungs billet was to england and here or in france he had lived with a few intervals ever since he first came to mans estate he had picked up our language quickly had taken a degree at london university and had made himself thoroughly at home in english literature in fact he was practically an englishman in everything but face and clothing his naturally fine intellect had assimilated european thought and european feeling with extraordinary ease and it was often almost impossible in talking with him to remember that he was not one of ourselves if you shut your eyes and listened you heard a pleasant cultivated intelligent young englishman when you opened them again it was always a fresh surprise to find yourself conversing with a genuine yellowfaced pigtailed chinaman in the full costume of the peacocks feather  you could never go back to live in china i said to him inquiringly after a time you could never endure life among your own people after so long a residence in civilized europe  my dear sir he answered with a slight shudder of horror you do not reflect what my position actually is my government may recall me any day i am simply at their mercy and i must do as i am bidden  but you would not like china i put in  like it he exclaimed with a gesture which for a chinaman i suppose one must call violent i should abhor it it would be a living death you who have never been in china can have no idea of what an awful misfortune it would be for a man who has acquired civilized habits and modes of thought to live among such a set of more than mediæval barbarians as my countrymen still remain at the present day oh no god grant i may never have to return there permanently for it would be more than i could endure even a short visit to pekin is bad enough the place reeks of cruelty jobbery and superstition from end to end and i always breathe more freely when i have once more got back on to the deck of a european steamer that flies the familiar british flag  then you are not patriotic i ventured to say  patriotic he replied with a slight curl of the lip how can a man be patriotic to such a mass of corruption and abomination as our chinese government i can understand a patriotic russian a patriotic egyptian nay even a patriotic turk but a patriotic chinamanwhy the very notion is palpably absurd listen my dear sir you ask me if i could live in china no i couldnt and for the best of all possible reasonsthey wouldnt let me you dont know what the furious prejudice and blind superstition of that awful country really is before i had been there three months they would accuse me either of foreign practices or what comes to much the same thing of witchcraft and they would put me to death by one of their most horrible torturing punishmentsatrocities which i could not even mention in an english drawingroom that is the sort of damocles sword that is always hanging over the head of every europeanized chinaman who returns against his own free will to his native land  i was startled and surprised it seemed so natural and simple to be talking under mrs bouverie bartons big chandelier with this interesting young man and yet so impossible for a moment to connect him in thought with all the terrible things that one had read in books about the prisons and penal laws of china that a graduate of london university a philosopher learned in all the political wisdom of ricardo mill and herbert spencer should really be subject to that barbaric code of abominable tortures was more than one could positively realize i hesitated a moment and then i said but of course they will never recall you  i trust not he said quietly i pray not very likely they will let me stop here all my lifetime i am an assistant interpreter to the embassy in which capacity i am useful to pekin whereas in any home appointment i would of course be an utter failure a manifest impossibility but there is really no accounting for the wild vagaries and caprices of the vermilion pencil for aught i know to the contrary i might even be recalled tomorrow if once they suspect a man of european sympathies their first idea is to cut off his head they regard it as you would regard the first plaguespot of cholera or smallpox in a great city  heaven forbid that they should ever recall you i said earnestly for already i had taken a strong fancy to his strange phenomenon of western education grafted on an immemorial eastern stock and i had read enough of china to know that what he said about his probable fate if he returned there permanently was nothing more than the literal truth the bare idea of such a catastrophe was too horrible to be realized for a moment in eaton place  as we drove home in our little onehorse brougham that evening my wife and effie were very anxious to learn what manner of man my chinese acquaintance might really be and when i told them what a charming person i had found him they were both inclined rather to laugh at me for my enthusiastic description effie in particular jeered much at the notion of an intelligent and earnestminded chinaman you know uncle darling she said in her bewitching way all your geese are always swans every woman you meet is absolutely beautiful and every man is perfectly delightfultill auntie and i have seen them  perfectly true effie i answered it is an amiable weakness of mine after all  however before the week was out effie and marian between them would have it that i must call upon chung and ask him to dine with us at kensington park terrace their curiosity was piqued for one thing and for another thing they thought it rather the cheese in these days of expansive cosmopolitanism to be on speaking terms with a chinese attaché japanese are cheap said effie horribly cheap of late yearsa perfect drug in the market but a chinaman is still thank heaven at a social premium now though i am an obedient enough husband as husbands go i dont always accede to marians wishes in these matters but everybody takes it for granted that effies will is law effie i may mention parenthetically is more than a daughter to us for she is poor toms only child and of course everybody connected with dear tom is doubly precious to us now as you may easily imagine so when effie had made up her mind that chung was to dine with us the thing was settled and i called at his rooms and duly invited him to the general satisfaction of everybody concerned  the dinner was a very pleasant one and for a wonder effie and marian both coincided entirely in my hastily formed opinion of mr chung his mellow silvery voice his frank truthful manner his perfect freedom from selfconsciousness all pleased and impressed those stern critics and by the end of the evening they were both quite as much taken with his delightful personality as i myself had originally been one link leads on to another and the end of it all was that when we went down for our summer villeggiatura to abbots norbury nothing would please marian but that mr chung must be invited down as one of our party he came willingly enough and for five or six weeks we had as pleasant a time together as any four people over spent chung was a perfect encyclopædia of information while his good humour and good spirits never for a moment failed him under any circumstances whatsoever  one day we had made up a little private picnic to norbury edge and were sitting together after luncheon under the shade of the big ash tree when the conversation happened to turn by accident on the small feet of chinese ladies i had often noticed that chung was very reticent about china he did not like talking about his native country and he was most pleased and most at home when we treated him most like a european born evidently he hated the provincialism of the flowery land and loved to lose his identity in the wider culture of a western civilization  how funny it will be said effie to see mrs chungs tiny feet when you bring her to london i suppose one of these days on one of your flying visits to pekin you will take to yourself a wife in your country  no chung answered with quiet dignity i shall never marrythat i have quite decided in my own mind  oh dont say that marian put in quickly i hate to hear men say theyll never marry it is such a terrible mistake they become so selfish and frumpish and oldbachelorish dear marian has a high idea of the services she has rendered to society in saving her own fortunate husband from this miserable and deplorable condition  perhaps so chung replied quietly no doubt what you say is true as a rule but for my own part i could never marry a chinawoman i am too thoroughly europeanized for that we should have absolutely no tastes or sympathies in common you dont know what my countrywomen are like mrs walters  ah no said my wife contemplatively i suppose your people are all heathens why goodness gracious mr chung if it comes to that i suppose really you are a heathen yourself  chung parried the question gracefully dont you know said he what lord chesterfield answered to the lady who asked him what religion he professed madam the religion to which all wise men belong and what is that said she madam no wise man ever says  never mind lord chesterfield said effie smiling but let us come back to the future mrs chung im quite disappointed you wont marry a chinawoman but at any rate i suppose youll marry somebody  well not a european of course marian put in  oh of course not chung echoed with true oriental imperturbability  why of course effie asked half unconsciously and yet the very unconsciousness with which she asked the question showed in itself that she instinctively felt the gulf as much as any of us if chung had been a white man instead of a yellow one she would hardly have discussed the question at issue with so much simplicity and obvious innocence  well i will tell you why chung answered because even supposing any european lady were to consent to become my wifewhich is in the first place eminently improbablei could never think of putting her in the terribly false position that she would have to occupy under existing circumstances to begin with her place in english society would be a peculiar and a trying one but that is not all you must remember that i am still a subject of the chinese empire and a member of the chinese civil service i may any day be recalled to china and of coursei say of course this time advisedlyit would be absolutely impossible for me to take an english wife to pekin with me so i am placed in this awkward dilemma i would never care to marry anybody except a european lady and to marry a european lady would be an act of injustice to her which i could never dream of committing but considering the justifiable contempt which all europeans rightly feel for us poor john chinamen i dont think it probable in any case that the temptation is at all likely to arise and so if you please as the newspapers always put it the subject then dropped  we all saw that chung was in earnest as to his wish that no more should be said about the matter and we respected his feelings accordingly but that evening as we sat smoking in the arbour after the ladies had retired i said to him quietly tell me chung if you really dislike china so very much and are so anxious not to return there why dont you throw off your allegiance altogether become a british subject and settle down among us for good and all  my dear fellow he said smiling you dont think of the difficulties i may say the impossibilities in the way of any such plan as you propose it is easy enough for a european to throw off his nationality whenever he chooses it is a very different thing for an asiatic to do so moreover i am a member of a legation my government would never willingly let me become a naturalized englishman and if i tried to manage it against their will they would demand my extradition and would carry their point too as a matter of international courtesy for one nation could never interfere with the accredited representative of another or with any of his suite even if i were to abscond and get rid of my personality altogether what would be the use of it nobody in england could find any employment for a chinaman i have no property of my own i depend entirely upon my salary for support my position is therefore quite hopeless i must simply let things go their own way and trust to chance not to be recalled to pekin  during all the rest of chungs visit we let him roam pretty much as he liked about the place and effie and i generally went with him of course we never for a moment fancied it possible that effie could conceivably take a fancy to a yellow man like him the very notion was too preposterously absurd and yet just towards the end of his stay with us it began to strike me uneasily that after all even a chinaman is human and when a chinaman happens to have perfect manners noble ideas delicate sensibility and a chivalrous respect for english ladies it is perhaps just within the bounds of conceivability that at some odd moments an english girl might for a second partially forget his oblique eyelids and his yellow skin i was sometimes half afraid that it might be so with effie and though i dont think she would ever herself have dreamed of marrying such a manthe physical barrier between the races is far too profound for thati fancy she occasionally pitied poor chungs loneliness with that womanly pity which so easily glides into a deeper and closer sentiment certainly she felt his isolation greatly and often hoped he would never really be obliged to go back for ever to that hateful china  one lovely summer evening a few days before chungs holiday was to end and his chief at the embassy expected him back again marian and i had gone out for a stroll together and in coming home happened to walk above the little arbour in the shrubbery by the upper path a seat let into the hedge bank overhung the summerhouse and here we both sat down silently to rest after our walking as we did so we heard chungs voice in the arbour close below so near and so clear that every word was quite distinctly audible  for the last time in england he was saying with a softly regretful cadence in his tone as we came upon him  the last time mr chung the other voice was effies what on earth do you mean by that  what i say miss walters i am recalled to china i got the letters of recall the day before yesterday  the day before yesterday and you never told us why didnt you let us know before  i did not know you would interest yourselves in my private affairs  mr chung there was a deep air of reproach in effies tone  well miss walters that is not quite true i ought not to have said it to friends so kind as you have all shown yourselves to be no my real reason was that i did not wish to grieve you unnecessarily and even now i would not have done so only  only  at this moment i for my part felt we had heard too much i blushed up to my eyes at the thought that we should have unwittingly played the spy upon these two innocent young people i was just going to call out and rush down the little path to them but as i made a slight movement forward marian held my wrist with an imploring gesture and earnestly put her finger on my lips i was overborne and i regret to say i stopped and listened marian did not utter a word but speaking rapidly on her fingers as we all had learnt to do for poor tom she said impressively for gods sake not a sound this is serious we must and ought to hear it out marian is a very clever woman in these matters and when she thinks anything a point of duty to poor toms girl i always give way to her implicitly but i confess i didnt like it  only effie had said  only i felt compelled to now i could not leave without telling you how deeply i had appreciated all your kindness  but mr chung tell me one thing she asked earnestly why have they recalled you to pekin  i had rather not tell you  i insist  because they are displeased with my foreign tastes and habits which have been reported to them by some of my fellowattachés  but mr chung uncle says there is no knowing what they will do to you they may kill you on some absurd charge or other of witchcraft or something equally meaningless  i am afraid he answered imperturbably that may be the case i dont mind at all on my own accountwe chinese are an apathetic race you knowbut i should be sorry to be a cause of grief to any of the dear friends i have made in england  mr chung this time the tone was one of unspeakable horror  dont speak like that chung said quickly there is no use in taking trouble at interest i may come to no harm at any rate it will not matter much to any one but myself now let us go back to the house i ought not to have stopped here with you so long and it is nearly dinner time  no said effie firmly we will not go back i must understand more about this there is plenty of time before dinner and if not dinner must wait  but miss walters i dont think i ought to have brought you out here and i am quite sure i ought not to stay any longer do return your aunt will be annoyed  bother aunt she is the best woman in the world but i must hear all about this mr chung why dont you say you wont go and stay in england in spite of them  nobody ever disobeys effie and so chung wavered visibly i will tell you why he answered slowly because i cannot i am a servant of the chinese government and if they choose to recall me i must go  but they couldnt enforce their demand  yes they could your government would give me up  but mr chung couldnt you run away and hide for a while and then come out again and live like an englishman  no he answered quietly it is quite impossible a chinaman couldnt get work in england as a clerk or anything of that sort and i have nothing of my own to live upon  there was a silence of a few minutes both were evidently thinking it out effie broke the silence first  oh mr chung do you think they will really put you to death  i dont think it i know it  you know it  yes  again a silence and this time chung broke it first miss effie he said one chinaman more or less in the world does not matter much and i shall never forgive myself for having been led to grieve you for a moment even though this is the last time i shall be able to speak to you but i see you are sorry for me and nowchinaman as i am i must speak outi cant leave you without having told you all i feel i am going to a terrible end and i know itso you will forgive me we shall never meet again so what i am going to say need never cause you any embarrassment in future that i am recalled does not much trouble me that i am going to die does not much trouble me but that i can never could never possibly have called you my wife troubles me and cuts me to the very quick it is the deepest drop in my cup of humiliation  i knew it said effie with wonderful composure  you knew it  yes i knew it i saw it from the second week you were here and i liked you for it but of course it was impossible so there is nothing more to be said about it  of course said chung ah that terrible of course i feel it you feel it we all feel it and yet what a horrible thing it is i am so human in everything else but there is that one impassable barrier between us and i myself cannot fail to recognize it i could not even wish you to feel that you could marry a chinaman  at that momentfor a moment onlyi almost felt as if i could have said to effie take him but the thing was too impossiblea something within us rises against itand i said nothing  so now chung continued i must go we must both go back to the house i have said more than i ought to have said and i am ashamed of myself for having done so yet in spite of the measureless gulf that parts us i felt i could not return to china without having told you will you forgive me  i am glad you did said effie it will relieve you  she stood a minute irresolute and then she began again mr chung i am too horrified to know what i ought to do i cant grasp it and take it all in so quickly if you had money of your own would you be able to run away and live somehow  i might possibly chung answered but not probably a chinaman even if he wears european clothing is too marked a person ever to escape the only chance would be by going to mauritius or california where i might get lost in the crowd  but mr chung i have money of my own what can i do help me tell me i cant let a fellowcreature die for a mere prejudice of race and colour if i were your wife it would be yours isnt it my duty  no said chung it is more sacrifice than any woman ought to make for any man you like me but that is all  if i shut my eyes and only heard you i think i could love you  miss effie said chung suddenly this is wrong very wrong of me i have let my weakness overcome me i wont stop any longer i have done what i ought not to have done and i shall go this minute just once before i go shut your eyes and let me kiss the tips of your fingers thank you no i will not stop and without another word he was gone  marian and i stared at one another in blank horror what on earth was to be done all solutions were equally impossible even to meet chung at dinner was terrible we both knew in our heart of hearts that if chung had been an englishman remaining in heart and soul the very selfsame man he was we would willingly have chosen him for effies husband but a chinaman reason about the prejudice as you like there it is a thing not to be got over and at bottom so real that even the very notion of getting over it is terribly repugnant to our natural instincts on the other hand was poor chung with his fine delicate feelings his courteous manners his cultivated intellect his english chivalry to go back among the savage semibarbarians of pekin and to be put to death in heaven knows what inhuman manner for the atrocious crime of having outstripped his race and nation the thing was too awful to contemplate either way  we walked home together without a word chung had taken the lower path we took the upper one and followed him at a distance effie remained behind for a while in the summerhouse i dont know how we managed to dress for dinner but we did somehow and when we went down into the little drawingroom at eight oclock we were not surprised to hear that miss effie had a headache and did not want any dinner that evening i was more surprised however when shortly before the gong sounded one of the servants brought me a little twisted note from chung written hurriedly in pencil and sent she said by a porter from the railway station it ran thus       dear mr walters       excuse great haste compelled to return to town immediately shall      write more fully tomorrow just in time to catch up express    yours ever   chung  evidently instead of returning to the house he had gone straight to the station after all chung had the true feelings of a gentleman he could not meet effie again after what had passed and he cut the gordian knot in the only way possible  effie said nothing to us and we said nothing to effie except to show her chungs note next morning in a casual offhand fashion two days later a note came for us from the embassy in chungs pretty incisive handwriting it contained copious excuses for his hasty departure and a few lines to say that he was ordered back to china by the next mail which started two days later marian and i talked it all over but we could think of nothing that could be of any use and after all we said to one another poor chung might be mistaken about the probable fate that was in store for him  i dont think effie said when we showed her the letter i ever met such a nice man as mr chung i believe he is really a hero we pretended not to understand what she could mean by it  the days went by and we went back again to the dull round of london society we heard nothing more of chung for many weeks till at last one morning i found a letter on the table bearing the hong kong postmark i opened it hastily as i supposed it was a note from chung it was written in a very small hand on a tiny square of ricepaper and it ran as follows    thienshan prison pekin dec 8  my dear friend       immediately on my return here i was arrested on a charge of      witchcraft and of complicity with the foreign devils to introduce      the western barbarism into china i have now been in a loathsome      prison in pekin for three weeks in the midst of sights and sounds      which i dare not describe to you already i have suffered more than      i can tell and i have very little doubt that i shall be brought to      trial and executed within a few weeks i write now begging you not      to let miss effie hear of this and if my name happens to be      mentioned in the english papers to keep my fate a secret from her      as far as possible i trust to chance for the opportunity of      getting this letter forwarded to hong kong and i have had to write      it secretly for i am not allowed pen ink or paper thank you      much for your very great kindness to me i am not sorry to die for      it is a mistake for a man to have lived outside the life of his own      people and there was no place left for me on earth goodbye    ever yours gratefully   chung  the letter almost drove me wild with ineffectual remorse and regret why had i not tried to persuade chung to remain in england why had i not managed to smuggle him out of the way and to find him some kind of light employment such as even a chinaman might easily have performed but it was no use regretting now the impassable gulf was fixed between us and it was hardly possible even then to realize that this amiable young student versed in all the science and philosophy of the nineteenth century had been handed over alive to the tender mercies of a worse than mediæval barbarism and superstition my heart sank within me and i did not venture to show the letter even to marian  for some weeks the days passed heavily indeed i could not get chung out of my mind and i saw that effie could not either we never mentioned his name but i noticed that effie had got from mudies all the books about china that she could hear of and that she was reading up with a sort of awful interest all the chapters that related to chinese law and chinese criminal punishments poor child the subject evidently enthralled her with a terrible fascination and i feared that the excitement she was in might bring on a brain fever  one morning early in april we were all seated in the little breakfastroom about ten oclock and effie had taken up the outside sheet of the times while i was engaged in looking over the telegrams on the central pages suddenly she gave a cry of horror flung down the paper with a gesture of awful repugnance and fell from her chair as stiff and white as a corpse i knew instinctively what had happened and i took her up in my arms and carried her to her room after the doctor had come and effie had recovered a little from the first shock i took up the paper from the ground where it lay and read the curt little paragraph which contained the news that seemed to us so terrible  the numerous persons who made the acquaintance of chung fo tsiou late assistant interpreter to the chinese embassy in london will learn with regret that this unfortunate member of the civil service has been accused of witchcraft and executed at pekin by the frightful chinese method known as the heavy death chung fo tsiou was well known in london and paris where he spent many years of his official life and attracted some attention by his natural inclination to european society and manners  poor chung his end was too horrible for an english reader even to hear of it but effie knew it all and i did not wonder that the news should have affected her so deeply  effie was some weeks ill and at first we almost feared her mind would give way under the pressure not that she had more than merely liked poor chung but the sense of horror was too great for her easily to cast it off even i myself did not sleep lightly for many and many a day after i heard the terrible truth but while effie was still ill a second letter reached us written this time in blood with a piece of stick apparently on a scrap of coarse english paper such as that which is used for wrapping up tobacco it was no more than this       execution today keep it from miss effie cannot forgive myself      for having spoken to her will you forgive me it was the weakness      of a moment but even chinamen have hearts i could not die without      telling herchung  i showed effie the scrap afterwardsit had come without a line of explanation from shanghaoand she has kept it ever since locked up in her little desk as a sacred memento i dont doubt that some of these days effie will marry but as long as she lives she will bear the impress of what she has suffered about poor chung an english girl could not conceivably marry a chinaman but now that chung is dead effie cannot help admiring the steadfastness the bravery and the noble qualities of her chinese lover it is an awful state of things which sometimes brings the nineteenth century and primitive barbarism into such close and horrible juxtaposition     the curate of churnside   walter dene deacon in his faultless oxford clerical coat and broad felt hat strolled along slowly sunning himself as he went after his wont down the pretty central lane of west churnside it was just the idyllic village best suited to the taste of such an idyllic young curate as walter dene there were cottages with lowthatched roofs thickly overgrown with yellow stonecrop and pink houseleek there were trelliswork porches up which the scented dogrose and the fainter honeysuckle clambered together in sisterly rivalry there were pargeted gableends of elizabethan farmhouses quaintly varied with black oak joists and moulded plaster panels at the end of all between an avenue of ancient elm trees the heavy square tower of the old church closed in the little vistaa church with a round norman doorway and dogtooth arches melting into early english lancets in the aisle and finishing up with a great decorated east window by the broken cross and yew tree not a trace of perpendicularity about it anywhere thank goodness for if it were perpendicular said walter dene to himself often i really think in spite of my uncle i should have to look out for another curacy  yes it was a charming village and a charming country but above all it was rendered habitable and pleasurable for a man of taste by the informing presence of christina eliot i dont think i shall propose to christina this week after all thought walter dene as he strolled along lazily the most delightful part of lovemaking is certainly its first beginning the little tremor of hope and expectation the halfneedless doubt you feel as to whether she really loves you the pains you take to pierce the thin veil of maidenly reserve the triumph of detecting her at a blush or a flutter when she sees you comingall these are delicate little morsels to be rolled daintily on the critical palate and not to be swallowed down coarsely at one vulgar gulp poor child she is on tenterhooks of hesitation and expectancy all the time i know for im sure she loves me now im sure she loves me but i must wait a week yet she will be grateful to me for it hereafter we mustnt kill the goose that lays the golden eggs we mustnt eat up all our capital at one extravagant feast and then lament the want of our interest ever afterward let us live another week in our first fools paradise before we enter on the safer but less tremulous pleasures of sure possession we can enjoy first love but once in a lifetime let us enjoy it now while we can and not fling away the chance prematurely by mere childish haste and girlish precipitancy thinking which thing walter dene halted a moment by the churchyard wall picked a long spray of scented wild thyme from a mossy cranny and gazed into the blue sky above at the graceful swifts who nested in the old tower as they curved and circled through the yielding air on their evenly poised and powerful pinions  just at that moment old mary long came out of her cottage to speak with the young parson if ye plaze maister dene she said in her native westcountry dialect our nully would like to zee ee shes main ill today zur and she be like to die amost im thinking  poor child poor child said walter dene tenderly shes a dear little thing mrs long is your nellie and i hope she may yet be spared to you ill come and see her at once and try if i can do anything to ease her  he crossed the road compassionately with the tottering old grandmother giving her his helping hand over the kerbstone and following her with bated breath into the close little sickroom then he flung open the tiny casement with its diamondleaded panes so as to let in the fresh summer air and picked a few sprigs of sweetbriar from the porch which he joined with the geranium from his own buttonhole to make a tiny nosegay for the bare bedside after that he sat and talked awhile gently in an undertone to pale pretty little nellie herself and went away at last promising to send her some jelly and some soup immediately from the vicarage kitchen  shes a sweet little child he said to himself musingly though im afraid shes not long for this world now and the poor like these small attentions dearly they get them seldom and value them for the sake of the thoughtfulness they imply rather than for the sake of the mere things themselves i can order a bottle of calfsfoot at the grocers and carter can set it in a mould without any trouble while as for the soup some tinned mockturtle and a little fresh stock makes a really capital mixture for this sort of thing it costs so little to give these poor souls pleasure and it is a great luxury to oneself undeniably but after all what a funny trade it is to set an educated man to do they send us up to oxford or cambridge give us a distinct taste for Æschylus and catullus dante and milton mendelssohn and chopin good claret and olives farcies and then bring us down to a country village to look after the bodily and spiritual ailments of rheumatic old washerwomen if it were not for poetry flowers and christina i really think i should succumb entirely under the infliction  hes a dear good man that he is is young passon murmured old miry long as walter disappeared between the elm trees and he do love the poor and the zick the same as if he was their own brother god bless his zoul the dear good vulla vor all his kindness to our nully  halfway down the main lane walter came across christina eliot as she saw him she smiled and coloured a little and held out her small gloved hand prettily walter took it with a certain courtly and graceful chivalry an exquisite day miss eliot he said such a depth of sapphire in the sky such a faint undertone of green on the clouds by the horizon such a lovely humming of bees over the flickering hot meadows on days like this one feels that schopenhauer is wrong after all and that life is sometimes really worth living  it seems to me often worth living christina answered if not for oneself at least for others but you pretend to be more of a pessimist than you really are i fancy mr dene any one who finds so much beauty in the world as you do can hardly think life poor or meagre you seem to catch the loveliest points in everything you look at and to throw a little literary or artistic reflection over them which makes them even lovelier than they are in themselves  well no doubt one can increase ones possibilities of enjoyment by carefully cultivating ones own faculties of admiration and appreciation said the curate thoughtfully but after all life has only a few chapters that are thoroughly interesting and enthralling in all its history we oughtnt to hurry over them too lightly miss eliot we ought to linger on them lovingly and make the most of their potentialities we ought to dwell upon them like linked sweetness long drawn out it is the mistake of the world at large to hurry too rapidly over the pleasantest episodes just as children pick all the plums at once out of the pudding i often think that from the purely selfish and temporal point of view the real value of a life to its subject may be measured by the space of time over which he has managed to spread the enjoyment of its greatest pleasures look for example at poetry now  a faint shade of disappointment passed across christinas face as he turned from what seemed another groove into that indifferent subject but she answered at once yes of course one feels that with the higher pleasures at least but there are others in which the interest of plot is greater and then one looks naturally rather to the end when you begin a good novel you cant help hurrying through it in order to find out what becomes of everybody at last  ah but the highest artistic interest goes beyond mere plot interest i like rather to read for the pleasure of reading and to loiter over the passages that please me quite irrespective of what goes before or what comes after just as you for your part like to sketch a beautiful scene for its own worth to you irrespective of what may happen to the leaves in autumn or to the cottage roof in twenty years from this by the way have you finished that little watercolour of the mill yet its the prettiest thing of yours ive ever seen and i want to look how youve managed the light on your foreground  come in and see it said christina its finished now and to tell you the truth im very well pleased with it myself  then i know it must be good the curate answered for you are always your own harshest critic and he turned in at the little gate with her and entered the village doctors tiny drawingroom  christina placed the sketch on an easel near the windowa low window opening to the ground with long lithe festoons of faintscented jasmine encroaching on it from outsideand let the light fall on it aslant in the right direction it was a pretty and a clever sketch certainly with more than a mere amateurs sense of form and colour and walter dene who had a true eye for pictures could conscientiously praise it for its artistic depth and fulness indeed on that head at least walter denes veracity was unimpeachable however lax in other matters nothing on earth would have induced him to praise as good a picture or a sculpture in which he saw no real merit he sat a little while criticizing and discussing it suggesting an improvement here or an alteration there and then he rose hurriedly remembering all at once his forgotten promise to little nellie dear me he said your daughters picture has almost made me overlook my proper duties mrs eliot i promised to send some jelly and things at once to poor little nellie long at her grandmothers how very wrong of me to let my natural inclinations keep me loitering here when i ought to have been thinking of the poor of my parish and he went out with just a gentle pressure on christinas hand and a look from his eyes that her heart knew how to read aright at the first glance of it  do you know christie said her father i sometimes fancy when i hear that new parson fellow talk about his artistic feelings and so on that hes just a trifle selfish or at least selfcentred he always dwells so much on his own enjoyment of things you know  oh no papa cried christina warmly hes anything but selfish im sure look how kind he is to all the poor in the village and how much he thinks about their comfort and welfare and whenever hes talking with one he seems so anxious to make you feel happy and contented with yourself he has a sort of little subtle flattery of manner about him thats all pure kindliness and hes always thinking what he can say or do to please you and to help you onward what you say about his dwelling on enjoyment so much is really only his artistic sensibility he feels things so keenly and enjoys beauty so deeply that he cant help talking enthusiastically about it even a little out of season he has more feelings to display than most men and im sure thats the reason why he displays them so much a ploughboy could only talk enthusiastically about roast beef and dumplings mr dene can talk about everything thats beautiful and sublime on earth or in heaven  meanwhile walter dene was walking quickly with his measured treadthe even regular tread of a cultivated gentlemandown the lane toward the village grocers saying to himself as he went there was never such a girl in all the world as my christina she may be only a country surgeons daughtera rosebud on a hedgerow bushbut she has the soul and the eye of a queen among women for all that every lover has deceived himself with the same sweet dream to be surehow overanalytic we have become nowadays when i must needs half argue myself out of the sweets of first lovebut then they hadnt so much to go upon as i have she has a wonderful touch in music she has an exquisite eye in painting she has an italian charm in manner and conversation im something of a connoisseur after all and no more likely to be deceived in a woman than i am in a wine or a picture and next week i shall really propose formally to christina though i know by this time it will be nothing more than the merest formality her eyes are too eloquent not to have told me that long ago it will be a delightful pleasure to live for her and in order to make her happy i frankly recognize that i am naturally a little selfishnot coarsely and vulgarly selfish from that disgusting and piggish vice i may conscientiously congratulate myself that im fairly free but still selfish in a refined and cultivated manner now living with christina and for christina will correct this defect in my nature will tend to bring me nearer to a true standard of perfection when i am by her side and then only i feel that i am thinking entirely of her and not at all of myself to her i show my best side with her that best side would be always uppermost the companionship of such a woman makes life something purer and higher and better worth having the one thing that stands in our way is this horrid practical question of what to live upon i dont suppose uncle arthur will be inclined to allow me anything and i cant marry on my own paltry income and my curacy only yet i cant bear to keep christina waiting indefinitely till some thickheaded squire or other chooses to take it into his opaque brain to give me a decent living  from the grocers the curate walked on carrying the two tins in his hand as far as the vicarage he went into the library sat down by his own desk and rang the bell will you be kind enough to give those things to carter john he said in his bland voice and tell her to put the jelly in a mould and let it set the soup must be warmed with a little fresh stock and seasoned then take them both with my compliments to old mary long the washerwoman for her grandchild is my uncle in  no master walter answered the manhe was always master walter to the old servants at his unclesthe vicar have gone over by train to churminster he told me to tell you he wouldnt be back till evening after dinner  did you see him off john  yes master walter i took his portmantew to the station  this will be a good chance then thought walter dene to himself very well john he went on aloud i shall write my sermon now dont let anybody come to disturb me  john nodded and withdrew walter dene locked the door after him carefully as he often did when writing sermons and then lit a cigar which was also a not infrequent concomitant of his exegetical labours after that he walked once or twice up and down the room paused a moment to look at his parchmentcovered rabelais and villon on the bookshelf peered out of the dulled glass windows with the crest in their centre and finally drew a curious bent iron instrument out of his waistcoat pocket with it in his hands he went up quietly to his uncles desk and began fumbling at the lock in an experienced manner as a matter of fact it was not his first trial of skill in lockpicking for walter dene was a painstaking and methodical man and having made up his mind that he would get at and read his uncles will he took good care to begin by fastening all the drawers in his own bedroom and trying his prentice hand at unfastening them again in the solitude of his chamber  after half a minutes twisting and turning the wards gave way gently to his dexterous pressure and the lid of the desk lay open before him walter dene took out the different papers one by onethere was no need for hurry and he was not a nervous persontill he came to a roll of parchment which he recognized at once as the expected will he unrolled it carefully and quietly without any womanish trembling or excitementthank heaven he said to himself im above such nonsense as thatand sat down leisurely to read it in the big low velvetcovered study chair as he did so he did not forget to lay a notched footrest for his feet and to put the little japanese dish on the tiny table by his side to hold his cigar ash and now he said for the important question whether uncle arthur has left his money to me or to arthur or to both of us equally he ought of course to leave at least half to me seeing i have become a curate on purpose to please him instead of following my natural vocation to the bar but i shouldnt be a bit surprised if he had left it all to arthur hes a pigheaded and illogical old man the vicar and he can never forgive me i believe because being the eldest son i wasnt called after him by my father and mother as if that was my fault some peoples ideas of personal responsibility are so ridiculously muddled  he composed himself quietly in the armchair and glanced rapidly at the will through the meaningless preliminaries till he came to the significant clauses these he read more carefully all my estate in the county of dorset and the messuage or tenement known as redlands in the parish of lode in the county of devon to my dear nephew arthur dene he said to himself slowly oh this will never do and i give and bequeath to my said nephew arthur dene the sum of ten thousand pounds three per cent consolidated annuities now standing in my nameoh this is atrocious quite atrocious whats this and i give and bequeath to my dear nephew walter dene the residue of my personal estateand so forth oh no thats quite sufficient this must be rectified the residuary legatee would only come in for a few hundreds or so its quite preposterous the vicar was always an illtempered cantankerous unaccountable person but i wonder he has the face to sit opposite me at dinner after that  he hummed an air from schubert and sat a moment looking thoughtfully at the will then he said to himself quietly the simplest thing to do would be merely to scrape out or take out with chemicals the name arthur substituting the name walter and vice versâ thats a very small matter a man who draws as well as i do ought to be able easily to imitate a copying clerks engrossing hand but it would be madness to attempt it now and here i want a little practice first at the same time i mustnt keep the will out a moment longer than is necessary my uncle may return by some accident before i expect him and the true philosophy of life consists in invariably minimizing the adverse chances this will was evidently drawn up by watson and blenkiron of chancery lane ill write tomorrow and get them to draw up a will for me leaving all i possess to arthur the same clerk is pretty sure to engross it and thatll give me a model for the two names on which i can do a little preliminary practice besides i can try the stuff wharton told me about for making ink fade on the same parchment that will be killing two birds with one stone certainly and now if i dont make haste i shant have time to write my sermon  he replaced the will calmly in the desk fastened the lock again with a delicate twirl of the pick and sat down in his armchair to compose his discourse for tomorrows evensong its not a bad bit of rhetoric he said to himself as he read it over for correction but im not sure that i havent plagiarized a little too freely from montaigne and dear old burton what a pity it must be thrown away upon a churnside congregation not a soul in the whole place will appreciate a word of it except christina well well that alone is enough reward for any man and he knocked off his ash pensively into the japanese ashpan  during the course of the next week walter practised diligently the art of imitating handwriting he got his will drawn up and engrossed at watson and blenkirons without signing it bien entendu and he spent many solitary hours in writing the two names walter and arthur on the spare end of parchment after the manner of the engrossing clerk he also tested the stuff for making the ink fade to his own perfect satisfaction and on the next occasion when his uncle was safely off the premises for three hours he took the will once more deliberately from the desk removed the obnoxious letters with scrupulous care and wrote in his own name in place of arthurs so that even the engrossing clerk himself would hardly have known the difference there he said to himself approvingly as he took down quiet old george herbert from the shelf and sat down to enjoy an hours smoke after the business was over thats one good deed well done anyhow i have the calm satisfaction of a clear conscience the vicars proposed arrangement was really most unfair i have substituted for it what aristotle would have rightly called true distributive justice for though ive left all the property to myself by the unfortunate necessity of the case of course i wont take it all ill be juster than the vicar arthur shall have his fair share which is more i believe than hed have done for me but i hate squalid moneygrubbing if brothers cant be generous and brotherly to one another what a wretched sordid little life this of ours would really be  next sunday morning the vicar preached and walter sat looking up at him reflectively from his place in the chancel a beautiful clearcut face the curates and seen to great advantage from the doctors pew set off by the white surplice and upturned in quiet meditation towards the elder priest in the pulpit walter was revolving many things in his mind and most of all one adverse chance which he could not just then see his way to minimize any day his uncle might take it into his head to read over the will and discover theah well the rectification walter was a man of too much delicacy of feeling even to think of it to himself as a fraud or a forgery then again the vicar was not a very old man after all he might live for an indefinite period and christina and himself might lose all the best years of their life waiting for a useless persons natural removal what a pity that threescore was not the utmost limit of human life for his own part like the psalmist walter had no desire to outlive his own highest tastes and powers of enjoyment ah well well mans prerogative is to better and improve upon nature if people do not die when they ought then it becomes clearly necessary for philosophically minded juniors to help them on their way artificially  it was an ugly necessity certainly walter frankly recognized that fact from the very beginning and he shrank even from contemplating it but there was no other way out of the difficulty the old man had always been a selfish bachelor with no love for anybody or anything on earth except his books his coins his garden and his dinner he was growing tired of all except the last would it not be better for the world at large on strict utilitarian principles that he should go at once true such steps are usually to be deprecated but the wise man is a law unto himself and instead of laying down the wooden hardandfast lines that make conventional morality so much a rule of thumb he judges every individual case on its own particular merits here was christinas happiness and his own on the one hand with many collateral advantages to other people set in the scale against the feeble remnant of a selfish old mans days on the other walter dene had a constitutional horror of taking life in any form and especially of shedding blood but he flattered himself that if anything of the sort became clearly necessary he was not the man to shrink from taking the needful measures to ensure it at any sacrifice of personal comfort  all through the next week walter turned over the subject in his own mind and the more he thought about it the more the plan gained in definiteness and consistency as detail after detail suggested itself to him first he thought of poison that was the cleanest and neatest way of managing the thing he considered and it involved the least unpleasant consequences to stick a knife or shoot a bullet into any sentient creature was a horrid and revolting act to put a little tasteless powder into a cup of coffee and let a man sleep off his life quietly was really nothing more than helping him involuntarily to a delightful euthanasia i wish any one would do as much for me at his age without telling me about it walter said to himself seriously but then the chances of detection would be much increased by using poison and walter felt it an imperative duty to do nothing which would expose christina to the shock of a discovery she would not see the matter in the same practical light as he did women never do their morality is purely conventional and a wise man will do nothing on earth to shake it you cannot buy poison without the risk of exciting question there remained then only shooting or stabbing but shooting makes an awkward noise and attracts attention at the moment so the one thing possible was a knife unpleasant as that conclusion seemed to all his more delicate feelings  having thus decided walter dene proceeded to lay his plans with deliberate caution he had no intention whatsoever of being detected though his method of action was simplicity itself it was only bunglers and clumsy fools who got caught he knew that a man of his intelligence and ability would not make such an idiot of himself aswell as common ruffians always do he took his old american bowieknife bought years ago as a curiosity out of the drawer where it had lain so long it was very rusty but it would be safer to sharpen it privately on his own hone and strop than to go asking for a new knife at a shop for the express purpose of enabling the shopman afterwards to identify him he sharpened it for safetys sake during sermonhour in the library with the door locked as usual it took a long time to get off all the rust and his arm got quickly tired one morning as he was polishing away at it he was stopped for a moment by a butterfly which flapped and fluttered against the dulled windowpanes poor thing he said to himself it will beat its feathery wings to pieces in its struggles and he put a vase of venetian glass on top of it lifted the sash carefully and let the creature fly away outside in the broad sunshine at the same moment the vicar who was strolling with his king charlie on the lawn came up and looked in at the window he could not have seen in before because of the dulled and painted diamonds  thats a murderouslooking weapon wally he said with a smile as his glance fell upon the bowie and hone what do you use it for  oh its an american bowie walter answered carelessly i bought it long ago for a curiosity and now im sharpening it up to help me in carving that block of walnut wood and he ran his finger lightly along the edge of the blade to test its keenness what a lucky thing that it was the vicar himself and not the gardener if he had been caught by anybody else the fact would have been fatal evidence after all was over méfiezvous des papillons he hummed to himself after béranger as he shut down the window one more butterfly and i must give up the game as useless  meanwhile as walter meant to make a clean job of ithacking and hewing clumsily was repulsive to all his finer feelingshe began also to study carefully the anatomy of the human back he took down all the books on the subject in the library and by their aid discovered exactly under which ribs the heart lay a little observation of the vicar compared with the plates in quains anatomy showed him precisely at what point in his clerical coat the most vulnerable interstice was situated its a horrid thing to have to do he thought over and over again as he planned it but its the only way to secure christinas happiness and so by a certain bright friday evening in august walter dene had fully completed all his preparations  that afternoon as on all bright afternoons in summer the vicar went for a walk in the grounds attended only by little king charlie he was squire and parson at once in churnside and he loved to make the round of his own estate at a certain gate by selbury copse the vicar always halted to rest awhile leaning on the bar and looking at the view across the valley it was a safe and lonely spot walter remained at home he was to take the regular friday evensong and went into the study by himself after a while he took his hat not without trembling strolled across the garden and then made the short cut through the copse so as to meet the vicar by the gate on his way he heard the noise of the dennings in the farm opposite out rabbitshooting with their guns and ferrets in the warren his very soul shrank within him at the sound of that brutal sport great heavens he said to himself with a shudder to think how i loathe and shrink from the necessity of almost painlessly killing this one selfish old man for an obviously good reason and those creatures there will go out massacring innocent animals with the aid of a hideous beast of prey not only without remorse but actually by way of amusement i thank heaven i am not even as they are near the gate he came upon his uncle quietly and naturally though it would be absurd to deny that at that supreme moment even walter denes equable heart throbbed hard and his breath went and came tremulously alone he thought to himself and nobody near this is quite providential using even then in thought the familiar phraseology of his profession  a lovely afternoon uncle arthur he said as composedly as he could accurately measuring the spot on the vicars coat with his eye meanwhile the valley looks beautiful in this light  yes a lovely afternoon wally my boy and an exquisite glimpse down yonder into the churchyard  as he spoke walter half leaned upon the gate beside him and adjusted the knife behind the vicars back scientifically then without a word more in spite of a natural shrinking he drove it home up to the haft with a terrible effort of will at the exact spot on the back that the books had pointed out to him it was a painful thing to do but he did it carefully and well the effect of walter denes scientific prevision was even more instantaneous than he had anticipated without a single cry without a sob or a contortion the vicars lifeless body fell over heavily by the side of the gate it rolled down like a log into the dry ditch beneath walter knelt trembling on the ground close by felt the pulse for a moment to assure himself that his uncle was really dead and having fully satisfied himself on this allimportant point proceeded to draw the knife neatly out of the wound he had let it fall in the body in order to extricate it more easily afterward and not risk pulling it out carelessly so as to get himself covered needlessly by telltale drops of blood like ordinary clumsy assassins but he had forgotten to reckon with little king charlie the dog jumped piteously upon the body of his master licked the wound with his tongue and refused to allow walter to withdraw the knife it would be unsafe to leave it there for it might be recognized minimize the adverse chances he muttered still but there was no inducing king charlie to move a struggle might result in getting drops of blood upon his coat and then great heavens what a terrible awakening for christina oh christina christina christina he said to himself piteously it is for you only that i could ever have ventured to do this hideous thing the blood was still oozing out of the narrow slit and saturating the black coat and walter dene with his delicate nerves could hardly bear to look upon it  at last he summoned up resolution to draw out the knife from the ugly wound in spite of king charlie and as he did so oh horror the little dog jumped at it and cut his left foreleg against the sharp edge deep to the bone here was a pretty accident indeed if walter dene had been a common heartless murderer he would have snatched up the knife immediately left the poor lame dog to watch and bleed beside his dead master and skulked off hurriedly from the mute witness to his accomplished crime but walter was made of very different mould from that he could not find it in his heart to leave a poor dumb animal wounded and bleeding for hours together alone and untended just at first indeed he tried sophistically to persuade himself his duty to christina demanded that he should go away at once and never mind the sufferings of a mere spaniel but his better nature told him the next moment that such sophisms were indefensible and his humane instincts overcame even the profound instinct of selfpreservation he sat down quietly beside the warm corpse thank goodness he said with a slight shiver of disgust im not one of those weakminded people who are troubled by remorse they would be so overcome by terror at what they had done that they would want to run away from the body immediately at any price but i dont think i could feel remorse it is an incident of lower naturesnatures that are capable of doing actions under one set of impulses which they regret when another set comes uppermost in turn that implies a want of balance an imperfect coordination of parts and passions the perfect character is consistent with itself shame and repentance are confessions of weakness for my part i never do anything without having first deliberately decided that it is the best or the only thing to do and having so done it i do not draw back like a girl from the necessary consequences of my own act no fluttering or running away for me still i must admit that all that blood does look very ghastly poor old gentleman i believe he really died almost without knowing it and that is certainly a great comfort to one under the circumstances  he took king charlie tenderly in his hands without touching the wounded leg and drew his pocket handkerchief softly from his pocket poor beastie he said aloud holding out the cut limb before him you are badly hurt im afraid but it wasnt my fault we must see what we can do for you then he wrapped the handkerchief deftly around it without letting any blood show through pressed the dog close against his breast and picked up the knife gingerly by the reeking handle a fool of a fellow would throw it into the river he thought with a curl of his graceful lip they always dredge the river after these incidents i shall just stick it down a hole in the hedge a hundred yards off the police have no invention dull donkeys they never dredge the hedges and he thrust it well down a disused rabbit burrow filling in the top neatly with loose mould  walter dene meant to have gone home quietly and said evensong leaving the discovery of the body to be made at haphazard by others but this unfortunate accident to king charlie compelled him against his will to give the first alarm it was absolutely necessary to take the dog to the veterinary at once or the poor little fellow might bleed to death incontinently ones best efforts he thought are always liable to these unfortunate contretemps i meant merely to remove a superfluous person from an uncongenial environment yet i cant manage it without at the same time seriously injuring a harmless little creature that i really love and with one last glance at the lifeless thing behind him he took his way regretfully along the ordinary path back towards the peaceful village of churnside  halfway down the lane at the entrance to the village he met one of his parishioners tom he said boldly have you seen anything of the vicar im afraid hes got hurt somehow heres poor little king charlie come limping back with his leg cut  he went down the road zur arf an hour zince and i arnt zeen him afterwards  tell the servants at the vicarage to look around the grounds then im afraid he has fallen and hurt himself i must take the dog at once to perkinss or else i shall be late for evensong  the man went off straight toward the vicarage and walter dene turned immediately with the dog in his arms into the village veterinarys   ii  the servants from the vicarage were not the first persons to hit upon the dead body of the vicar joe harley the poacher was out reconnoitring that afternoon in the vicars preserves and five minutes after walter dene had passed down the far side of the hedge joe harley skulked noiselessly from the orchard up to the cover of the gate by selbury copse he crept through the open end by the post for it was against joes principles under any circumstances to climb over an obstacle of any sort and so needlessly expose himself and he was just going to slink off along the other hedge having wires and traps in his pocket when his boot struck violently against a soft object in the ditch underfoot it struck so violently that it crushed in the object with the force of the impact and when joe came to look at what the object might be he found to his horror that it was the bruised and livid face of the old parson joe had had a brush with keepers more than once and had spent several months of seclusion in dorchester gaol but in spite of his familiarity with minor forms of lawlessness he was moved enough in all conscience by this awful and unexpected discovery he turned the body over clumsily with his hands and saw that it had been stabbed in the back once only in doing so he trod in a little blood and got a drop or two on his sleeve and trousers for the pool was bigger now and joe was not so handy or dainty with his fingers as the idyllic curate  it was an awful dilemma indeed for a confirmed and convicted poacher should he give the alarm then and there boldly trusting to his innocence for vindication and helping the police to discover the murderer why that would be sheer suicide no doubt for who but would believe he thought twas me as done it or should he slink away quietly and say nothing leaving others to find the body as best they might that was dangerous enough in its way if anybody saw him but not so dangerous as the other course in an evil hour for his own chances joe harley chose that worse counsel and slank off in his familiar crouching fashion towards the opposite corner of the copse  on the way he heard johns voice holloaing for his master and kept close to the hedge till he had quite turned the corner but john had caught a glimpse of him too and john did not forget it when a few minutes later he came upon the horrid sight beside the gate of selbury copse  meanwhile walter had taken king charlie to the veterinarys and had his leg bound and bandaged securely he had also gone down to the church got out his surplice and begun to put it on in the vestry for evensong when a messenger came at hot haste from the vicarage with news that master walter must come up at once for the vicar was murdered  murdered walter dene said to himself slowly half aloud murdered how horrible murdered it was an ugly word and he turned it over with a genuine thrill of horror that was what they would say of him if ever the thing came to be discovered what an inappropriate classification  he threw aside the surplice and rushed up hurriedly to the vicarage already the servants had brought in the body and laid it out in the clothes it wore on the vicars own bed waltor dene went in shuddering to look at it to his utter amazement the face was battered in horribly and almost unrecognizably by a blow or kick what could that hideous mutilation mean he could not imagine it was an awful mystery great heavens just fancy if any one were to take it into his head that he walter dene had done thathad kicked a defenceless old gentleman brutally about the face like a common london ruffian the idea was too horrible to be borne for a moment it unmanned him utterly and he hid his face between his two hands and sobbed aloud like one brokenhearted this days work has been too much for my nerves he thought to himself between the sobs but perhaps it is just as well i should give way now completely  that night was mainly taken up with the formalities of all such cases and when at last walter dene went off tired and nerveworn to bed about midnight he could not sleep much for thinking of the mystery the murder itself didnt trouble him greatly that was over and past now and he felt sure his precautions had been amply sufficient to protect him even from the barest suspicion but he couldnt fathom the mystery of that battered and mutilated face somebody must have seen the corpse between the time of the murder and the discovery who could that somebody have been and what possible motive could he have had for such a horrible piece of purposeless brutality  as for the servants in solemn conclave in the hall they had unanimously but one theory to account for all the facts some poacher or other for choice joe harley had come across the vicar in the copse with gun and traps in hand the wretch had seen he was discovered had felled the poor old vicar by a blow in the face with the buttend of his rifle and after he fell fainting had stabbed him for greater security in the back that was such an obvious solution of the difficulty that nobody in the servants hall had a moments hesitation in accepting it  when walter heard next morning early that joe harley had been arrested overnight on johns information his horror and surprise at the news were wholly unaffected here was another new difficulty indeed when i did the thing he said to himself i never thought of that possibility i took it for granted it would be a mystery a problem for the local police who of course could no more solve it than they could solve the ponsasinorum but it never struck me they would arrest an innocent person on the charge instead of me this is horrible its so easy to make out a case against a poacher and hang him for it on suspicion ones whole sense of justice revolts against the thing after all theres a great deal to be said in favour of the ordinary commonplace morality it prevents complications a man of delicate sensibilities oughtnt to kill anybody he lets himself in for all kinds of unexpected contingencies without knowing it  at the coroners inquest things looked very black indeed for joe harley walter gave his evidence first showing how he had found king charlie wounded in the lane and then the others gave theirs as to the search for and finding of the body john in particular swore to having seen a mans back and head slinking away by the hedge while they were looking for the vicar and that back and head he felt sure were joe harleys to walters infinite horror and disgust the coroners jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against the poor poacher what other verdict could they possibly have given in accordance with such evidence  the trial of joe harley for the wilful murder of the reverend arthur dene was fixed for the next dorchester assizes in the interval walter dene for the first time in his placid life knew what it was to undergo a mental struggle whatever happened he could not let joe harley be hanged for this murder his whole soul rose up within him in loathing for such an act of hideous injustice for though walter denes code of morality was certainly not the conventional one as he so often boasted to himself he was not by any means without any code of morals of any sort he could commit a murder where he thought it necessary but he could not let an innocent man suffer in his stead his ethical judgment on that point was just as clear and categorical as the judgment which told him he was in duty bound to murder his uncle for walter did not argue with himself on moral questions he perceived the right and necessary thing intuitively he was a law to himself and he obeyed his own law implicitly for good or for evil such men are capable of horrible and diabolically deliberate crimes but they are capable of great and genuine selfsacrifices also  walter made no secret in the village of his disinclination to believe in joe harleys guilt joe was a rough fellow he said certainly and he had no objection to taking a pheasant or two and even to having a free fight with the keepers but after all our game laws were an outrageous piece of class legislation and he could easily understand how the poor whose sense of justice they outraged should be so set against them he could not think joe harley was capable of a detestable crime besides he had seen him himself within a few minutes before and after the murder everybody thought it such a proof of the young parsons generous and kindly disposition he had certainly the charity which thinketh no evil even though his own uncle had been brutally murdered on his own estate he checked his natural feelings of resentment and refused to believe that one of his own parishioners could have been guilty of the crime nay more so anxious was he that substantial justice should be done the accused and so confident was he of his innocence that he promised to provide counsel for him at his own expense and he provided two of the ablest barristers on the western circuit  before the trial walter dene had come after a terrible internal struggle to an awful resolution he would do everything he could for joe harley but if the verdict went against him he was resolved then and there in open court to confess before judge and jury the whole truth it would be a horrible thing for christina he knew that but he could not love christina so much loved he not honour more and honour after his own fashion he certainly loved dearly though he might be false to all that all the world thought right it was ingrained in the very fibre of his soul to be true to his own inner nature at least night after night he lay awake tossing on his bed and picturing to his minds eye every detail of that terrible disclosure the jury would bring in a verdict of guilty then before the judge put on his black cap he walter would stand up and tell them that he could not let another man hang for his crime he would have the whole truth out before them and then he would die for he would have taken a little bottle of poison at the first sound of the verdict as for christinaoh christinawalter dene could not dare to let himself think upon that it was horrible it was unendurable it was torture a thousand times worse than dying but still he must and would face it for in certain phases walter dene forger and murderer as he was could be positively heroic  the day of the trial came and walter dene pale and haggard with much vigil walked in a dream and faintly from his hotel to the courthouse everybody present noticed what a deep effect the shock of his uncles death had had upon him he was thinner and more bloodless than usual and his dulled eyes looked black and sunken in their sockets indeed he seemed to have suffered far more intensely than the prisoner himself who walked in firmer and more erect and took his seat doggedly in the familiar dock he had been there more than once before to say the truth though never before on such an errand yet mere habit when he got there made him at once assume the hangdog look of the consciously guilty  walter sat and watched and listened still in a dream but without once betraying in his face the real depth of his innermost feelings in the body of the court he saw joes wife weeping profusely and ostentatiously after the fashion considered to be correct by her class and though he pitied her from the bottom of his heart he could only think by contrast of christina what were that good womans fears and sorrows by the side of the grief and shame and unspeakable horror he might have to bring upon his christina pray heaven the shock if it came might kill her outright that would at least be better than that she should live long years to remember more than judge or jury or prisoner walter dene saw everywhere behind the visible shadows that thronged the court that one persistent prospective picture of heartbroken christina  the evidence for the prosecution told with damning force against the prisoner he was a notorious poacher the vicar was a gamepreserver he had poached more than once on the ground of the vicarage he was shown by numerous witnesses to have had an animus against the vicar he had been seen not in the face to be sure but still seen and recognized slinking away immediately after the fact from the scene of the murder and the prosecution had found stains of blood believed by scientific experts to be human on the clothing he had worn when he was arrested walter dene listened now with terrible unabated earnestness for he knew that in reality it was he himself who was upon his trial he himself and christinas happiness for if the poacher were found guilty he was firmly resolved beyond hope of respite to tell all and face the unspeakable  the defence seemed indeed a weak and feeble theory somebody unknown had committed the murder and this somebody seen from behind had been mistaken by john for joe harley the bloodstains need not be human as the crossexamination went to show but were only known by counterexperts to be mammalianperhaps a rabbits every poacherand it was admitted that joe was a poacherwas liable to get his clothes bloodstained grant they were human joe it appeared had himself once shot off his little finger all these points came out from the examination of the earlier witnesses at last counsel put the curate himself into the box and proceeded to examine him briefly as a witness for the defence  walter dene stepped pale and haggard still into the witnessbox he had made up his mind to make one final effort for christinas happiness he fumbled nervously all the time at a small glass phial in his pocket but he answered all questions without a moments hesitation and he kept down his emotions with a wonderful composure which excited the admiration of everybody present there was a general hush to hear him did he see the prisoner joseph harley on the day of the murder yes three times when was the first occasion from the library window just before the vicar left the house what was joseph harley then doing walking in the opposite direction from the copse did joseph harley recognize him yes he touched his hat to him when was the second occasion about ten minutes later when he walter was leaving the vicarage for a stroll did joseph harley then recognize him yes he touched his hat again and the curate said good morning joe a fine day for walking when was the third time ten minutes later again when he was returning from the lane carrying wounded little king charlie would it have been physically possible for the prisoner to go from the vicarage to the spot where the murder was committed and back again in the interval between the first two occasions it would not would it have been physically possible for the prisoner to do so in the interval between the second and third occasions it would not  then in your opinion mr dene it is physically impossible that joseph harley can have committed this murder  in my opinion it is physically impossible  while walter dene solemnly swore amid dead silence to this treble lie he did not dare to look joe harley once in the face and while joe harley listened in amazement to this unexpected assistance to his casefor counsel suspecting a mistaken identity had not questioned him too closely on the subjecthe had presence of mind enough not to let his astonishment show upon his stolid features but when walter had finished his evidence in chief he stole a glance at joe and for a moment their eyes met then walters fell in utter selfhumiliation and he said to himself fiercely i would not so have debased and degraded myself before any man to save my own lifewhat is my life worth me after allbut to save christina to save christina to save christina i have brought all this upon myself for christinas sake  meanwhile joe harley was asking himself curiously what could be the meaning of this new move on parsons part it was deliberate perjury joe felt sure for parson could not have mistaken another person for him three times over but what good end for himself could parson hope to gain by it if it was he who had murdered the vicar as joe strongly suspected why did he not try to press the charge home against the first person who happened to be accused instead of committing a distinct perjury on purpose to compass his acquittal joe harley with his simple everyday criminal mind could not be expected to unravel the intricacies of so complex a personality as walter denes but even there on trial for his life he could not help wondering what on earth young parson could be driving at in this business  the judge summed up with the usual luminously obvious alternate platitudes if the jury thought that john had really seen joe harley and that the curate was mistaken in the person whom he thrice saw or was mistaken once only out of the thrice or had miscalculated the time between each occurrence or the time necessary to cover the ground to the gate then they would find the prisoner guilty of wilful murder if on the other hand they believed john had judged hastily and that the curate had really seen the prisoner three separate times and that he had rightly calculated all the intervals then they would find the prisoner not guilty the prisoners case rested entirely upon the alibi supposing they thought there was a doubt in the matter they should give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt walter noticed that the judge said in every other case if you believe the witness soandso but that in his case he made no such discourteous reservation as a matter of fact the one person whose conduct nobody for a moment dreamt of calling in question was the real murderer  the jury retired for more than an hour during all that time two men stood there in mortal suspense intent and haggard both upon their trial but not both equally the prisoner in the dock fixed his arms in a dogged and sullen attitude the colour half gone from his brown cheek and his eyes straining with excitement but showing no outward sign of any emotion except the craven fear of death walter dene stood almost fainting in the body of the court his bloodless fingers still fumbling nervously at the little phial and his face deadly pale with the awful pallor of a devouring horror his heart scarcely beat at all but at each long slow pulsation he could feel it throb distinctly within his bosom he saw or heard nothing before him but kept his aching eyes fixed steadily on the door by which the jury were to enter junior counsel nudged one another to notice his agitation and whispered that that poor young curate had evidently never seen a man tried for his life before  at last the jury entered joe and walter waited each in his own manner breathless for the verdict do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty of wilful murder walter took the little phial from his pocket and held it carefully between his finger and thumb the awful moment had come the next word would decide the fate of himself and christina the foreman of the jury looked up solemnly and answered with slow distinctness not guilty the prisoner leaned back vacantly and wiped his forehead but there was an awful cry of relief from one mouth in the body of the court and walter dene sank back into the arms of the bystanders exhausted with suspense and overcome by the reaction the crowd remarked among themselves that young parson dene was too tenderhearted a man to come into court at a criminal trial he would break his heart to see even a dog hanged let alone his fellowchristians as for joe harley it was universally admitted that he had had a narrow squeak of it and that he had got off better than he deserved the jury gave him the benefit of the doubt  as soon as all the persons concerned had returned to churnside walter sent at once for joe harley the poacher came to see him in the vicarage library he was elated and coarsely exultant with his victory as a relief from the strain he had suffered after the manner of all vulgar natures  joe said the clergyman slowly motioning him into a chair at the other side of the desk i know that after this trial churnside will not be a pleasant place to hold you all your neighbours believe in spite of the verdict that you killed the vicar i feel sure however that you did not commit this murder therefore as some compensation for the suffering of mind to which you have been put i think it well to send you and your wife and family to australia or canada whichever you like best i propose also to make you a present of a hundred pounds to set you up in your new home  make it five hundred passon joe said looking at him significantly  walter smiled quietly and did not flinch in any way i said a hundred he continued calmly and i will make it only a hundred i should have had no objection to making it five except for the manner in which you ask it but you evidently mistake the motive of my gift i give it out of pure compassion for you and not out of any other feeling whatsoever  very well passon said joe sullenly i accept it  you mistake again walter went on blandly for he was himself again now you are not to accept it as terms you are to thank me for it as a pure present i see we two partially understand each other but it is important you should understand me exactly as i mean it joe harley listen to me seriously i have saved your life if i had been a man of a coarse and vulgar nature if i had been like you in a similar predicament i would have pressed the case against you for obvious personal reasons and you would have been hanged for it but i did not press it because i felt convinced of your innocence and my sense of justice rose irresistibly against it i did the best i could to save you i risked my own reputation to save you and i have no hesitation now in telling you that to the best of my belief if the verdict had gone against you the person who really killed the vicar accidentally or intentionally meant to have given himself up to the police rather than let an innocent man suffer  passon said joe harley looking at him intently i believe as youre tellin me the truth i zeen as much in that persons face afore the verdict  there was a solemn pause for a moment and then walter dene said slowly now that you have withdrawn your claim as a claim i will stretch a point and make it five hundred it is little enough for what you have suffered but i too have suffered terribly terribly  thank you passon joe answered i zeen as you were turble anxious  there was again a moments pause then walter dene asked quietly how did the vicars face come to be so bruised and battered  i stumbled up agin im accidental like and didnt know id kicked un till id done it must a been just a few minutes after youd a left un  joe said the curate in his calmest tone you had better go the money will be sent to you shortly but if you ever see my face again or speak or write a word of this to me you shall not have a penny of it but shall be prosecuted for intimidation a hundred before you leave four hundred in australia now go  very well passon joe answered and he went  pah said the curate with a face of disgust shutting the door after him and lighting a perfumed pastille in his little chinese porcelain incenseburner as if to fumigate the room from the poachers offensive presence pah to think that these affairs should compel one to humiliate and abase ones self before a vulgar clod like that to think that all his life long that fellow will virtually knowand misinterpretmy secret he is incapable of understanding that i did it as a duty to christina well he will never dare to tell it thats certain for nobody would believe him if he did and he may congratulate himself heartily that hes got well out of this difficulty it will be the luckiest thing in the end that ever happened to him and now i hope this little episode is finally over  when the churnside public learned that walter dene meant to carry his belief in joe harleys innocence so far as to send him and his family at his own expense out to australia they held that the young parsons charity and guilelessness was really as the doctor said almost quixotic and when in his anxiety to detect and punish the real murderer he offered a reward of five hundred pounds from his own pocket for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the criminal the churnside people laughed quietly at his extraordinary childlike simplicity of heart the real murderer had been caught and tried at dorchester assizes they said and had only got off by the skin of his teeth because walter himself had come forward and sworn to a quite improbable and inconclusive alibi there was plenty of time for joe to have got to the gate by the short cut and that he did so everybody at churnside felt morally certain indeed a few years later a bloodstained bowieknife was found in the hedge not far from the scene of the murder and the gamekeeper could almost a took his bible oath hed zeen just such a knife along o joe harley  that was not the end of walter denes quixotisms however when the will was read it turned out that almost everything was left to the young parson and who could deserve it better or spend it more charitably but walter though he would not for the world seem to cast any slight or disrespect upon his dear uncles memory did not approve of customs of primogeniture and felt bound to share the estate equally with his brother arthur strange said the head of the firm of watson and blenkiron to himself when he read the little paragraph about this generous conduct in the paper i thought the instructions were to leave it to his nephew arthur not to his nephew walter but there one forgets and confuses names of people that one does not know so easily gracious goodness thought the engrossing clerk surely it was the other way on i wonder if i can have gone and copied the wrong names in the wrong places but in a big london business nobody notes these things as they would have been noted in churnside the vicar was always a changeable pernickety huffy old fellow and very likely he had had a reverse will drawn up afterwards by his country lawyer all the world only thought that walter denes generosity was really almost ridiculous even in a parson when he was married to christina six months afterwards everybody said so charming a girl was well mated with so excellent and admirable a husband  and he really did make a very tender and loving husband and father christina believed in him always for he did his best to foster and keep alive her faith he would have given up active clerical duty if he could never having liked it for he was above hypocrisy but christina was against the project and his bishop would not hear of it the church could ill afford to lose such a man as mr dene the bishop said in these troubled times and he begged him as a personal favour to accept the living of churnside which was in his gift but walter did not like the place and asked for another living instead which being of less valueso like mr dene to think nothing of the temporalitiesthe bishop even more graciously granted he has since published a small volume of dainty little poems on uncut paper considered by some critics as rather pagan in tone for a clergyman but universally allowed to be extremely graceful the perfection of poetical form with much delicate mastery of poetical matter and everybody knows that the author is almost certain to be offered the first vacant canonry in his own cathedral as for the little episode he himself has almost forgotten all about it for those who think a murderer must feel remorse his whole life long are trying to read their own emotional nature into the wholly dispassionate character of walter dene     an episode in high life   sir henry vardon kcb electrician to the admiralty whose title as everybody knows was gazetted some six weeks since is at this moment the youngest living member of the british knighthood he is now only just thirty and he has obtained his present high distinction by those remarkable inventions of his in the matter of electrical signalling and lighthouse arrangements which have been so much talked about in nature this year and which gained him the gold medal of the royal society in 1881 lady vardon is one of the youngest and prettiest hostesses in london and if you would care to hear the history of their courtship here it is  when harry vardon left oxford only seven years ago none of his friends could imagine what he meant by throwing up all his chances of university success the son of a poor country parson in devonshire who had strained his little income to the uttermost to send him to college vardon of magdalen had done credit to his father and himself in all the schools he gained the best demyship of his year got a first in classical mods and then unaccountably took to reading science in which he carried everything before him at the end of his four years he walked into a scientific fellowship at balliol as a matter of course and then after twelve months residence he suddenly surprised the world of oxford by accepting a tutorship to the young earl of surrey at that time as you doubtless remember a minor aged about sixteen  but harry vardon had good reasons of his own for taking this tutorship six months after he became a fellow of balliol the old vicar had died unexpectedly leaving his only other child edith alone and unprovided for as was indeed natural for the expenses of harrys college life had quite eaten up the meagre savings of twenty years at little hinton in order to provide a home for edith it was necessary that harry should find something or other to do which would bring in an immediate income schoolmastering that refuge of the destitute graduate was not much to his mind and so when the senior tutor of boniface wrote a little note to ask whether he would care to accept the charge of a cub nobleman as he disrespectfully phrased it harry jumped at the offer and took the proposed salary of 400l a year with the greatest alacrity that would far more than suffice for all ediths simple needs and he himself could live upon the proceeds of his fellowship besides finding time to continue his electrical researches for i will not disguise the fact that harry only accepted the cub nobleman as a stopgap and that he meant even then to make his fortune in the end by those splendid electrical discoveries which will undoubtedly immortalize his name in future ages  it was summer term when the appointment was made and the surrey people who were poor for their station had just gone down to colyford abbey the family seat in the valley of the axe near seaton you have visited the house i dare sayopen to visitors every tuesday when the family is absenta fine somewhat modernized mansion with some good perpendicular work about it still in spite of the havoc wrought in it by inigo jones who converted the chapel and refectory of the old cistercians into a banquetinghall and ballroom for the first lord surrey of the present creation it was lovely weather when harry vardon went down there and the abbey and the terrace and the park and the beautiful valley beyond were looking their very best harry fell in love with the view at once and almost fell in love with the inmates too at the first glance  lady surrey the mother was sitting on a garden seat in front of the house as the carriage which met him at colyford station drove up to the door she was much younger and more beautiful than harry had at all expected he had pictured the dowager to himself as a stately old lady of sixty with white hair and a grand manner instead of which he found himself face to face with a wellpreserved beauty of something less than forty not above medium height and still strikingly pretty in a roundfaced mature but very delicate fashion she had wavy chestnut hair regular features an exquisite set of pearly teeth full cheeks whose natural roses were perhaps just a trifle increased by not wholly ungraceful art and above all a lovely complexion quite unspoilt as yet by years she was dressed as such a person should be dressed with no affectation of girlishness but in the style that best shows off ripe beauty and a womanly figure harry was always a very impressionable fellow and i really believe that if lady surrey had been alone he would have fallen over head and ears in love with her at first sight  but there was something which kept him from falling in love at once with lady surrey and that was the girl who sat half reclining on a tigerskin at her feet with a little sketching tablet on her lap he could hardly take full stock of the mother because he was so busy looking at the daughter as well i shall not attempt to describe lady gladys durant all pretty girls fall under one of some halfdozen heads and description at best can really do no more than classify them lady gladys belonged to the tall and graceful aristocratic class and she was a good specimen of the type at seventeen not that harry vardon fell in love with her at once he was really in the pleasing condition of captain macheath too much engaged in looking at two pretty women to be capable even mentally of making a choice between them mother and daughter were both almost equally beautiful each in her own distinct style  the countess half rose to greet himit is condescension on the part of a countess to notice the tutor at all i believe but though i am no lover of lords myself i will do the durants the justice to say that their treatment of harry was always the very kindliest that could possibly be expected from people of their ideas and traditions  mr vardon she said interrogatively as she held out her hand to the new tutor harry bowed assent im glad you have such a lovely day to make your first acquaintance with colyford its a pretty place isnt it gladys this is mr vardon who is kindly going to take charge of surrey for us  im afraid you dont know what youre going to undertake said gladys smiling and holding out her hand hes a dreadful pickle do you know this part of the world before mr vardon  not just hereabouts harry answered my fathers parish was in north devon but i know the greater part of the county very well  thats a good thing said gladys quickly were all devonshire people here and we believe in the county with all our hearts i wish surrey took his title from it its so absurd to take your title from a place you dont care about only because youve got land there i love devonshire people best of any  mr vardon would probably like to see his rooms said the countess parker will you show him up  the rooms were everything that harry could wish there was a prettily furnished sittingroom for himself on the front looking across the terrace with a view of the valley and the sea in the distance there was a study next door for tutor and pupil to work in there was a cheerful little bedroom behind and downstairs at the back there was the large bare room for which harry had specially stipulated wherein to put his electrical apparatus for he meant to experiment and work busily at his own subject in his spare time there was a special servant too told off to wait upon him and altogether harry felt that if only the social position could be made endurable he could live very comfortably for a year or two at colyford abbey  there are some men who could never stand such a life at all there are others who can stand it because they can stand anything but harry vardon belonged to neither class he was one of those who feel at home in most places and who can get on in all society alike in the first place he was one of the handsomest fellows you ever saw with large dark eyes and that particular black moustache that no woman can ever resist then again he was tall and had a good presence which impressed even those most dangerous of critics for a private tutor the footmen moreover he was clever chatty and agreeable and it never entered into his head that he was not conferring some distinction upon the surrey family by consenting to be teacher to their young lordlingwhich indeed was after all the sober fact  the train was in a little before seven and there was a bit of a drive from the station so that harry had only just had time to dress for dinner when the gong sounded in the drawingroom he met his future pupil a goodlooking highspirited but evidently lazy boy of sixteen the family was alone so the earl took down his mother while harry gave his arm to lady gladys before dinner was over the new tutor had taken the measure of the trio pretty accurately the countess was clever that was certain she took an interest in books and in art and she could talk lightly but well upon most current topics in the easy sparkling style of a woman of the world gladys was clever too though not booky she was full of sketching and music and was delighted to hear that harry could paint a little in watercolours besides being the owner of a good violin as to the boy his fancy clearly ran for the most part to dogs guns and cricket and indeed though he was no doubt a very important person as a future member of the british legislature i think for the purposes of the present story which is mainly concerned with harry vardons fortunes we may safely leave him out of consideration harry taught him as much as he could be induced to learn for an hour or two every morning and looked after him as far as possible when he was anywhere within hearing throughout the rest of the day but as the lad was almost always out around the place somewhere with a gamekeeper or a stableboy he hardly entered practically into the current of harrys life at all outside the regular hours of study as a matter of fact he never learnt much from anybody or did anything worth speaking of but he has since married a birmingham heiress with a million or so of her own and is now one of the most rising young members of the house of lords  after dinner the countess showed harry her excellent collection of bartolozzis and harry who knew something about them showed the countess that she was wrong as to the authenticity of one or two among them then gladys played passably well and he sang a duet with her in a way that made her feel a little ashamed of her own singing and lastly harry brought down his violin at which the countess smiled a little for she thought it audacious on the first evening but when he played one of his best pieces she smiled again for she had a good ear and a great deal of taste after which they all retired to bed and gladys remarked to her maid in the privacy of her own room that the new tutor was a very pleasant man and quite a relief after such a stick as mr wilkinson  at breakfast next morning the party remained unchanged but at lunch the two younger girls appeared upon the scene with their governess miss martindale though very different in type from gladys ethel martindale was in her way an equally pretty girl she was small and mignonne with delicate little hands and a light pretty figure not too slight but very gracefully proportioned her cheeks and chin were charmingly dimpled and her complexion was just of that faintlydark tinge that one sees so often combined with lightbrown hair and eyes in the moorland parts of lancashire altogether she was a perfect foil to gladys and it would have been difficult for almost any man as he sat at that table to say which of the three mother daughter or governess was really the prettiest for my own part i give my vote unreservedly for the countess but then i am getting somewhat grizzled now and have long been bald so my liking turns naturally towards ripe beauty i hate your selfconscious chits of seventeen who can only chat and giggle i like a woman who has something to say for herself but harry was just turned twentythree and perhaps his choice might not unnaturally have gone otherwise  the governess talked little at lunch and seemed altogether a rather subdued and timid girl harry noticed with pain that she appeared half afraid of speaking to anybody and also that the footmen made a marked distinction between their manner to him and their manner to her he would have liked once or twice to kick the fellows for their insolence after lunch gladys and the little ones went for a stroll down towards the river and harry followed after with miss martindale  do you come from this part of england he asked  no answered ethel i come from lancashire my father was rector of a small parish on the moors  harrys heart smote him it might have been edith what a little turn of chance had made all the difference my father was a parson too he said and then checked himself for the halfdisrespectful word but he lived down here in devonshire do you like colyford  oh yesthe place very much there are delightful rambles and lady gladys and i go out sketching a great deal and its a delightful country for flowers  the place but not the life thought harry poor child it must be very hard for her  mr vardon come on here i want you called out gladys from the little stone bridge you know everything can you tell me what this flower is and she held out a long spray of waving greenstuff  caper spurge said harry looking at it carelessly  oh no miss martindale put in quickly portland spurge surely  so it is harry answered looking closer then you are a bit of a botanist miss martindale  not a botanist but very fond of the flowers  miss martindales always picking lots of ugly things and bringing them home said gladys laughingly arent you dear  ethel smiled and nodded so they went on past the bridge and out upon the opposite side and back again by the little white railings into the park  for the next three months harry enjoyed himself in a busy way immensely every morning he had his three hours teaching and every afternoon he went a walk or fished in the river or worked at his electrical machines to the household at the abbey such a man was a perfect godsend for he was a versatile fellow able to turn his hand to anything and the durants lived in a very quiet way and were glad of somebody to keep the house lively the money was all tied up till the boy came of age and even then there wouldnt be much of it surrey had been sent to eton for a month or two and then removed by request to prevent more violent measures after which he was sent to two or three other schools always with the same result so he was brought home again and handed over to the domestic persuasion of a private tutor the only thing that kept him moderately quiet was the possibility of running around the place with the keepers and the only person who ever taught him anything was harry vardon though even he i must admit did not succeed in impressing any very valuable lessons upon the lads volatile brain the countess saw few visitors and so a man like harry was a real acquisition to the little circle he was perpetually being wanted by everybody everywhere and at the end of three months he was simply indispensable  lady surrey was always consulting him as to the proper place to plant the new wellingtonias the right aspect for deodars the best plan for mounting watercolours and the correct date of all the neighbouring churches it was so delightful to drive about with somebody who really understood the history and geology and antiquities of the county she said and she began to develop an extraordinary interest in prehistoric archæology and to listen patiently to harrys disquisitions on the difference between long barrows and round barrows or on the true nature of the earthworks that cap the top of membury hill harry for his part was quite ready to discourse volubly on all these subjects for it was his hobby to impart information whereof he had plenty and he liked knocking about the country examining castles or churches and laying down the law about matters architectural with much authority to two pretty women the countess even took an interest in his great electrical investigation and came into his workshop to hear all about the uses of his mysterious batteries as for lady gladys she was for ever wanting mr vardons opinion about the exact colour for that shadow by the cottage mr vardons aid in practising that difficult bit of chopin mr vardons counsel about the decorative treatment of the passionflower on that lovely piece of crewelwork indeed contrary to miss martindales express admonition and all the dictates of propriety she was always running off to harrys little sittingroom to ask his advice about five hundred different things five hundred times in every twentyfour hours  there was only one person in the household who seemed at all shy of harry and that was miss martindale do what he could he could never get her to feel at home with him she seemed always anxious to keep out of his way and never ready to join in any of his plans this was annoying because harry really liked the poor girl and felt sorry for her lonely position but as she would have nothing to say to him why there was nothing else to be done so he contented himself with being as polite to her as possible while respecting her evident wish to be let alone  one afternoon when the four had been out for a drive together to visit the old ruins near cowhayne and harry had been sketching with gladys and lecturing to the countess to his hearts content he was sitting on the bench by the red cedars when to his surprise he saw the governess strolling carelessly across the terrace towards him mr vardon she said standing beside the bench i want to say something to you you mustnt mind my saying it but i feel it is part of my duty do you think you ought to pay so much attention to gladys you and i come into a family of this sort on peculiar terms you know they dont think we are quite the same sort of human beings as themselves now im half afraidi dont like to say so but i think it better i should say it than my ladyim half afraid that gladys is getting her head too much filled with you whatever she does you are always helping her she is for ever running off to see you about something or other she is very young she meets very few other men and you have been extremely attentive to her but when people like these admit you into their family they do so on the tacit understanding that you will not do what they would call abusing the position today i half fancied that my lady looked at you once or twice when you were talking to gladys and i thought i would try to be brave enough to speak to you about it if i dont i think she will  really miss martindale said harry rising and walking by her side towards the laburnum alley im very glad you have unburdened your mind about this matter for myself you know i dont acknowledge the obligation i should marry any girl i liked if she would have me whatever her artificial position might be and i should never let any barriers of that sort stand in my way but i dont know that i have the slightest intention of ever trying to marry lady gladys or anybody else of the sort so while i remain undecided on that point i shall do as you wish me by the way it strikes me now that you have been trying to keep her away from me as much as possible  as part of my duty i think i ought to do so yes  well you may rely upon it i will give you no more cause for anxiety said harry so the less we say about it the better what a lovely sunset and what a glorious colour on the cliffs at axmouth and he walked down the alley with her two or three times talking about various indifferent subjects somehow he had never managed to get on so well with her before she was a very nice girl he thought really a very nice girl what a pity she would never take any notice of him in any way however he enjoyed that quiet halfhour immensely and was quite sorry when lady surrey came out a little later and joined them exactly as if she wanted to interrupt their conversation but what a beautiful woman lady surrey was too as she came across the lawn just then in her garden hat and the pale blue umritzur shawl thrown loosely across her shapely shoulders by jove she was as handsome a woman after all as he had ever seen  after dinner that evening lady surrey sent gladys off to miss martindales room on some small pretext and then put harry down on the sofa beside her to help in arranging those interminable ferns of hers evening dress suited the countess best and she knew it she was looking even more beautiful than before with her hair prettily dressed and the little simple turquoise necklet setting off her white neck and she talked a great deal to harry and was really very charming no more fascinating widow he thought to be found anywhere within a hundred miles at last she stopped leaning over the ferns and sat back a little on the sofa half fronting him mr vardon she said suddenly there is something i wish to speak to you about privately  certainly said harry half expecting the topic  do you know i think you ought not to pay such marked attention to lady gladys two or three times i have fancied i noticed it and have meant to mention it to you but i thought it might be unnecessary on many accounts however i think it is best not to let it pass any longer the difference of station  excuse me said harry im sorry to differ from you but i dont acknowledge differences of station  well said the countess in a conciliatory tone under certain circumstances that may be perfectly correct a young man in your position and with your talents has of course the whole world before him he can make himself whatever he pleases i dont think mr vardon i have ever underestimated the worth of brains i do feel that knowledge and culture are much greater things after all than mere position now in justice to me dont you think i do  harry looked at hershe was really a very beautiful womanand then said yes i think you have certainly better and more rational tastes than most other people circumstanced as you are  im so glad you do the countess answered heartily i dont care for a life of perfect frivolity and fashion such as one gets in london if it were not for gladyss sake i sometimes think i would give it up entirely do you know i often wish my life had been cast very differentlycast among another set of people from the people i have always mixed among whenever i meet clever peopleliterary people and scholarsi always feel so sorry i havent moved all my life in their world from one point of view i quite recognize what you said just now that these artificial distinctions should not exist between people who are really equals in intellect and culture  naturally not said harry to whom this proposition sounded like a familiar truism  but in lady gladyss case i feel i ought to guard her against seeing too much of anybody in particular just at present she is only seventeen and she is of course impressionable now you know a great many mothers would not have spoken to you as i do but i like you mr vardon and i feel at home with you you will promise me not to pay so much attention to gladys in future wont you  as she looked at him full in the face with her beautiful eyes harry felt he could just then have promised her anything yes he said i will promise  thank you said the countess looking at him again i am very much obliged to you and then for a moment there was an awkward pause and they both looked full into one anothers eyes without saying a word  in a minute the countess began again and said a good many things about what a dreadful waste of life people generally made and what a privilege it was to know clever people and what a reality and purpose there was in their lives a great deal of this sort she said and in a low pleasant voice and then there was another awkward pause and they looked at one another once more  harry certainly thought the countess very beautiful and he liked her very much she was really kindhearted and friendly she was interested in the subjects that pleased him and she was after all a pretty woman still young as men count youth and very agreeablenay anxious to please and then she had said what she said about the artificiality of class distinctions so markedly and pointedly with such a commentary from her eyes that harry half fanciedwell i dont quite know what he fancied as he sat there beside her on the sofa with the ferns before him looking straight into her eyes and she into his it must be clear to all my readers that if he had any special proposition to make to her on any abstract subject of human speculation the time had obviously arrived to make it but something or other inscrutable kept him back lady surrey he said and the words stuck in his throat  yes she answered softly shall  shall we go on with the ferns lady surrey gave a little short breath brought back her eyes from dreamland and turned with a sudden smile back to the portfolio for the rest of the evening the candid historian must admit that they both felt like a pair of fools conversation lagged and i dont think either of them was sorry when the time came for retiring  it is useless for the clumsy male psychologist to pretend that he can see into the heart of a woman especially when the normal action of said heart is complicated by such queer conventionalities as that of a countess who feels a distinct liking for her sons tutor but if i may venture to attempt that impossible feat of clairvoyance without rebuke i should be inclined to diagnose lady surreys condition as she lay sleepless for an hour or so on her pillow that night somewhat as follows she thought that harry vardon was really a very clever and a very pleasant fellow she thought that men in society were generally dreadfully emptyheaded and horribly vain she thought that the importance of disparity in age had as a rule been immensely overrated she thought that rank was after all much less valuable than she used to think it when first she married poor dear surrey who was really the kindest of men and a thorough gentleman but certainly not at all brilliant she thought that a young man of harrys talent might if well connected get into parliament and rise like beaconsfield to any position she thought he was very frank and open and gentlemanly and very handsome too she thought he had half hesitated whether he should propose to her or not and had then drawn back because he was not certain of the consequences she thought that if he had proposed to herwell perhapswhy yes she might even possibly have accepted him she thought he would probably propose in earnest before long as soon as he saw that she was not wholly averse to his attentions she thought in that case she might perhaps provisionally accept him and get him to try what he could do in the way of obtaining some sort of positionshe didnt exactly know whatwhere he could more easily marry her with the least possible shock to the feelings of society and she thought that she really didnt know before for twenty years at least how great a goose she positively was  next morning after breakfast lady surrey sent for gladys to come to her in her boudoir then she put her daughter in a chair by the window drew her own close to it laid her hand kindly on her shouldershe was a nice little woman at heart was the countessand said to her gently my dear gladys theres a little matter i want to talk to you about you are still very young you know dear and i think you ought to be very careful about not letting your feelings be played upon in any way however unconsciously now you walk and talk a great deal too much dear with mr vardon in many ways it would be well that you should mr vardon is very clever and very well informed and a very instructive companion i like you to talk to intelligent people and to hear intelligent people talk it gives you something that mere books can never give but you know gladys you should always remember the disparity in your stations i dont deny that theres a great deal in all that sort of thing thats very conventional and absurd my dear but still girls are girls and if theyre thrown too much with any one young manlady surrey was going to add especially when hes handsome and agreeable but she checked herself in timetheyre very apt to form an affection for him of course im not suggesting that youre likely to do anything of the sort with mr vardoni dont for a moment suppose you wouldbut a girl can never be too careful i hope you know your position too well here lady surrey was conscious of certain internal qualms and indeed whether it was mr vardon or anybody else you are much too young to fill your head with such notions at your age of course if some really good offer had been made to you even in your first seasonsay lord st ives or sir montaguei dont say it might not have been prudent to accept it but under ordinary circumstances a girl does best to think as little as possible about such things until she is twenty at least however i hope in future youll remember that i dont wish you to be quite so familiar in your intercourse with mr vardon  very well mamma said gladys quietly drawing herself up i have heard what you want to say and i shall try to do as you wish but i should like to say something in return if youll be so kind as to listen to me  certainly darling lady surrey answered with a vague foreboding of something wrong  i dont say i care any more for mr vardon than for anybody else i havent seen enough of him to know whether i care for him or not but if ever i do care for anybody it will be for somebody like him and not for somebody like lord st ives or monty fitzroy i dont like the men i meet in town they all talk to us as if we were dolls or babies i dont want to marry a man who says to himself as surrey says already ah i shall look out for some rich girl or other and make her a countess if shes a good girl and if she suits me id rather have a man like mr vardon than any of the men we ever meet in london  but my darling said lady surrey quite alarmed at gladys too serious tone surely there are gentlemen quite as clever and quite as intellectual as mr vardon  mamma cried gladys rising do you mean to say mr vardon is not a gentleman  gladys gladys sit down dear dont get so excited of course he is i trust i have as great a respect as anybody for talent and culture but what i meant to say was thiscant you find as much talent and culture among people of our own station asas among people of mr vardons  no said gladys shortly  really my dear you are too hard upon the peerage  well mamma can you mention any one that we know who is asked the peremptory girl  not exactly in our own set said lady surrey hesitatingly but surely there must be some  i dont know them gladys replied quietly and till i do know them i shall remain of my own opinion still if you wish me not to see so much of mr vardon i shall try to do as you say but if i happen to like any particular person whether hes a peer or a ploughboy i cant help liking him so theres an end of it and gladys kissed her mother demurely on the forehead and walked with a stately sweep out of the room  its perfectly clear said lady surrey to herself that that girls in love with mr vardon and what on earth im to do about it is to me a mystery and indeed lady surreys position was by no means an easy one on the one hand she felt that whatever she herself who was a person of mature years might happen to do it would be positively wicked in her to allow a young girl like gladys to throw herself away on a man in harry vardons position without any shadow of an arrière pensée that was her genuine feeling as a mother and a member of society but then on the other hand how could she oppose it if she really ever thought herself even conditionally of marrying harry vardon could she endure that her daughter should think she had acted as her rival could she press the point about harrys conventional disadvantages when she herself had some vague idea that if harry offered himself as gladys stepfather she would not be wholly disinclined to consider his proposal could she set it down as a crime in her daughter to form the very selfsame affection which she herself had wellnigh formed moreover she couldnt help feeling in her heart that gladys was right after all and that the daughters defiance of conventionality was implicitly inherited from the mother if she had met harry vardon twenty years ago she would have thought and spoken much like gladys in fact though she didnt speak she thought so very nearly even now i am sorry that i am obliged to write out these faint outlines of ideas in all the brutal plainness of the english language as spoken by men i cannot give all those fine shades of unspoken reservations and womanly selfdeceptive subterfuges by which the poor little countess half disguised her own meaning even from herself but at least you will not be surprised to hear that in the end she lay down on the little couch in the corner covered her face with chagrin and disappointment and had a good cry then she got up an hour later washed her eyes carefully to take off the redness put on her pretty dovecoloured morning gown with the lace trimmingshe looked charming in laceand went down smiling to lunch as pleasant and cheery a little widow of thirtyseven as ever you would wish to see upon my soul harry vardon i really almost think you will be a fool if you dont finally marry the countess  gladys said little lord surrey to his sister that evening when she came into his room on her way upstairs to bedgladys its my opinion youre getting too sweet on this fellow vardon  i shall be obliged surrey if youll mind your own business and allow me to mind mine  oh its no use coming the high and mighty over me i can tell you so dont you try it on besides i have something i want to speak to you about particularly its my opinion also that my ladys doing the very same thing  what nonsense surrey cried gladys colouring up to her eyebrows in a second how dare you say such a thing about mamma but a light broke in upon her suddenly all the same and a number of little unnoticed circumstances flashed back at once upon her memory with a fresh flood of meaning  nonsense or not its true i know and what i want to say to you is thisif old vardons to marry either of you it ought to be you because that would save mamma at any rate from making a fool of herself as far as im concerned id rather neither of you did for i dont see why either of you should want to marry a beggarly fellow of a tutorgladys eyes flashed firethough vardons a decent enough chap in his way if that was all but at any rate as one or other of yous cocksure to do it i dont want him for a stepfather so you see as far as that goes i back the filly now say no more about it but go to bed like a good girl and mind whatever you do you dont forget to say your prayers good night old girl  i wouldnt marry a fellow like surrey said gladys to herself as she went upstairs no not if he was the premier duke of england  for the next three weeks there was such a comedy of errors and crosspurposes at colyford abbey as was never seen before anywhere outside of one of mr gilberts clever extravaganzas lady surrey tried to keep gladys in every possible way out of harrys sight while her brother tried in every possible way to throw them together gladys on her part half avoided him and yet grew somewhat more confidential than ever whenever she happened to talk with him harry did not feel quite so much at home as before with lady surrey he had an uncomfortable sense that he had failed to acquit himself as he ought to have done while lady surrey had a half suspicion that she had let him see her unfledged secret a little too early and too openly the natural consequence of all this was that harry was cast far more than before upon the society of ethel martindale with whom he often strolled about the shrubbery till very close upon the dressing gong ethel did not come down to dinnershe dined with the little ones at the family luncheon and that horrid galling distinction cut harry to the quick every night when he left her to go in every day too it began to dawn upon him more clearly that the vague reason which had kept him back from proposing to lady surrey on that eventful night was just thisthat ethel martindale had made herself a certain vacant niche in his unfurnished heart she was a dear quiet unassuming little girl but so very graceful so very tender so very womanly that she crept into his affections unawares without possibility of resistance the countess was a beautiful and accomplished woman of the world with a real heart left in her still but not quite the sort of tender shrinking girlish heart that harry wanted gladys was a lovely girl with stately manners and a wonderfully formed character but too great and too redolent of society for harry he admired them both each in her own way but he couldnt possibly have lived a lifetime with either but ethel dear meek pretty gentle little ethelwell there im not going to repeat for you all the raptures that harry went into over that perennial and ever rejuvenescent theme for to tell you the truth about three weeks after the night when harry did not propose to the countess he actually did propose to ethel martindale and ethel after many timid protests after much demure selfdepreciation and declaration of utter unworthiness for such a manwhich made harry wild with indignationdid finally let him put her little hand to his lips and whispered a sort of broken and blushing yes  what a fool he had been he thought that evening to suppose for half a second that lady surrey had ever meant to regard him in any other light than as her sons tutor he hated himself for his own nonsensical vanity who was he that he should fancy all the women in england were in love with him  next mornings times contained that curious announcement about its being the intention of the government to appoint an electrician to the admiralty and inviting applications from distinguished men of science now harry young as he was had just perfected his great system of the doublerevolving commutator and backaction rheostat patent office no 18237504 and had sent in a paper on the subject which had been read with great success at the royal society the famous professor brusegay himself had described it as a remarkable invention likely to prove of immense practical importance to telegraphy and electrical science generally so when harry saw the announcement that morning he made up his mind to apply for the appointment at once and he thought that if he got it as the salary was a good one he might before long marry ethel and yet manage to keep edith in the same comfort as before  lady surrey saw the paragraph too and had her own ideas about what it might be made to do it was the very opening that harry wanted and if he got it why then no doubt he might make the proposal which he evidently felt afraid to make poor fellow in his present position so she went into her boudoir immediately after breakfast and wrote two careful and cautiously worded little notes one was to dr brusegay whom she knew well mentioning to him that her sons tutor was the author of that remarkable paper on commutators and that she thought he would probably be admirably fitted for the post but that on that point the professor himself was the best judge the other was to her cousin lord ardenleigh who was a great man in the government of the day suggesting casually that he should look into the claims of her friend mr vardon for this new place at the admiralty two nicer little notes written with better tact and judgment it would be difficult to find  at that very moment harry was also sitting down in his own room after five minutes consultation with ethel to make formal application for the new post and after lunch the same day he spoke to lady surrey upon the subject  there is one special reason he said why i should like to get this post and i think i ought to let you know it now poor little lady surreys heart fluttered like a girls the fact is i am anxious to obtain a position which would enable me to marry how very bluntly he puts it said the countess to herself i ought to tell you i think that i have proposed to miss martindale and she has accepted me  miss martindale great heavens how the room reeled round the poor little woman as she stood with her hand on the table trying to balance herself trying to conceal her shame and mortification trying to look as if the announcement did not concern her in any way poor dear good little countess from my heart i pity you miss martindale why she had never even thought of her a mere governess a nobody and harry vardon with his magnificent intellect and splendid prospects was going to throw himself away on that girl she could hardly control herself to answer him but with a great effort she gulped down her feelings and remarked that ethel martindale was a very good girl and would doubtless make an admirable wife and then she walked quietly out of the room stepped up the stairs somewhat faster rushed into her boudoir doublelocked the door and burst into a perfect flood of hot scalding tears at that moment she began to realize the fact that she had in truth liked harry vardon much more than a little  byandby she got up went over to her desk took out the two unposted notes tore them into fragments and then carefully burnt them up piece by piece in a perfect holocaust of white paper what a wicked vindictive little countess was she going to spoil these two young peoples lives to throw every possible obstacle in the way of their marriage not a bit of it as soon as her eyes allowed her she sat down and wrote two more notes a great deal stronger and better than before for this time she need not fear the possibility of after reflections from an unkind world she said a great deal in a casual halfhinting fashion about harrys merits and remarked upon the loss that she should sustain in the removal of such a tutor from lord surrey but she felt that sooner or later his talents must get him a higher recognition and she hoped dr brusegay and her cousin would use their influence to obtain him the appointment then she went downstairs feeling like a christian martyr kissed and congratulated ethel talked gaily about bartolozzi to harry and tried to make believe that she took the engagement as a matter of course nothing in fact as she remarked to gladys could possibly be more suitable gladys bit her tongue and answered shortly that she didnt herself perceive any special natural congruity about the match but perhaps her mother was better informed on the subject  now we all know that in the matter of public appointment anything like backstairs influence or indirect canvassing is positively fatal to the success of a candidate accordingly it may surprise you to learn that when professor brusegay who held the appointment virtually in his hands opened his letters next morning he said to his wife why maria that young fellow vardon who wrote that astonishingly clever paper on commutators you know is tutor at lady surreys and she wants him to get this place at the admiralty we must really see what we can do about it lady surrey is such a very useful person to know and besides its so important to keep on good terms with her for the paulsons would be absolutely intolerable if we hadnt its acquaintance in the peerage to play off against their lord poodlebury and when the professor shortly afterwards mentioned harrys name to lord ardenleigh his lordship remarked immediately why bless my soul thats the very man amelia wrote to me about he shall have the place by all means and they both wrote back nice little notes to lady surrey to say that she might consider the matter settled but that she mustnt mention it to harry until the appointment was regularly announced anything so remarkable in this age of purity i for my part have seldom heard of  lady surrey never did mention the matter to harry from that day to this and sir henry vardon kcb does not for a moment imagine even now that he owes his advancement to anything but his own native merits he married ethel shortly after and a prettier or more blushing bride you never saw lady surrey has been their best friend in society and still sighs occasionally when she sees harry a great magnate in his way and thinks of the narrow escape he had that night at colyford as to gladys she consistently refused several promising heirs at least twenty younger sons and a score or so of wealthy young men whose papas were something in the city her first five seasons and then to lord surreys horror she married a young scotchman from glasgow who was merely a writer for some london paper and had nothing on earth but a head on his shoulders to bless himself with his lordship himself bagged an heiress as he expressively puts it with several thousands a year of her own and is now one of the most respected members of his party who may be counted upon always to vote straight and never to have any opinions of his own upon any subject except the improvement of the british racehorse he often wishes gladys had taken his advice and married vardon who is at least in respectable society instead of that shockheaded scotch fellowbut there the girl was always full of fancies and never would behave like other people  for myself i am a horrid radical and republican and all that sort of thing and have a perfectly rabid hatred of titles and so forth dont you knowbut still on the first day when ethel went to call on the countess dowager after harry was knighted i happened to be present purely on business and heard her duly announced as lady vardon and i give you my word of honour i could not find it in my heart to grudge the dear little woman the flush of pride that rose upon her cheek as she entered the room for the first time in her new position it was a pleasure to me who know the whole story to see lady surrey kiss the little exgoverness warmly on her cheek and say to her my dear lady vardon i am so glad so very very glad and i really believe she meant it after all in spite of her little weakness there is a great deal of human nature left in the countess     my new years eve among the mummies   i have been a wanderer and a vagabond on the face of the earth for a good many years now and i have certainly had some odd adventures in my time but i can assure you i never spent twentyfour queerer hours than those which i passed some twelve months since in the great unopened pyramid of abu yilla  the way i got there was itself a very strange one i had come to egypt for a winter tour with the fitzsimkinses to whose daughter editha i was at that precise moment engaged you will probably remember that old fitzsimkins belonged originally to the wealthy firm of simkinson and stokoe worshipful vintners but when the senior partner retired from the business and got his knighthood the college of heralds opportunely discovered that his ancestors had changed their fine old norman name for its english equivalent some time about the reign of king richard i and they immediately authorized the old gentleman to resume the patronymic and the armorial bearings of his distinguished forefathers its really quite astonishing how often these curious coincidences crop up at the college of heralds  of course it was a great catch for a landless and briefless barrister like myselfdependent on a small fortune in south american securities and my precarious earnings as a writer of burlesqueto secure such a valuable prospective property as editha fitzsimkins to be sure the girl was undeniably plain but i have known plainer girls than she was whom forty thousand pounds converted into my ladies and if editha hadnt really fallen over head and ears in love with me i suppose old fitzsimkins would never have consented to such a match as it was however we had flirted so openly and so desperately during the scarborough season that it would have been difficult for sir peter to break it off and so i had come to egypt on a tour of insurance to secure my prize following in the wake of my future motherinlaw whose lungs were supposed to require a genial climatethough in my private opinion they were really as creditable a pair of pulmonary appendages as ever drew breath  nevertheless the course of our true love did not run so smoothly as might have been expected editha found me less ardent than a devoted squire should be and on the very last night of the old year she got up a regulation lovers quarrel because i had sneaked away from the boat that afternoon under the guidance of our dragoman to witness the seductive performances of some fair ghawázi the dancing girls of a neighbouring town how she found it out heaven only knows for i gave that rascal dimitri five piastres to hold his tongue but she did find it out somehow and chose to regard it as an offence of the first magnitude a mortal sin only to be expiated by three days of penance and humiliation  i went to bed that night in my hammock on deck with feelings far from satisfactory we were moored against the bank at abu yilla the most pestiferous hole between thee cataracts and the delta the mosquitoes were worse than the ordinary mosquitoes of egypt and that is saying a great deal the heat was oppressive even at night and the malaria from the lotus beds rose like a palpable mist before my eyes above all i was getting doubtful whether editha fitzsimkins might not after all slip between my fingers i felt wretched and feverish and yet i had delightful interlusive recollections in between of that lovely little gháziyah who danced that exquisite marvellous entrancing delicious and awfully oriental dance that i saw in the afternoon  by jove she was a beautiful creature eyes like two full moons hair like miltons penseroso movements like a poem of swinburnes set to action if editha was only a faint picture of that girl now upon my word i was falling in love with a gháziyah  then the mosquitoes came again buzzbuzzbuzz i make a lunge at the loudest and biggest a sort of prima donna in their infernal opera i kill the prima donna but ten more shrill performers come in its place the frogs croak dismally in the reedy shallows the night grows hotter and hotter still at last i can stand it no longer i rise up dress myself lightly and jump ashore to find some way of passing the time  yonder across the flat lies the great unopened pyramid of abu yilla we are going tomorrow to climb to the top but i will take a turn to reconnoitre in that direction now i walk across the moonlit fields my soul still divided between editha and the gháziyah and approach the solemn mass of huge antiquated graniteblocks standing out so grimly against the pale horizon i feel half awake half asleep and altogether feverish but i poke about the base in an aimless sort of way with a vague idea that i may perhaps discover by chance the secret of its sealed entrance which has ere now baffled so many pertinacious explorers and learned egyptologists  as i walk along the base i remember old herodotuss story like a page from the arabian nights of how king rhampsinitus built himself a treasury wherein one stone turned on a pivot like a door and how the builder availed himself of this his cunning device to steal gold from the kings storehouse suppose the entrance to the unopened pyramid should be by such a door it would be curious if i should chance to light upon the very spot  i stood in the broad moonlight near the northeast angle of the great pile at the twelfth stone from the corner a random fancy struck me that i might turn this stone by pushing it inward on the left side i leant against it with all my weight and tried to move it on the imaginary pivot did it give way a fraction of an inch no it must have been mere fancy let me try again surely it is yielding gracious osiris it has moved an inch or more my heart beats fast either with fever or excitement and i try a third time the rust of centuries on the pivot wears slowly off and the stone turns ponderously round giving access to a low dark passage  it must have been madness which led me to enter the forgotten corridor alone without torch or match at that hour of the evening but at any rate i entered the passage was tall enough for a man to walk erect and i could feel as i groped slowly along that the wall was composed of smooth polished granite while the floor sloped away downward with a slight but regular descent i walked with trembling heart and faltering feet for some forty or fifty yards down the mysterious vestibule and then i felt myself brought suddenly to a standstill by a block of stone placed right across the pathway i had had nearly enough for one evening and i was preparing to return to the boat agog with my new discovery when my attention was suddenly arrested by an incredible a perfectly miraculous fact  the block of stone which barred the passage was faintly visible as a square by means of a struggling belt of light streaming through the seams there must be a lamp or other flame burning within what if this were a door like the outer one leading into a chamber perhaps inhabited by some dangerous band of outcasts the light was a sure evidence of human occupation and yet the outer door swung rustily on its pivot as though it had never been opened for ages i paused a moment in fear before i ventured to try the stone and then urged on once more by some insane impulse i turned the massive block with all my might to the left it gave way slowly like its neighbour and finally opened into the central hall  never as long as i live shall i forget the ecstasy of terror astonishment and blank dismay which seized upon me when i stepped into that seemingly enchanted chamber a blaze of light first burst upon my eyes from jets of gas arranged in regular rows tier above tier upon the columns and walls of the vast apartment huge pillars richly painted with red yellow blue and green decorations stretched in endless succession down the dazzling aisles a floor of polished syenite reflected the splendour of the lamps and afforded a base for red granite sphinxes and dark purple images in porphyry of the catfaced goddess pasht whose form i knew so well at the louvre and the british museum but i had no eyes for any of these lesser marvels being wholly absorbed in the greatest marvel of all for there in royal state and with mitred head a living egyptian king surrounded by his coiffured court was banqueting in the flesh upon a real throne before a table laden with memphian delicacies  i stood transfixed with awe and amazement my tongue and my feet alike forgetting their office and my brain whirling round and round as i remember it used to whirl when my health broke down utterly at cambridge after the classical tripos i gazed fixedly at the strange picture before me taking in all its details in a confused way yet quite incapable of understanding or realizing any part of its true import i saw the king in the centre of the hall raised on a throne of granite inlaid with gold and ivory his head crowned with the peaked cap of rameses and his curled hair flowing down his shoulders in a set and formal frizz i saw priests and warriors on either side dressed in the costumes which i had often carefully noted in our great collections while bronzeskinned maids with light garments round their waists and limbs displayed in graceful picturesqueness waited upon them half nude as in the wall paintings which we had lately examined at karnak and syene i saw the ladies clothed from head to foot in dyed linen garments sitting apart in the background banqueting by themselves at a separate table while dancing girls like older representatives of my yesternoon friends the ghawázi tumbled before them in strange attitudes to the music of fourstringed harps and long straight pipes in short i beheld as in a dream the whole drama of everyday egyptian royal life playing itself out anew under my eyes in its real original properties and personages  gradually as i looked i became aware that my hosts were no less surprised at the appearance of their anachronistic guest than was the guest himself at the strange living panorama which met his eyes in a moment music and dancing ceased the banquet paused in its course and the king and his nobles stood up in undisguised astonishment to survey the strange intruder  some minutes passed before any one moved forward on either side at last a young girl of royal appearance yet strangely resembling the gháziyah of abu yilla and recalling in part the laughing maiden in the foreground of mr longs great canvas at the previous academy stepped out before the throng  may i ask you she said in ancient egyptian who you are and why you come hither to disturb us  i was never aware before that i spoke or understood the language of the hieroglyphics yet i found i had not the slightest difficulty in comprehending or answering her question to say the truth ancient egyptian though an extremely tough tongue to decipher in its written form becomes as easy as lovemaking when spoken by a pair of lips like that pharaonic princesss it is really very much the same as english pronounced in a rapid and somewhat indefinite whisper and with all the vowels left out  i beg ten thousand pardons for my intrusion i answered apologetically but i did not know that this pyramid was inhabited or i should not have entered your residence so rudely as for the points you wish to know i am an english tourist and you will find my name upon this card saying which i handed her one from the case which i had fortunately put into my pocket with conciliatory politeness the princess examined it closely but evidently did not understand its import  in return i continued may i ask you in what august presence i now find myself by accident  a court official stood forth from the throng and answered in a set heraldic tone in the presence of the illustrious monarch brother of the sun thothmes the twentyseventh king of the eighteenth dynasty  salute the lord of the world put in another official in the same regulation drone  i bowed low to his majesty and stepped out into the hall apparently my obeisance did not come up to egyptian standards of courtesy for a suppressed titter broke audibly from the ranks of bronzeskinned waitingwomen but the king graciously smiled at my attempt and turning to the nearest nobleman observed in a voice of great sweetness and selfcontained majesty this stranger ombos is certainly a very curious person his appearance does not at all resemble that of an ethiopian or other savage nor does he look like the palefaced sailors who come to us from the achaian land beyond the sea his features to be sure are not very different from theirs but his extraordinary and singularly inartistic dress shows him to belong to some other barbaric race  i glanced down at my waistcoat and saw that i was wearing my tourists check suit of grey and mud colour with which a bond street tailor had supplied me just before leaving town as the latest thing out in fancy tweeds evidently these egyptians must have a very curious standard of taste not to admire our pretty and graceful style of male attire  if the dust beneath your majestys feet may venture upon a suggestion put in the officer whom the king had addressed i would hint that this young man is probably a stray visitor from the utterly uncivilized lands of the north the headgear which he carries in his hand obviously betrays an arctic habitat  i had instinctively taken off my round felt hat in the first moment of surprise when i found myself in the midst of this strange throng and i standing now in a somewhat embarrassed posture holding it awkwardly before me like a shield to protect my chest  let the stranger cover himself said the king  barbarian intruder cover yourself cried the herald i noticed throughout that the king never directly addressed anybody save the higher officials around him  i put on my hat as desired a most uncomfortable and silly form of tiara indeed said the great thothmes  very unlike your noble and awespiring mitre lion of egypt answered ombos  ask the stranger his name the king continued  it was useless to offer another card so i mentioned it in a clear voice  an uncouth and almost unpronounceable designation truly commented his majesty to the grand chamberlain beside him these savages speak strange languages widely different from the flowing tongue of memnon and sesostris  the chamberlain bowed his assent with three low genuflexions i began to feel a little abashed at these personal remarks and i almost think though i shouldnt like it to be mentioned in the temple that a blush rose to my cheek  the beautiful princess who had been standing near me meanwhile in an attitude of statuesque repose now appeared anxious to change the current of the conversation dear father she said with a respectful inclination surely the stranger barbarian though he be cannot relish such pointed allusions to his person and costume we must let him feel the grace and delicacy of egyptian refinement then he may perhaps carry back with him some faint echo of its cultured beauty to his northern wilds  nonsense hatasou replied thothmes xxvii testily savages have no feelings and they are as incapable of appreciating egyptian sensibility as the chattering crow is incapable of attaining the dignified reserve of the sacred crocodile  your majesty is mistaken i said recovering my selfpossession gradually and realizing my position as a freeborn englishman before the court of a foreign despotthough i must allow that i felt rather less confident than usual owing to the fact that we were not represented in the pyramid by a british consuli am an english tourist a visitor from a modern land whose civilization far surpasses the rude culture of early egypt and i am accustomed to respectful treatment from all other nationalities as becomes a citizen of the first naval power in the world  my answer created a profound impression he has spoken to the brother of the sun cried ombos in evident perturbation he must be of the blood royal in his own tribe or he would never have dared to do so  otherwise added a person whose dress i recognized as that of a priest he must be offered up in expiation to amonra immediately  as a rule i am a decently truthful person but under these alarming circumstances i ventured to tell a slight fib with an air of nonchalant boldness i am a younger brother of our reigning king i said without a moments hesitation for there was nobody present to gainsay me and i tried to salve my conscience by reflecting that at any rate i was only claiming consanguinity with an imaginary personage  in that case said king thothmes with more geniality in his tone there can be no impropriety in my addressing you personally will you take a place at our table next to myself and we can converse together without interrupting a banquet which must be brief enough in any circumstances hatasou my dear you may seat yourself next to the barbarian prince  i felt a visible swelling to the proper dimensions of a royal highness as i sat down by the kings right hand the nobles resumed their places the bronzeskinned waitresses left off standing like soldiers in a row and staring straight at my humble self the goblets went round once more and a comely maid soon brought me meat bread fruits and date wine  all this time i was naturally burning with curiosity to inquire who my strange hosts might be and how they had preserved their existence for so many centuries in this undiscovered hall but i was obliged to wait until i had satisfied his majesty of my own nationality the means by which i had entered the pyramid the general state of affairs throughout the world at the present moment and fifty thousand other matters of a similar sort thothmes utterly refused to believe my reiterated assertion that our existing civilization was far superior to the egyptian because said he i see from your dress that your nation is utterly devoid of taste or invention but he listened with great interest to my account of modern society the steamengine the permissive prohibitory bill the telegraph the house of commons home rule and the other blessings of our advanced era as well as to a brief résumé of european history from the rise of the greek culture to the russoturkish war at last his questions were nearly exhausted and i got a chance of making a few counter inquiries on my own account  and now i said turning to the charming hatasou whom i thought a more pleasing informant than her august papa i should like to know who you are  what dont you know she cried with unaffected surprise why were mummies  she made this astounding statement with just the same quiet unconsciousness as if she had said were french or were americans i glanced round the walls and observed behind the columns what i had not noticed till thena large number of empty mummycases with their lids placed carelessly by their sides  but what are you doing here i asked in a bewildered way  is it possible said hatasou that you dont really know the object of embalming though your manners show you to be an agreeable and wellbred young man you must excuse my saying that you are shockingly ignorant we are made into mummies in order to preserve our immortality once in every thousand years we wake up for twentyfour hours recover our flesh and blood and banquet once more upon the mummied dishes and other good things laid by for us in the pyramid today is the first day of a millennium and so we have waked up for the sixth time since we were first embalmed  the sixth time i inquired incredulously then you must have been dead six thousand years  exactly so  but the world has not yet existed so long i cried in a fervour of orthodox horror  excuse me barbarian prince this is the first day of the three hundred and twentyseven thousandth millennium  my orthodoxy received a severe shock however i had been accustomed to geological calculations and was somewhat inclined to accept the antiquity of man so i swallowed the statement without more ado besides if such a charming girl as hatasou had asked me at that moment to turn mohammedan or to worship osiris i believe i should incontinently have done so  you wake up only for a single day and night then i said  only for a single day and night after that we go to sleep for another millennium  unless you are meanwhile burned as fuel on the cairo railway i added mentally but how i continued aloud do you get these lights  the pyramid is built above a spring of inflammable gas we have a reservoir in one of the side chambers in which it collects during the thousand years as soon as we awake we turn it on at once from the tap and light it with a lucifer match  upon my word i interposed i had no notion you ancient egyptians were acquainted with the use of matches  very likely not there are more things in heaven and earth cephrenes than are dreamt of in your philosophy as the bard of philæ puts it  further inquiries brought out all the secrets of that strange tombhouse and kept me fully interested till the close of the banquet then the chief priest solemnly rose offered a small fragment of meat to a deified crocodile who sat in a meditative manner by the side of his deserted mummycase and declared the feast concluded for the night all rose from their places wandered away into the long corridors or sideaisles and formed little groups of talkers under the brilliant gaslamps  for my part i scrolled off with hatasou down the least illuminated of the colonnades and took my seat beside a marble fountain where several fish gods of great sanctity hatasou assured me were disporting themselves in a porphyry basin how long we sat there i cannot tell but i know that we talked a good deal about fish and gods and egyptian habits and egyptian philosophy and above all egyptian lovemaking the lastnamed subject we found very interesting and when once we got fully started upon it no diversion afterwards occurred to break the even tenour of the conversation hatasou was a lovely figure tall queenly with smooth dark arms and neck of polished bronze her big black eyes full of tenderness and her long hair bound up into a bright egyptian headdress that harmonized to a tone with her complexion and her robe the more we talked the more desperately did i fall in love and the more utterly oblivious did i become of my duty to editha fitzsimkins the mere ugly daughter of a rich and vulgar brandnew knight forsooth to show off her airs before me when here was a princess of the blood royal of egypt obviously sensible to the attentions which i was paying her and not unwilling to receive them with a coy and modest grace  well i went on saying pretty things to hatasou and hatasou went on deprecating them in a pretty little way as who should say i dont mean what i pretend to mean one bit until at last i may confess that we were both evidently as far gone in the disease of the heart called love as it is possible for two young people on first acquaintance to become therefore when hatasou pulled forth her watchanother piece of mechanism with which antiquaries used never to credit the egyptian peopleand declared that she had only three more hours to live at least for the next thousand years i fairly broke down took out my handkerchief and began to sob like a child of five years old  hatasou was deeply moved decorum forbade that she should console me with too much empressement but she ventured to remove the handkerchief gently from my face and suggested that there was yet one course open by which we might enjoy a little more of one anothers society suppose she said quietly you were to become a mummy you would then wake up as we do every thousand years and after you have tried it once you will find it just as natural to sleep for a millennium as for eight hours of course she added with a slight blush during the next three or four solar cycles there would be plenty of time to conclude any other arrangements you might possibly contemplate before the occurrence of another glacial epoch  this mode of regarding time was certainly novel and somewhat bewildering to people who ordinarily reckon its lapse by weeks and months and i had a vague consciousness that my relations with editha imposed upon me a moral necessity of returning to the outer world instead of becoming a millennial mummy besides there was the awkward chance of being converted into fuel and dissipated into space before the arrival of the next waking day but i took one look at hatasou whose eyes were filling in turn with sympathetic tears and that look decided me i flung editha life and duty to the dogs and resolved at once to become a mummy  there was no time to be lost only three hours remained to us and the process of embalming even in the most hasty manner would take up fully two we rushed off to the chief priest who had charge of the particular department in question he at once acceded to my wishes and briefly explained the mode in which they usually treated the corpse  that word suddenly aroused me the corpse i cried but i am alive you cant embalm me living  we can replied the priest under chloroform  chloroform i echoed growing more and more astonished i had no idea you egyptians knew anything about it  ignorant barbarian he answered with a curl of the lip you imagine yourself much wiser than the teachers of the world if you were versed in all the wisdom of the egyptians you would know that chloroform is one of our simplest and commonest anæsthetics  i put myself at once under the hands of the priest he brought out the chloroform and placed it beneath my nostrils as i lay on a soft couch under the central court hatasou held my hand in hers and watched my breathing with an anxious eye i saw the priest leaning over me with a clouded phial in his hand and i experienced a vague sensation of smelling myrrh and spikenard next i lost myself for a few moments and when i again recovered my senses in a temporary break the priest was holding a small greenstone knife dabbled with blood and i felt that a gash had been made across my breast then they applied the chloroform once more i felt hatasou give my hand a gentle squeeze the whole panorama faded finally from my view and i went to sleep for a seemingly endless time  when i awoke again my first impression led me to believe that the thousand years were over and that i had come to life once more to feast with hatasou and thothmes in the pyramid of abu yilla but second thoughts combined with closer observation of the surroundings convinced me that i was really lying in a bedroom of shepheards hotel at cairo an hospital nurse leant over me instead of a chief priest and i noticed no tokens of editha fitzsimkinss presence but when i endeavoured to make inquiries upon the subject of my whereabouts i was peremptorily informed that i mustnt speak as i was only just recovering from a severe fever and might endanger my life by talking  some weeks later i learned the sequel of my nights adventure the fitzsimkinses missing me from the boat in the morning at first imagined that i might have gone ashore for an early stroll but after breakfast time lunch time and dinner time had gone past they began to grow alarmed and sent to look for me in all directions one of their scouts happening to pass the pyramid noticed that one of the stones near the northeast angle had been displaced so as to give access to a dark passage hitherto unknown calling several of his friends for he was afraid to venture in alone he passed down the corridor and through a second gateway into the central hall there the fellahin found me lying on the ground bleeding profusely from a wound on the breast and in an advanced stage of malarious fever they brought me back to the boat and the fitzsimkinses conveyed me at once to cairo for medical attendance and proper nursing  editha was at first convinced that i had attempted to commit suicide because i could not endure having caused her pain and she accordingly resolved to tend me with the utmost care through my illness but she found that my delirious remarks besides bearing frequent reference to a princess with whom i appeared to have been on unexpectedly intimate terms also related very largely to our casus belli itself the dancing girls of abu yilla even this trial she might have borne setting down the moral degeneracy which led me to patronize so degrading an exhibition as a first symptom of my approaching malady but certain unfortunate observations containing pointed and by no means flattering allusions to her personal appearancewhich i contrasted much to her disadvantage with that of the unknown princessthese i say were things which she could not forgive and she left cairo abruptly with her parents for the riviera leaving behind a stinging note in which she denounced my perfidy and emptyheartedness with all the flowers of feminine eloquence from that day to this i have never seen her  when i returned to london and proposed to lay this account before the society of antiquaries all my friends dissuaded me on the ground of its apparent incredibility they declare that i must have gone to the pyramid already in a state of delirium discovered the entrance by accident and sunk exhausted when i reached the inner chamber in answer i would point out three facts in the first place i undoubtedly found my way into the unknown passagefor which achievement i afterwards received the gold medal of the sociétée khédiviale and of which i retain a clear recollection differing in no way from my recollection of the subsequent events in the second place i had in my pocket when found a ring of hatasous which i drew from her finger just before i took the chloroform and put into my pocket as a keepsake and in the third place i had on my breast the wound which i saw the priest inflict with a knife of greenstone and the scar may be seen on the spot to the present day the absurd hypothesis of my medical friends that i was wounded by falling against a sharp edge of rock i must at once reject as unworthy a moments consideration  my own theory is either that the priest had not time to complete the operation or else that the arrival of the fitzsimkins scouts frightened back the mummies to their cases an hour or so too soon at any rate there they all were ranged around the walls undisturbed the moment the fellahin entered  unfortunately the truth of my account cannot be tested for another thousand years but as a copy of this book will be preserved for the benefit of posterity in the british museum i hereby solemnly call upon collective humanity to try the veracity of this history by sending a deputation of archæologists to the pyramid of abu yilla on the last day of december two thousand eight hundred and seventyseven if they do not then find thothmes and hatasou feasting in the central hall exactly as i have described i shall willingly admit that the story of my new years eve among the mummies is a vain hallucination unworthy of credence at the hands of the scientific world     the foundering of the fortuna   i  i am going to spin you the yarn of the foundering of the fortuna exactly as an old lake captain on a huron steamer once span it for me by great manitoulin island it is a strange and a weird story and if i cant give you the dialect in which he told it you must forgive an english tongue its native accent for the sake of the curious yankee tale that underlies it  captain montague beresford pierpoint was hardly the sort of man you would have expected to find behind the counter of a small shanty bank at aylmers pike colorado there was an engaging english frankness an obvious honesty and refinement of manner about him which suited very oddly with the rough habits and rougher western speech of the mining population in whose midst he lived and yet captain pierpoint had succeeded in gaining the confidence and respect of those strange outcasts of civilization by some indescribable charm of address and some invisible talisman of quiet goodfellowship which caused him to be more universally believed in than any other man whatsoever at aylmers pike indeed to say so much is rather to underrate the uniqueness of his position for it might perhaps be truer to say that captain pierpoint was the only man in the place in whom any one believed at all in any way he was an honestspoken quiet unobtrusive sort of man who walked about fearlessly without a revolver and never gambled either in mining shares or at poker so that to the simpleminded unsophisticated rogues and vagabonds of aylmers pike he seemed the very incarnation of incorruptible commercial honour they would have trusted all their earnings and winnings without hesitation to captain pierpoints bare word and when they did so they knew that captain pierpoint had always had the money forthcoming on demand without a moments delay or a single prevarication  captain pierpoint walked very straight and erect as becomes a man of conspicuous uprightness and there was a certain tinge of military bearing in his manner which seemed at first sight sufficiently to justify his popular title but he himself made no false pretences upon that head he freely acknowledged that he had acquired the position of captain not in her britannic majestys guards as the gossip of aylmers pike sometimes asserted but in the course of his earlier professional engagements as skipper of a lake superior grainvessel though he hinted at times that he was by no means distantly connected with the three distinguished families whose names he bore he did not attempt to exalt his rank or birth unduly admitting that he was only a canadian sailor by trade thrown by a series of singular circumstances into the position of a colorado banker the one thing he really understood he would tell his mining friends was the graintrade on the upper lakes for finance he had but a single recommendation and that was that if people trusted him he could never deceive them  if any man had set up a bank in aylmers point with an iron strongroom a lot of electric bells and an obtrusive display of firearms and weapons it is tolerably certain that that bank would have been promptly robbed and gutted within its first week of existence by open violence five or six of the boys would have banded themselves together into a body of housebreakers and would have shot down the banker and burst into his strongroom without thought of the electric bells or other feeble resources of civilization to that end appointed but when a quiet unobtrusive brave man like captain montague pierpoint settled himself in a shanty in their midst and won their confidence by his straightforward honesty scarcely a miner in the lot would ever have dreamt of attempting to rob him captain pierpoint had not come to aylmers pike at first with any settled idea of making himself the financier of the rough little community he intended to dig on his own account and the rôle of banker was only slowly thrust upon him by the unanimous voice of the whole diggings he had begun by lending men money out of his own pocketmen who were unlucky in their claims men who had lost everything at monte men who had come penniless to the pike and expected to find silver growing freely and openly on the surface he had lent to them in a friendly way without interest and had been forced to accept a small present in addition to the sum advanced when the tide began to turn and luck at last led the penniless ones to a remunerative placer or pocket gradually the diggers got into the habit of regarding this as captain pierpoints natural function and captain pierpoint being himself but an indifferent digger acquiesced so readily that at last yielding to the persuasion of his clients he put up a wooden counter and painted over his rough door the magnificent notice aylmers pike bank montague pierpoint manager he got a large iron safe from carson city and in that safe which stood by his own bedside all the silver and other securities of the whole village were duly deposited any one of the boys could easily shoot me and open that safe any night captain pierpoint used to say pleasantly but if he did by george hed have to reckon afterwards with every man on the pike and i should be sorry to stand in his shoesthat i would any time indeed the entire pike looked upon captain pierpoints safe as our bank and united in a single front by that simple social contract they agreed to respect the safe as a sacred object protected by the collective guarantee of three hundred mutually suspicious revolverbearing outcasts  however even at aylmers pike there were degrees and stages of comparative unscrupulousness two men newcomers to the pike by name hiram coffin and pete morris at last wickedly and feloniously conspired together to rob captain pierpoints bank their plan was simplicity itself they would go at midnight very quietly to the captains house cut his throat as he slept rob the precious safe and ride off straight for the east thus getting a clear nights start of any possible pursuer it was an easy enough thing to do and they were really surprised in their own minds that nobody else had ever been cute enough to seize upon such an obvious and excellent path to wealth and security  the day before the night the two burglars had fixed upon for their enterprise captain pierpoint himself appeared to be in unusual spirits pete morris called in at the bank during the course of the morning to reconnoitre the premises under pretence of paying in a few dollars worth of silver and he found the captain very lively indeed when pete handed him the silver across the counter the captain weighed it with a smile gave a receipt for the amounthe always gave receipts as a matter of formand actually invited pete into the little back room which was at once kitchen bedroom and parlour to have a drink then before petes very eyes he opened the safe bursting with papers and placed the silver in a bag on a shelf by itself sticking the key into his waistcoat pocket he is delivering himself up into our hands thought pete to himself as the captain poured out two glasses of old bourbon and handed one to the miner opposite heres success to all our enterprises cried the captain gaily heres success pard pete answered with a sinister look which even the captain could not help noting in a sidelong fashion  that night about two oclock when all aylmers pike was quietly dreaming its own sordid drunken dreams two sober men rose up from their cabin and stole out softly to the wooden bank house two horses were ready saddled with mexican saddlebags and tied to a tree outside the digging and in half an hour pete and hiram hoped to find themselves in full possession of all captain pierpoints securities and well on their road towards the nearest station of the pacific railway they groped along to the door of the bank shanty and began fumbling with their wire picks at the rough lock after a moments exploration of the wards pete morris drew back in surprise  pard he murmured in a low whisper heres suthin rather extraordinary this ere locks not fastened  they turned the handle gently and found that the door opened without an effort both men looked at one another in the dim light incredulously was there ever such a simple trustful fool as that fellow pierpoint he actually slept in the bank shanty with his outer door unfastened  the two robbers passed through the outer room and into the little back bedroomparlour hiram held the dark lantern and turned it full on to the bed to their immense astonishment they found it empty  their first impulse was to suppose that the captain had somehow anticipated their coming and had gone out to rouse the boys for a moment they almost contemplated running away without the money but a second glance reassured them the bed had not been slept in the captain was a man of very regular habits he made his bed in civilized fashion every morning after breakfast and he retired every evening at a little after eleven where he could be stopping so late they couldnt imagine but they hadnt come there to make a study of the captains personal habits and as he was away the best thing they could do was to open the safe immediately before he came back they werent particular about murder pete and hiram still if you could do your robbery without bloodshed it was certainly all the better to do it so  hiram held the lantern carefully shaded by his hand towards the door of the safe pete looked cautiously at the lock and began pushing it about with his wire pick he had hoped to get the key out of captain pierpoints pocket but as that easy scheme was so unexpectedly foiled he trusted to his skill in picking to force the lock open once more a fresh surprise awaited him the door opened almost of its own accord pete looked at hiram and hiram looked at pete there was no mistaking the strange fact that met their gazethe safe was empty  what on airth do you suppose is the meaning of this pete hiram whispered hoarsely but pete did not whisper the whole truth flashed upon him in a moment and he answered aloud with a string of oaths the capn has gone and made tracks hisself for madison depôt and hes taken every red cent in the safe along with him too the mean low dirty scoundrel hes taken even my silver that he give me a receipt for this very morning  hiram stared at pete in blank amazement that such base treachery could exist on earth almost surpassed his powers of comprehension he could understand that a man should rob and murder simply and naturally as he was prepared to do out of pure guileless depravity of heart but that a man should plan and plot for a couple of years to impose upon the simplicity of a dishonest community by a consistent show of respectability with the ultimate object of stealing its whole wealth at one fell swoop was scarcely within the limits of his narrow intelligence he stared blankly at the empty safe and whispered once more to pete in a timid undertone perhaps hes got wind of this and took off the plate to somebody elses hut if the boys was to come and catch us here it ud be derned awkward for you an me pete but pete answered gruffly and loudly never you mind about the plate pard the capns gone and the plates gone with him and what weve got to do now is to rouse the boys and ride after him like greased lightnin the mean swindler to go and swindle me out of the silver that ive been and dug out of that there claim yonder with my own pick for the sense of personal injustice to ones self rises perennially in the human breast however depraved and the man who would murder another without a scruple is always genuinely aghast with just indignation when he finds the counsel for the prosecution pressing a point against him with what seems to him unfair persistency  pete flung his lockpick out among the agave scrub that faced the bank shanty and ran out wildly into the midst of the dusty white road that led down the row of huts which the people of aylmers pike euphemistically described as the main street there he raised such an unearthly whoop as roused the sleepers in the nearest huts to turn over in their beds and listen in wonder with a vague idea that the injuns were coming down on a scalpingtrail upon the diggings next he hurried down the street beating heavily with his fist on every frame door and kicking hard at the log walls of the successive shanties in a few minutes the whole pike was out and alive unwholesomelooking men in unwashed flannel shirts and loose trousers mostly barefooted in their haste came forth to inquire with an unnecessary wealth of expletives what the something was stirring pete breathless and wrathful in the midst livid with rage and disappointment could only shriek aloud capn pierpoint has cleared out of camp and taken all the plate with him there was at first an incredulous shouting and crying then a general stampede towards the bank shanty and finally as the truth became apparent to everybody a deep and angry howl for vengeance on the traitor in one moment captain pierpoints smoothfaced villany dawned as clear as day to all aylmers pike and the whole chorus of gamblers rascals and blacklegs stood awestruck with horror and indignation at the more plausible rogue who had succeeded in swindling even them the cleanwashed whiteshirted fairspoken villain they would have his blood for this if the united states marshal had every mothers son of them strung up in a row for it after the pesky business was once fairly over  nobody inquired how pete and hiram came by the news nobody asked how they had happened to notice that the shanty was empty and the safe rifled all they thought of was how to catch and punish the public robber he must have made for the nearest depôt madison clearing on the union pacific line and he would take the first cars east for st louisthat was certain every horse in the pike was promptly requisitioned by the fastest riders and a rough cavalcade revolvers in hand made down the gulch and across the plain full tilt to madison but when in the garish blaze of early morning they reached the white wooden depôt in the valley and asked the ticketclerk whether a man answering to their description had gone on by the east mail at 430 the ticketclerk swore in reply that not a soul had left the depôt by any train either way that blessed night pete morris proposed to hold a revolver to his head and force him to confess but even that strong measure failed to induce a satisfactory retractation by way of general precaution two of the boys went on by the day train to st louis but neither of them could hear anything of captain pierpoint indeed as a matter of fact the late manager and present appropriator of the aylmers pike bank had simply turned his horses head in the opposite direction towards the further station at cheyenne gap and had gone westward to san francisco intending to make his way back to new york viâ panama and the isthmus railway  when the boys really understood that they had been completely duped they swore vengeance in solemn fashion and they picked out two of themselves to carry out the oath in a regular assembly each contributed of his substance what he was able and pete and hiram being more stirred with righteous wrath than all the rest put together were unanimously deputed to follow the captains tracks to san francisco and to have his life wherever and whenever they might chance to find him pete and hiram accepted the task thrust upon them con amore and went forth zealously to hunt up the doomed life of captain montague beresford pierpoint   ii  society in sarnia admitted that captain pierpoint was really quite an acquisition an english gentleman by birth well educated and of pleasant manners he had made a little money out west by mining it was understood and had now retired to the city of sarnia in the province of ontario and dominion of canada to increase it by a quiet bit of speculative grain trading he had been in the grain trade already and people on the lake remembered him well for captain pierpoint in his honest straightforward fashion disdained the vulgar trickiness of an alias and bore throughout the string of names which he had originally received from his godfathers and godmothers at his baptism a thorough good fellow captain pierpoint had been at aylmers pike a perfect gentleman he was at sarnia as a matter of fact indeed the captain was decently wellborn the son of an english country clergyman educated at a respectable grammar school and capable of being all things to all men in whatever station of life it might please providence to place him society at sarnia had no prejudice against the grain trade if it had the prejudice would have been distinctly selfregarding for everybody in the little town did something in grain and if captain pierpoint chose sometimes to navigate his own vessels that was a fad which struck nobody as out of the way in an easygoing moneygetting canadian city  somehow or other everything seemed to go wrong with captain pierpoints cargoes he was always losing a scow laden with best fall wheat from chicago for buffalo or running a lumber vessel ashore on the shoals of lake erie or getting a fourmaster jammed in the ice packs on the st clair river and though the insurance companies continually declared that captain pierpoint had got the better of them the captain himself was wont to complain that no insurance could ever possibly cover the losses he sustained by the carelessness of his subordinates or the constant perversity of wind and waters he was obliged to take his own ships down he would have it because nobody else could take them safely for him and though he met with quite as many accidents himself as many of his deputies did he continued to convey his grain in person hoping as he said that luck would turn some day and that a good speculation would finally enable him honourably to retrieve his shattered fortunes  however this might be it happened curiously enough that in spite of all his losses captain pierpoint seemed to grow richer and richer visibly to the naked eye with each reverse of his trading efforts he took a handsome house set up a carriage and pair and made love to the prettiest and sweetest girl in all sarnia the prettiest and sweetest girl was not proof against captain pierpoints suave tongue and handsome house and she married him in very good faith honestly believing in him as a good woman will in a scoundrel and clinging to him fervently with all her heart and soul no happier and more loving pair in all sarnia than captain and mrs pierpoint  some months after the marriage captain pierpoint arranged to take down a scow or flatbottomed boat laden with grain from milwaukee for the erie canal he took up the scow himself and before he started for the voyage it was a curious fact that he went in person down into the hold bored eight large holes right through the bottom and filled each up as he drew out the auger with a caulked plug made exactly to fit it and hammered firmly into place with a wooden mallet there was a ring in each plug by which it could be pulled out again without much difficulty and the whole eight were all placed along the gangway of the hold where no cargo would lie on top of them the scows name was the fortuna sit faustum omen et felix murmured captain pierpoint to himself for among his other accomplishments he had not wholly neglected nor entirely forgotten the classical languages  it took only two men and the skipper to navigate the scow for lake craft towed by steam propellers are always very lightly manned and when captain pierpoint reached milwaukee where he was to take in cargo he dismissed the two sailors who had come with him from sarnia and engaged two fresh hands at the harbour rough minerlooking men they were with very little of the sailor about them but captain pierpoints sharp eye soon told him they were the right sort of men for his purpose and he engaged them on the spot without a moments hesitation pete and hiram had had some difficulty in tracking him for they never thought he would return to the lakes but they had tracked him at last and were ready now to take their revenge  they had disguised themselves as well as they were able and in their clumsy knavery they thought they had completely deceived the captain but almost from the moment the captain saw them he knew who they were and he took his measures accordingly stupid louts he said to himself with the fine contempt of an educated scoundrel for the unsophisticated natural ruffian heres a fine chance of killing two birds with one stone and when the captain said the word killing he said it in his own mind with a delicate sinister emphasis which meant business  the scow was duly loaded and with a heavy cargo of grain aboard she proceeded to make her way slowly by the aid of a tug out of milwaukee harbour  as soon as she was once clear of the wharf and while the busy shipping of the great port still surrounded them on every side captain pierpoint calmly drew his revolver and took his stand beside the hatches pete and hiram he said quietly to his two assistants i want to have a little serious talk with you two before we go any further  if he had fired upon them outright instead of merely calling them by their own names the two common conspirators could not have started more unfeignedly or looked more unspeakably cowed than they did at that moment their first impulse was to draw their own revolvers in return but they saw in a second that the captain was beforehand with them and that they had better not try to shoot him before the very eyes of all milwaukee  now boys the captain went on steadily with his finger on the trigger and his eye fixed straight on the mens faces we three quite understand one another i took your savings for reasons of my own and you have shipped here today to murder me on the voyage but i recognized you before i engaged you and i have left word at milwaukee that if anything happens to me on this journey you two have a grudge against me and must be hanged for it ive taken care that if this scow comes into any port along the lakes without me aboard you two are to be promptly arrested this was false of course but to captain pierpoint a small matter like that was a mere trifle and ive shipped myself along with you just to show you im not afraid of you but if either of you disobeys my orders in anything for one minute i shoot at once and no jury in canada or the states will touch a hair of my head for doing it im a respectable shipowner and grain merchant youre a pair of disreputable skulking miners pretending to be sailors and youve shipped aboard here on purpose to murder and rob me if you shoot me its murder if i shoot you its justifiable homicide now boys do you understand that  pete looked at hiram and was beginning to speak when the captain interrupted him in the calm tone of one having authority look here pete he said drawing a chalk line amidships across the deck you stand this side of that line and you stand there hiram now mind if either of you chooses to step across that line or to confer with the other i shoot you whether its here before all the eyes of milwaukee or alone in the middle of huron you must each take your own counsel and do as you like for yourselves but ive got a little plan of my own on and if you choose willingly to help me in it your fortunes made look at the thing squarely boys whats the use of your killing me sooner or later youll get hung for it and its a very unpleasant thing i can assure you hanging as the captain spoke he placed his unoccupied hand loosely on his throat and pressed it gently backward pete and hiram shuddered a little as he did so well whats the good of ending your lives that way eh but im doing a little speculative business on these lakes where i want just such a couple of men as you twomen thatll do as theyre told in a matter of business and ask no squeamish questions if you care to help me in this business stop and make your fortunes if you dont you can go back to milwaukee with the tug  you speak fair enough said pete dubitatively but you know capn you aint a man to be trusted i owe you one already for stealing my silver  very little silver the captain answered with a wave of the hand and a graceful smile bonds united states bonds and greenbacks most of it converted beforehand for easier conveyance by horseback these however are business details which neednt stand in the way between you and me partner i always was straightforward in all my dealings and ill come to the point at once so that you can know whether youll help me or not this scows plugged at bottom my intention is first to part the rope that ties us to the tug next to transfer the cargo by night to a small shanty ive got on manitoulin island and then to pull the plugs and sink the scow on manitoulin rocks that way i get insurance for the cargo and scow and carry on the grain in the slack season if you consent to help me unload and sink the ship you shall have half profits between you if you dont you can go back to milwaukee like a couple of fools and ill put into port again to get a couple of pluckier fellows answer each for yourselves hiram will you go with me  how shall i know youll keep your promise asked hiram  for the best of all possible reasons replied the captain jauntily because if i dont you can inform upon me to the insurance people  in hiram coffins sordid soul there was a moments turning over of the chances and then greed prevailed over revenge and he said grudgingly  well capn ill go with you  the captain smiled the smile of calm selfapprobation and turned half round to pete  and you he asked  if hiram goes i go too pete answered half hoping that some chance might occur for conferring with his neighbour on the road and following out their original conspiracy but captain pierpoint had been too much for him he had followed the excellent rule divide et impera and he remained clearly master of the situation  as soon as they were well outside milwaukee harbour the tug dragged them into the open lake all unconscious of the strange scene that had passed on the deck so close to it and the oddly mated crew made its way practically alone down the busy waters of lake michigan  captain pierpoint certainly didnt spend a comfortable time during his voyage down the lake or through the straits of mackinaw to say the truth he could hardly sleep at all and he was very fagged and weary when they arrived at manitoulin island but pete and hiram though they had many chances of talking together could not see their way to kill him in safety and hiram at least in his own mind had come to the conclusion that it was better to make a little money than to risk ones neck for a foolish revenge so in the dead of night on the second day out when a rough wind had risen from the north and a fog had come over them the captain quietly began to cut away at the rope that tied them to the tug he cut the rope all round leaving a sound core in the centre and when the next gust of wind came the rope strained and parted quite naturally so that the people on the tug never suspected the genuineness of the transaction they looked about in the fog and storm for the scow but of course they couldnt find her for captain pierpoint who knew his ground well had driven her straight ashore before the wind and beached her on a small shelving cove on manitoulin island there they found five men waiting for them who helped unload the cargo with startling rapidity for it was all arranged in sacks not in bulk and a high slide fixed on the gangway enabled them to slip it quickly down into an underground granary excavated below the level of the beach after unloading they made their way down before the breeze towards the jagged rocks of manitoulin  it was eleven oclock on a stormy moonlight night when the fortuna arrived off the jutting point of the great island a black squall as they call it on the lakes was blowing down from the sault ste marie the scow drove about aimlessly under very little canvas and the boat was ready to be lowered in case the captain said humorously of any accident close to the end of the point the captain ordered pete and hiram down into the hold he had shown them beforehand the way to draw the plugs and had explained that the water would rise very slowly and they would have plenty of time to get up the companionladder long before there was a foot deep of water in the hold at the last moment pete hung back a little the captain took him quietly by the shoulders and without an oath an omission which told eloquently on pete thrust him down the ladder and told him in his calmest manner to do his duty hiram held the light in his hand and both went down together into the black abyss there was no time to be lost they were well off the point and in another moment the wreck would have lost all show of reasonable probability  as the two miners went down into the hold captain pierpoint drew quietly from his pocket a large hammer and a packet of fiveinch nails they were good stout nails and would resist a considerable pressure he looked carefully down into the hold and saw the two men draw the first plug one after another he watched them till the fourth was drawn and then he turned away and took one of the nails firmly between his thumb and forefinger  next week everybody at sarnia was grieved to hear that another of captain pierpoints vessels had gone down off manitoulin point in that dreadful black squall on thursday evening both the sailors on board had been drowned but the captain himself had managed to make good his escape in the jolly boat he would be a heavy loser it was understood on the value of the cargo for insurance never covers the loss of grain still it was a fortunate thing that such a delightful man as the captain had not perished in the foundering of the fortuna   iii  somehow after that wreck captain pierpoint never cared for the water again his nerves were shattered he said and he couldnt stand danger as he used to do when he was younger and stronger so he went on the lake no more and confined his attention more strictly to the futures business he was a thriving and prosperous person in spite of his losses and the underwriters had begun to look a little askance at his insurances even before this late foundering case some whispered ominously in underwriting circles that they had their doubts about the fortuna  one summer a few years later the water on lake huron sank lower than it had ever been known to sink before it was a very dry season in the back country and the rivers brought down very diminished streams into the great basins foot by foot the level of the lake fell slowly till many of the wharves were left high and dry and the vessels could only come alongside in very few deep places captain pierpoint had suffered much from sleeplessness combined with canadian ague for some years past but this particular summer his mind was very evidently much troubled for some unaccountable reason he watched the falling of the river with the intensest anxiety and after it had passed a certain point his interest in the question became painfully keen though the fever and the ague gained upon him from day to day and his doctor counselled perfect quiet he was perpetually consulting charts and making measurements of the configuration which the coast had now reached especially at the upper end of lake huron at last his mind seemed almost to give way and weak and feverish as he was he insisted the first time for many seasons that he must take a trip upon the water remonstrance was quite useless he would go on the lake again he said if it killed him so he hired one of the little steam pleasure yachts which are always to let in numbers at detroit and started with his wife and her brother a young surgeon for a months cruise into lake superior  as the yacht neared manitoulin island captain pierpoint insisted upon being brought up on deck in a chairhe was too ill to standand swept all the coast with his binocular close to the point a flattopped object lay mouldering in the sun half out of water on the shoals by the bank what is it ernest asked the captain trembling of his brotherinlaw  a wreck i should say the brotherinlaw answered carelessly by jove now i look at it with the glass i can read the name fortuna sarnia  captain pierpoint seized the glass with a shaking hand and read the name on the stern himself in a dazed fashion take me downstairs he said feebly and let me die quietly and for heavens sake ernest never let her know about it all  they took him downstairs into the little cabin and gave him quinine but he called for brandy they let him have it and he drank a glassful then he lay down and the shivering seized him and with his wifes hand in his he died that night in raving delirium about eleven a black squall was blowing down from the sault ste marie and they lay at anchor out in the lake tossing and pitching opposite the green mouldering hull of the fortuna  they took him back and buried him at sarnia and all the world went to attend his funeral as of a man who died justly respected for his wealth and other socially admired qualities but the brotherinlaw knew there was a mystery somewhere in the wreck of the fortuna and as soon as the funeral was over he went back with the yacht and took its skipper with him to examine the stranded vessel when they came to look at the bottom they found eight holes in it six of them were wide open one was still plugged and the remaining one had the plug pulled half out inward as if the persons who were pulling it had abandoned the attempt for the fear of the rising water that was bad enough and they did not wonder that captain pierpoint had shrunk in horror from the revealing of the secret of the fortuna  but when they scrambled on the deck they discovered another fact which gave a more terrible meaning to the dead mans tragedy the covering of the hatchway by the companionladder was battened down and nailed from the side with fiveinch nails the skipper loosened the rusty iron with his knife and after a while they lifted the lid off and descended carefully into the empty hold below as they suspected there was no damaged grain in it but at the foot of the companionladder left behind by the retreating water two halfcleaned skeletons in sailor clothes lay huddled together loosely on the floor that was all that remained of pete and hiram evidently the captain had nailed the hatch down on top of them and left them there terrorstricken to drown as the water rushed in and rose around them  for a while the skipper and the brotherinlaw kept the dead mans secret but they did not try to destroy or conceal the proofs of his guilt and in time others visited the wreck till bit by bit the horrible story leaked out in its entirety nowadays as you pass the great manitoulin island every sailor on the lake route is ready to tell you this strange and ghastly yarn of the foundering of the fortuna     the backslider   there was much stir and commotion on the night of thursday january the 14th 1874 in the gideonite apostolic church number 47 walworth lane peckham se anybody could see at a glance that some important business was under consideration for the apostle was there himself in his chair of presidency and the twelve episcops were there and the fortyeight presbyters and a large and earnest gathering of the gideonite laity it was only a small bare schoolroom fitted with wooden benches was that headquarters station of the young church but you could not look around it once without seeing that its occupants were of the sort by whom great religious revolutions may be made or marred for the gideonites were one of those strange enthusiastic holeandcorner sects that spring up naturally in the outlying suburbs of great thinking centres they gather around the marked personality of some one ardent vigorous halfeducated visionary and they consist for the most part of intelligent halfreasoning people who are bold enough to cast overboard the dogmatic beliefs of their fathers but not so bold as to exercise their logical faculty upon the fundamental basis on which the dogmas originally rested the gideonites had thus collected around the fixed centre of their apostle a retired attorney murgess by name whose teaching commended itself to their groping reason as the pure outcome of faithful biblical research and they had chosen their name because though they were but three hundred in number they had full confidence that when the time came they would blow their trumpets and all the host of midian would be scattered before them in fact they divided the world generally into gideonite and midianite for they knew that he that was not with them was against them and no wonder for the people of peckham did not love the struggling church its chief doctrine was one of absolute celibacy like the shakers of america and to this doctrine the church had testified in the old kent road and elsewhere after a vigorous practical fashion that roused the spirit of southeastern london into the fiercest opposition the young men and maidens said the apostle must no longer marry or be given in marriage the wives and husbands must dwell asunder and the earth must be made as an image of heaven these were heterodox opinions indeed which southeastern london could only receive with a strenuous counterblast of orthodox brickbats and sound anglican road metal  the fleece of wool was duly laid upon the floor the trumpet and the lamp were placed upon the bare wooden reading desk and the apostle rising slowly from his seat began to address the assembled gideonites  friends he said in a low clear impressive voice with a musical ring tempering its slow distinctness we have met together tonight to take counsel with one another upon a high matter it is plain to all of us that the work of the church in the world does not prosper as it might prosper were the charge of it in worthier hands we have to contend against great difficulties we are not among the rich or the mighty of the earth and the poor whom we have always with us do not listen to us it is expedient therefore that we should set some one among us aside to be instructed thoroughly in those things that are most commonly taught among the midianites at oxford or cambridge to some of you it may seem as it seemed at first to me that such a course would involve going back upon the very principles of our constitution we are not to overcome midian by our own hand nor by the strength of two and thirty thousand but by the trumpet and the pitcher and the cake of barley bread yet when i searched and inquired after this matter it seemed to me that we might also err by overmuch confidence on the other side for moses who led the people out of egypt was made ready for the task by being learned in all the learning of the egyptians daniel who testified in the captivity was cunning in knowledge and understanding science and instructed in the wisdom and tongue of the chaldeans paul who was the apostle of the gentiles had not only sat at the feet of gamaliel but was also able from their own poets and philosophers to confute the sophisms and subtleties of the grecians themselves these things show us that we should not too lightly despise even worldly learning and worldly science perhaps we have gone wrong in thinking too little of such dross and being puffed up with spiritual pride the world might listen to us more readily if we had one who could speak the word for us in the tongues understanded of the world  as he paused a hum of acquiescence went round the room  it has seemed to me then the apostle went on that we ought to choose some one among our younger brethren upon whose shoulders the cares and duties of the apostolate might hereafter fall we are a poor people but by subscription among ourselves we might raise a sufficient sum to send the chosen person first to a good school here in london and afterwards to the university of oxford it may seem a doubtful and a hazardous thing thus to stake our future upon any one young man but then we must remember that the choice will not be wholly or even mainly ours we will be guided and directed as we ever are in the laying on of hands to me considering this matter thus it has seemed that there is one youth in our body who is specially pointed out for this work only one child has ever been born into the church he as you know is the son of brother john owen and sister margaret owen who were received into the fold just six days before his birth paul owens very name seems to many of us who take nothing for chance but all things for divinely ordered to mark him out at once as a foreordained apostle is it your wish then presbyter john owen to dedicate your only son to this ministry  presbyter john owen rose from the row of seats assigned to the fortyeight and moved hesitatingly towards the platform he was an intelligentlooking honestfaced sunburnt working man a mason by trade who had come into the church from the baptist society and he was awkwardly dressed in his sunday clothes with the scrupulous clumsy neatness of a respectable artisan who expects to take part in an important ceremony he spoke nervously and with hesitation but with all the transparent earnestness of a simple enthusiastic nature  apostle and friends he said it aint very easy for me to disentangle my feelins on this subjec from one another i hope i aint moved by any worldly feelin an yet i hardly know how to keep such considerations out for theres no denyin that it would be a great pleasure to me and to his mother to see our paul becomin a teacher in israel and receivin an education such as you apostle has pinted out but we hope too we aint insensible to the good of the church and the advantage that it might derive from our pauls support and preachin we cant help seein ourselves that the lad has got abilities and weve tried to train him up from his youth upward like timothy for the furtherance of the right doctrine if the church thinks hes fit for the work laid upon him his mother and mell be glad to dedicate him to the service  he sat down awkwardly and the church again hummed its approbation in a suppressed murmur the apostle rose once more and briefly called on paul owen to stand forward  in answer to the call a tall handsome earnesteyed boy advanced timidly to the platform it was no wonder that those enthusiastic gideonite visionaries should have seen in his face the visible stamp of the apostleship paul owen had a rich crop of darkbrown glossy and curly hair cut something after the florentine cinquecento fashionnot because his parents wished him to look artistic but because that was the way in which they had seen the hair dressed in all the sacred pictures that they knew and margaret owen the daughter of some wesleyan spitalfields weaver folk with the imaginative huguenot blood still strong in her veins had made up her mind ever since she became convinced of the truth as their phrase ran that her paul was called from his cradle to a great work his features were delicately chiselled and showed rather natural culture like his mothers than rough honesty like john owens or strong individuality like the masterful apostles his eyes were peculiarly deep and luminous with a faraway look which might have reminded an artist of the central boyish figure in holman hunts picture of the doctors in the temple and yet paul owen had a healthy colour in his cheek and a general sturdiness of limb and muscle which showed that he was none of your nervous bloodless sickly idealists but a wholesome english peasant boy of native refinement and delicate sensibilities he moved forward with some natural hesitation before the eyes of so many peopleay and what was more terrible of the entire church upon earth but he was not awkward and constrained in his action like his father one could see that he was sustained in the prominent part he took that morning by the consciousness of a duty he had to perform and a mission laid upon him which he must not reject  are you willing my son paul asked the apostle gravely to take upon yourself the task that the church proposes  i am willing answered the boy in a low voice grace preventing me  does all the church unanimously approve the election of our brother paul to this office the apostle asked formally for it was a rule with the gideonites that nothing should be done except by the unanimous and spontaneous action of the whole body acting under direct and immediate inspiration and all important matters were accordingly arranged beforehand by the apostle in private interviews with every member of the church individually so that everything that took place in public assembly had the appearance of being wholly unquestioned they took counsel first with one another and consulted the scripture together and when all private doubts were satisfied they met as a church to ratify in solemn conclave their separate conclusions it was not often that the apostle did not have his own way not only had he the most marked personality and the strongest will but he alone also had greek and hebrew enough to appeal always to the original word and that mysterious amount of learning slight as it really was sufficed almost invariably to settle the scruples of his wholly ignorant and pliant disciples reverence for the literal scripture in its primitive language was the cornerstone of the gideonite church and for all practical purposes its one depositary and exponent for them was the apostle himself even the rev albert barness commentary was held to possess an inferior authority  the church approves was the unanimous answer  then episcops presbyters and brethren said the apostle taking up a roll of names i have to ask that you will each mark down on this paper opposite your own names how much a year you can spare of your substance for six years to come as a guarantee fund for this great work you must remember that the ministry of this church has cost you nothing freely i have received and freely given do you now bear your part in equipping a new aspirant for the succession to the apostolate  the two senior episcops took two rolls from his hand and went round the benches with a stylographic pen so strangely do the ages mingleapostles and stylographs silently asking each to put down his voluntary subscription meanwhile the apostle read slowly and reverently a few appropriate sentences of scripture some of the richer memberswelltodo small tradesmen of peckhamput down a pound or even two pounds apiece the poorer brethren wrote themselves down for ten shillings or even five in the end the guarantee list amounted to 195l a year the apostle reckoned it up rapidly to himself and then announced the result to the assembly with a gentle smile relaxing his austere countenance he was well pleased for the sum was quite sufficient to keep paul owen two years at school in london and then send him comfortably if not splendidly to oxford the boy had already had a fair education in latin and some greek at the birkbeck schools and with two years further study he might even gain a scholarship for he was a bright lad which would materially lessen the expense to the young church unlike many prophets and enthusiasts the apostle was a good man of business and he had taken pains to learn all about these favourable chances before embarking his people on so very doubtful a speculation  the assembly was just about to close when one of the presbyters rose unexpectedly to put a question which contrary to the usual practice had not already been submitted for approbation to the apostle he was a hardheaded thickset vulgarlooking man a greengrocer at denmark hill and the apostle always looked upon him as a thorn in his side promoted by inscrutable wisdom to the presbytery for the special purpose of keeping down the apostles spiritual pride  one more pint apostle he said abruptly afore we close it seems to me that even in the churchs work wed ought to be businesslike now it aint businesslike to let this young man brother paul get his eddication out of us if i may so speak afore the church on spec its all very well our sayin hes to be eddicated and take on the apostleship but how do we know but what when hes had his eddication he may fall away and become a backslider like demas and like others among ourselves that we could mention he may go to oxford among a lot of midianites and them of the great an mighty of the earth too and how do we know but what he may round upon the church and go back upon us after weve paid for his eddication so what i want to ask is just this cant we bind him down in a bond that if he dont take the apostleship with the consent of the church when it falls vacant hell pay us back our money so as we can eddicate up another asll be more worthy  the apostle moved uneasily in his chair but before he could speak paul owens indignation found voice and he said out his say boldly before the whole assembly blushing crimson with mingled shame and excitement as he did so if brother grimshaw and all the brethren think so ill of me that they cannot trust my honesty and honour he said they need not be at the pains of educating me i will sign no bond and enter into no compact but if you suppose that i will be a backslider you do not know me and i will confer no more with you upon the subject  my son paul is right the apostle said flushing up in turn at the boys audacity we will not make the affairs of the spirit a matter for bonds and earthly arrangements if the church thinks as i do you will all rise up  all rose except presbyter grimshaw for a moment there was some hesitation for the rule of the church in favour of unanimity was absolute but the apostle fixed his piercing eyes on job grimshaw and after a minute or so job grimshaw too rose slowly like one compelled by an unseen power and cast in his vote grudgingly with the rest there was nothing more said about signing an agreement   ii  meenie bolton had counted a great deal upon her visit to oxford and she found it quite as delightful as she had anticipated her brother knew such a nice set of men especially mr owen of christchurch meenie had never been so near falling in love with anybody in her life as she was with paul owen he was so handsome and so clever and then there was something so romantic about this strange church they said he belonged to meenies father was a country parson and the way in which paul shrank from talking about the rector as if his office were something wicked or uncanny piqued and amused her there was an heretical tinge about him which made him doubly interesting to the rectors daughter the afternoon water party that eventful thursday down to nuneham she looked forward to with the deepest interest for her aunt the professors wife who was to take charge of them was certainly the most delightful and most sensible of chaperons  is it really true mr owen she said as they sat together for ten minutes alone after their picnic luncheon by the side of the weir under the shadow of the nuneham beechesis it really true that this church of yours doesnt allow people to marry  paul coloured up to his eyes as he answered well miss bolton i dont know that you should identify me too absolutely with my church i was very young when they selected me to go to oxford and my opinions have decidedly wavered a good deal lately but the church certainly does forbid marriage i have always been brought up to look upon it as sinful  meenie laughed aloud and paul to whom the question was no laughing matter but a serious point of conscientious scruple could hardly help laughing with her so infectious was that pleasant ripple he checked himself with an effort and tried to look serious do you know he said when i first came to christchurch i doubted even whether i ought to make your brothers acquaintance because he was a clergymans son i was taught to describe clergymen always as priests of midian he never talked about his church to anybody at oxford and it was a sort of relief to him to speak on the subject to meenie in spite of her laughing eyes and undisguised amusement the other men would have laughed at him too but their laughter would have been less sympathetic  and do you think them priests of midian still asked meenie  miss bolton said paul suddenly as one who relieves his overburdened mind by a great effort i am almost moved to make a confidante of you  there is nothing i love better than confidences meenie answered and she might truthfully have added particularly from you  well i have been passing lately through a great many doubts and difficulties i was brought up by my church to become its next apostle and i have been educated at their expense both in london and here you know paul added with his innate love of telling out the whole truth i am not a gentleman i am the son of poor working people in london  tom told me who your parents were meenie answered simply but he told me too you were none the less a true gentleman born for that and i see myself he told me right  paul flushed againhe had a most unmanly trick of flushing upand bowed a little timid bow thank you he said quietly well while i was in london i lived entirely among my own people and never heard anything talked about except our own doctrines i thought our apostle the most learned the wisest and the greatest of men i had not a doubt about the absolute infallibility of our own opinions but ever since i came to oxford i have slowly begun to hesitate and to falter when i came up first the men laughed at me a good deal in a goodhumoured way because i wouldnt do as they did then i thought myself persecuted for the truths sake and was glad but the men were really very kind and forbearing to me they never argued with me or bullied me they respected my scruples and said nothing more about it as soon as they found out what they really were that was my first stumblingblock if they had fought me and debated with me i might have stuck to my own opinions by force of opposition but they turned me in upon myself completely by their silence and mastered me by their kindly forbearance point by point i began to give in till now i hardly know where i am standing  you wouldnt join the cricket club at first tom says  no i wouldnt i thought it wrong to walk in the ways of midian but gradually i began to argue myself out of my scruples and now i positively pull six in the boat and wear a christchurch ribbon on my hat i have given up protesting against having my letters addressed to me as esquire though i have really no right to the title and i nearly went the other day to have some cards engraved with my name as mr paul owen i am afraid im backsliding terribly  meenie laughed again if that is all you have to burden your conscience with she said i dont think you need spend many sleepless nights  quite so paul answered smiling i think so myself but that is not all i have begun to have serious doubts about the apostle himself and the whole church altogether i have been three years at oxford now and while i was reading for mods i dont think i was so unsettled in my mind but since i have begun reading philosophy for my greats i have had to go into all sorts of deep booksmill and spencer and bain and all kinds of fellows who really think about things you know down to the very bottomand an awful truth begins to dawn upon me that our apostle is after all only a very thirdrate type of a thinker now that you know is really terrible  i dont see why meenie answered demurely she was beginning to get genuinely interested  that is because you have never had to call in question a cherished and almost ingrown faith you have never realized any similar circumstances here am i brought up by these good honest earnest people with their own hardearned money as a pillar of their belief i have been taught to look upon myself as the chosen advocate of their creed and on the apostle as an almost divinely inspired man my whole life has been bound up in it i have worked and read night and day in order to pass high and do honour to the church and now what do i begin to find the church really is a petty group of poor devoted enthusiastic ignorant people led blindly by a decently instructed but narrowminded teacher who has mixed up his own headstrong selfconceit and selfimportance with his own peculiar ideas of abstract religion paul paused half surprised at himself for though he had doubted before he had never ventured till that day to formulate his doubts even to himself in such plain and straightforward language  i see said meenie gravely you have come into a wider world you have mixed with wider ideas and the wider world has converted you instead of your converting the world well that is only natural others beside you have had to change their opinions  yes yes but for me it is harderoh so much harder  because you have looked forward to being an apostle  miss bolton you do me injusticenot in what you say but in the tone you say it in no it is not the giving up of the apostleship that troubles me though i did hope that i might help in my way to make the world a new earth but it is the shock and downfall of their hopes to all those good earnest people and especiallyoh especially miss bolton to my own dear father and mother his eyes filled with tears as he spoke  i can understand said meenie sympathetically her eyes dimming a little in response they have set their hearts all their lives long on your accomplishing this work and it will be to them the disappointment of a cherished romance  they looked at one another a few minutes in silence  how long have you begun to have your doubts meenie asked after the pause  a long time but most of all since i saw you it has made meit has made me hesitate more about the fundamental article of our faith even now i am not sure whether it is not wrong of me to be talking so with you about such matters  i see said meenie a little more archly it comes perilously near and she broke off for she felt she had gone a step too far  perilously near falling in love paul continued boldly turning his big eyes full upon her yes perilously near  their eyes met meenies fell and they said no more but they both felt they understood one another just at that moment the professors wife came up to interrupt the têteàtête for that young owen she said to herself is really getting quite too confidential with dear meenie  that same evening paul paced up and down his rooms in peckwater with all his soul strangely upheaved within him and tossed and racked by a dozen conflicting doubts and passions had he gone too far had he yielded like adam to the woman who beguiled him had he given way like samson to the snares of delilah for the old scripture phraseology and imagery so long burned into his very nature clung to him still in spite of all his faltering changes of opinion had he said more than he thought and felt about the apostle even if he was going to revise his views was it right was it candid was it loyal to the truth that he should revise them under the biassing influence of meenies eyes if only he could have separated the two questionsthe apostles mission and the something which he felt growing up within him but he could notand as he suspected for a most excellent reason because the two were intimately bound up in the very warp and woof of his existence nature was asserting herself against the religious asceticism of the apostle it could not be so wrong for him to feel those feelings that had thrilled every heart in all his ancestors for innumerable generations  he was in love with meenie he knew that clearly now and this love was after all not such a wicked and terrible feeling on the contrary he felt all the better and the purer for it already but then that might merely be the horrible seductiveness of the thing was it not always typified by the cup of circe by the song of the sirens by all that was alluring and beautiful and hollow he paced up and down for half an hour and then he had sported his oak long ago he lit his little reading lamp and sat down in the big chair by the bay window running his eyes over his bookshelf he took out half by chance spencers sociology then from sheer weariness he read on for a while hardly heeding what he read at last he got interested and finished a chapter when he had finished it he put the book down and felt that the struggle was over strange that side by side in the same world in the same london there should exist two such utterly different types of man as herbert spencer and the gideonite apostle the last seemed to belong to the sixteenth century the first to some new and hitherto uncreated social world in an age which produced thinkers like that how could he ever have mistaken the poor bigoted narrow halfinstructed apostle for a divinely inspired teacher so far as paul owen was concerned the gideonite church and all that belonged to it had melted utterly into thin air  three days later after the eights in the early evening paul found an opportunity of speaking again alone with meenie he had taken their party on to the christchurch barge to see the race and he was strolling with them afterwards round the meadow walk by the bank of the cherwell paul managed to get a little in front with meenie and entered at once upon the subject of his late embarrassments  i have thought it all over since miss bolton he saidhe half hesitated whether he should say meenie or not and she was half disappointed that he didnt for they were both very young and very young people fall in love so unaffectedlyi have thought it all over and i have come to the conclusion that there is no help for it i must break openly with the church  of course said meenie simply that i understood  he smiled at her ingenuousness such a very forward young person and yet he liked it well the next thing is what to do about it you see i have really been obtaining my education so to speak under false pretences i cant continue taking these good peoples money after i have ceased to believe in their doctrines i ought to have faced the question sooner it was wrong of me to wait untiluntil it was forced upon me by other considerations  this time it was meenie who blushed but you dont mean to leave oxford without taking your degree she asked quickly  no i think it will be better not to stop here and try for a fellowship is my best chance of repaying these poor people the money which i have taken from them for no purpose  i never thought of that said meenie you are bound in honour to pay them back of course  paul liked the instantaneous honesty of that of course it marked the naturally honourable character for of course too they must wait to marry young people jump so till all that money was paid off fortunately he said i have lived economically and have not spent nearly as much as they guaranteed i got scholarships up to a hundred a year of my own and i only took a hundred a year of theirs they offered me two hundred but theres five years at a hundred that makes five hundred poundsa big debt to begin life with  never mind said meenie you will get a fellowship and in a few years you can pay it off  yes said paul i can pay it off but i can never pay off the hopes and aspirations i have blighted i must become a schoolmaster or a barrister or something of that sort and never repay them for their selfsacrifice and devotion in making me whatever i shall become they may get back their money but they will have lost their cherished apostle for ever  mr owen meenie answered solemnly the seal of the apostolate lies far deeper than that it was born in you and no act of yours can shake it off  meenie he said looking at her gently with a changed expressionmeenie we shall have to wait many years  never mind paul she replied as naturally as if he had been paul to her all her life long i can wait if you can but what will you do for the immediate present  i have my scholarship he said i can get on partly upon that and then i can take pupils and i have only one year more of it  so before they parted that night it was all well understood between them that paul was to declare his defection from the church at the earliest opportunity that he was to live as best he might till he could take his degree that he was then to pay off all the back debt and that after all these things he and meenie might get comfortably married whenever they were able as to the rector and his wife or any other parental authorities they both left them out in the cold as wholly as young people always do leave their elders out on all similar occasions  marias a born fool said the rector to his wife a week after meenies return i always knew she was a fool but i never knew she was quite such a fool as to permit a thing like this so far as i can get it out of edie and so far as edie can get it out of meenie i understand that she has allowed meenie to go and get herself engaged to some dissenter fellow a shaker or a mormon or a communist or something of the sort who is the son of a common labourer and has been sent up to oxford tom tells me by his own sect to be made into a gentleman so as to give some sort or colour of respectability to their absurd doctrines i shall send the girl to town at once to emilys and she shall stop there all next season to see if she cant manage to get engaged to some young man in decent society at any rate   iii  when paul owen returned to peckham for the long vacation it was with a heavy heart that he ventured back slowly to his fathers cottage margaret owen had put everything straight and neat in the little living room as she always did to welcome home her son who had grown into a gentleman and honest john stood at the threshold beaming with pleasure to wring pauls hand in his firm grip just back unwashed from his days labour after the first kissings and greetings were over john owen said rather solemnly i have bad news for you paul the apostle is sick even unto death  when paul heard that he was sorely tempted to put off the disclosure for the present but he felt he must not so that same night as they sat together in the dusk near the window where the geraniums stood he began to unburden his whole mind gently and tentatively so as to spare their feelings as much as possible to his father and mother he told them how since he went to oxford he had learned to think somewhat differently about many things how his ideas had gradually deepened and broadened how he had begun to inquire into fundamentals for himself how he had feared that the gideonites took too much for granted and reposed too implicitly on the supposed critical learning of their apostle as he spoke his mother listened in tearful silence but his father murmured from time to time i was afeard of this already paul i seen it coming now and again long ago there was pity and regret in his tone but not a shade of reproachfulness  at last however paul came to speak timidly and reservedly of meenie then his fathers eye began to flash a little and his breath came deeper and harder when paul told him briefly that he was engaged to her the strong man could stand it no longer he rose up in righteous wrath and thrust his son at arms length from him what he cried fiercely you dont mean to tell me you have fallen into sin and looked upon the daughters of midian it was no scriptural doubts that druv you on then but the desire of the flesh and the lust of the eyes that has lost you you dare to stand up there paul owen and tell me that you throw over the church and the apostle for the sake of a girl like a poor miserable samson you are no son of mine and i have nothin more to say to you  but margaret owen put her hand on his shoulder and said softly john let us hear him out and john recalled by that gentle touch listened once more then paul pleaded his case powerfully again he quoted scripture to them he argued with them after their own fashion and down to their own comprehension text by text he pitted his own critical and exegetical faculty against the apostles last of all he turned to his mother who tearful still and heartbroken with disappointment yet looked admiringly upon her learned eloquent boy and said to her tenderly remember mother you yourself were once in love you yourself once stood night after night leaning on the gate waiting with your heart beating for a footstep that you knew so well you yourself once counted the days and the hours and the minutes till the next meeting came and margaret owen touched to the heart by that simple appeal kissed him fervently a dozen times over the hot tears dropping on his cheek meanwhile and then contrary to all the rules of their austere church she flung her arms round her husband too and kissed him passionately the first time for twenty years with all the fervour of a floodgate loosed paul owens apostolate had surely borne its first fruit  the father stood for a moment in doubt and terror like one stunned or dazed and then in a moment of sudden remembrance stepped forward and returned the kiss the spell was broken and the apostles power was no more what else passed in the cottage that night when john owen fell upon his knees and wrestled in spirit was too wholly internal to the mans own soul for telling here next day john and margaret owen felt the dream of their lives was gone but the mother in her heart rejoiced to think her boy might know the depths of love and might bring home a real lady for his wife  on sunday it was rumoured that the apostles ailment was very serious but young brother paul owen would address the church he did so though not exactly in the way the church expected he told them simply and plainly how he had changed his views about certain matters how he thanked them from his heart for the loan of their money he was careful to emphasize the word loan which had helped him to carry on his education at oxford and how he would repay them the principal and interest though he could never repay them the kindness at the earliest possible opportunity he was so grave so earnest so transparently true that in spite of the downfall of their dearest hopes he carried the whole meeting with him all save one man that man was job grimshaw job rose from his place with a look of undisguised triumph as soon as paul had finished and mounting the platform quietly said his say  i knew episcops presbyters and brethren he began how this ere young man would finish i saw it the day he was appinted hes flushing up now the same as he flushed up then when i spoke to him and it aint sperritual its worldly pride and headstrongness thats what it is hes had our money and hes had his eddication and now hes going to round on us just as i said he would its all very well talking about paying us back hows a young man like him to get five hundred pounds i should like to know and if he did even what sort o repayment would that be to many of the brethren whove saved and scraped for five year to let him live like a gentleman among the great and the mighty o midian hes got his eddication out of us and he can keep that whatever happens and make a living out of it too and now hes going back on us same as i said he would and having got all he can out of the church hes going to chuck it away like a sucked orange i detest such backsliding and such ungratefulness  pauls cup of humiliation was full but he bit his lip till the blood almost came and made no answer  he boasted in his own strength job went on mercilessly that he wasnt going to be a backslider and he wasnt going to sign no bond and he wasnt going to confer with us but we must trust his honour and honesty and such like ive got his very words written down in my notebook ere for i made a note of em foreseeing this if wed a bound him down as i proposed he wouldnt a dared to go backsliding and rounding on us and making up to the daughters of midian as i dont doubt but what hes been doing pauls telltale face showed him at once that he had struck by accident on the right chord but if he ever goes bringing a daughter of midian here to peckham job continued well show her these very notes and ask her what she thinks of such dishonourable conduct the apostles dying thats clear and before he dies i warrant he shall know this treachery  paul could not stand that last threat though he had lost faith in the apostle as an apostle he could never forget the allegiance he had once borne him as a father or the spell which his powerful individuality had once thrown around him as a teacher to have embittered that mans dying bed with the shadow of a terrible disappointment would be to paul a lifelong subject of deep remorse i did not intend to open my mouth in answer to you mr grimshaw he said for the first time breaking through the customary address of brother but i pray you i entreat you i beseech you not to harass the apostle in his last moments with such a subject  oh yes i suppose so job grimshaw answered maliciously all the ingrained coarseness of the man breaking out in the wrinkles of his face no wonder you dont want him enlightened about your goings on with the daughters of midian when you must know as well as i do that his life aint worth a days purchase and that hes a man of independent means and has left you every penny hes got in his will because he believes youre a fit successor to the apostolate i know it for i signed as a witness and i read it through being a short one while the other witness was signing and you must know it as well as i do i suppose you dont think hell make another will now but theres time enough to burn that one anyhow  paul owen stood aghast at the vulgar baseness of which this lewd fellow supposed him capable he had never thought of it before and yet it flashed across his mind in a moment how obvious it was now of course the apostle would leave him his money he was being educated for the apostolate and the apostolate could not be carried on without the sinews of war but that job grimshaw should think him guilty of angling for the apostles money and then throwing the church overboardthe bare notion of it was so horrible to him that he could not even hold up his head to answer the taunt he sat down and buried his crimson face in his hands and job grimshaw taking up his hat sturdily with the air of a man who has to perform an unpleasant duty left the meetingroom abruptly without another word  there was a gloomy sunday dinner that morning in the masons cottage and nobody seemed much inclined to speak in any way but as they were in the midst of their solemn meal a neighbour who was also a gideonite came in hurriedly its all over he said breathlessall over with us and with the church the apostle is dead he died this morning  margaret owen found voice to ask before job grimshaw saw him  the neighbour nodded yes  thank heaven for that cried paul then he did not die misunderstanding me  and youll get his money added the neighbour for i was the other witness  paul drew a long breath i wish meenie was here he said i must see her about this   iv  a few days later the apostle was buried and his will was read over before the assembled church by earnest persuasion of his father paul consented to be present though he feared another humiliation from job grimshaw but two days before he had taken the law into his own hands by writing to meenie at her aunts in eaton place and that very indiscreet young lady in response had actually consented to meet him in kensington gardens alone the next afternoon there he sat with her on one of the benches by the serpentine and talked the whole matter over with her to his hearts content  if the money is really left to me he said i must in honour refuse it it was left to me to carry on the apostolate and i cant take it on any other ground but what ought i to do with it i cant give it over to the church for in three days there will be no church left to give it to what shall i do with it  why said meenie thoughtfully if i were you i should do this first pay back everybody who contributed towards your support in full principal and interest then borrow from the remainder as much as you require to complete your oxford course and finally pay back all that and the other money to the fund when you are able and hand it over for the purpose of doing some good work in peckham itself where your church was originally founded if the ideal cant be fulfilled let the money do something good for the actual  you are quite right meenie said paul except in one particular i will not borrow from the fund for my own support i will not touch a penny of it temporarily or permanently for myself in any way if it comes to me i shall make it over to trustees at once for some good object as you suggest and shall borrow from them five hundred pounds to repay my own poor people giving the trustees my bond to repay the fund hereafter i shall fight my own battle henceforth unaided  you will do as you ought to do paul and i am proud of it  so next morning when the meeting took place paul felt somewhat happier in his own mind as to the course he should pursue with reference to job grimshaw  the senior episcop opened and read the last will and testament of arthur murgess attorneyatlaw it provided in a few words that all his estate real and personal should pass unreservedly to his friend paul owen of christchurch oxford it was whispered about that besides the house and grounds the personalty might be sworn at £8000 a vast sum to those simple people  when the reading was finished paul rose and addressed the assembly he told them briefly the plan he had formed and insisted on his determination that not a penny of the money should be put to his own uses he would face the world for himself and thanks to their kindness he could face it easily enough he would still earn and pay back all that he owed them he would use the fund first for the good of those who had been members of the church and afterwards for the good of the people of peckham generally and he thanked them from the bottom of his heart for the kindness they had shown him  even job grimshaw could only mutter to himself that this was not sperritual grace but mere worldly pride and stubbornness lest the lad should betray his evil designs which had thus availed him nothing he has lost his own soul and wrecked the church for the sake of the money job said and now he dassnt touch a farden of it  next john owen rose and said slowly friends it seems to me we may as well all confess that this church has gone to pieces i cant stop in it myself any longer for i see its clear agin nature and whats agin nature cant be true and though the assembly said nothing it was plain that there were many waverers in the little body whom the affairs of the last week had shaken sadly in their simple faith indeed as a matter of fact before the end of the month the gideonite church had melted away member by member till nobody at all was left of the whole assembly but job grimshaw  my dear said the rector to his wife a few weeks later laying down his illustrated this is really a very curious thing that young fellow owen of christchurch that meenie fancied herself engaged to has just come into a little landed property and eight or nine thousand pounds on his own account he must be better connected than tom imagines perhaps we might make inquiries about him after all  the rector did make inquiries in the course of the week and with such results that he returned to the rectory in blank amazement that fellows mad amelia he said stark mad if ever anybody was the leader of his little bethel or ebenezer or whatever it may be has left him all his property absolutely without conditions and the idiot of a boy declares he wont touch a penny of it because hes ceased to believe in their particular shibboleth and he thinks the leader wanted him to succeed him very right and proper of him of course to leave the sect if he cant reconcile it with his conscience but perfectly quixotic of him to give up the money and beggar himself outright even if his connection was otherwise desirable which it is far from being it would be absurd to think of letting meenie marry such a ridiculous hairbrained fellow  paul and meenie however went their own way as young people often will in spite of the rector paul returned next term to oxford penniless but full of resolution and by dint of taking pupils managed to eke out his scholarship for the next year at the end of that time he took his first in greats and shortly after gained a fellowship from the very first day he began saving money to pay off that dead weight of five hundred pounds the kindly exgideonites had mostly protested against his repaying them at all but in vain paul would not make his entry into life he said under false pretences it was a hard pull but he did it he took pupils he lectured he wrote well and vigorously for the press he worked late and early with volcanic energy and by the end of three years he had not only saved the whole of the sum advanced by the gideonites but had also begun to put away a little nestegg against his marriage with meenie and when the editor of a great morning paper in london offered him a permanent place upon the staff at a large salary he actually went down to worcestershire saw the formidable rector himself in his own parish and demanded meenie outright in marriage and the rector observed to his wife that this young owen seemed a wellbehaved and amiable young man that after all one neednt know anything about his relations if one didnt like and that as meenie had quite made up her mind and was as headstrong as a mule there was no use trying to oppose her any longer  down in peckham where paul owen lives and is loved by half the poor of the district no one has forgotten who was the real founder of the murgess institute which does so much good in encouraging thrift and is so admirably managed by the founder and his wife he would take a house nowhere but at peckham he said to the peckham people he owed his education and for the peckham people he would watch the working of his little institute there is no better work being done anywhere in that great squalid desert the east and southeast of london there is no influence more magnetic than the founders john and margaret owen have recovered their hopes for their boy only they run now in another and more feasible direction and those who witness the good that is being done by the institute among the poor of peckham or who have read that remarkable and brilliant economical work lately published on the future of cooperation in the east end by p o venture to believe that meenie was right after all and that even the great social world itself has not yet heard the last of young paul owens lay apostolate     the mysterious occurrence in piccadilly   i  i really never felt so profoundly ashamed of myself in my whole life as when my fatherinlaw professor w bryce murray of oriel college oxford sent me the last number of the proceedings of the society for the investigation of supernatural phenomena as i opened the pamphlet a horrible foreboding seized me that i should find in it detailed at full length with my name and address in plain printing not even asterisks that extraordinary story of his about the mysterious occurrence in piccadilly i turned anxiously to page 14 which i saw was neatly folded over at the corner and there sure enough i came upon the professors remarkable narrative which i shall simply extract here by way of introduction in his own admirable and perspicuous language  i wish to communicate to the society says my respected relation a curious case of wraiths or doubles which came under my own personal observation and for which i can vouch on my own authority and that of my soninlaw dr owen mansfield keeper of accadian antiquities at the british museum it is seldom indeed that so strange an example of a supernatural phenomenon can be independently attested by two trustworthy scientific observers both still living  on the 12th of may 1873i made a note of the circumstance at the time and am therefore able to feel perfect confidence as to the strict accuracy of my factsi was walking down piccadilly about four oclock in the afternoon when i saw a simulacrum or image approaching me from the opposite direction exactly resembling in outer appearance an undergraduate of oriel college of the name of owen mansfield it must be carefully borne in mind that at this time i was not related or connected with mr mansfield in any way his marriage with my daughter having taken place some eleven months later i only knew him then as a promising junior member of my own college i was just about to approach and address mr mansfield when a most singular and mysterious event took place the simulacrum appeared spontaneously to glide up towards me with a peculiarly rapid and noiseless motion waved a wand or staff which it bore in its hands thrice round my head and then vanished hastily in the direction of an hotel which stands at the corner of albemarle street i followed it quickly to the door but on inquiry of the porter i learned that he himself had observed nobody enter the simulacrum seems to have dissipated itself or become invisible suddenly in the very act of passing through the folding glass portals which give access to the hotel from piccadilly  that same evening by the last post i received a hastilywritten note from mr mansfield bearing the oxford postmark dated oriel college 5 pm and relating the facts of an exactly similar apparition which had manifested itself to him with absolute simultaneity of occurrence on the very day and hour when i had seen mr mansfields wraith in piccadilly mr mansfield himself was walking down the corn market in oxford in the direction of the taylor institute as he approached the corner he saw what he took to be a vision or image of myself his tutor moving towards him in my usual leisurely manner suddenly as he was on the point of addressing me with regard to my aristotle lecture the next morning the image glided up to him in a rapid and evasive manner shook a green silk umbrella with a rhinoceroshorn handle three times around his head and then disappeared incomprehensibly through the door of the randolph hotel returning to college in a state of breathless alarm and surprise at what he took to be an act of incipient insanity or extreme inebriation on my part mr mansfield learnt from the porter to his intense astonishment that i was at that moment actually in london unable to conceal his amazement at this strange event he wrote me a full account of the facts while they were still fresh in his memory and as i preserve his note to this day i append a copy of it to my present communication for publication in the societys transactions  there is one small point in the above narrative to which i would wish to call special attention and that is the accurate description given by mr mansfield of the umbrella carried by the apparition he observed in oxford this umbrella exactly coincided in every particular with the one i was then actually carrying in piccadilly but what is truly remarkable and what stamps the occurrence as a genuine case of supernatural intervention is the fact that mr mansfield could not possibly ever have seen that umbrella in my hands because i had only just that afternoon purchased it at a shop in bond street this to my mind conclusively proves that no mere effort of fancy or visual delusion based upon previous memories vague or conscious could have had anything whatsoever to do with mr mansfields observation at least it was in short distinctly an objective apparition as distinguished from a mere subjective reminiscence or hallucination  as i laid down the proceedings on the breakfast table with a sigh i said to my wife who had been looking over my shoulder while i read now nora were really in for it what on earth do you suppose id better do  nora looked at me with her laughing eyes laughing harder and brighter than ever my dear owen she said putting the proceedings promptly into the waste paper basket theres really nothing on earth possible now except to make a clean breast of it  i groaned i suppose youre right i answered but its a precious awkward thing to have to do however here goes so i sat down at once with pen ink and paper at my desk to draw up this present narrative as to the real facts about the mysterious occurrence in piccadilly   ii  in 1873 i was a fourthyear man going in for my greats at the june examination but as if aristotle and mill and the affair of corcyra were not enough to occupy one young fellows head at the age of twentythree i had foolishly gone and fallen in love undergraduate fashion with the only really pretty girl i insist upon putting it though nora has struck it out with her pen in all oxford she was the daughter of my tutor professor bryce murray and her name as the astute reader will already have inferred was nora  the professor had lost his wife some years before and he was left to bring up nora by his own devices with the aid of his sister miss lydia amelia murray the wellknown advocate of female education womans rights antivaccination vegetarianism the tichborne claimant and psychic force nora however had no fancy for any of these multifarious interests of her aunts i have reason to believe she takes rather after her mothers family and miss lydia amelia murray early decided that she was a girl of no intellectual tastes of any sort who had better be kept at school at south kensington as much as possible especially did aunt lydia hold it to be undesirable that nora should ever come in contact with that very objectionable and wholly antagonistic animal the oriel undergraduate undergraduates were well known to laugh openly at womans rights to devour underdone beefsteaks with savage persistence and to utter most irreverent and ribald jests about psychic force  still it is quite impossible to keep the orbit of a professors daughter from occasionally crossing that of a stray meteoric undergraduate nora only came home to oxford in vacation time but during the preceding long i had stopped up for the sake of pursuing my accadian studies in a quiet spot and it was then that i first quite accidentally met nora i was canoeing on the cherwell one afternoon when i came across the professor and his daughter in a punt and saw the prettiest girl in all oxford actually holding the pole in her own pretty little hands while that lazy old man lolled back at his ease with a book on the luxurious cushions in the stern as i passed the punt i capped the professor of course and looking back a minute later i observed that the pretty daughter had got her pole stuck fast in the mud and couldnt with all her force pull it out again in another minute she had lost her hold of it and the punt began to drift of itself down the river towards iffley  common politeness naturally made me put back my canoe extricate the pole and hand it as gracefully as i could to the professors daughter as i did so i attempted to raise my straw hat cautiously with one hand while i gave back the pole with the other an attempt which of course compelled me to lay down my paddle on the front of the canoe as i happen to be only provided with two hands instead of four like our earlier ancestors i dont know whether it was my instantaneous admiration for noras pretty blush which distracted my attention from the purely practical question of equilibrium or whether it was her own awkwardness and modesty in taking the pole or finally whether it was my tutors freezing look that utterly disconcerted me but at any rate just at that moment something unluckily or rather luckily caused me to lose my balance altogether now everybody knows that a canoe is very easily upset and in a moment before i knew exactly where i was i found the canoe floating bottom upward about three yards away from me and myself standing safe and dry in my tutors punt beside his pretty blushing daughter i had felt the canoe turning over as i handed back the pole and had instinctively jumped into the safer refuge of the punt which saved me at least the ignominy of appearing before miss nora murray in the ungraceful attitude of clambering back wet and dripping into an upset canoe  the inexorable logic of facts had thus convinced the professor of the impossibility of keeping all undergraduates permanently at a safe distance and there was nothing open for him now except resignedly to acquiesce in the situation so created for him however much he might object to my presence he could hardly as a christian and a gentleman request me to jump in and swim after my canoe or even when we had at last successfully brought it alongside with the aid of the pole to seat myself once more on the soaking cushions after all my mishap had come about in the endeavour to render him a service so he was fain with what grace he could to let me relieve his daughter of the pole and punt him back as far as the barges with my own moist and uncomfortable bark trailing casually from the stern  as for nora being thus thrown unexpectedly into the dangerous society of that gruesome animal the oriel undergraduate i think i may venture to say from my subsequent experience that she was not wholly disposed to regard the creature as either so objectionable or so ferocious as she had been previously led to imagine we got on together so well that i could see the professor growing visibly wrathful about the corners of the mouth and by the time we reached the barges he could barely be civil enough to say good morning to me when we parted  an introduction however no matter how obtained is really in these matters absolutely everything as long as you dont know a pretty girl you dont know her and you cant take a step in advance without an introduction but when once you do know her heaven and earth and aunts and fathers may try their hardest to prevent you and yet whatever they try they cant keep you out i was so far struck with nora that i boldly ventured whenever i met her out walking with her father or her aunt to join myself to the party and though they never hesitated to show me that my presence was not rapturously welcomed they couldnt well say to me pointblank have the goodness mr mansfield to go away and not to speak to me again in future so the end of it was that before the beginning of october term nora and i understood one another perfectly and had even managed in a few minutes têteàtête in the parks to whisper to one another the ingenuous vows of sweet seventeen and twoandtwenty  when the professor discovered that i had actually written a letter to his daughter marked private and confidential his wrath knew no bounds he sent for me to his rooms and spoke to me severely ive half a mind mansfield he said to bring the matter before a college meeting at any rate this conduct must not be repeated if it is sirhe didnt finish the sentence preferring to terrify me by the effective figure of speech which commentators describe as an aposiopesis and i left him with a vague sense that if it was repeated i should probably incur the penalties of præmunire whatever they may be or be hanged drawn and quartered with my head finally stuck as an adornment on the acute wings of the griffin vice temple bar removed  next day nora met me casually at a confectioners in the high where i will frankly confess that i was engaged in experimenting upon the relative merits of raspberry cream and lemon water ices she gave me her hand timidly and whispered to me half under her breath papas so dreadfully angry owen and im afraid i shall never be able to meet you any more for hes going to send me back this very afternoon to south kensington and keep me away from oxford altogether in future i saw her eyes were red with crying and that she really thought our little romance was entirely at an end  my darling nora i replied in an undertone even south kensington is not so unutterably remote that i shall never be able to see you there write to me whenever you are able and let me know where i can write to you my dear little nora if there were a hundred papas and a thousand aunt lydias interposed in a square between us dont you know we should manage all the same to love one another and to overcome all difficulties  nora smiled and half cried at once and then discreetly turned to order half a pound of glacé cherries and that was the last that i saw of her for the time at oxford  during the next term or two im afraid i must admit that the relations between my tutor and myself were distinctly strained so much so as continually to threaten the breaking out of open hostilities it wasnt merely that nora was in question but the professor also suspected me of jeering in private at his psychical investigations and if the truth must be told i will admit that his suspicions were not wholly without justification it began to be whispered among the undergraduates just then that the professor and his sister had taken to turning planchettes interrogating easychairs and obtaining interesting details about the present abode of shakespeare or milton from intelligent and wellinformed fiveoclock teatables it had long been well known that the professor took a deep interest in haunted houses considered that the portents recorded by livy must have something in them and declared himself unable to be sceptical as to facts which had convinced such great men as plato seneca and samuel johnson but the tableturning was a new fad and we noisy undergraduates occasionally amused ourselves by getting up an amateur séance in imitation of the professor and eliciting psychical truths often couched in a surprisingly slangy or even indecorous dialect from a very lively though painfully irreverent spirit who discoursed to us through the material intervention of a rickety whatnot however as the only mediums we employed were the very unprofessional ones of two plain decanters respectively containing port and sherry the professor who was a teetotaler and who paid five guineas a séance for the services of that distinguished psychical specialist dr grade considered the interesting results we obtained as wholly beneath the dignity of scientific inquiry he even most unworthily endeavoured to stifle research by gating us all one evening when a materialized spirit assuming the outer form of the junior exhibitioner sang a comic song of the period in a loud voice with the windows open and accompanied itself noisily with a psychical tattoo on the rickety whatnot the professor went so far as to observe sarcastically that our results appeared to him to be rather spirituous than spiritual  on may 11 1873 i will endeavour to rival the professor in accuracy and preciseness i got a short note from dear nora dated from south kensington which i too though not from psychical motives have carefully preserved i will not publish it however either here or in the societys proceedings for reasons which will probably be obvious to any of my readers who happen ever to have been placed in similar circumstances themselves disengaging the kernel of fact from the irrelevant matter in which it was imbedded i may state that nora wrote me somewhat to this effect she was going next day to the academy with the parents of some schoolfellow could i manage to run up to town for the day go to the academy myself and meet her quite accidentally you know dear in the watercolour room about halfpast eleven  this was rather awkward for next day as it happened was precisely the professors morning for the herodotus lecture but circumstances like mine at that moment know no law so i succeeded in excusing myself from attendance somehow or other i hope truthfully and took the nine am express up to town shortly after eleven i was at the academy and waiting anxiously for noras arrival that dear little hypocrite the moment she saw me approach assumed such an inimitable air of infantile surprise and innocent pleasure at my unexpected appearance that i positively blushed for her wicked powers of deception  you here mr mansfield she cried in a tone of the most apparently unaffected astonishment why i thought it was full term time surely you ought to be up at oriel  so i am i answered officially but in my private capacity ive come up for the day to look at the pictures  oh how nice said that shocking little nora with a smile that was childlike and bland mr mansfield is such a great critic mrs worplesdon he knows all about art and artists and so on hell be able to tell us which pictures we ought to admire you know and which arent worth looking at mr worplesdon let me introduce you mrs worplesdonmiss worplesdon how very lucky we should have happened to come across you mr mansfield  the worplesdons fell immediately like lambs into the trap so ingenuously spread for them indeed i have always noticed that ninetynine per cent of the british public when turned into an artgallery are only too glad to accept the opinion of anybody whatsoever who is bold enough to have one and to express it openly having thus been thrust by nora into the arduous position of critic by appointment to the worplesdon party i delivered myself ex cathedrâ forthwith upon the merits and demerits of the entire exhibition and i was so successful in my critical views that i not only produced an immense impression upon mr worplesdon himself but also observed many ladies in the neighbourhood nudge one another as they gazed intently backward and forward between wall and catalogue and heard them whisper audibly among themselves a gentleman here says the flesh tones on that shoulder are simply marvellous or that artist in the tweed suit behind us thinks the careless painting of the ferns in the foreground quite unworthy of such a colourist as daubiton so highly was my criticism appreciated in fact that mr worplesdon even invited me to lunch with nora and his party at a neighbouring restaurant where i spent the most delightful hour i had passed for the last halfyear in the company of that naughty mendacious little schemer  about four oclock however the worplesdons departed taking nora with them to south kensington and i prepared to walk back in the direction of paddington meaning to catch an evening train and return to oxford i was strolling in a leisurely fashion along piccadilly towards the park and looking into all the photographers windows when suddenly an awful apparition loomed upon methe professor himself coming round the corner from bond street folding up a new rhinoceroshandled umbrella as he walked along in a moment i felt that all was lost i was up in town without leave the professor would certainly see me and recognize me he would ask me how and why i had left the university contrary to rules and i must then either tell him the whole truth which would get nora into a fearful scrape or else run the risk of being sent down in disgrace which might prevent me from taking a degree and would at least cause my father and mother an immense deal of unmerited trouble  like a flash of lightning a wild idea shot instantaneously across my brain might i pretend to be my own double the professor was profoundly superstitious on the subject of wraiths apparitions ghosts brainwaves and supernatural appearances generally if i could only manage to impose upon him for a moment by doing something outrageously uncommon or eccentric i might succeed in stifling further inquiry by setting him from the beginning on a false track which he was naturally prone to follow before i had time to reflect upon the consequences of my act the wild idea had taken possession of me body and soul and had worked itself out in action with all the rapidity of a mad impulse i rushed frantically up to the professor with my eyes fixed in a vacant stare on a point in space somewhere above the tops of the chimneypots i waved my stick three times mysteriously around his head and then without giving him time to recover from his surprise or to address a single word to me i bolted off in a red indian dance to the nearest corner  there was an hotel there which i had often noticed before though i had never entered it and i rushed wildly in meaning to get out as best i could when the professor who is very shortsighted had passed on along piccadilly in search of me but fortune as usual favoured the bold luckily it was a corner house and to my surprise i found when i got inside it that the hall opened both ways with a door on to the side street the porter was looking away as i entered so i merely ran in of one door and out of the other never stopping till i met a hansom into which i jumped and ordered the man to drive to paddington i just caught the 435 to oxford and by a little over six oclock i was in my own rooms at oriel  it was very wrong of me indeed i acknowledge it now but the whole thing had flashed across my undergraduate mind so rapidly that i carried it out in a moment before i could at all realize what a very foolish act i was really committing to take a rise out of the professor and to save nora an angry interview were the only ideas that occurred to me at the second when i began to reflect upon it afterwards i was conscious that i had really practised a very gross and wicked deception however there was no help for it now and as i rolled along in the train to oxford i felt that to save myself and nora from utter disgrace i must carry the plot out to the end without flinching it then occurred to me that a double apparition would be more in accordance with all recognized principles of psychical manifestation than a single one at reading therefore i regret to say i bought a pencil and a sheet of paper and an envelope and before i reached oxford station i had written to the professor what i now blush to acknowledge as a tissue of shocking fables in which i paralleled every particular of my own behaviour to him by a similar imaginary piece of behaviour on his part to me only changing the scene to oxford it was awfully wrong i admit at the time however being yet but little more than a schoolboy after all i regarded it simply in the light of a capital practical joke i informed the professor gravely how i had seen him at four oclock in the corn market and how astonished i was when i found him waving his green silk umbrella three times wildly around my head  the moment i arrived at oxford i dashed up to college in a hansom and got the professors address in london from the porter he had gone up to town for the night it seemed probably to visit nora and would not be back in college till the next morning then i rushed down to the postoffice where i was just in time with an extra stamp to catch the last post for that nights delivery the moment the letter was in the box i repented and began to fear i had gone too far and when i got back to my own rooms at last and went down late for dinner in hall i confess i trembled not a little as to the possible effect of my quite too bold and palpable imposition  next morning by the second post i got a long letter from the professor which completely relieved me from all immediate anxiety as to his interpretation of my conduct he rose to the fly with a charming simplicity which showed how delighted he was at this personal confirmation of all his own most cherished superstitions my dear mansfield his letter began now hear what at the very selfsame hour and minute happened to me in piccadilly in fact he had swallowed the whole thing entire without a single moments scepticism or hesitation  from what i heard afterwards it was indeed a lucky thing for me that i had played him this shocking trick for nora believes he was then actually on his way to south kensington on purpose to forbid her most stringently from holding any further communication with me in any way but as soon as this mysterious event took place he began to change his mind about me altogether so remarkable an apparition could not have happened except for some good and weighty reason he argued and he suspected that the reason might have something to do with my intentions towards nora why when he was on his way to warn her against me should a vision bearing my outer and bodily shape come straight across his path and by vehement signs of displeasure endeavour to turn him from his purpose unless it were clearly well for nora that my attentions should not be discouraged  from that day forth the professor began to ask me to his rooms and address me far more cordially than he used to do before he even on the strength of my singular adventure invited me to assist at one or two of his psychical séances here i must confess i was not entirely successful the distinguished medium complained that i exerted a repellent effect upon the spirits who seemed to be hurt by my want of generous confidence in their good intentions and by my suspicious habit of keeping my eyes too sharply fixed upon the legs of the tables he declared that when i was present an adverse influence seemed to pervade the room due apparently to my painful lack of spiritual sympathies but the professor condoned my failure in the regular psychical line in consideration of my brilliant success as a beholder of wraiths and visions after i took my degree that summer he used all his influence to procure me the post of keeper of the accadian antiquities at the museum for which my previous studies had excellently fitted me and by his friendly aid i was enabled to obtain the post though i regret to say that in spite of his credulity in supernatural matters he still refuses to believe in the correctness of my conjectural interpretation of the celebrated amalekite cylinders imported by mr ananias which i have deciphered in so very simple and satisfactory a manner as everybody knows my translation may be regarded as perfectly certain if only one makes the very modest assumption that the cylinders were originally engraved upside down by an aztec captive who had learned broken accadian with a bad accent from a chinese exile and who occasionally employed egyptian hieroglyphics in incorrect senses to piece out his own very imperfect idiom and doubtful spelling of the early babylonian language the solitary real doubt in the matter is whether certain extraordinary marks in the upper lefthand corner of the cylinder are to be interpreted as accidental scratches or as a picture representing the triumph of a king over seven bound prisoners or finally as an accadian sentence in cuneiforms which may be translated either as to the memory of om the great or else as pithor the high priest dedicates a fat goose to the family dinner on the 25th of the month of mid winter every candid and unprejudiced mind must admit that these small discrepancies or alternatives in the opinions of experts can cast no doubt at all upon the general soundness of the method employed but persons like the professor while ready to accept any evidence at all where their own prepossessions are concerned can never be induced to believe such plain and unvarnished statements of simple scientific knowledge  however the end of it all was that before i had been a month at the museum i had obtained the professors consent to my marriage with nora and as i had had noras own consent long before we were duly joined together in holy matrimony early in october at oxford and came at once to live in hampstead so as it turned out i finally owed the sweetest and best little wife in all christendom to the mysterious occurrence in piccadilly     carvalho   i  the first time i ever met ernest carvalho was just before the regimental dance at newcastle i had ridden up the port royal mountains that same morning from our decaying sugar estate in the liguanca plain and i was to stop in cantonments with the majors wife fat little mrs venn who had promised my mother that she would undertake to chaperon me to this my earliest military party i wont deny that i looked forward to it immensely for i was then a girl of only eighteen fresh out from school in england where i had been living away from our family ever since i was twelve years old dear mamma was a jamaican lady of the old school completely overpowered by the ingrained west indian indolence and if i had waited to go to a dance till i could get her to accompany me i might have waited till doomsday or probably later so i was glad enough to accept fat little mrs venns proffered protection and to go up the hills on my surefooted mountain pony while isaac the black stableboy ran up behind me carrying on his thick head the small portmanteau that contained my plain white balldress  as i went up the steep mountainpath alonefor ladies ride only with such an unmounted domestic escort in jamaicai happened to overtake a tall gentleman with a handsome rather jewish face and a pair of extremely lustrous black eyes who was mounted on a beautiful chestnut mare just in front of me the horsepaths in the port royal mountains are very narrow being mere zigzag ledges cut halfway up the precipitous green slopes of fern and clubmoss so that there is seldom room for two horses to pass abreast and it is necessary to wait at some convenient corner whenever you see another rider coming in the opposite direction at the first opportunity the tall jewishlooking gentleman drew aside in such a corner and waited for me to pass pray dont wait i said as soon as i saw what he meant your horse will get up faster than my pony and if i go in front i shall keep you back unnecessarily  not at all he answered raising his hat gracefully you are a stranger in the hills i see it is the rule of these mountainpaths always to give a lady the lead if i go first and my mare breaks into a canter on a bit of level your pony will try to catch her up on the steep slopes and that is always dangerous  seeing he did not intend to move till i did i waived the point at last and took the lead from that moment i dont know what on earth came over my lazy old pony he refused to go at more than a walk or at best a jogtrot the whole way to newcastle now the rise from the plain to the cantonments is about four thousand feet i think i am a dreadfully bad hand at remembering figures and the distance cant be much less i suppose than seven miles during all that time you never see a soul except a few negro pickaninnies playing in the dustheaps not a human habitation except a few huts embowered in mangoes hibiscusbushes and treeferns at first we kept a decorous silence not having been introduced to one another but the strangers mare followed close at my ponys heels pull her in as he would and it seemed really too ridiculous to be solemnly pacing after one another single file in this way for a couple of hours without speaking a word out of pure punctiliousness so at last we broke the ice and long before we got to newcastle we had struck up quite an acquaintance with one another it is wonderful how well two people can get mutually known in the course of two hours têteàtête especially under such peculiar circumstances you are just near enough to one another for friendly chat and yet not too near for casual strangers and then isaac with the portmanteau behind was quite sufficient escort to satisfy the convenances in england ones groom would have to be mounted which always seems to me in my simplicity a distinction without a difference  mr carvalho was on his way up to newcastle on the same errand as myself to go to the dance he might have been twenty i suppose and to a girl of eighteen boys of twenty seem quite men already he was a clerk in a government office in kingston and was going to stop with a sub at newcastle for a week or two on leave i did not know much about men in those days but i needed little knowledge of the subject to tell me that ernest carvalho was decidedly clever as soon as the first chill wore off our conversation he kept me amused the whole way by his bright sketchy talk about the petty dignitaries of a colonial capital there was his excellency for the time being and there was the right reverend of that day and there was the honourable colonial secretary and there was the honourable director of roads and there were a number of other assorted honourables whose queer little peculiarities he hit off dexterously in the quaintest manner not that there was any unkindly satire in his brilliant conversation on the contrary he evidently liked most of the men he talked about and seemed only to read and realize their characters so thoroughly that they spoke for themselves in his dramatic anecdotes he appeared to me a more genial copy of thackeray in a colonial society with all the sting gone and only the skilful delineation of men and women left i had never met anybody before and i have never met anybody since who struck me so instantaneously with the idea of innate genius as ernest carvalho  you have been in england of course i said as we were nearing newcastle  no never he answered i am a jamaican born and bred i have never been out of the island  i was surprised for he seemed so different from any of the young planters i had met at our house most of whom had never opened a book apparently in the course of their lives while mr carvalhos talk was full of indefinite literary flavour where were you educated then i asked  i never was educated anywhere he answered laughing i went to a small school at port antonio during my fathers life but for the most part i have picked up whatever i know and thats not much wholly by myself of course french like reading and writing comes by nature and i got enough spanish to dip into cervantes from the cuban refugees latin one has to grind up out of books naturally and as for greek im sorry to say i know very little though of course i can spell out homer a bit and even Æschylus but my hobby is natural science and there a fellow has to make his own way here for hardly anything has been done at the beasts and the flowers in the west indies yet but if i live i mean to work them up in time and ive made a fair beginning already  this reasonable list of accomplishments given modestly not boastfully by a young man of twenty wholly selftaught fairly took my breath away i was inspired at once with a secret admiration for mr carvalho he was so handsome and so clever that i think i was halfinclined to fall in love with him at first sight to say the truth i believe almost all love is love at first sight and for my own part i wouldnt give you a thankyou for any other kind  here we must part he said as we reached a fork in the narrow path just outside the steep hogs back on which newcastle stands unless you will allow me to see you safely as far as mrs venns the path to the right leads to the majors quarters this on the left takes me to my friend camerons hut may i see you to the majors door  no thank you i answered decidedly isaac is escort enough we shall meet again this evening  perhaps then he suggested i may have the pleasure of a dance with you of course its quite irregular of me to ask you now but we shall be formally introduced no doubt tonight and im afraid if you lunch at the venns your card will be filled up by the 99th men before i can edge myself in anywhere for a dance will you allow me  certainly i said what shall it be the first waltz  you are very kind he answered taking out a pencil you know my namecarvalho what may i put down for yours i havent heard it yet  miss hazleden i replied of palmettos  mr carvalho gave a little start of surprise miss hazleden of palmettos he said half to himself with a rather pained expression miss hazleden then perhaps id betterwell why not why not indeed palmettosyes i will turning to me he said louder thank you till this evening then and raising his hat he hurried sharply round the corner of the hill  what was there in my name i wondered which made him so evidently hesitate and falter  fat little mrs venn was very kind and not a very strict chaperon but i judged it best not to mention to her this romantic episode of the handsome stranger however during the course of lunch i ventured casually to ask her husband whether he knew of any family in jamaica of the name of carvalho  carvalho answered the major bless my soul yes old settled family in the island jews live down savannahlamar way been here ever since the spanish time doocid clever fellows too and rich most of them  jews i thought ah yes mr carvalho had a very handsome jewish type of face and dark eyes but why yes surely i heard him speak several times of having been to church and once of the cathedral at spanish town this was curious  are any of them christians i asked again  not a man answered the major not a man my dear good old jewish family jews in jamaica never turn christians nothing to gain by it  the dance took place in the big messroom looking out on the fanpalms and treeferns of the regimental garden it was a lovely tropical night moonlight of course for all jamaican entertainments are given at full moon so as to let the people who ride from a distance get to and fro safely over the breakneck mountain horsepaths the windows which open down to the ground were flung wide for the sake of ventilation and thus the terrace and garden were made into a sort of vestibule where partners might promenade and cool themselves among the tropical flowers after the heat of dancing and yet i dont know how it is though the climate is so hot in jamaica i never danced anywhere so much or felt the heat so little oppressive  before the first waltz mr carvalho came up accompanied by my old friend dr wade and was properly introduced to me by that time my card was pretty full for of course i was a belle in those days and being just fresh out from england was rather run after but i will confess that i had taken the liberty of filling in three later waltzes unasked with mr carvalhos name for i knew by his very look that he could waltz divinely and i do love a good partner he did waltz divinely but at the end of the dance i was really afraid he didnt mean to ask me again when he did a little hesitatingly i said i had still three vacancies and found he had not yet asked anybody else i enjoyed those four dances more than any others that evening the more so perhaps as i saw my cousin harry verner of agualta was dying with jealousy because i danced so much with mr carvalho  i must just say a word or two about harry verner he was a planter pur sang and agualta was one of the few really flourishing sugar estates then left on the island harry was therefore naturally regarded as rather a catch but for my part i could never care for any man who has only three subjects of conversationhimself vacuumpan sugar and the wickedness of the french bounty system which keeps the poor planter out of his own so i danced away with mr carvalho partly because i liked him just a little you know but partly also i will frankly admit because i saw it annoyed harry verner  at the end of our fourth dance i was strolling with mr carvalho among the great bushy poinsettias and plumbagos on the terrace under the beautiful soft green light of that tropical moon when harry verner came from one of the windows directly upon us i suppose youve forgotten edith he said that youre engaged to me for the next lancers mr carvalho i know you are to dance with miss wade hadnt you better go and look for your partner  he spoke pointedly almost rudely and mr carvalho took the hint at once as soon as he was gone harry turned round to me fiercely and said in a low angry voice you shall not dance this lancers you shall sit it out with me here in the garden come over to the seat in the far corner  he led me resistlessly to the seat away from the noise of the regimental band and the dancers and then sat himself down at the far end from me like a great surly bear that he was  a pretty fool youve been making of yourself tonight edith he said in a tone of suppressed anger with that fellow carvalho do you know who he is miss do you know who he is  no i answered faintly fearing he was going to assure me that my clever new acquaintance was a notorious swindler or a runaway ticketofleave man  well then ill tell you he cried angrily ill tell you hes a coloured man miss thats what he is  a coloured man i exclaimed in surprise why hes as white as you and i are every bit as white harry  so he may be to look at answered my cousin but a brown mans a brown man all the same however much white blood he may have in him you can never breed the nigger out confound his impudence asking you to dance four times with him in a single evening you too of all girls in the island confound his impudence why his mother was a slave girl once on palmettos estate  oh harry you dont mean to say so i cried for i was west indian enough in my feelings to have a certain innate horror of coloured blood and i was really shocked to think i had been so imprudent as to dance four times with a brown man  yes i do mean it miss he answered an octaroon slave girl and carvalhos her son by old jacob carvalho a jew merchant at the back of the island who was fool enough to go and actually marry her so now you see what a pretty mess youve gone and been and made of it we shall have it all over kingston tomorrow i suppose that miss hazleden a hazleden and a verner has been flirting violently with a bit of coloured scum off her own grandfathers estate at palmettos a nice thing for the family indeed  but harry i said pleading hes such a perfect gentleman in his manners and conversation so very much superior to a great many jamaican young men  hang it all miss said harryhe used a stronger expression for he was not particular about swearing before ladies but i wont transcribe all his oathshang it all thats the way of you girls who have been to england if i had fifty daughters id never send one of em home not i you go over there and you get enlightened as you call it and you learn a lot of radical fallal about equality and amanandabrother and all that humbug and then you come back and despise your own people who are gentlemen and the sons of gentlemen for fifty generations from the good old slavery days onward i wish we had them here again i do and id tie up that fellow carvalho to a horsepost and flog him with a cowhide within an inch of his life  i was too much accustomed to harrys manners to make any protest against this vigorous suggestion of reprisals i took his arm quietly let us go back into the ballroom harry i said as persuasively as i was able for i loathed the man in my heart and for heavens sake dont make a scene about it if there is anything on earth i detest its scenes  next morning i felt rather feverish and dear fat little mrs venn was quite frightened about me if you go down again to liguanca with this fever on you my dear she said youll get yellow jack as soon as you are home again better write and ask your mamma to let you stop a fortnight with us here  i consented readily enough for of course no girl of eighteen ever in her heart objects to military society and the 99th were really very pleasant wellintentioned young fellows but i made up my mind that if i stayed i would take particular care to see no more of mr carvalho he was very clever very fascinating very nice but thenhe was a brown man that was a bar that no west indian girl could ever be expected to get over  as illluck would have it howeveri write as i then feltabout three days after mrs venn said to me ive invited mr cameron one of our sublieutenants to dine this evening and ive had to invite his guest young carvalho as well by the way edie if i were you i wouldnt talk quite so much as you did the other evening to mr carvalho you know dear though he doesnt look it hes a brown man  i didnt know it i answered till the end of the evening and then harry verner told me i wouldnt have danced with him more than once if id known it  wonderful how that young fellow has managed to edge himself into society said the major looking up from his book devilish odd son of old jacob carvalho jacob left him all his coin not very much picked up his abc somewhere or other got into government service asked to governors dances goes everywhere now cant understand it  well my dear says mrs venn why do we ask him ourselves  because we cant help it says the major testily cameron goes and picks him up ought to be in the engineers cameron too doocid clever for the line and for this regiment always picks up some astronomer fellow or some botanist fellow or some fellow who understands fortification or something competitive examinations ruin of the service get all sorts of people into the regiment now believe cameron himself lives upon his pay almost hanged if i dont  that evening mr carvalho came and i liked him better than ever mr cameron who was a brother botanist and a nice ingenuous young highlander made him bring his portfolio of jamaica ferns and flowers the loveliest things i ever sawdried specimens and watercolour sketches to accompany them of the plants themselves as they grew naturally he told us all about them so enthusiastically and of how he used to employ almost all his holidays in the mountains hunting for specimens im afraid the fellows at the office think me a dreadful muff for it he said but i cant help it its born in me my mother is a descendant of sir hans sloanes who lived here for several yearsthe founder of the british museum you knowand all her family have always had a taste for bush as the negroes call it you know a good many mulatto people have the blood of able english families in their veins and that accounts i believe for their usual high average of general intelligence  i was surprised to hear him speak so unaffectedly of his ancestry on the wrong side of the house for most light coloured people studiously avoid any reference to their social disabilities i liked him all the better however for the perfect frankness with which he said it if only he hadnt been a brown man now but there you cant get over those fundamental race prejudices  next morning as the major and i were out riding we came again across mr cameron and mr carvalho fate really seemed determined to throw us together we were going to the fern walk to gather gold and silver ferns and mr carvalho was bound in the same direction to look for some rare hilltop flowers at the walk we dismounted and while the two officers went hunting about among the bush mr carvalho and i sat for a while upon a big rock in the shade of a mountain palm the conversation happened to come round to somewhat the same turn as it had taken the last evening  yes said mr carvalho in answer to a question of mine i do think that mulattos and quadroons are generally cleverer than the average run of white people you see mixture of race evidently tends to increase the total amount of brain power there are peculiar gains of brain on the one side and other peculiar gains however small on the other and the mixture i fancy tends to preserve or increase both that is why the descendants of huguenots in england and the descendants of italians in france show generally such great ability  then you yourself ought to be an example i said for your name seems to be spanish or portuguese  spanish and jewish he answered laughing though i didnt mean to give a sidepuff to myself yes i am of very mixed race indeed on my fathers side i am jewish though of course the jews acknowledge nobody who isnt a pureblooded descendant of abraham in both lines and for that reason i have been brought up a christian on my mothers side i am partly negro partly english partly haitian french and through the sloanes partly dutch as well so you see i am a very fair mixture  and that accounts i said for your being so clever  he blushed and bowed a little demure bow but said nothing  its no use fighting against fate and during all that fortnight i did nothing but run up against mr carvalho wherever i went he was sure to be wherever i was invited he was invited to meet me the fact is i had somehow acquired the reputation of being a clever girl and as mr cameron was by common consent the clever man of his regiment it was considered proper that he and by inference his guest should be always asked to entertain me the more i saw of mr carvalho the better i liked him he was so clever and yet so simple and unassuming that one couldnt help admiring and sympathizing with him indeed if he hadnt been a brown man i almost think i should have fallen in love with him outright  at the end of a fortnight i went back to palmettos a few days after who should come to call but old general farquhar and with him of all men in the world mr carvalho mamma was furious she managed to be frigidly polite as long as they stopped but when they were gone she went off at once into one of her worst nervous crisises thats not the regular plural im sure but no matter i know his mother when she was a slave of your grandfathers she said an upstanding proud octaroon girl who thought herself too good for her place because she was nearly a white woman she left the estate immediately after that horrid emancipation to keep a school of brown girls in kingston and then she had the insolence to go and get actually married at church to old jacob carvalho just like those brown people their grandmothers never married for poor mamma always made it a subject of reproach against the respectable coloured folk that they tried to live more decently and properly than their ancestors used to do in slavery times  mr carvalho never came to palmettos again but whenever i went to kingston to dances i met him and in spite of mamma i talked to him too one day i went over to a ball at government house and there i saw both him and harry verner for the first time in my life i had two proposals made me and on the same night harry verners came first  edie he said to me between the dances as we were strolling out in the gardens west indian fashion i often think agualta is rather lonely it wants a lady to look after the house while im down looking after the cane pieces we made the best return in sugar of any estate on the island last year you know but a man cant subsist entirely on sugar he wants sympathy and intellectual companionship this was quite an effort for harry now ive not been in a hurry to get married ive waited till i could find some one whom i could thoroughly respect and admire as well as love ive looked at all the girls in jamaica before making my choice and ive determined not to be guided by monetary considerations or any other considerations except those of the affections and of real underlying goodness and intellect i feel that you are the one girl i have met who is far and away my superior in everything worth living for edie and im going to ask you whether you will make me proud and happy for ever by becoming the mistress of agualta  i felt that harry was really conceding so very much to me and honouring me so greatly by offering me a life partnership in that flourishing sugarestate that it really went to my heart to have to refuse him but i told him plainly i could not marry him because i did not love him harry seemed quite surprised at my refusal but answered politely that perhaps i might learn to love him hereafter that he would not be so foolish as to press me further now and that he would do his best to deserve my love in future and with that little speech he led me back to the ballroom and handed me over to my next partner  later on in the evening mr carvalho too with an earnest look in his handsome dark eyes asked leave to take me for a few turns in the garden we sat down on a bench under the great mango tree and he began to talk to me in a graver fashion than usual  your mother was annoyed i fear miss hazleden he said that i should call at palmettos  to tell you the truth i answered i think she was  i was afraid she would bei knew she would be in fact and for that very reason i hesitated to do it as i hesitated to dance with you the first time i met you as soon as i knew who you really were but i felt i ought to face it out you know by this time no doubt miss hazleden that my mother was once a slave on your grandfathers estate now it is a theory of minea little quixotic perhaps but still a theory of minethat the guilt and the shame of slavery lay with the slaveowners forgive me if i must needs speak against your own class and not with the slaves or their descendants we have nothing on earth to be ashamed of thinking thus i felt it incumbent upon me to call at palmettos partly in defence of my general principles and partly also because i wished to see whether you shared your mothers ideas on that subject  you were quite right in what you did mr carvalho i answered and i respect you for the boldness with which you cling to what you think your duty  thank you miss hazleden he answered you are very kind now i wish to speak to you about another and more serious question forgive my talking about myself for a moment i feel sure you have kindly interested yourself in me a little i too am proud of my birth in my way for i am the son of an honest able man and of a tender true woman i come on one side from the oldest and greatest among civilized races the jews and on the other side from many energetic english french and dutch families whose blood i am vain enough to prize as a precious inheritance even though it came to me through the veins of an octaroon girl i have lately arrived at the conclusion that it is not well for me to remain in jamaica i cannot bear to live in a society which will not receive my dear mother on the same terms as it receives me and will not receive either of us on the same terms as it receives other people we are not rich but we are well enough off to go to live in england and to england i mean soon to go  i am glad and sorry to hear it i said glad because i am sure it is the best thing for your own happiness and the best opening for your great talents sorry because there are not many people in jamaica whose society i shall miss so much  what you say encourages me to venture a little further when i get to england i intend to go to cambridge and take a degree there so as to put myself on an equality with other educated people now miss hazleden i am going to ask you something which is so great a thing to ask that it makes my heart tremble to ask it i know no man on earth least of all myself dare think himself fit for you or dare plead his own cause before you without feeling his own unworthiness and pettiness of soul beside you yet just because i know how infinitely better and nobler and higher you are than i am i cannot resist trying just once whether i may not hope that perhaps you will consider my appeal and count my earnestness to me for righteousness i have watched you and listened to you and admired you till in spite of myself i have not been able to refrain from loving you i know it is madness i know it is yearning after the unattainable but i cannot help it oh dont answer me too soon and crush me but consider whether perhaps in the future you might not somehow at some time think it possible  he leaned forward towards me in a supplicating attitude at that moment i loved him with all the force of my nature yet i dared not say so the spectre of the raceprejudice rose instinctively like a dividing wall between my heart and my lips mr carvalho i said take me back to my seat you must not talk so please  one minute miss hazleden he went on passionately one minute and then i will be silent for ever remember we might live in england far away from all these unmeaning barriers i do not ask you to take me now and as i am i will do all i can to make myself more worthy of you only let me hope dont answer me no without considering it i know how little i deserve such happiness but if you will take me i will live all my life for no other purpose than to make you see that i am striving to show myself grateful for your love oh miss hazleden do listen to me  i felt that in another moment i should yield i could have seized his outstretched hands then and told him that i loved him but i dared not mr carvalho i said let us go back now i will write to you tomorrow he gave me his arm with a deep breath and we went back slowly to the music  edith said my mother sharply when i got home that night harry has been here and i know two things he has proposed to you and you have refused him im certain of that and the other thing is that young carvalho has been insolent enough to make you an offer  i said nothing  what did you answer him  that i would reply by letter  sit down then and write as i tell you  i sat down mechanically mamma began dictating i cried as i wrote but i wrote it i know now how very shameful and wrong it was of me but i was only eighteen and i was accustomed to do as mamma told me in everything she had a terrible will you know and a terrible temper  dear mr carvalho youd better begin so or hell know i dictated iti was too much surprised at your strange conduct last night to give you an answer immediately on thinking it over i can only say i am astonished you should have supposed such a thing as you suggested lay within the bounds of possibility in future it will be well that we should avoid one another our spheres are different pray do not repeat your mistake of last eveningyours truly e hazleden have you put all that down  mamma i cried it is abominable it isnt true i cant sign it  sign it said my mother briefly  i took the pen and did so you will break my heart mamma i said you will break my heart and kill me  it shall go first thing tomorrow said my mother taking no notice of my words and now edith you shall marry harry verner   ii  seven years are a large slice out of ones life and the seven years spent in fighting poor dear mamma over that fixed project were not happy ones but on that point nothing on earth would bend me i would not marry harry verner at last after poor mammas sudden death i thought it best to sell the remnant of the estate for what it would fetch and go back to england i was twentyfive then and had slowly learnt to have a will of my own meanwhile but during all that time i hardly ever heard again of ernest carvalho once or twice indeed i was told he had taken a distinguished place at cambridge and had gone to the bar in the temple but that was all  a month or two after my return to london my aunt emily who was not one of the west indian side of the house managed to get me an invitation to mrs bouverie bartons of course you know mrs bouverie barton the famous novelist whose books everybody talks about well mrs barton lives in eaton place and gives charming thursday evening receptions which are the recognized rendezvous of all literary and artistic london if there is a celebrity in town from paris or vienna timbuctoo or the south sea islands you are sure to meet him in the little back drawingroom at eaton place the music there is always of the best and the conversation of the cleverest but what pleased me most on that occasion was the fact that mr gerard llewellyn the author of that singular book peter martindale was to be the lion of the party on this particular thursday i had just been reading peter martindalewho had not that season for it was the rage of the dayand i had never read any novel before which so impressed me by its weird power its philosophical insight and its transparent depth of moral earnestness so i was naturally very much pleased at the prospect of seeing and meeting so famous a man as mr gerard llewellyn  when we entered mrs bouverie bartons handsome rooms we saw a great crowd of people whom even the most unobservant stranger would instantly have recognized as out of the common run there was the hostess herself with her kindly smile and her friendly goodhumoured manner hardly if at all concealing the profound intellectual strength that lay latent in her calm grey eyes there were artistic artists and rugged artists satirical novelists and gay novelists heavy professors and deep professorsevery possible representative of literature science and art at first i was put off with introductions to young poe tasters and gentlemen with an interest in cuneiform inscriptions but i had quite made up my mind to get a talk with mr gerard llewellyn and to mr gerard llewellyn our hostess at last promised to introduce me she crossed the room in search of him near the big fireplace  a tall handsome young man with long moustache and beard and piercing black eyes stood somewhat listlessly leaning against the mantelshelf and talking with an even brilliant flow to a short stout indianlooking gentleman at his side i knew in a moment that the short stout gentleman must be mr llewellyn for in the tall young man in spite of seven years and the long moustaches i recognized at once ernest carvalho  but to my surprise mrs bouverie barton brought the tall young man and not his neighbour across the room with her she must have made a mistake i thought mr carvalho she said i want you to come and be introduced to the lady on the ottoman miss hazleden mr carvalho  i have met mr carvalho long ago in jamaica i said warmly but i am very glad indeed to meet him here again however i hardly expected to see him here this evening  indeed said mrs barton with some surprise in her tone i thought you asked to be introduced to the author of peter martindale  so i did i answered but i understood his name was llewellyn  oh said ernest carvalho quickly that is only my nom de plume but the authorship is an open secret now and i suppose mrs barton thought you knew it  it is a happy chance at any rate mr carvalho i said which has thrown us two again together  he bowed gravely and with dignity you are very kind to say so he said it is always a pleasure to meet old acquaintances from jamaica  my heart beat violently there was a studied coldness in his tone i thought and no wonder but if i had been in love with ernest carvalho before i felt a thousand more times in love with him now as he stood there in his evening dress a perfect english gentleman he looked so kinglike with his handsome slightly jewish features his piercing black eyes his long moustaches and his beautiful delicate thinlipped mouth there was such an air of power in his forehead such a speaking evidence of high culture in his general expression and then he had written peter martindale why who else could possibly have written it i wondered at my own stupidity in not having guessed the authorship at once but most terrible of all i had probably lost his love for ever i might once have called ernest carvalho my husband and i had utterly alienated him by a single culpable act of foolish weakness  you are living in london now i asked  yes he answered we have a little home of our own in kensington i am working on the staff of the morning detonator  mrs carvalho is here this evening said mrs bouverie barton do you know her i suppose you do of course  mrs carvalho as i heard the name i was conscious of a deep but rapid thud thud thud in my ear and after a moment it struck me that the thud came from the quick beating of my own heart then ernest carvalho was married  no he said in reply seeing that i did not answer immediately miss hazleden has never met her i believe but i shall be happy to introduce her and he turned to a sofa where two or three ladies were chatting together a little in the corner  a very queenly old lady with snowwhite hair prettily covered in part by a dainty and becoming lace cap held out her small white hand to me with a gracious smile my mother ernest carvalho said quietly and i took the proffered hand with a warmth that must have really surprised the slaveborn octaroon the one thought that was uppermost in my mind was just this that after all ernest carvalho was not married once more i heard the thud in my ear and nothing else  as soon as i could notice anybody or anything except myself i began to observe that mrs carvalho was very handsome she was rather dark to be sure but less so than many spanish or italian ladies i had seen and her look and manner were those of a louis quinze marquise with a distinct reminiscence of the stately old haitian french politeness she could never have had any education except what she had picked up for herself but no one would suspect the deficiency now for she was as clever as all halfcastes and had made the best of her advantages meanwhile such as they were when she talked about the literary london in which her son lived and moved i felt like the colonialbred ignoramus i really was and when she told me they had just been to visit mr fradellis new picture at the studio i was positively too ashamed to let her see that i had never in my life heard of that famous painter before to think that that queenly old lady was still a slave girl at palmettos when my poor dear mother was a little child and to think too that my own family would have kept her a slave all her life long if only they had had the power i remembered at once with a blush what ernest carvalho had said to me the last time i saw him about the people with whom the guilt and shame of slavery really rested  i sat half in a maze talking with mrs carvalho all the rest of that evening ernest lingered near for a while as if to see what impression his mother produced upon me but soon went off proudly i thought to another part of the room where he got into conversation with the german gentleman who wore the big blue wireguarded spectacles yet i fancied he kept looking half anxiously in our direction throughout the evening and i was sure i saw him catch his mothers eye furtively now and again as for mrs carvalho she made a conquest of me at once and she was evidently well pleased with her conquest when i rose to leave she took both my hands in hers and said to me warmly miss hazleden we shall be so pleased to see you whenever you like to come at merton gardens had ernest ever told her of his proposal i wondered  mrs bouverie barton was very kind to me she kept on asking me to her thursday evenings and there time after time i met ernest carvalho at first he seldom spoke to me much but at last partly because i always talked so much to his mother perhaps he began to thaw a little and often came up to me in quite a friendly way we have left jamaica and all that behind miss hazleden he said once and here in free england we may at least be friends oh how i longed to explain the whole truth to him and how impossible an explanation was besides he had seen so many other girls since and very likely his boyish fancy for me had long since passed away altogether you cant count much on the lovemaking of eighteen and twenty  mrs carvalho asked me often to their pretty little house in merton gardens and i went but still ernest never in any way alluded to what had passed months went by and i began to feel that i must crush that little dream entirely out of my heartif i could one afternoon i went in to mrs carvalhos for a cup of fiveoclock tea and had an uninterrupted têteàtête with her for half an hour we had been exchanging small confidences with one another for a while and after a pause the old lady laid her gentle hand upon my head and stroked back my hair in such a motherly fashion my dear child she said halfsighing i do wish my ernest would only take a fancy to a sweet young girl like you  mr carvalho does not seem quite a marrying man i answered forcing a laugh i notice he seldom talks to ladies but always to men and those of the solemnest  ah my dear he has had a great disappointment a terrible disappointment said the mother unburdening herself i can tell you all about it for you are a jamaican born and though you are one of the proud palmettos people you are not full of prejudices like the rest of them and so you will understand it before we left jamaica he was in love with a young lady there he never told me her name and that is the one secret he has ever kept from me well he talked to her often and he thought she was above the wicked prejudices of race and colour she seemed to encourage him and to be fond of his society at last he proposed to her then she wrote him a cruel cruel letter a letter that he never showed me but he told me what was in it and it drove him away from the island immediately it was a letter full of wicked reproaches about our octaroon blood and it broke his heart with the shock of its heartlessness he has never cared for any woman since  then does he love her still i asked breathless  how can he no but he says he loves the memory of what he once thought her he has seen her since somewhere in london and spoken to her but he can never love her again yet do you know i feel sure he cannot help loving her in spite of himself and he often goes out at night i am sure to watch her door to see her come in and out for the sake of the love he once bore her my ernest is not the sort of man who can love twice in a lifetime  perhaps i said colouring if he were to ask her again she might accept him things are so different here in england and he is a famous man now  mrs carvalho shook her head slowly oh no she answered he would never importune or trouble her though she has rejected him he is too loyal to the love he once bore her too careful of wounding her feelings or even her very prejudices ever to obtrude his love again upon her notice if she cannot love him of herself and for himself spontaneously he would not weary her out with oft asking he will never marry now of that i am certain  my eyes filled with tears as they did so i tried to brush them away unseen behind my fan but mrs carvalho caught my glance and looked sharply through me with a sudden gleam of discovery why she said very slowly and distinctly with a pause and a stress upon each word i believe it must have been you yourself miss hazleden and as she spoke she held her open hand palm outward stretched against me with a gesture of horror as one might shrink in alarm from a coiled rattlesnake  dear mrs carvalho i cried clasping my hands before her do hear me i entreat you do let me explain to you how it all happened  there is no explanation possible she answered sternly go you have wrecked a life that might otherwise have been happy and famous and then you come to a mother with an explanation  that letter was not mine i said boldly for i saw that to put the truth shortly in that truest and briefest form was the only way of getting her to listen to me now  she sank back in a chair and folded her hands faintly one above the other tell me it all she said in a weak voice i will hear you  so i told her all i did not try to extenuate my own weakness in writing from my mothers dictation but i let her see what i had suffered then and what i had suffered since when i had finished she drew me towards her gently and printed one kiss upon my forehead it is hard to forget she said softly but you were very young and helpless and your mother was a terrible woman the iron has entered into your own soul too go home dear and i will see about this matter  we fell upon one anothers necks the palmettos slavegirl and i and cried together glad tears for ten minutes then i wiped my red eyes dry covered them with a double fold of my veil and ran home hurriedly in the dusk to aunties it was such a terrible relief to have got it all over  that evening about eleven oclock auntie had gone to bed and i was sitting up by myself musing late over the red cinders in the little back drawingroom grate i felt as though i couldnt sleep and so i was waiting up till i got sleepy suddenly there came a loud knock and a ring at the bell after which amelia ran in to say that a gentleman wanted to see me in the diningroom on urgent business and would i please come down to speak with him immediately i knew at once it was ernest  the moment i entered the room he never said a word but he took my two hands eagerly in his and then he kissed me fervently on the lips half a dozen times over and now edith he said we need say no more about the past for my mother has explained it all to me we will only think about the future  i have no distinct recollection what oclock it was before ernest left that evening but i know auntie sent down word twice to say it was high time i went to bed and poor amelia looked awfully tired and very sleepy however it was settled then and there that ernest and i should be married early in october  a few days later after the engagement had been announced to all our friends dear mrs bouverie barton paid me a congratulatory call you are a very lucky girl my dear she said to me kindly we are half envious of you i wish we could find another such husband as mr carvalho for my christina but you have carried off the prize of the season and you are well worthy of him it is a very great honour for any girl to win and deserve the love of such a man as ernest carvalho  will you believe it so strangely do ones first impressions and early ideas about people cling to one that though i had often felt before how completely the tables had been turned since we two came to england it had not struck me till that moment that in the eyes of the world at large it was ernest who was doing an honour to me and not i who was doing an honour to ernest i felt ashamed to think that mrs bouverie barton should see instinctively the true state of the case while i who loved and admired him so greatly should have let the shadow of that old prejudice stand even now between me and the lover i was so proud to own but when i took dear old mrs carvalhos hand in mine the day of our wedding and kissed her and called her mother for the first time i felt that i had left the guilt and shame of slavery for ever behind me and that i should strive ever after to live worthily of ernest carvalhos love     pausodyne  a great chemical discovery   walking along the strand one evening last year towards pall mall i was accosted near charing cross station by a strangelooking middleaged man in a poor suit of clothes who surprised and startled me by asking if i could tell him from what inn the coach usually started for york  dear me i said a little puzzled i didnt know there was a coach to york indeed im almost certain there isnt one  the man looked puzzled and surprised in turn no coach to york he muttered to himself half inarticulately no coach to york how things have changed i wonder whether nobody ever goes to york nowadays  pardon me i said anxious to discover what could be his meaning many people go to york every day but of course they go by rail  ah yes he answered softly i see yes of course they go by rail they go by rail no doubt how very stupid of me and he turned on his heel as if to get away from me as quickly as possible  i cant exactly say why but i felt instinctively that this curious stranger was trying to conceal from me his ignorance of what a railway really was i was quite certain from the way in which he spoke that he had not the slightest conception what i meant and that he was doing his best to hide his confusion by pretending to understand me here was indeed a strange mystery in the latter end of this nineteenth century in the metropolis of industrial england within a stonesthrow of charing cross terminus i had met an adult englishman who apparently did not know of the existence of railways my curiosity was too much piqued to let the matter rest there i must find out what he meant by it i walked after him hastily as he tried to disappear among the crowd and laid my hand upon his shoulder to his evident chagrin  excuse me i said drawing him aside down the corner of craven street you did not understand what i meant when i said people went to york by rail  he looked in my face steadily and then instead of replying to my remark he said slowly your name is spottiswood i believe  again i gave a start of surprise it is i answered but i never remember to have seen you before  no he replied dreamily no we have never met till now no doubt but i knew your father im sure or perhaps it may have been your grandfather  not my grandfather certainly said i for he was killed at waterloo  at waterloo indeed how long since pray  i could not refrain from laughing outright why of course i answered in 1815 there has been nothing particular to kill off any large number of englishmen at waterloo since the year of the battle i suppose  true he muttered quite true so i should have fancied but i saw again from the cloud of doubt and bewilderment which came over his intelligent face that the name of waterloo conveyed no idea whatsoever to his mind  never in my life had i felt so utterly confused and astonished in spite of his poor dress i could easily see from the clearcut face and the refined accent of my strange acquaintance that he was an educated gentlemana man accustomed to mix in cultivated society yet he clearly knew nothing whatsoever about railways and was ignorant of the most salient facts in english history had i suddenly come across some caspar hauser immured for years in a private prison and just let loose upon the world by his gaolers or was my mysterious stranger one of the seven sleepers of ephesus turned out unexpectedly in modern costume on the streets of london i dont suppose there exists on earth a man more utterly free than i am from any tinge of superstition any lingering touch of a love for the miraculous but i confess for a moment i felt half inclined to suppose that the man before me must have drunk the elixir of life or must have dropped suddenly upon earth from some distant planet  the impulse to fathom this mystery was irresistible i drew my arm through his if you knew my father i said you will not object to come into my chambers and take a glass of wine with me  thank you he answered half suspiciously thank you very much i think you look like a man who can be trusted and i will go with you  we walked along the embankment to adelphi terrace where i took him up to my rooms and seated him in my easychair near the window as he sat down one of the trains on the metropolitan line whirred past the terrace snorting steam and whistling shrilly after the fashion of metropolitan engines generally my mysterious stranger jumped back in alarm and seemed to be afraid of some immediate catastrophe there was absolutely no possibility of doubting it the man had obviously never seen a locomotive before  evidently i said you do not know london i suppose you are a colonist from some remote district perhaps an australian from the interior somewhere just landed at the tower  no not an austriani noted his misapprehensionbut a londoner born and bred  how is it then that you seem never to have seen an engine before  can i trust you he asked in a piteously plaintive halfterrified tone if i tell you all about it will you at least not aid in persecuting and imprisoning me  i was touched by his evident grief and terror no i answered you may trust me implicitly i feel sure there is something in your history which entitles you to sympathy and protection  well he replied grasping my hand warmly i will tell you all my story but you must be prepared for something almost too startling to be credible  my name is jonathan spottiswood he began calmly  again i experienced a marvellous start jonathan spottiswood was the name of my greatgreatuncle whose unaccountable disappearance from london just a century since had involved our family in so much protracted litigation as to the succession to his property in fact it was jonathan spottiswoods money which at that moment formed the bulk of my little fortune but i would not interrupt him so great was my anxiety to hear the story of his life  i was born in london he went on in 1750 if you can hear me say that and yet believe that possibly i am not a madman i will tell you the rest of my tale if not i shall go at once and for ever  i suspend judgment for the present i answered what you say is extraordinary but not more extraordinary perhaps than the clear anachronism of your ignorance about locomotives in the midst of the present century  so be it then well i will tell you the facts briefly in as few words as i can i was always much given to experimental philosophy and i spent most of my time in the little laboratory which i had built for myself behind my fathers house in the strand i had a small independent fortune of my own left me by an uncle who had made successful ventures in the china trade and as i was indisposed to follow my fathers profession of solicitor i gave myself up almost entirely to the pursuit of natural philosophy following the researches of the great mr cavendish our chief english thinker in this kind as well as of monsieur lavoisier the ingenious french chemist and of my friend dr priestley the birmingham philosopher whose new theory of phlogiston i have been much concerned to consider and to promulgate but the especial subject to which i devoted myself was the elucidation of the nature of fixed air i do not know how far you yourself may happen to have heard respecting these late discoveries in chemical science but i dare venture to say that you are at least acquainted with the nature of the body to which i refer  perfectly i answered with a smile though your terminology is now a little out of date fixed air was i believe the oldfashioned name for carbonic acid gas  ah he cried vehemently that accursed word again carbonic acid has undone me clearly yes if you will have it so that seems to be what they call it in this extraordinary century but fixed air was the name we used to give it in our time and fixed air is what i must call it of course in telling you my story well i was deeply interested in this curious question and also in some of the results which i obtained from working with fixed air in combination with a substance i had produced from the essential oil of a weed known to us in england as ladys mantle but which the learned mr carl linnæus describes in his system as alchemilla vulgaris from that weed i obtained an oil which i combined with a certain decoction of fixed air into a remarkable compound and to this compound from its singular properties i proposed to give the name of pausodyne for some years i was almost wholly engaged in investigating the conduct of this remarkable agent and lest i should weary you by entering into too much detail i may as well say at once that it possessed the singular power of entirely suspending animation in men or animals for several hours together it is a highly volatile oil like ammonia in smell but much thicker in gravity and when held to the nose of an animal it causes immediate stoppage of the hearts action making the body seem quite dead for long periods at a time but the moment a mixture of the pausodyne with oil of vitriol and gum resin is presented to the nostrils the animal instantaneously revives exactly as before showing no evil effects whatsoever from its temporary simulation of death to the reviving mixture i have given the appropriate name of anegeiric  of course you will instantly see the valuable medical applications which may be made of such an agent i used it at first for experimenting upon the amputation of limbs and other surgical operations it succeeded admirably i found that a dog under the influence of pausodyne suffered his leg which had been broken in a street accident to be set and spliced without the slightest symptom of feeling or discomfort a cat shot with a pistol by a cruel boy had the bullet extracted without moving a muscle my assistant having allowed his little finger to mortify from neglect of a burn permitted me to try the effect of my discovery upon himself and i removed the injured joints while he remained in a state of complete insensibility so that he could hardly believe afterwards in the actual truth of their removal i felt certain that i had invented a medical process of the very highest and greatest utility  all this took place in or before the year 1781 how long ago that may be according to your modern reckoning i cannot say but to me it seems hardly more than a few months since perhaps you would not mind telling me the date of the current year i have never been able to ascertain it  this is 1881 i said growing every moment more interested in his tale  thank you i gathered that we must now be somewhere near the close of the nineteenth century though i could not learn the exact date with certainty well i should tell you my dear sir that i had contracted an engagement about the year 1779 with a young lady of most remarkable beauty and attractive mental gifts a miss amelia spragg daughter of the wellknown general sir thomas spragg with whose achievements you are doubtless familiar pardon me my friend of another age pardon me i beg of you if i cannot allude to this subject without emotion after a lapse of time which to you doubtless seems like a century but is to me a matter of some few months only at the utmost i feel towards her as towards one whom i have but recently lost though i now find that she has been dead for more than eighty years as he spoke the tears came into his eyes profusely and i could see that under the external calmness and quaintness of his eighteenth century language and demeanour his whole nature was profoundly stirred at the thought of his lost love  look here he continued taking from his breast a large oldfashioned gold locket containing a miniature that is her portrait by mr walker and a very truthful likeness indeed they left me that when they took away my clothes at the asylum for i would not consent to part with it and the physician in attendance observed that to deprive me of it might only increase the frequency and violence of my paroxysms for i will not conceal from you the fact that i have just escaped from a pauper lunatic establishment  i took the miniature which he handed me and looked at it closely it was the picture of a young and beautiful girl with the features and costume of a sir joshua i recognized the face at once as that of a lady whose portrait by gainsborough hangs on the walls of my uncles diningroom at whittingham abbey it was strange indeed to hear a living man speak of himself as the former lover of this to me historic personage  sir thomas however he went on was much opposed to our union on the ground of some real or fancied social disparity in our positions but i at last obtained his conditional consent if only i could succeed in obtaining the fellowship of the royal society which might he thought be accepted as a passport into that fashionable circle of which he was a member spurred on by this ambition and by the encouragement of my amelia i worked day and night at the perfectioning of my great discovery which i was assured would bring not only honour and dignity to myself but also the alleviation and assuagement of pain to countless thousands of my fellowcreatures i concealed the nature of my experiments however lest any rival investigator should enter the field with me prematurely and share the credit to which i alone was really entitled for some months i was successful in my efforts at concealment but in march of this yeari mistake of the year 1781 i should sayan unfortunate circumstance caused me to take special and exceptional precautions against intrusion  i was then conducting my experiments upon living animals and especially upon the extirpation of certain painful internal diseases to which they are subject i had a number of suffering cats in my laboratory which i had treated with pausodyne and stretched out on boards for the purpose of removing the tumours with which they were afflicted i had no doubt that in this manner while directly benefiting the animal creation i should indirectly obtain the necessary skill to operate successfully upon human beings in similar circumstances already i had completely cured several cats without any pain whatsoever and i was anxious to proceed to the human subject walking one morning in the strand i found a beggar woman outside a ginshop quite drunk with a small illclad child by her side suffering the most excruciating torments from a perfectly remediable cause i induced the mother to accompany me to my laboratory and there i treated the poor little creature with pausodyne and began to operate upon her with perfect confidence of success  unhappily my laboratory had excited the suspicion of many illdisposed persons among the low mob of the neighbourhood it was whispered abroad that i was what they called a vivisectionist and these people who would willingly have attended a bullbaiting or a prize fight found themselves of a sudden wondrous humane when scientific procedure was under consideration besides i had made myself unpopular by receiving visits from my friend dr priestley whose religious opinions were not satisfactory to the strict orthodoxy of st giless i was rumoured to be a philosopher a torturer of live animals and an atheist whether the former accusation were true or not let others decide the two latter heaven be my witness were wholly unfounded however when the neighbouring rabble saw a drunken woman with a little girl entering my door a report got abroad at once that i was going to vivisect a christian child the mob soon collected in force and broke into the laboratory at that moment i was engaged with my assistant in operating upon the girl while several cats all completely anæstheticised were bound down on the boards around awaiting the healing of their wounds after the removal of tumours at the sight of such apparent tortures the people grew wild with rage and happening in their transports to fling down a large bottle of the anegeiric or reviving mixture the child and the animals all at once recovered consciousness and began of course to writhe and scream with acute pain i need not describe to you the scene that ensued my laboratory was wrecked my assistant severely injured and i myself barely escaped with my life  after this contretemps i determined to be more cautious i took the lease of a new house at hampstead and in the garden i determined to build myself a subterranean laboratory where i might be absolutely free from intrusion i hired some labourers from bath for this purpose and i explained to them the nature of my wishes and the absolute necessity of secrecy a high wall surrounded the garden and here the workmen worked securely and unseen i concealed my design even from my dear brotherwhose grandson or greatgrandson i suppose you must beand when the building was finished i sent my men back to bath with strict injunctions never to mention the matter to any one a trapdoor in the cellar artfully concealed gave access to the passage a large oak portal bound with iron shut me securely in and my air supply was obtained by means of pipes communicating through blank spaces in the brick wall of the garden with the outer atmosphere every arrangement for concealment was perfect and i resolved in future till my results were perfectly established that i would dispense with the aid of an assistant  i was in high spirits when i went to visit my amelia that evening and i told her confidently that before the end of the year i expected to gain the gold medal of the royal society the dear girl was pleased at my glowing prospects and gave me every assurance of the delight with which she hailed the probability of our approaching union  next day i began my experiments afresh in my new quarters i bolted myself into the laboratory and set to work with renewed vigour i was experimenting upon an injured dog and i placed a large bottle of pausodyne beside me as i administered the drug to his nostrils the rising fumes seemed to affect my head more than usual in that confined space and i tottered a little as i worked my arm grew weaker and at last fell powerless to my side as it fell it knocked down the large bottle of pausodyne and i saw the liquid spreading over the floor that was almost the last thing that i knew i staggered toward the door but did not reach it and then i remember nothing more for a considerable period  he wiped his forehead with his sleevehe had no handkerchiefand then proceeded  when i woke up again the effects of the pausodyne had worn themselves out and i felt that i must have remained unconscious for at least a week or a fortnight my candle had gone out and i could not find my tinderbox i rose up slowly and with difficulty for the air of the room was close and filled with fumes and made my way in the dark towards the door to my surprise the bolt was so stiff with rust that it would hardly move i opened it after a struggle and found myself in the passage groping my way towards the trapdoor of the cellar i felt it was obstructed by some heavy body with an immense effort for my strength seemed but feeble i pushed it up and discovered that a heap of seacoals lay on top of it i extricated myself into the cellar and there a fresh surprise awaited me a new entrance had been made into the front so that i walked out at once upon the open road instead of up the stairs into the kitchen looking up at the exterior of my house my brain reeled with bewilderment when i saw that it had disappeared almost entirely and that a different porch and wholly unfamiliar windows occupied its façade i must have slept far longer than i at first imaginedperhaps a whole year or more a vague terror prevented me from walking up the steps of my own home possibly my brother thinking me dead might have sold the lease possibly some stranger might resent my intrusion into the house that was now his own at any rate i thought it safer to walk into the road i would go towards london to my brothers house in st mary le bone i turned into the hampstead road and directed my steps thitherward  again another surprise began to affect me with a horrible and illdefined sense of awe not a single object that i saw was really familiar to me i recognized that i was in the hampstead road but it was not the hampstead road which i used to know before my fatal experiments the houses were far more numerous the trees were bigger and older a year nay even a few years would not have sufficed for such a change i began to fear that i had slept away a whole decade  it was early morning and few people were yet abroad but the costume of those whom i met seemed strange and fantastic to me moreover i noticed that they all turned and looked after me with evident surprise as though my dress caused them quite as much astonishment as theirs caused me i was quietly attired in my snuffcoloured suit of smallclothes with silk stockings and simple buckle shoes and i had of course no hat but i gathered that my appearance caused universal amazement and concern far more than could be justified by the mere accidental absence of headgear a dread began to oppress me that i might actually have slept out my whole age and generation was my amelia alive and if so would she be still the same amelia i had known a week or two before should i find her an aged woman still cherishing a reminiscence of her former love or might she herself perhaps be dead and forgotten while i remained alone and solitary in a world which knew me not  i walked along unmolested but with reeling brain through streets more and more unfamiliar till i came near the st mary le bone road there as i hesitated a little and staggered at the crossing a man in a curious suit of dark blue clothes with a grotesque felt helmet on his head whom i afterwards found to be a constable came up and touched me on the shoulder  look here he said to me in a rough voice what are you adoin in this ere fancydress at this hour in the mornin youve lost your way home i take it  i was going i answered to the st mary le bone road  why you image says he rudely if you mean marribon why dont you say marribon what house are you alookin for eh  my brother lives i replied at the lamb near st marys church and i was going to his residence  the lamb says he with a rude laugh there aint no public of that name in the road its my belief he goes on after a moment that youre drunk or mad or else youve stole them clothes any way youve got to go along with me to the station so walk it will you  pardon me i said i suppose you are an officer of the law and i would not attempt to resist your authorityyoud better not says he half to himselfbut i should like to go to my brothers house where i could show you that i am a respectable person  well says my fellow insolently ill go along of you if you like and if its all right i suppose you wont mind standing a bob  a what said i  a bob says he laughing a shillin you know  to get rid of his insolence for a while i pulled out my purse and handed him a shilling it was a george ii with milled edges not like the things i see you use now he held it up and looked at it and then he said again look here you know this isnt good youd better come along with me straight to the station and not make a fuss about it theres three charges against you thats all one is that youre drunk the second is that youre mad and the third is that youve been trying to utter false coin any one of ems quite enough to justify me in takin you into custody  i saw it was no use to resist and i went along with him  i wont trouble you with the whole of the details but the upshot of it all was they took me before a magistrate by this time i had begun to realize the full terror of the situation and i saw clearly that the real danger lay in the inevitable suspicion of madness under which i must labour when i got into the court i told the magistrate my story very shortly and simply as i have told it to you now he listened to me without a word and at the end he turned round to his clerk and said this is clearly a case for dr fitzjenkins i think  sir i said before you send me to a madhouse which i suppose is what you mean by these words i trust you will at least examine the evidences of my story look at my clothing look at these coins look at everything about me and i handed him my purse to see for himself  he looked at it for a minute and then he turned towards me very sternly mr spottiswood he said or whatever else your real name may be if this is a joke it is a very foolish and unbecoming one your dress is no doubt very well designed your small collection of coins is interesting and wellselected and you have got up your character remarkably well if you are really sane which i suspect to be the case then your studied attempt to waste the time of this court and to make a laughingstock of its magistrate will meet with the punishment it deserves i shall remit your case for consideration to our medical officer if you consent to give him your real name and address you will be liberated after his examination otherwise it will be necessary to satisfy ourselves as to your identity not a word more sir he continued as i tried to speak on behalf of my story inspector remove the prisoner  they took me away and the surgeon examined me to cut things short i was pronounced mad and three days later the commissioners passed me for a pauper asylum when i came to be examined they said i showed no recollection of most subjects of ordinary education  i am a chemist said i try me with some chemical questions you will see that i can answer sanely enough  how do you mix a grey powder said the commissioner  excuse me i said i mean a chemical philosopher not an apothecary  oh very well then what is carbonic acid  i never heard of it i answered in despair it must be something which has come into use sincesince i left off learning chemistry for i had discovered that my only chance now was to avoid all reference to my past life and the extraordinary calamity which had thus unexpectedly overtaken me please try me with something else  oh certainly what is the atomic weight of chlorine  i could only answer that i did not know  this is a very clear case said the commissioner evidently he is a gentleman by birth and education but he can give no very satisfactory account of his friends and till they come forward to claim him we can only send him for a time to north street  for heavens sake gentlemen i cried before you consign me to an asylum give me one more chance i am perfectly sane i remember all i ever knew but you are asking me questions about subjects on which i never had any information ask me anything historical and see whether i have forgotten or confused any of my facts  i will do the commissioner the justice to say that he seemed anxious not to decide upon the case without full consideration tell me what you can recollect he said as to the reign of george iv  i know nothing at all about it i answered terrorstricken but oh do pray ask me anything up to the time of george iii  then please say what you think of the french revolution  i was thunderstruck i could make no reply and the commissioners shortly signed the papers to send me to north street pauper asylum they hurried me into the street and i walked beside my captors towards the prison to which they had consigned me yet i did not give up all hope even so of ultimately regaining my freedom i thought the rationality of my demeanour and the obvious soundness of all my reasoning powers would suffice in time to satisfy the medical attendant as to my perfect sanity i felt sure that people could never long mistake a man so clearheaded and collected as myself for a madman  on our way however we happened to pass a churchyard where some workmen were engaged in removing a number of old tombstones from the crowded area even in my existing agitated condition i could not help catching the name and date on one mouldering slab which a labourer had just placed upon the edge of the pavement it ran something like this sacred to the memory of amelia second daughter of the late sir thomas spragg knight and beloved wife of henry mcalister esq by whom this stone is erected died may 20 1799 aged 44 years though i had gathered already that my dear girl must probably have long been dead yet the reality of the fact had not yet had time to fix itself upon my mind you must remember my dear sir that i had but awaked a few days earlier from my long slumber and that during those days i had been harassed and agitated by such a flood of incomprehensible complications that i could not really grasp in all its fulness the complete isolation of my present position when i saw the tombstone of one whom as it seemed to me i had loved passionately but a week or two before i could not refrain from rushing to embrace it and covering the insensible stone with my boiling tears oh my amelia my amelia i cried i shall never again behold thee then i shall never again press thee to my heart or hear thy dear lips pronounce my name  but the unfeeling wretches who had charge of me were far from being moved to sympathy by my bitter grief died in 1799 said one of them with a sneer why this madmans blubbering over the grave of an old lady who has been buried for about a hundred years and the workmen joined in their laughter as my gaolers tore me away to the prison where i was to spend the remainder of my days  when we arrived at the asylum the surgeon in attendance was informed of this circumstance and the opinion that i was hopelessly mad thus became ingrained in his whole conceptions of my case i remained five months or more in the asylum but i never saw any chance of creating a more favourable impression on the minds of the authorities mixing as i did only with other patients i could gain no clear ideas of what had happened since i had taken my fatal sleep and whenever i endeavoured to question the keepers they amused themselves by giving me evidently false and inconsistent answers in order to enjoy my chagrin and confusion i could not even learn the actual date of the present year for one keeper would laugh and say it was 2001 while another would confidentially advise me to date my petition to the commissioners jan 1 ad one million the surgeon who never played me any such pranks yet refused to aid me in any way lest as he said he should strengthen me in my sad delusion he was convinced that i must be an historical student whose reason had broken down through too close study of the eighteenth century and he felt certain that sooner or later my friends would come to claim me he is a gentle and humane man against whom i have no personal complaint to make but his initial misconception prevented him and everybody else from ever paying the least attention to my story i could not even induce them to make inquiries at my house at hampstead where the discovery of the subterranean laboratory would have partially proved the truth of my account  many visitors came to the asylum from time to time and they were always told that i possessed a minute and remarkable acquaintance with the history of the eighteenth century they questioned me about facts which are as vivid in my memory as those of the present month and were much surprised at the accuracy of my replies but they only thought it strange that so clever a man should be so very mad and that my information should be so full as to past events while my notions about the modern world were so utterly chaotic the surgeon however always believed that my reticence about all events posterior to 1781 was a part of my insanity i had studied the early part of the eighteenth century so fully he said that i fancied i had lived in it and i had persuaded myself that i knew nothing at all about the subsequent state of the world  the poor fellow stopped a while and again drew his sleeve across his forehead it was impossible to look at him and believe for a moment that he was a madman  and how did you make your escape from the asylum i asked  now this very evening he answered i simply broke away from the door and ran down toward the strand till i came to a place that looked a little like st martins fields with a great column and some fountains and near there i met you it seemed to me that the best thing to do was to catch the york coach and get away from the town as soon as possible you met me and your look and name inspired me with confidence i believe you must be a descendant of my dear brother  i have not the slightest doubt i answered solemnly that every word of your story is true and that you are really my greatgreatuncle my own knowledge of our family history exactly tallies with what you tell me i shall spare no endeavour to clear up this extraordinary matter and to put you once more in your true position  and you will protect me he cried fervently clasping my hand in both his own with intense eagerness you will not give me up once more to the asylum people  i will do everything on earth that is possible for you i replied  he lifted my hand to his lips and kissed it several times while i felt hot tears falling upon it as he bent over me it was a strange position look at it how you will grant that i was but the dupe of a madman yet even to believe for a moment that i a man of wellnigh fifty stood there in face of my own greatgrandfathers brother to all appearance some twenty years my junior was in itself an extraordinary and marvellous thing both of us were too overcome to speak it was a few minutes before we said anything and then a loud knock at the door made my hunted stranger rise up hastily in terror from his chair  gracious heavens he cried they have tracked me hither they are coming to fetch me oh hide me hide me anywhere from these wretches  as he spoke the door opened and two keepers with a policeman entered my room  ah here he is said one of them advancing towards the fugitive who shrank away towards the window as he approached  do not touch him i exclaimed throwing myself in the way every word of what he says is true and he is no more insane than i am  the keeper laughed a low laugh of vulgar incredulity why theres a pair of you i do believe he said youre just as mad yourself as tother one and he pushed me aside roughly to get at his charge  but the poor fellow seeing him come towards him seemed suddenly to grow instinct with a terrible vigour and hurled off the keeper with one hand as a strong man might do with a little terrier then before we could see what he was meditating he jumped upon the ledge of the open window shouted out loudly farewell farewell and leapt with a spring on to the embankment beneath  all four of us rushed hastily down the three flights of steps to the bottom and came below upon a crushed and mangled mass on the spattered pavement he was quite dead even the policeman was shocked and horrified at the dreadful way in which the body had been crushed and mutilated in its fall and at the suddenness and unexpectedness of the tragedy we took him up and laid him out in my room and from that room he was interred after the inquest with all the respect which i should have paid to an undoubted relative on his grave in kensal green cemetery i have placed a stone bearing the simple inscription jonathan spottiswood died 1881 the hint i had received from the keeper prevented me from saying anything as to my belief in his story but i asked for leave to undertake the duty of his interment on the ground that he bore my own surname and that no other person was forthcoming to assume the task the parochial authorities were glad enough to rid the ratepayers of the expense  at the inquest i gave my evidence simply and briefly dwelling mainly upon the accidental nature of our meeting and the facts as to his fatal leap i said nothing about the known disappearance of jonathan spottiswood in 1781 nor the other points which gave credibility to his strange tale but from this day forward i give myself up to proving the truth of his story and realizing the splendid chemical discovery which promises so much benefit to mankind for the first purpose i have offered a large reward for the discovery of a trapdoor in a coalcellar at hampstead leading into a subterranean passage and laboratory since unfortunately my unhappy visitor did not happen to mention the position of his house for the second purpose i have begun a series of experiments upon the properties of the essential oil of alchemilla and the possibility of successfully treating it with carbonic anhydride since unfortunately he was equally vague as to the nature of his process and the proportions of either constituent many people will conclude at once no doubt that i myself have become infected with the monomania of my miserable namesake but i am determined at any rate not to allow so extraordinary an anæsthetic to go unacknowledged if there be even a remote chance of actually proving its useful nature meanwhile i say nothing even to my dearest friends with regard to the researches upon which i am engaged     the empress of andorra   all the troubles in andorra arose from the fact that the town clerk had views of his own respecting the holy roman empire  of course everybody knows that for many centuries the republic of andorra situated in an isolated valley among the pyrenees has enjoyed the noble and inestimable boon of autonomy not that the andorrans have been accustomed to call it by that name because you see the name was not yet invented but the thing itself they have long possessed in all its full and glorious significance the ancient constitution of the republic may be briefly described as democracy tempered by stiletto the free and independent citizens did that which seemed right in their own eyes unless indeed it suited their convenience better to do that which seemed wrong and in the latter case they did it unhesitatingly so every man in andorra stabbed or shot his neighbour as he willed especially if he suspected his neighbour of a prior intention to stab or shoot him the republic contained no gallows capital punishment having been entirely abolished and for the matter of that all other punishment into the bargain in short the town of andorra was really a very eligible place of residence for families or gentlemen provided only they were decently expert in the use of the pistol  however in this model little republic as elsewhere society found itself ranged under two camps the liberal and the conservative and lest any man should herein suspect the present veracious historian of covert satirical intent or sly allusion to the politics of neighbouring states it may be well to add that there was not much to choose between the liberals and the conservatives of andorra  now the town clerk was the acknowledged and ostensible head of the great liberal party his name in full consisted of some twenty highsounding spanish prenomens followed by about the same number of equally highsounding surnames but i need only trouble you here with the first and last on the list which were simply señor don pedro henriquez it happened that don pedro being a learned man took in all the english periodicals and so i need hardly tell you that he was thoroughly well up in the holy roman empire question he could have passed a competitive examination on that subject before mr freeman or held a public discussion with professor bryce himself the town clerk was perfectly aware that the holy roman empire had come to an end pro tem at least in the year eighteen hundred and something when francis the first second or third renounced for himself and his heirs for ever the imperial roman title but the town clerk also knew that the holy roman empire had often lain in abeyance for years or even centuries and had afterwards been resuscitated by some karl whom the wicked call charlemagne some otto or some henry the fowler and the town clerk a bold and ambitious young man reflecting on these things had formed a deep scheme in his inmost heart the deep scheme was after this wise  why not revive the holy roman empire in andorra  nothing could be more simple more natural or more in accordance with the facts of history even mr freeman could have no plausible argument to urge against it for observe how well the scheme hangs together andorra formed an undoubted and integral portion of the roman empire having been included in region vii diocese 13 hispania citerior viii under the division of diocletian but the empire having gone to pieces at the present day any fragment of that empire may reconstitute itself the whole just as the tentacle of a hydra polype said don pedro who you know was a very learned man may reconstitute itself into a perfect animal by developing a body head mouth and footstalk this as you are well aware is called the analogical method of political reasoning therefore there was no just cause or impediment why andorra should not set up to be the original and only genuine representative of the holy roman empire all others being spurious imitationsq e d  the town clerk had further determined in his own mind that he himself was the karl not charlemagne who was destined to raise up this revived and splendid roman empire he had already struck coins in imagination bearing on the obverse his image and superscription and the proud title imp petrus p f aug pater patriæ cos xviii with a reverse of victory crowned and the legend renovatio romanorum but this part of his scheme he kept as yet deeply buried in the recesses of his own soul  as regards the details of this cæsarian plan much diversity of opinion existed in the minds of the liberal leaders don pedro himself as champion of education proposed that the new emperor should be elected by competitive examination in which case he felt sure that his own knowledge of the holy roman empire would easily place him at the head of the list but his colleague don luis dacosta who was the joseph hume of andorran politics rather favoured the notion of sending in sealed tenders for executing the office of sovereign the state not binding itself to accept the lowest or any other tender and he had himself determined to make an offer for wearing the crown at the modest remuneration of three hundred pounds per annum payable quarterly again don iago montes a poetical young man who believed firmly in prestige advocated the idea of inviting the younger son of some german grandduke to accept the imperial crown and the faithful hearts of a loyal andorran people but these minor points could easily be settled in the future and the important object for the immediate present said don pedro was the acceptance in principle of the resuscitated holy roman empire  don pedros designs however met with considerable opposition from the conservative party in the folk mote they called it folk mote and not cortes or fueros on purpose to annoy historical critics and for the same reason they always styled their chief magistrate not the alcalde but the burgomaster the conservative leader don juan pereira first and last names only intermediate thirtyeight omitted for want of space wisely observed that the good old constitution had suited our fathers admirably that we did not wish to go beyond the wisdom of our ancestors that young men were apt to prove thoughtless or precipitate and finally that nolumus leges andorræ mutare hereupon don pedro objected that the growing anarchy of the citizens whose stabbings were increasing by geometrical progression called for the establishment of a strong government which should curb the lawless habits of the jeunesse dorée but don juan retorted that stabbing was a very useful practice in its way that no citizen ever got stabbed unless he had made himself obnoxious to a fellowcitizen which was a gross and indefensible piece of incivism and that stilettos had always been considered extremely respectable instruments by a large number of deceased andorran worthies whose names he proceeded to recount in a long and somewhat tedious catalogue this you know is called the argument from authority the folk mote which consisted of men over forty alone unanimously adopted don juans views and at once rejected the town clerks bill for the resuscitation of the holy roman empire  thus driven to extremities the town clerk determined upon a coup détat the appeal to the people alone could save andorran society but being as cautious as he was ambitious he decided not to display his hand too openly at first accordingly he resolved to elect an empress to begin with and then by marrying the empress to become emperorconsort after which he could easily secure the imperial crown on his own account  to ensure the success of this excellent notion don pedro trusted to the emotions of the populace the way he did it was simply this  at that particular juncture a beautiful young prima donna had lately been engaged for the national italian opera andorra she was to appear as the grande duchesse on the very evening after that on which the resuscitation bill had been thrown out on a third reading this amiable lady bore the name of signorita nora obrienelli she was of italian parentage but born in america where her father signor patricio obrienelli a banished neapolitan nobleman and patriot had been better known as paddy obrien having adopted that disguise to protect himself from the ubiquitous emissaries of king bomba however on her first appearance upon any stage the signorita once more resumed her discarded patronymic of obrienelli and it is this circumstance alone which has led certain scandalous journalists maliciously to assert that her father was really an irish chimneysweep but not to dwell on these genealogical details it will suffice to say that signorita nora was a beautiful young lady with a magnificent soprano voice the enthusiastic and gallant andorrans were already wild at the mere sight of her beauty and expected great things from her operatic powers  don pedro marked his opportunity calling on the prima donna in the afternoon faultlessly attired in frockcoat chimneypot and lavender kid gloves the ambitious politician offered her a bouquet worth at least threeandsixpence accompanied by a profound bow and inquired whether the title and position of empress would suit her views  down to the ground my dear don pedro replied the impulsive actress the resuscitation of the holy roman empire has long been the dream of my existence  half an hour sufficed to settle the details the protocols were signed the engagements delivered and the fate of andorra with that of the holy roman empire attached trembled for a moment in the balance don pedro hastily left to organize the coup détat and to hire a special body of claqueurs for the occasion  evening drew on apace big with the fate of pedro and of rome the opera house was crowded stalls and boxes glittered with the partisans of the liberal leader the expectant hero of a revived cæsarism the claque occupied the pit and gallery enthusiasm real and simulated knew no bounds signorita obrienelli was almost smothered with bouquets and the music of catcalls resounded throughout the house at length in the second act when the prima donna entered crown on head and robes of state trained behind in the official costume of the grandduchess of gerolstein don pedro raised himself from his seat and cried in a loud voice long live nora empress of andorra and of the holy roman empire  the whole audience rose as one man long live the empress reechoed from every side of the building handkerchiefs waved ecstatically women sobbed with emotion old men wept tears of joy that they had lived to behold the renovation of the romans in five minutes the revolution was a fait accompli don juan pereira obtained early news of the coup détat and fled precipitately across the border to escape the popular vengeancenot a difficult feat as the boundaries of the quondam republic extended only five miles in any direction thence the brokenhearted old patriot betook himself into france where he intended at first to commit suicide in imitation of cato but on second thoughts he decided to proceed to guernsey where he entered into negotiations for purchasing victor hugos house and tried to pose as a kind of pendent to that banished poet and politician  although this mode of election was afterwards commented upon as informal by the european press don pedro successfully defended it in a learned letter to the times under the signature of historicus secundus in which he pointed out that a similar mode has long been practised by the sacred college who call it electio per inspirationem  the very next day the bishop of urgel drove over to andorra and crowned the happy prima donna as empress great rejoicings immediately followed and the illuminations were conducted on so grand a scale that the single tallowchandler in the town sold out his entire stockintrade and many houses went without candles for a whole week  of course the first act of the grateful sovereign was to extend her favour to don pedro who had been so largely instrumental in placing her upon the throne she immediately created him chancellor of andorra and prince of the holy roman empire the office of town clerk was abolished in perpetuity while an hereditary estate of five acres was conferred upon he the chancellor and his posterity for ever  don pedro had now the longwishedfor opportunity of improving the social and political position of that andorran people whom he had so greatly loved he determined to endow them with primary education a national debt free libraries and museums the income tax female suffrage trial by jury permissive prohibitory bills a plebiscitum an extradition treaty a magna charta association and all the other blessings of modern civilization by these means he hoped to ingratiate himself in the public favour and thus at length to place himself unopposed upon the imperial and holy roman throne  his first step was the settlement of the constitution and as he was quite determined in his own mind that the poor little empress should only be a puppet in the hands of her chancellor who was to act as mayor of the palace observe how well his historical learning stood him in good stead on all occasions he decided that the revived empire should take the form of a strictly limited monarchy he had some idea indeed of proclaiming it as the holy roman empire limited but on second thoughts it occurred to him that the phrase might be misinterpreted as referring to the somewhat exiguous extent of the andorran territory and as he wished it to be understood that the new state was an aggressive power which contemplated the final absorption of all the other latin races he wisely refrained from the equivocal title however he settled the constitution on a broad and liberal basis after the following fashion i quote from his rough draftsketch the completed document being too long for insertion in full  the supreme authority resides in the sovereign and the folk mote the sovereign reigns but does not govern at present the folk mote has full legislative and deliberative powers it consists of fourteen members chosen from the fourteen wards of east and west andorra members for spain france portugal and italy may hereafter be added raising the total complement to eighteen the right of voting is granted to all persons male or female above eighteen years of age the executive power rests with the chancellor of the empire who acts in the name of the sovereign he possesses a right of veto on all acts of the folk mote his office is perpetual vivat imperatrix  this constitution was proposed to a public assembly or comitia of the andorran people and was immediately carried nem con enthusiasm was the order of the day don pedro was a handsome young man of personal popularity the ladies of andorra were delighted with any scheme of government which offered them a vote and the men had all a high opinion of don pedros learning so nobody opposed a single clause of the constitution on any ground  the next step to be taken consisted in gaining the affections of the empress but here don pedro found to his consternation that he had reckoned without his hostess it is an easy thing to make a revolution in the body politic but it is much more serious to attempt a revolution in a womans heart her majestys had long been bestowed elsewhere it is true she had encouraged don pedros attentions on his first momentous visit but that might be largely accounted for on political grounds it is true also that she was still quite ready to carry on an innocent flirtation with her handsome young chancellor when he came to deliberate upon matters of state but that she had often done before with the lout of an actor who took the part of fritz prince she would say with one of her sunny smiles do just what you like about the permissive prohibitory bill and let us have a glass of sparkling sillery together in the council chamber you and i are too young and shall i say too goodlooking to trouble our poor little heads about politics and such rubbish youth after all is nothing without champagne and love  and yet her hearther heart was over the sea during one of her starring engagements among the central american states signorita obrienelli had made the acquaintance of don carlos montillado eldest son of the president of guatemala a mutual attachment had sprung up between the young couple and had taken the practical form of bouquets bracelets and champagne suppers but alas the difference in their ranks had long hindered the fulfilment of don carloss anxious vows his excellency the president constantly declared that nothing could induce him to consent to a marriage between his son and a strolling actressin such insolent terms did the wretch allude to the future occupant of an imperial throne now however all was changed fate had smiled upon the happy lovers and don carlos was already on his way to andorra as ambassador extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary from the guatemalan republic to the renovated empire the poor chancellor discovered too late that he had baited a hook for his own destruction  however he did not yet despair to be sure the empress young beautiful and with a magnificent soprano voice had seated herself firmly in the hearts of her susceptible subjects besides her engaging manners marked by all the charming abandon of the stage allowed her to make conquests freely among her lieges each of whom she encouraged in turn while smiling slily at the discarded rivals still don pedro took heart once more revolution enthroned her he muttered between his teeth and counterrevolution shall disenthrone her yet these silly people will smirk and bow while she pretends to be in love with every one of them from day to day but when once the young guatemalan has carried off the prize they will regret their folly and turn to the chancellor whose heart has always been fixed upon the welfare of andorra  with this object in view the astute politician worked harder than ever for the regeneration of the state his policy falls under two heads the external and the internal each head deserves a passing mention from the laborious historian  don pedros external policy consisted in the annexation of france spain portugal and italy and the amalgamation of the latin races accordingly he despatched ambassadors to the courts of those four powers informing them that the holy roman empire had been resuscitated in andorra and inviting them to send in their adhesion to the new state in that case he assured them that each country should possess a representative in the imperial folk mote on the same terms as the several wards of andorra itself and that the settlement of local affairs should be left unreservedly to the minor legislatures while the chancellor of the empire in person would manage the military and naval forces and the general executive department of the whole confederation as the four powers refused to take any notice of don pedros manifesto the chancellor declared to the folk mote his determination of treating them as recalcitrant rebels and reducing them by force of arms however the andorran army not being thoroughly mobilized and indeed having fallen into a state of considerable demoralization the ambitious prince decided to postpone the declaration of war sine die and his foreign policy accordingly stood over for the time being  don pedros internal policy embraced various measures of finance electoral law public morals and police regulation  the financial position of andorra was now truly deplorable in addition to the expenses of the imperial election and the hire of posthorses for the bishop of urgel to attend the coronation it cannot be denied that the empress had fallen into most extravagant habits she insisted upon drinking veuve clicquot every day for dinner and upon ordering large quantities of olives farcies and pâté de foie gras to which delicacies she was inordinately attached she also sent to a parisian milliner for two new bonnets and had her measure taken for a poult de lyon dress these expensive tastes contracted upon the stage soon drained the andorran exchequer and the folk mote was at its wits end to devise a budget one radical member had even the bad taste to call for a return of her majestys millinery bill but this motion the house firmly and politely declined to sanction at last don pedro stepped in to solve the difficulty and proposed an act for the inflation of the currency  inflation is a very simple financial process indeed it consists in writing on a small piece of white paper this is a dollar or this is a pound as the case may be and then compelling your creditors to accept the paper as payment in full for the amount written upon its face the scheme met with perfect success and don pedro was much bepraised by the press as the glorious regenerator of andorran finance  among the chancellors plans for electoral reform the most important was the bill for the promotion of infant suffrage don pedro shrewdly argued that if you wished to be popular in the future you must enlist the sympathies of the rising generation by conferring upon them some signal benefit hence his advocacy of infant suffrage in his great speech to the folk mote upon this important measure he pointed out that the brutal doctrine of an appeal to force in the last resort ill befitted the nineteenth century many infants owned property therefore they ought to be represented their property was taxed no taxation without representation therefore they ought to be represented great cruelties were often practised upon them by their parents which showed how futile was the argument that their parents vicariously represented them therefore they ought to be directly represented an honourable member on the opposition side had suggested that dogs were also taxed and that great cruelties were occasionally practised upon dogs those facts were perfectly true and he could only say that they proved to him the thorough desirability of insuring representation for dogs at some future day but we must not move too fast he was no hasty radical no violent reconstructionist he preferred stone by stone to build up the sure and perfect fabric of their liberties so he would waive for the time being the question concerning the rights of dogs and only move at present the third reading of the bill for the promotion of infant suffrage a division was hardly necessary the house passed the act by a majority of twelve out of a total of fourteen members  the bills for the gratuitous distribution of lollipops for the wednesday and saturday whole holidays and for the total abolition of latin grammar followed as a matter of course the minds of the infant electors were thus thoroughly enlisted on the chancellors side  as to moral regeneration that was mainly ensured by the act for the absolute suppression of the tea trade no man said the chancellor had a right to endanger the health and happiness of his posterity by the pernicious habit of teadrinking alcohol they had suppressed and tobacco they had suppressed but tea still remained a plaguespot in their midst it had been proved that tea and coffee contained poisonous alkaloid principles known as theine and caffeine here the chancellor displayed the full extent of his chemical learning which were all but absolutely identical with the poisonous principles of opium prussic acid and atheistical literature generally it might be said that this bill endangered the liberty of the subject no man had a greater respect for the liberty of the subject than he had he adored he idolized he honoured with absolute apotheosis the liberty of the subject but in what did it consist not assuredly in the right to imbibe a venomous drug which polluted the stream of life for future generations and was more productive of manifold diseases than even vaccination itself tea cried the orator passionately raising his voice till the fresh whitewash on the ceiling of the council chamber trembled with sympathetic emotion tea forsooth call it rather strychnine call it arsenic call it the deadly upastree of java antiaris toxicaria linnæuswhat prodigious learningwhich poisons with its fatal breath whoever ventures to pass beneath its baleful shadow i see it driving out of the field the harmless chocolate of our forefathers i see it forcing its way into the earliest meal of morning and the latest meal of eve i see it now once more swarming over the pyrenees from france with paris fashions and bad romances to desecrate the sacred hour of five oclock with its newfangled presence the infant in arms finds it rendered palatable to his tender years by the insidious addition of copious milk and sugar the hallowed reverence of age forgets itself in disgraceful excesses at the refreshmentroom of railway stations this is the ubiquitous pest which distils its venom into every sex and every age this is the enchanted chalice of the cathaian circe which i ask you to repel today from the lips of the young the pure and the virtuous  it was an able and eloquent effort but even the chancellors powers were all but overtasked in so hard a struggle against ignorance and prejudice unhappily several of the members were themselves secretly addicted to that cup of five oclock tea to which don pedro so feelingly alluded in the end however by taking advantage of the temporary absence of three senators who had gone to indulge their favourite vice at home the bill triumphantly passed its third reading by an overwhelming majority of chocolate drinkers and became forthwith the law of the holy roman empire  meanwhile don carlos montillado had crossed the stormy seas in safety and arrived by special mule at the city of andorra he took up his quarters at the guatemalan embassy and immediately sent his card to the empress and the chancellor requesting the honour of an early interview  the empress at once despatched a note requesting don carlos to present himself without delay in the private drawingroom of the palace the happy lover and ambassador flew to her side and for half an hour the pair enjoyed the delicious paradise of a mutual attachment at the end of that period don pedro presented himself at the door  your majesty he exclaimed in a tone of surprise this is a most irregular proceeding his excellency the guatemalan ambassador should have called in the first instance upon the imperial chancellor  prince replied the empress firmly i refuse to give you audience at present i am engaged on private businesson strictly private businesswith his excellency  excuse me said the chancellor blandly but i must assure your majesty  leave the room prince said the empress with an impatient gesture leave the room at once  leave the room fellow when a lady speaks to you cried the impetuous young guatemalan drawing his sword and pushing don pedro bodily out of the door  the die was cast the rubicon was crossed don pedro determined on a counterrevolution and waited for his revenge nor had he long to wait  half an hour later as don carlos was passing out of the palace on his way home to dress for dinner six stout constables seized him by the arms handcuffed him on the spot and dragged him off to the imperial prison at the suit of his excellency the chancellor they said in explanation and hurried him away without another word  the empress was furious how dare you she shrieked to don pedro what right have you to imprison himthe accredited representative of a foreign power  excuse me answered don pedro in his smoothest tone article 39 of the penal code enacts that the person of the chancellor is sacred and that any individual who violently assaults him with arms in hand may be immediately committed to prison without trial by her majestys command article 40 further provides that foreign ambassadors and other privileged persons are not exempt from the penalties of the previous article  but sir cried the angry little empress she was too excited now to remember that don pedro was a prince i never gave any command to have don carlos imprisoned release him at once i tell you  your majesty forgets replied the chancellor quietly that by article i of the constitution the sovereign reigns but does not govern the prerogative is solely exercised through the chancellor létat cest moi and he struck an attitude  so you refuse to let him out said the empress maynt i marry who i like maynt i even settle who shall be my own visitors  certainly not your majesty if the interests of the state demand that it should be otherwise  then ill resign shrieked out the poor little empress with a burst of tears ill withdraw ill retire ill abdicate  by all means said the chancellor coolly we can easily find another sovereign quite as good  the shrewd little exactress looked hard into don pedros face she was an adept in the art of reading emotions and she saw at once what don pedro really wished in a moment she had changed front and stood up once more every inch an empress no i wont she cried i see you would be glad to get rid of me and i shall stop here to baffle and thwart you and i shall marry carlos and we shall fight it out to the bitter end so saying she darted out of the room redeyed but majestic and banged the door after her with a slam as she went  henceforward it was open war between them don pedro did not dare to depose the empress who had still a considerable body of partisans amongst the andorran people but he resolutely refused to release the guatemalan legate and decided to accept hostilities with the central american republic in order to divert the minds of the populace from internal politics if he returned home from the campaign as a successful commander he did not doubt that he would find himself sufficiently powerful to throw off the mask and to assume the imperial purple in name as well as in reality  accordingly before the guatemalan president could receive the news of his sons imprisonment don pedro resolved to prepare for war his first care was to strengthen the naval resources of his country the oppositionthat is to say the empresss partyobjected that andorra had no seaboard but don pedro at once overruled that objection by dint of several parallel instances the province of upper canada now ontario added the careful historical student had no seaboard yet the canadians placed numerous gunboats on the great lakes during the war of 1812 what research again the nile the indus the ganges and many other great rivers had been the scene of important naval engagements as early as bc 1082 which he could show from the evidence of papyri now preserved in the british museum what universal knowledge the objection was frivolous but answered the opposition andorra has neither lakes nor navigable rivers this don pedro considered was mere hairsplitting perhaps they would tell him next it had no gutters or waterbutts besides we must accommodate ourselves to the environment this you see conclusively proves that the chancellor had read mr herbert spencer and was thoroughly well up in the minutiæ of the evolutionist philosophy had they never looked into their thucydides did they not remember the famous holkos or trench whereby the athenian triremes were lifted across the isthmus of corinth well he proposed in like manner to order a large number of ironclads from an eminent glasgow firm to pull them overland up the pyrenees and to plant them on the mountain tops around andorra as permanent batteries that was what he meant by adaptation to the environment  so the order was given to the eminent glasgow firm who forthwith supplied the empire with ten magnificent clydebuilt ironclads having 14inch plates and patent doublesecurity rivets mounting twelve eightyton guns apiece and fitted up with all the latest woolwich improvements these vessels were then hauled up the mountains as don pedro proposed and there they stood on the tallest neighbouring summits in very little danger of going to the bottom as the ironclads of other powers are so apt to do in return don pedro tendered payment by means of five million pounds inflated currency which he assured the eminent shipbuilders were quite as good as gold if not a great deal better the firm was at first inclined to demur to this mode of payment but don pedro immediately retorted that they did not seem to understand the currency question and as this is an imputation which no gentleman could endure for a moment the eminent shipbuilders pocketed the inflated paper at once and pretended to think no more about it  however there was one man among them who rather mistrusted inflation because you see his education had been sadly neglected especially as regards the works of american political economists in which don pedro was so deeply versed now this ignorant and misguided man went straight off to the stock exchange with his share of the five millions and endeavoured to negotiate a few hundred thousands for pocketmoney but it turned out that all the other stock exchange magnates were just as illinformed as himself with respect to inflation and the currency question at large and they persisted in declaring that a piece of paper is really none the better for having the words this is a pound written across its face so the eminent shipbuilder returned home disconsolate and next day instituted proceedings in chancery against the holy roman empire at andorra for the recovery of five million pounds sterling what came at last of this important suit you shall hear in the sequel  meanwhile poor don carlos remained incarcerated in the imperial prison and preparations for war went on with vigour and activity both in andorra and guatemala naturally the greatest excitement prevailed throughout europe and especially in the sympathetic republic of san marino very different views of the situation were expressed by the various periodicals of that effusive state the matutinal agitator declared that andorra under the obrienelli dynasty had become a dangerously aggressive power and that no peace could be expected in europe until the andorrans had been taught to recognize their true position in the scale of nations the vespertinal sentimentalist on the other hand looked upon the guatemalans as wanton disturbers of the public quietude and considered andorra in the favourable light of an oppressed nationality the hebdomadal tranquillizer which treated both sides with contemptavowing that it held the andorrans to be little better than lawless brigands in the last stage of bankruptcy and the guatemalans to be mere drunken halfcastes incapable of attack or defence for want of men and moneythis lukewarm and meanspirited journal i say was treated with universal contumely as a wretched timeserver devoid of human sympathies and of proper cosmopolitan expansiveness at length however through the good offices of the san marino government both powers were induced to lay aside the thought of needless bloodshed and to discuss the terms of a mutual understanding at a panhispanic congress to be held in the neutral metropolis of monaco  invitations to attend the congress were issued to all the spanishspeaking nations on both sides of the atlantic there were a few trifling refusals it is true as spain mexico and the south american states declined to send representatives to the proposed meeting but still a goodly array of plenipotentiaries met to discuss the terms of peace envoys from andorra from guatemala and from the other central american republicsone of whom was of course a chevalier of the exalted order of the holy rose of honduras while another represented the latest president of nicaraguasat down by the side of a coloured marquis from san domingo and a mulatto general who presented credentials from the republic of cubasince unhappily extinct thus it will be seen at a glance that the congress wanted nothing which could add to its imposing character either as an international parliament or as an expression of military panhispanic force europe felt instinctively that its deliberations were backed up by all the vast terrestrial and naval armaments of its constituent powers  but while don pedro was pulling the wires of the monaco convention by telegraph from his headquarters at andorrahe could not himself have attended its meeting lest his august sovereign should embrace the opportunity of releasing the captive guatemalan and so stopping his hopes of future successhe had to contend at home not only with the covert opposition of the brave little empress but also with the open rebellion of a disaffected minority the five wards which constitute east andorra had long been at secret variance with the nine wards of west andorra and they seized upon this moment of foreign complications to organize a home rule party and set on foot a movement of secession after a few months of mere parliamentary opposition they broke at last into overt acts of treason seized on three of don pedros ironclads and proclaimed themselves a separate government under the title of the confederate wards of andorra this last blow almost broke don pedros heart he had serious thoughts of giving up all for lost and retiring into a monastery for the term of his natural life  as it happened however the chancellor was spared the necessity for that final humiliation and the panhispanic congress was relieved of its arduous duties by the sudden intervention of a hitherto passive power great britain woke at last to a sense of her own prestige and the necessities of the situation the court of chancery decided that the inflated currency was not legal tender and adjudicated the bankrupt state of andorra to the prosecuting creditors the firm of eminent shipbuilders at glasgow a sheriffs officer backed by a company of british grenadiers was despatched to take possession of the territory in the name of the assignees and to repel any attempt at armed resistance  political considerations had no little weight in the decision which led to this imposing military demonstration it was felt that if we permitted guatemala to keep up a squadron of ironclads in the caribbean a perpetual menace would overshadow our tenure of jamaica and barbadoes while if we suffered andorra to overrun the peninsula our position at gibraltar would not be worth a fortnights purchase for these reasons the abovementioned expeditionary force was detailed for the purpose of attaching the insolent empire liberating the imprisoned guatemalan and entirely removing the casus belli it was hoped that such prompt and vigorous action would deter the central american states from their extensive military preparations which had already reached to several pounds of powder and over one hundred stand of martinihenry rifles  our demonstration was quite as successful as the little wars of great britain have always been don pedro made some show of resistance with his eightyton guns but finding that the contractors had only supplied them with wooden bores he deemed it prudent at length to beat a precipitate retreat as to the poor little empress she had long learned to regard herself as a cypher in the realm over which she reigned but did not govern and she was therefore perfectly ready to abdicate the throne and resign the crown jewels to the sheriffs officer she did so with the less regret because the crown was only aluminium and the jewels only pastebeing in fact the identical articles which she had worn in her theatrical character as the grandduchess of gerolstein the quondam republic was far from rich and it had been glad to purchase these convenient regalia from the propertyman at the theatre on the eventful morning of the imperial coronation  don carlos was immediately liberated by the victorious troops and rushed at once into the arms of his inamorata the bishop of urgel married them as private persons on the very same afternoon the exempress returned to the stage and made her first reappearance in london where the history of her misfortunes and the sympathy which the british nation always extends to the conquered rapidly secured her an unbounded popularity don carlos practised with success on the violin and joined the orchestra at the same house where his happy little wife appeared as prima donna señor montillado the elder at first announced his intention of cutting off his son with a shilling but being shortly after expelled from the presidency of the guatemalan republic by one of the triennial revolutions which periodically diversify life in that volcanic state he changed his mind took the mail steamer to southampton and obtained through his sons influence a remunerative post as pantaloon at a neighbouring theatre  the eminent shipbuilders took possession of east and west andorra quelled the insurrectionary movement of the confederate wards and brought back the ten ironclads together with the crown jewels and other public effects on the whole they rather gained than lost by the national bankruptcy as they let out the conquered territory to the andorran people at a neat little groundrent of some £20000 per annum  don pedro fled across the border to toulouse where he obtained congenial employment as clerk to an avoué he was also promptly elected secretary to the local academy of science and art a post for which his varied attainments fit him in the highest degree he has given up all hopes of the resuscitation of the holy roman empire and is now engaged to a businesslike young woman at the café de lunivers who will effectually cure him of all lingering love for transcendental politics  finally if any hypercritical person ventures to assert that this history is based upon a total misconception of the holy roman empire questionthat i am completely mistaken about francis ii utterly wrong about otto the great and hopelessly fogged about henry the fowleri can only answer that i take these statements as i find them in the notebooks of don pedro and the printed debates of the andorran folk mote like a veracious historian i cannot go beyond my authorities but i think you will agree with me my courteous reader that the dogmatic omniscience of these historical critics is really beginning to surpass human endurance     the senior proctors wooing  a tale of two continents   i  i was positively blinded i could hardly read the note a neatly written little square sheet of paper and the words seemed to swim before my eyes it was in the very thick of summer term and i cyril payne ma senior proctor of the university of oxford was calmly asked to undertake the sole charge for a week of a wild american girl travelling alone and probably expecting me to run about with her just as foolishly as i had done at nice there it lay before me that awful note in its overwhelming conciseness without hope of respite or interference it was simply crushing       my dear mr payne       i am coming to oxford as you advised me i shall arrive tomorrow      by the 1015 am train and mean to stop at the randolph i hope      you will kindly show me all the lions    yours very sincerely   ida van rensselaer  it was dated tuesday and this was wednesday morning i hadnt opened my letters before seeing last nights charges at nine oclock and it was now just ten in a moment the full terror of the situation flashed upon me she had started she was already almost here there was no possibility of telegraphing to stop her before i could do anything she would have arrived have taken rooms at the randolph and have come round in her queer american manner to call upon me there was not a moment to be lost i must rush down to the station and meet herin full academicals velvet sleeves and all for a proctor must never be seen in the morning in mufti if there had been half an hour more i could have driven round by the parks and called for my sister annie who was married to the rev theophilus sheepshanks professor of comparative osteology and who might have helped me out of the scrape but as things stood i was compelled to burst down the high just as i was hail a hansom opposite queens and drive furiously to the station in bare time to meet the 1015 train at all hazards ida van rensselaer must not go to the randolph and must be carried off to annies whether she would or not on the way down i had time to arrange my plan of action and before i reached the station i thought i saw my way dimly out of the awful scrape which this mad yankee girl had so inconsiderately got me into  i had met ida van rensselaer the winter before at nice we stopped together at a pension on the promenade des anglais and as i was away from oxfordfor even a proctor must unbend sometimesand as she was a pleasant lively young person with remarkably fine eyes travelling by herself i had taken the trouble to instruct her in european scenery and european art she had a fancy for being original so i took her to see eza and roccabrunna and st pons and all the other queer picturesque little places in the nice district which no american had ever dreamt of going to see before and when ida went on to florence i happenedquite accidentally of courseto turn up at the very same pension three days later where i gave her further lessons in the art of admiring the early mediæval masters and the other treasures of giottos city i was a bit of a collector myself and in my rooms at magdalen i flatter myself that i have got the only one genuine botticelli in a private collection in england in spite of her untamed american savagery ida had a certain taste for these things and evidently my lessons gave her the first glimpse she had ever had of that real interior europe whose culture she had not previously suspected it is pleasant to teach a pretty pupil and in the impulse of a weak momentit was in a gondola at venicei even told her that she should not leave for america without having seen oxford of course i fancied that she would bring a chaperon now she had taken me at my word but she had come alone i had brought it all upon myself undoubtedly though how the dickens i was ever to get out of it i could not imagine  as i reached the station the 1015 was just coming in i cast a wild glance right and left and saw at least a dozen undergraduates without cap or gown loitering on the platform in obvious disregard of university law but i felt far too guilty to proctorize them and i was terribly conscious that all their eyes were fixed upon me as i moved up and down the carriages looking for my american friend she caught my eye in a moment peering out of a secondclass windowshe had told me that she was not well offand i thought i should have sunk in the ground when she jumped lightly out seized my hand warmly and cried out quite audibly in her pretty faintly american voice my dear mr payne i am so glad youve come to meet me will you see after my baggageno luggage you call it in england dont youand get it sent up to the randolph please at once  was ever proctor so tried on this earth but i made an effort to smile it off my sister is so sorry she could not come to meet you miss van rensselaer i said in my loudest voice for i saw all those twelve sinister undergraduates watching afar off with eager curiosity but she has sent me down to carry you off in her stead and she begs you wont think of going to the randolph but will come and make her house your home as long as you stay in oxford i flattered myself that the twelve odious young men who were now forming a sort of irregular circle around us would be completely crushed by that masterly stroke though what on earth annie would say at being saddled with this yankee girl for a week i hardly dared to fancy for annie was a professors wife and the dignity of a professors wife is almost as serious a matter as that of a senior proctor himself  imagine my horror then when ida answered with her frank smile and sunny voice your sister i didnt know you had a sister and anyhow i havent come to see your sister but yourself and id better go to the randolph straight im sure because i shall feel more at home there you can come round and see me whenever you like there and i mean you to show me all oxford now ive come here thats certain  i glanced furtively at the openeared undergraduates and felt that the game was really up i could never face them again i must resign everything take orders and fly to a country rectory at least i thought so on the spur of the moment  but something must clearly be done i couldnt stand and argue out the case with ida before those twelve young fiends now reinforced by a group of porters and i determined to act strategicallythat is to say tell a white lie you can go to the randolph of course if you wish miss van rensselaer i said will you come and show me which is your luggage here you sir to one of the portersa little angrily i fearcome and get this ladys boxes will you  in a minute i had secured the boxes and went out for a cab there was nothing left but a single hansom demoralized as i was i took it and put ida inside drive to lechlade villa the parks i whispered to the cabbythat was annies addressand i jumped in beside my torturer as we drove up by the cornmarket i could see the porters and scouts of balliol and johns all looking eagerly out at the unwonted sight of a senior proctor in full academicals driving through the streets of oxford in a hansom cab with a lady by his side as for ida she remained happily unconscious though i blamed her none the less for it in her native wilds i knew that such vagaries were permitted by the rules of society but she ought surely to have known that in europe they were not admissible  now miss van rensselaer i said as we turned the corner of carfax i am taking you to my sisters excuse my frankness if i tell you that according to english and especially to oxford etiquette it would never do for you to go to an hotel peoples sense of decorum would be scandalized if they learnt that a lady had come alone to visit the senior proctor and was stopping at the randolph dont you see yourself how very odd it looks  well no said ida promptly i think you are a dreadfully suspicious people you seem always to credit everybody with the worst motives in america we think people mean no harm and dont look after them so sharply as you do but i really cant go to your sisters i dont know her and i havent been invited does she know im coming  well i cant say she does i answered hesitatingly you see your letter only reached me half an hour ago and i had no time to see her before i went to meet you  then i certainly wont go mr payne thats certain  but my dear miss van rensselaer  not the slightest use i assure you i cant go to a house where they dont even know im coming driver will you go to the randolph hotel please  i sank back paralyzed and unmanned this girl was one too many for me miss van rensselaer i cried in a last despairing fit do you know that as senior proctor of the university i have the power to order you away from oxford and that if i told them at the randolph not to take you in they wouldnt dare to do it  well really mr payne i dare say you have some extraordinary mediæval customs here but you can hardly mean to send me away again by main force i shall go to the randolph  and she went i had to draw up solemnly at the door to accompany her to the office and to see her safely provided with a couple of rooms before i could get away hastily to the ancient house of convocation where public business was being delayed by my absence as i hurried through the schools quadrangle i felt like a convicted malefactor going to face his judges and selfcondemned by his very face  that afternoon as soon as i had gulped down a choking lunch i bolted down to the parks and saw annie at first i thought it was a hopeless task to convince her that ida van rensselaers conduct was from an american point of view nothing extraordinary she persisted in declaring that such goingson were not respectable and that i was bound as an officer of the university to remove the young woman at once from the eightmile radius over which my jurisdiction extended i pleaded in vain that ladies in america always travelled alone and that nobody thought anything of it annie pertinently remarked that that would be excellent logic in new york but that it was quite unaristotelian in oxford when your american friends come to rome she said coldlyas though i were in the habit of importing yankee girls wholesalethey must do as rome does but when i at last pointed out that ida as an american citizen could appeal to her minister if i attempted to turn her out and that we might find ourselves the centre of an international quarrelpossibly even a casus bellishe finally yielded with a struggle for the sake of respectability she said solemnly ill go and call on this girl with you but remember cyril i shall never undertake to help you out of such a disgraceful scrape a second time i sneaked out into the garden to wait for her and felt that the burden of a proctorship was really more than i could endure  we called duly upon ida that very hour and ida certainly behaved herself remarkably well she was so charmingly frank and pretty she apologized so simply to annie for her ignorance of english etiquette and she was so obviously guileless and innocenthearted in all her talk that even annie herselfwho is i must confess a typical dons wifewas gradually mollified to my great surprise annie even asked her to dinner en famille the same evening and suggested that i should make an arrangement with the junior proctor to take my work and join the party i consented not without serious misgivings but i felt that if ida was really going to stop a week it would be well to put the best face upon it and to show her up in company with annie as often as possible that might just conceivably take the edge off the keen blade of university scandal  to cut a long story short ida did stop her week and i got through it very creditably after all annie behaved like a brick as soon as the first chill was over for though she is married to a professor of dry bones comparative osteology sounds very well but means no more than that when you come to think of it she is a woman at heart in spite of it all ida had the most winning charming confiding manner and she was so pleased with oxford with the colleges the libraries the gardens the river the boats the mediæval air the whole place that she quite gained annie over to her side nay my sister even discovered incidentally that ida had a little fortune of her own amounting to some £300 a year which though it doesnt count for much in america would be a neat little sum to a man like myself in england and she shrewdly observed in her sensible businesslike manner that it would quite make up for the possible loss of my magdalen fellowship i am not exactly what you call a marrying manat least i know i had never got married before but as the week wore on and i continued boating flirting and acting showman to ida annie of course always assisting for proprietys sake i began to feel that the proctor was being conquered by the man i fell most seriously and undoubtedly in love ida admired my rooms was charmed with the pretty view from my windows over magdalen bridge and the beautiful gardens and criticized my botticelli with real sympathy i was interested in her she was so fresh so real and so genuinely delighted with the new world which opened before her it was almost her first glimpse of the true interior europe and she was fascinated with it as all better american minds invariably are when they feel the charm of its contrast with their own hurrying bustling mushroom world the week passed easily and pleasantly enough and when it was drawing to an end i had half made up my mind to propose to ida van rensselaer  the day before she was to leave she told us she would not go out in the afternoon so i determined to stroll down the river to iffley by myself in a tub dingeya small boat with room in it for two if occasion demands when i reached the iffley lock imagine my horror at seeing ida in the middle of the stream quietly engaged in paddling herself down the river in a canoe i ran my dingey close beside her drove her remorselessly against the bank and handed her out on to the meadow before she could imagine what i was driving at  now miss van rensselaer i said sternly this will never do by herculean efforts annie and i have got over this week without serious scandal and at the last moment you endeavour to wreck our plans by canoeing down the open river by yourself before the eyes of the whole university everybody will talk about the senior proctors visitor having been seen indecorously paddling about in broad daylight in a boat of her own  i didnt know there was any harm in it said ida penitently for she was beginning to understand the real seriousness of university etiquette  well i answered it cant be helped now you must get into my boat at onceill send one of salters men down to fetch your canoeand we must row straight back to oxford immediately  she obeyed me mechanically and i began to pull away for very life theres nothing for it now i said pensively except to propose to you i half meant to do it before and now ive quite made up my mind will you have me  ida looked at me without surprise but with a little pleasure in her face what nonsense she said quietly i knew you were going to propose to me this afternoon and so i came out alone to keep out of your way you havent had time to make up your mind properly yet  as i looked at her beautiful calm face and lovely eyes i forgot everything in a moment i was over head and ears in love again and conscious of nothing else ida i cried looking at her steadily ida  now please stop said ida before i could get any further i know exactly what youre going to say youre going to say ida i love you dont desecrate the verb to love by draggling it more than it has already been draggled through all the grammars of every european language ive conjugated to love myself in english french german and italian and youve conjugated it in latin and greek and for aught i know in anglosaxon and coptic and assyrian as well so now lets have done with it for ever and conjugate some other verb more worthy the attention of two rational and original human beings cant you strike out a line for yourself  youre quite mistaken i answered curtly for i wasnt going to be browbeaten in that way i meant to say nothing of the sort what i did mean to sayand ill trouble you to listen to it attentivelywas just this you seem to me about as well suited to my abstract requirements as any other young woman i have ever met and if youre inclined to take me we might possibly arrange an engagement  what a funny man you are she went on innocently you dont propose at all en règle ive had twelve men propose to me separately in a boat in america and you make up the bakers dozen but all the others leaned forward lackadaisically dropped the oars when they were beginning to get serious and looked at me sentimentally while you go on rowing all the time as if there was nothing unusual in it  probably i suggested your twelve american admirers attached more importance to the ceremony than i do but you havent answered my question yet  let me ask you one instead she said more seriously do you think im at all the kind of person for a senior proctors wife you say i suit your abstract requirements but one cant get married in the abstract you know viewed concretely dont you fancy im about the most unsuitable helpmate you could possibly light upon  the profound consciousness of that indubitable fact i replied carelessly has made me struggle in a hopeless sort of way against the irresistible impulse to propose to you ever since i saw you first but i suppose senior proctors are much the same as other men they fly like moths about the candle and cant overcome the temptation of singeing their wings  if i had any notion of accepting you said ida reflectively i should at least have the consolation of knowing that you didnt make anything by your bargain for my fifteen hundred dollars would just amount to the three hundred a year which you would have to give up with your fellowship  quite so i answered i see you come of a businesslike nation and i as former bursar of my college am a man of business myself so i have no reason for concealing from you the fact that i have a private income of about four hundred a year besides university appointments worth five hundred more which would not go with the fellowship  do you really think me sordid enough to care for such considerations  if i did i wouldnt have taken the trouble to tell you them i merely mentioned the facts for their general interest and not as bearing on the question in hand  well then mr payne you shall have my answerno  is it final  is anything human final except ones twentyninth birthday i choose it to be final for the present and the subject then dropped as the papers say about debates in congress let us have done now with this troublesome verb altogether and conjugate our return to oxford instead see what bunches of fritillaries again i never saw anything prettier except the orangelilies in new hampshire if you like you may come to america next season you would enjoy our woodlands  where shall i find you  at saratoga  when  any day from july the first  good i said after a moments reflection if i stick to my fancy for flying into the candle you will see me there if i change my mind it wont matter much to either of us  so we paddled back to oxford talking all the way of indifferent subjects of england and our english villages and enjoying the peaceful greenness of the trees and banks it was halfpast six when we got to salters barge and i walked with ida as far as the randolph then i returned to college feeling very much like an undetected sheepstealer and had a furtive sort of dinner served up in my own room next morning i confess it was with a sigh of relief that annie and i saw ida van rensselaer start from the station en route for liverpool it was quite a fortnight before i could face my own bulldogs unabashed and i bowed with a wan and guilty smile upon my face whenever any one of those twelve undergraduates capped me in the high till the end of term i believe they never missed an opportunity of meeting me if they saw a chance open i was glad indeed when long vacation came to ease me of my office and my troubles   ii  congress hall in saratoga is really one of the most comfortable hotels at which i ever stopped of course it holds a thousand guests and covers an unknown extent of area it measures its passages by the mile and its carpets by the acre all that goes unsaid for it is a big american hotel but it is also a very pleasant and luxurious one even for america i was not sorry on the second of july to find myself comfortably quartered by elevator in room no 547 on the fifth floor with a gay lookout on broadway and the columbia spring after ten days of dismal rolling on the midatlantic and a week of hurry and bustle in new york i found it extremely delightful to sit down at my ease in summer quarters on a broad balcony overlooking the leafy promenade to sip my iced cobbler like a prince and to watch that strange new and wonderfully holiday life which was unfolding itself before my eyes such a phantasmagoria of brightlydressed women in light but costly silks of lounging young men in tweed suits and panama hats of sulkies carriages trotting horses string bands icecreams effervescing drinks cool fruits green trees waving bunting lilac blossoms roses and golden sunshine i had never seen till then and shall never see again i doubt me until i can pay a second visit to saratoga it was a midsummer saturnalia of strawberries and acacia flowers gone mad with excessive mint julep  after all said i to myself even if i dont happen to run up against ida van rensselaer i shall have taken as pleasant a holiday as i could easily have found in old europe everybody is tired of switzerland and italy so happy thought try saratoga on the other hand if ida keeps her tryst i shall have one more shot at her in the shape of a proposal and then if she really means no i shall be none the worse off than if i had stayed in england in which happygolucky and philosophic frame of mind i sat watching the crowd in the broadway after dinner in utrumque paratus ready either to marry ida if she would have me or to go home again in the autumn a joyous bachelor if she did not turn up according to her promise a very coldblooded attitude that to assume towards the tender passion no doubt but after all why should a sensible man of thirtyfive think it necessary to go wild for a year or two like a hobbledehoy and convert himself into a perambulating statue of melancholy simply because one particular young woman out of the nine hundred million estimated to inhabit this insignificant planet has refused to print his individual name upon her visiting cards ida would make as good a mrs cyril payne as any other girl of my acquaintanceno doubt indeed i am inclined to say a vast deal a better one but there are more women than five in the world and if you strike an average i dare say most of them are pretty much alike  as i sat and looked i could not help noticing the extraordinary magnificence of all the toilettes in the promenade nowhere in europe can you behold such a republican dead level of reckless extravagance every woman was dressed like a princess nothing more and nothing less i began to wonder how poor little ida with her simple and tasteful travelling gowns would feel when she found herself cast in the midst of these gorgeous silks and these costly satin grenadines look for example at that pair now strolling along from spring avenue a new york exquisite in the very coolest of american summer suits and a new york élégante their own word i assure you in a splendid but graceful grey silk dress gold bracelet diamond earrings and every other item in her costume of the finest and costliest what would ida do in a crowd of such women as that why  gracious heavens  can it be no it cant yes it must well to be sure it positively isida herself  my first impulse was to lean over the balcony and call out to her as i would have called out to a friend whom i chanced to see passing in magdalen quad not an unnatural impulse either seeing that in spite of my own prevarications to myself i had after all really come across the atlantic on purpose to see her but on second thoughts it struck me that even ida might perhaps find such a proceeding a trifle unconventional especially now that she was habited in such passing splendour besides what did it all mean the only rational answer i could give myself when i fairly squared the question was that ida must have got suddenly married to a wealthy fellowcountryman and that the exquisite in the cool suit was in fact none other than her newlyacquired husband i had thought my philosophy proof against any such small defeats to my calculation but when it actually came to the point i began to perceive that i was after all very unphilosophically in love with ida van rensselaer the merest undergraduate could not have felt a sillier flutter than that which agitated both auricles and ventricles of my central vascular organas a senior proctor i must really draw the line at speaking outright of my heart i seized my hat rushed down the broad staircase and walked rapidly along broadway in the direction the pair had taken but i could see nothing of them and i returned to congress hall in despair  that night i thought about many things and slept very little it came home to me somewhat vividly that if ida was really married i should probably feel more grieved and disappointed than a good pessimist philosopher ought ever to feel at the ordinary vexatiousness of the universe next morning however i rose early and breakfasted not without a most unpoetical appetite on white fish buckwheat pancakes and excellent watermelon after breakfast refreshed by the meal i sallied forth like a true knighterrant under the shade of a white cotton sunumbrella instead of a shield to search for the lady of my choice naturally i turned my steps first towards the springs and at the very second of them all i luckily came upon ida and the man in the tweed suit lounging as before and drinking the waters lazily  ida stepped up as if she had fully expected to meet me extended her daintilygloved hand with the gold bracelet and said as unconcernedly as possible you have come two days late mr payne  so it seems i answered cest monsieur votre mari and i waved my hand interrogatively towards the stranger for i hardly knew how to word the question in english  À dieu ne plaise she cried heartily in an undertone and i felt my vascular system once more the theatre of a most unacademical though more pleasing palpitation allow me to introduce you mr payne of oxford my cousin mr jefferson hitchcock  i charitably inferred that mr hitchcocks early education in modern languages had been unfortunately neglected or else his companions energetic mode of denying her supposed conjugal relation with him could hardly have appeared flattering to his vanity  my cousin has spoken of you to me sir said mr hitchcock solemnly i understand that you are one of the most distinguished luminaries of oxford college and i am proud to welcome you as such to our country  i bowed and laughedi never feel capable of making any other reply than a bow and a laugh to the style of oratory peculiar to american gentlemenand then i turned to ida she was looking as pretty as piquante and as fresh as ever but what her dress could mean was a complete puzzle to me as she stood diamonds and all a jewellers assistant couldnt have valued her at a penny less than six hundred pounds in england such a display in morning dress would have been out of taste but in saratoga it seemed to be the height of the fashion  we walked along towards the grand union hotel where ida and her cousin were staying and my astonishment grew upon me at every step however we had so much to say to one another about everything in general and ida was so unaffectedly pleased at my keeping my engagement made half in joke that i found no time to unravel the mystery when we reached the great doorway ida took leave of me for the time but made me promise to call for her again early the next morning unhappily she said i have to go this afternoon to a most tedious partya set of boston people you know the style the best european culture bottled and corked as imported and let out again by driblets with about as much spontaneousness as champagne the second day but i must fulfil my social duties here no canoeing on the isis at saratoga however we must see a great deal of you now that youve come so i expect you to call and drive me down to the lake at ten oclock tomorrow  is that proceeding within the expansive limits of american proprieties i asked dubiously  sir said mr hitchcock answering for her this is a land of freedom and every lady can go where she chooses unmolested by those frivolous bonds of conventionality which bind the feet of your european women as closely as the cramped shoes of the chinese bind the feet of the celestial females  ida smiled at me with a peculiar smile waved her hand graciously and ran lightly up the stairs i was left on the piazza with mr jefferson hitchcock his conversation scarcely struck me as in itself enticing but i was anxious to find out the meaning of idas sudden accession to wealth and so i determined to make the best of his companionship for half an hour as a sure high road to the american bosom and safe recommendation to the american confidence i ordered a couple of delectable summer beverages mr hitchcock advised an eyeopener which proved worthy of the commendation he bestowed upon it and we sat down on the piazza in two convenient rockingchairs under the shade of the elms smoking our havanas and sipping our iced drink after a little preliminary talk i struck out upon the subject of ida  when i met miss van rensselaer at nice i said she was stopping at a very quiet little pension it is quite a different thing living in a palace like this  we are a republican nation sir answered mr hitchcock and we expect to be all treated on the equal level of a sovereign people the splendour that you in europe restrict to princes we in our country lavish upon the humblest american citizen miss van rensselaers wealth however entitles her to mix in the highest circles of even your most polished society  indeed i said i had no idea that she was wealthy  no sir probably not miss van rensselaer is a woman of that striking originality only to be met with in our emancipated country she has shaken off the trammels of female servitude and prefers to travel in all the simplicity of a humble income she went to europe if i may so speak incognita and desired to hide her opulence from the prying gaze of your aristocracy she did not wish your penniless peers to buzz about her fortune but she is in reality one of our richest heiresses the man who secures that woman as a property sir will find himself in possession of an income worth as much as one hundred thousand dollars  twenty thousand sterling a year the idea took my breath away and reduced me once more to a state of helpless incapacity i couldnt talk much more smalltalk to mr hitchcock so i managed to make some small excuse and returned listlessly to congress hall there over a luncheon of saddlerock oysters you see i never allow my feelings to interfere with my appetite i decided that i must give up all idea of ida van rensselaer  i have no abstract objection to an income of £20000 a year but i could not consent to take it from any woman or to endure the chance of her supposing that i had been fortunehunting it may be and doubtless is a plebeian feeling which as mr hitchcock justly hinted is never shared by the younger sons of our old nobility but i hate the notion of living off somebody elses money especially if that somebody were my own wife so i came to the reluctant conclusion that i must give up the idea for ever and as it would not be fair to stop any longer at saratoga under the circumstances i made up my mind to start for niagara on the next day but one after fulfilling my driving engagement with ida the following morning  punctually at ten oclock the next day i found myself in a handsome carriage waiting at the doors of the grand union ida came down to meet me splendidly dressed and looked like a queen as she sat by my side we will drive to the lake she said as she took her seat and you will take me for a row as you did on the isis at oxford so we whirled along comfortably enough over the six miles of splendid avenue leading to the lake and then we took our places in one of the canopied boats which wait for hire at the little quay  i rowed out into the middle of the lake admiring the pretty wooded banks and sandstone cliffs talking of saratoga and american society but keeping to my determination in steering clear of all allusions to my oxford proposal ida was as charming as evermore provokingly charming indeed than even of old now that i had decided she could not be mine but i stood by my resolution like a man clearly ida was surprised at my reticence and when i told her that my time in america being limited i must start almost at once for niagara she was obviously astonished it is possible to be even too original she observed shortly i turned the boat and rowed back toward the shore  as i had nearly reached the bank ida jumped up from her seat and asked me suddenly to let her pull for a dozen strokes i changed places and gave her the oars to my surprise she headed the boat around and pulled once more for the middle of the lake when we had reached a point at some distance from the shore she dropped the oars on the tholepins they use no rowlocks on american lake or river craft and looked for a moment full in my face then she said abruptly  if you are really going to leave for niagara tomorrow mr payne hadnt we better finish this bit of business out of hand  i was not aware i answered that we had any business transactions to settle  why she said i mean this matter of proposing  i gazed back at her as straight as i dared ida i said with an attempt at firmness i dont mean to propose to you again at all at least i didnt mean to when i started this morning i think i thought i had decided not  then why did you come to saratoga she asked quickly you oughtnt to have come if you meant nothing by it  when i left england i did mean something i answered but i learned a fact yesterday which has altered my intentions and then i told her about mr hitchcocks revelations and the reflections to which they had given rise  ida listened patiently to all my faint arguments for i felt my courage quailing under her pretty sympathetic glance and then she said decisively you are quite right and yet quite wrong  explain yourself o sphinx i answered much relieved by her words  why she said you are quite right to hesitate quite wrong to decide i know you dont want my money i know you dont like it even but i ask you to take me in spite of it of course that is dreadfully unwomanly and unconventional and so forth but it is what i ought to do listen to me cyril may i call you cyril i will tell you why i want you to marry me before i went to europe i was dissatisfied with all these rich american young men i hated their wealth and their selfishness and their cheap cynicism and their trotting horses and their narrow views and their monotonous talltalk all cast in a stereotyped american mould so that whenever i said a i knew every one of them would answer b  i went to europe and i met your english young men with their drawls and their pigeonshooting and their shaggy ulsters and their conventional wit and their commonplace chaff and their utter contempt for women as though we were all a herd of marketable animals from whom they could pick and choose whichever pleased them best according to their lordly fancy i would no more give myself up to one of them than i would marry my cousin jefferson hitchcock but when i met you first at nice i saw you were a different sort of person you could think and act for yourself and you could appreciate a real living woman who could think and act too you taught me what europe was like i only knew the outside you showed me how to get within the husk you made me admire eza and roccabrunna and iffley church you roused something within me that i never felt beforea wish to be a different being a longing for something more worth living for than diamonds and saratoga i know i am not good enough for you i dont know enough or read enough or feel enough but i dont want to fall back and sink to the level of new york society so i have a right to ask you to marry me if you will i dont want to be a blue but i want not to feel myself a social doll you know yourselfi see you know itthat i oughtnt to throw away my chance of making the best of what nature i may have in me i am only a beginner i scarcely half understand your world yet i cant properly admire your botticellis and your pinturiccios i know but i want to admire i should like to and i will try i want you to take me because i know you understand me and would help me forward instead of letting me sink down to the petty interests of this american desert you liked me at nice you did more than like me at oxford but i wouldnt take you then though i longed to say yes because i wasnt quite sure whether you really meant it i knew you liked me for myself not my money but i left you to come to saratoga for two things i wanted to make sure you were in earnest not to take you at a moment of weakness i said if he really cares for me if he thinks i might become worthy of him he will come and look for me if not i must let the dream go and then i wanted to know what effect my fortune would have upon you now you know my whole reasons why should my money stand in our way why should we both make ourselves unhappy on account of it you would have married me if i was poor what good reason have you for rejecting me only because i am rich whatever my money may do for you and you have enough of your own it will be nothing to what you can do for me will you tell me to go and make myself an animated peg for hanging jewellery upon with such a conscious automaton as jefferson hitchcock to keep me company through life  as she finished flushed proud ashamed but every inch a woman i caught her hand in mine the utter meanness and selfishness of my life burst upon me like a thunderbolt oh ida i cried how terribly you make me feel my own pettiness and egotism you are cutting me to the heart like a knife i cannot marry you i dare not marry you i must not marry you i am not worthy of such a wife as you how had i ever the audacity to ask you my life has been too narrow and egoistic and selfindulgent to deserve such confidence as yours i am not good enough for you i really dare not accept it  no she said a little more calmly i hope we are just good enough for one another and that is why we ought to marry and as for the hundred thousand dollars perhaps we might manage to be happy in spite of them  we had drifted into a little bay under shelter of a high rocky point i felt a sudden access of insane boldness and taking both idas hands in mine i ventured to kiss her open forehead she took the kiss quietly but with a certain queenly sense of homage due and now she said shaking off my hands and smiling archly let us row back toward saratoga for you know you have to pack up for niagara  no i answered i may as well put off my visit to the falls till you can accompany me  very well said ida quietly and then we shall go back to england and live near oxford i dont want you to give up the dear old university i want you to teach me the way you look at things and show me how to look at them myself im not going to learn any latin or greek or stupid nonsense of that sort and im not going to join the womens suffrage association but i like your english culture and i should love to live in its midst  so you shall ida i answered and you shall teach me too how to be a little less narrow and selfcentred than we oxford bachelors are apt to become in our foolish isolation  so we expect to spend our honeymoon at niagara     the child of the phalanstery   poor little thing said my strongminded friend compassionately just look at her clubfooted what a misery to herself and others in a wellorganized state of society you know such poor wee cripples as that would be quietly put out of their misery while they were still babies  let me think said i how that would work out in actual practice im not so sure after all that we should be altogether the better or the happier for it   i  they sat together in a corner of the beautiful phalanstery garden olive and clarence on the marble seat that overhung the mossy dell where the streamlet danced and bickered among its pebbly stickles they sat there hand in hand in lovers guise and felt their two bosoms beating and thrilling in some strange sweet fashion just like two foolish unregenerate young people of the old antisocial prephalansteric days perhaps it was the leaven of their unenlightened ancestors still leavening by heredity the whole lump perhaps it was the inspiration of the calm soft august evening and the delicate afterglow of the setting sun perhaps it was the deep heart of man and woman vibrating still as of yore in human sympathy and stirred to its innermost recesses by the unutterable breath of human emotion but at any rate there they sat the beautiful strong man in his shapely chiton and the dainty fair girl in her long white robe with the dark green embroidered border looking far into the fathomless depths of one anothers eyes in silence sweeter and more eloquent than many words it was olives tenthday holiday from her share in the maidens household duty of the community and clarence by arrangement with his friend germain had made exchange from his own decade which fell on plato to this quiet milton evening that he might wander through the park and gardens with his chosen love and speak his full mind to her now without reserve  if only the phalanstery will give its consent clarence olive said at last with a little sigh releasing her hand from his and gathering up the folds of her stole from the marble flooring of the seat if only the phalanstery will give its consent but i have my doubts about it is it quite right have we chosen quite wisely will the hierarch and the elder brothers think i am strong enough and fit enough for the duties of the task it is no light matter we know to enter into bonds with one another for the responsibilities of fatherhood and motherhood i sometimes feelforgive me clarencebut i sometimes feel as if i were allowing my own heart and my own wishes to guide me too exclusively in this solemn question thinking too much about you and me about ourselves which is only an enlarged form of selfishness after all and too little about the future good of the community andand blushing a little for women will be women even in a phalansteryand of the precious lives we may be the means of adding to it you remember clarence what the hierarch said that we ought to think least and last of our own feelings first and foremost of the progressive evolution of universal humanity  i remember darling clarence answered leaning over towards her tenderly i remember well and in my own way so far as a man can for we men havent the moral earnestness of you women im afraid olive i try to act up to it but dearest i think your fears are greater than they need be you must recollect that humanity requires for its higher development tenderness and truth and love and all the softer qualities as well as strength and manliness and if you are a trifle less strong than most of our sisters here you seem to me at least and i really believe to the hierarch and to the elder brothers too to make up for it and more than make up for it in your sweet and lovable inner nature the men of the future mustnt all be cast in one unvarying stereotyped mould we must have a little of all good types combined in order to make a perfect phalanstery  olive sighed again i dont know she said pensively i dont feel sure i hope i am doing right in my aspirations every evening i have desired light on this matter and have earnestly hoped that i was not being misled by my own feelings for oh clarence i do love you so dearly so truly so absorbingly that i half fear my love may be taking me unwittingly astray i try to curb it i try to think of it all as the hierarch tells us we ought to but in my own heart i sometimes almost fear that i may be lapsing into the idolatrous love of the old days when people married and were given in marriage and thought only of the gratification of their own personal emotions and affections and nothing of the ultimate good of humanity oh clarence dont hate me and despise me for it dont turn upon me and scold me but i love you i love you i love you oh im afraid i love you almost idolatrously  clarence lifted her small white hand slowly to his lips with that natural air of chivalrous respect which came so easily to the young men of the phalanstery and kissed it twice over fervidly with quiet reverence let us go into the musicroom olive dearest he said as he rose you are too sad tonight you shall play me that sweet piece of marians that you love so much and that will quiet you darling from thinking too earnestly about this serious matter   ii  next day when clarence had finished his daily spell of work in the fruitgarden he was third undergardener to the community he went up to his own study and wrote out a little notice in due form to be posted at dinnertime on the refectory door clarence and olive ask leave of the phalanstery to enter with one another into free contract of holy matrimony his pen trembled a little in his hand as he framed that familiar set form of words strange that he had read it so often with so little emotion and wrote it now with so much we men are so selfish but he fixed it boldly with four small brass nails on the regulation noticeboard and waited not without a certain quiet confidence for the final result of the communal council  aha said the hierarch to himself with a kindly smile as he passed into the refectory at dinnertime that day has it come to that then well well i thought as much i felt sure it would a good girl olive a true earnest lovable girl and she has chosen wisely too for clarence is the very man to balance her own character as mans and wifes should do whether clarence has done well in selecting her is another matter for my own part i had rather hoped she would have joined the celibate sisters and have taken nurse duty for the sick and the children its her natural function in life the work shes best fitted for and i should have liked to see her take to it but after all the business of the phalanstery is not to decide vicariously for its individual membersnot to thwart their natural harmless inclinations and wishes on the contrary we ought to allow every man and girl the fullest liberty to follow their own personal taste and judgment in every possible matter our power of interference as a community ive always felt and said should only extend to the prevention of obviously wrong and immoral acts such as marriage with a person in illhealth or of inferior mental power or with a distinctly bad or insubordinate temper things of that sort of course are as clearly wicked as idling in work hours or marriage with a first cousin olives health however isnt really bad nothing more than a very slight feebleness of constitution as constitutions go with us and eustace who has attended her medically from her babyhood what a dear crowing little thing she used to be in the nursery to be sure tells me shes perfectly fitted for the duties of her proposed situation ah well ah well ive no doubt theyll be perfectly happy and the wishes of the whole phalanstery will go with them in any case thats certain  everybody knew that whatever the hierarch said or thought was pretty sure to be approved by the unanimous voice of the entire community not that he was at all a dictatorial or dogmatic old man quite the contrary but his gentle kindly way had its full weight with the brothers and his intimate acquaintance through the exercise of his spiritual functions with the inmost thoughts and ideas of every individual member man or woman made him a safe guide in all difficult or delicate questions as to what the decision of the council ought to be so when on the first cosmos the elder brothers assembled to transact phalansteric business and the hierarch put in clarences request with the simple phrase in my opinion there is no reasonable objection the community at once gave in its adhesion and formal notice was posted an hour later on the refectory door the phalanstery approves the proposition of clarence and olive and wishes all happiness to them and to humanity from the sacred union they now contemplate you see dearest clarence said kissing her lips for the first time as unwritten law demanded now that the seal of the community had been placed upon their choice you see there cant be any harm in our contract for the elder brothers all approve it  olive smiled and sighed from the very bottom of her full heart and clung to her lover as the ivy clings to a strong supporting oaktree darling she murmured in his ear if i have you to comfort me i shall not be afraid and we will try our best to work together for the advancement and the good of divine humanity  four decades later on a bright cosmos morning in september those two stood up beside one another before the altar of humanity and heard with a thrill the voice of the hierarch uttering that solemn declaration in the name of the past and of the present and of the future i hereby admit you clarence and olive into the holy society of fathers and mothers of the united avondale phalanstery in trust for humanity whose stewards you are may you so use and enhance the good gifts you have received from your ancestors that you may hand them on untarnished and increased to the bodies and minds of your furthest descendants and clarence and olive answered humbly and reverently if grace be given us we will   iii  brother eustace physiologist to the phalanstery looked very grave and sad indeed as he passed from the mothers room into the conversazione in search of the hierarch a child is born into the phalanstery he said gloomily but his face conveyed at once a far deeper and more pregnant meaning than his mere words could carry to the ear  the hierarch rose hastily and glanced into his dark keen eyes with an inquiring look not something amiss he said eagerly with an infinite tenderness in his fatherly voice dont tell me that eustace not  oh not a child that the phalanstery must not for its own sake permit to live oh eustace not i hope idiotic and i gave my consent too i gave my consent for pretty gentle little olives sake heaven grant i was not too much moved by her prettiness and her delicacy for i love her eustace i love her like a daughter  so we all love all the children of the phalanstery cyriac we who are elder brothers said the physiologist gravely half smiling to himself nevertheless at this quaint expression of oldworld feeling on the part even of the very hierarch whose bounden duty it was to advise and persuade a higher rule of conduct and thought than such antique phraseology implied no not idiotic not quite so bad as that cyriac not absolutely a hopeless case but still very serious and distressing for all that the dear little baby has its feet turned inward shell be a cripple for life i fear and no help for it  tears rose unchecked into the hierarchs soft grey eyes its feet turned inward he muttered sadly half to himself feet turned inward oh how terrible this will be a frightful blow to clarence and to olive poor young things their firstborn too oh eustace what an awful thought that with all the care and precaution we take to keep all causes of misery away from the precincts of the phalanstery such trials as this must needs come upon us by the blind workings of the unconscious cosmos it is terrible too terrible  and yet it isnt all loss the physiologist answered earnestly it isnt all loss cyriac heartrending as the necessity seems to us i sometimes think that if we hadnt these occasional distressful objects on which to expend our sympathy and our sorrow we in our happy little communities might grow too smug and comfortable and material and earthy but things like this bring tears into our eyes and we are the better for them in the end depend upon it we are the better for them they try our fortitude our devotion to principle our obedience to the highest and the hardest law every time some poor little waif like this is born into our midst we feel the strain of old prephalansteric emotions and fallacies of feeling dragging us steadily and cruelly down our first impulse is to pity the poor mother to pity the poor child and in our mistaken kindness to let an unhappy life go on indefinitely to its own misery and the preventible distress of all around it we have to make an effort a struggle before the higher and more abstract pity conquers the lower and more concrete one but in the end we are all the better for it and each such struggle and each such victory cyriac paves the way for that final and truest morality when we shall do right instinctively and naturally without any impulse on any side to do wrong in any way at all  you speak wisely eustace the hierarch answered with a sad shake of his head and i wish i could feel like you i ought to but i cant your functions make you able to look more dispassionately upon these things than i can im afraid theres a great deal of the old adam lingering wrongfully in me yet and im still more afraid theres a great deal of the old eve lingering even more strongly in all our mothers itll be a long time i doubt me before theyll ever consent without a struggle to the painless extinction of necessarily unhappy and imperfect lives a long time a very long time does clarence know of this yet  yes i have told him his grief is terrible you had better go and console him as best you can  i will i will and poor olive poor olive it wrings my heart to think of her of course she wont be told of it if you can help for the probationary four decades  no not if we can help it but i dont know how it can ever be kept from her she will see clarence and clarence will certainly tell her  the hierarch whistled gently to himself its a sad case he said ruefully a very sad case and yet i dont see how we can possibly prevent it  he walked slowly and deliberately into the anteroom where clarence was seated on a sofa his head between his hands rocking himself to and fro in his mute misery or stopping to groan now and then in a faint feeble inarticulate fashion rhoda one of the elder sisters held the unconscious baby sleeping in her arms and the hierarch took it from her like a man accustomed to infants and looked ruthfully at the poor distorted little feet yes eustace was evidently quite right there could be no hope of ever putting those wee twisted ankles back straight and firm into their proper place again like other peoples  he sat down beside clarence on the sofa and with a commiserating gesture removed the young mans hands from his pale white face my dear dear friend he said softly what comfort or consolation can we try to give you that is not a cruel mockery none none none we can only sympathize with you and olive and perhaps after all the truest sympathy is silence  clarence answered nothing for a moment but buried his face once more in his hands and burst into tears the men of the phalanstery were less careful to conceal their emotions than we oldtime folks in these early centuries oh dear hierarch he said after a long sob it is too hard a sacrifice too hard too terrible i dont feel it for the babys sake for her tis better so she will be freed from a life of misery and dependence but for my own sake and oh above all for dear olives it will kill her hierarch i feel sure it will kill her  the elder brother passed his hand with a troubled gesture across his forehead but what else can we do dear clarence he asked pathetically what else can we do would you have us bring up the dear child to lead a lingering life of misfortune to distress the eyes of all around her to feel herself a useless incumbrance in the midst of so many mutually helpful and serviceable and happy people how keenly she would realize her own isolation in the joyous busy labouring community of our phalansteries how terribly she would brood over her own misfortune when surrounded by such a world of hearty healthy soundlimbed useful persons would it not be a wicked and a cruel act to bring her up to an old age of unhappiness and imperfection you have been in australia my boy when we sent you on that planthunting expedition and you have seen cripples with your own eyes no doubt which i have never donethank heaveni who have never gone beyond the limits of the most highly civilized euramerican countries you have seen cripples in those semicivilized old colonial societies which have lagged after us so slowly in the path of progress and would you like your own daughter to grow up to such a life as that clarence would you like her i ask you to grow up to such a life as that  clarence clenched his right hand tightly over his left arm and answered with a groan no hierarch not even for olives sake could i wish for such an act of irrational injustice you have trained us up to know the good from the evil and for no personal gratification of our deepest emotions i hope and trust shall we ever betray your teaching or depart from your principles i know what it is i saw just such a cripple once at a great town in the heart of central australiaa child of eight years old limping along lamely on her heels by her mothers side a sickening sight to think of it even now turns the blood in ones arteries and i could never wish olives baby to live and grow up to be a thing like that but oh i wish to heaven it might have been otherwise i wish to heaven this trial might have been spared us both oh hierarch dear hierarch the sacrifice is one that no good man or woman would wish selfishly to forego yet for all that our hearts our hearts are human still and though we may reason and may act up to our reasoning the human feeling in usrelic of the idolatrous days or whatever you like to call itit will not choose to be so put down and stifled it will out hierarch it will out for all that in real hot human tears oh dear dear kind father and brother it will kill olive i know it will kill her  olive is a good girl the hierarch answered slowly a good girl well brought up and with sound principles she will not flinch from doing her duty i know clarence but her emotional nature is a very delicate one and we have reason indeed to fear the shock to her nervous system that she will do right bravely i dont doubt the only danger is lest the effort to do right should cost her too dear whatever can be done to spare her shall be done clarence it is a sad misfortune for the whole phalanstery such a child being born to us as this and we all sympathize with you we sympathize with you more deeply than words can say  the young man only rocked up and down drearily as before and murmured to himself it will kill her it will kill her my olive my olive i know it will kill her   iv  they didnt keep the secret of the babys crippled condition from olive till the four decades were over nor anything like it the moment she saw clarence she guessed at once with a womans instinct that something serious had happened and she didnt rest till she had found out from him all about it rhoda brought her the poor wee mite carefully wrapped after the phalansteric fashion in a long strip of fine flannel and olive unrolled the piece until she came at last upon the small crippled feet that looked so soft and tender and dainty and waxen in their very deformity the young mother leant over the child a moment in speechless misery spirit of humanity she whispered at length feebly oh give me strength to bear this terrible unutterable trial it will break my heart but i will try to bear it  there was something so touching in her attempted resignation that rhoda for the first time in her life felt almost tempted to wish she had been born in the old wicked prephalansteric days when they would have let the poor baby grow up to womanhood as a matter of course and bear its own burden through life as best it might presently olive raised her head again from the crimson silken pillow clarence she said in a trembling voice pressing the sleeping baby hard against her breast when will it be how long is there no hope no chance of respite  not for a long time yet dearest olive clarence answered through his tears the phalanstery will be very gentle and patient with us we know and brother eustace will do everything that lies in his power though hes afraid he can give us very little hope indeed in any case olive darling the community waits for four decades before deciding anything it waits to see whether there is any chance for physiological or surgical relief it decides nothing hastily or thoughtlessly it waits for every possible improvement hoping against hope till hope itself is hopeless and then if at the end of the quartet as i fear will be the casefor we must face the worst darling we must face the worstif at the end of the quartet it seems clear to brother eustace and the three assessor physiologists from the neighbouring phalansteries that the dear child would be a cripple for life were still allowed four decades more to prepare ourselves in four whole decades more olive to take our leave of the darling baby youll have your baby with you for eighty days and we must wean ourselves from her in that time darling we must try to wean ourselves but oh olive oh rhoda its very hard very very very hard  olive answered not a word but lay silently weeping and pressing the baby against her breast with her large brown eyes fixed vacantly upon the fretted woodwork of the panelled ceiling  you mustnt do like that olive dear sister rhoda said in a halffrightened voice you must cry right out and sob and not restrain yourself darling or else youll break your heart with silence and repression do cry aloud theres a dear girl do cry aloud and relieve yourself a good cry would be the best thing on earth for you and think dear how much happier it will really be for the sweet baby to sink asleep so peacefully than to live a long life of conscious inferiority and felt imperfection what a blessing it is to think you were born in a phalansteric land where the dear child will be happily and painlessly rid of its poor little unconscious existence before it has reached the age when it might begin to know its own incurable and inevitable misfortune oh olive what a blessing that is and how thankful we ought all to be that we live in a world where the sweet pet will be saved so much humiliation and mortification and misery  at that moment olive looking within into her own wicked rebellious heart was conscious with a mingled glow half shame half indignation that so far from appreciating the priceless blessings of her own situation she would gladly have changed places then and there with any barbaric woman of the old semicivilized prephalansteric days we can so little appreciate our own mercies it was very wrong and anticosmic she knew very wrong indeed and the hierarch would have told her so at once but in her own womans soul she felt she would rather be a miserable naked savage in a wattled hut like those one saw in old books about africa before the illumination if only she could keep that one little angel of a crippled baby than dwell among all the enlightenment and knowledge and art and perfected social arrangements of phalansteric england without her childher dear helpless beautiful baby how truly the founder himself had said think you there will be no more tragedies and dramas in the world when we have reformed it nothing but one dreary dead level of monotonous content ay indeed there will for that fear not while the heart of man remains there will be tragedy enough on earth and to spare for a hundred poets to take for their saddest epics  olive looked up at rhoda wistfully sister rhoda she said in a timid tone it may be very wickedi feel sure it isbut do you know ive read somewhere in old stories of the unenlightened days that a mother always loved the most afflicted of her children the best and i can understand it now sister rhoda i can feel it here and she put her hand upon her poor still heart if only i could keep this one dear crippled baby i could give up all the world besideexcept you clarence  oh hush darling rhoda cried in an awed voice stooping down half alarmed to kiss her pale forehead you mustnt talk like that olive dearest its wicked its undutiful i know how hard it is not to repine and to rebel but you mustnt olive you mustnt we must each strive to bear our own burdens with the help of the community and not to put any of them off upon a poor helpless crippled little baby  but our natures clarence said wiping his eyes dreamily our natures are only half attuned as yet to the necessities of the higher social existence of course its very wrong and very sad but we cant help feeling it sister rhoda though we try our hardest remember its not so many generations since our fathers would have reared the child without a thought that they were doing anything wickednay rather would even have held so powerful is custom that it was positively wrong to save it by preventive means from a certain life of predestined misery our conscience in this matter isnt yet fully formed we feel that its right of course oh yes we know the phalanstery has ordered everything for the best but we cant help grieving over it the human heart within us is too unregenerate still to acquiesce without a struggle in the dictates of right and reason  olive again said nothing but fixed her eyes silently upon the grave earnest portrait of the founder over the carved oak mantelpiece and let the hot tears stream their own way over her cold white pallid bloodless cheek without reproof for many minutes her heart was too full for either speech or comfort   v  eight decades passed away slowly in the avondale phalanstery and day after day seemed more and more terrible to poor weak disconsolate olive the quiet refinement and delicate surroundings of their placid life seemed to make her poignant misery and long anxious term of waiting only the more intense in its sorrow and its awesomeness every day the younger sisters turned as of old to their allotted round of pleasant housework every day the elder sisters who had earned their leisure brought in their dainty embroidery or their drawing materials or their other occupations and tried to console her or rather to condole with her in her great sorrow she couldnt complain of any unkindness on the contrary all the brothers and sisters were sympathy itself while clarence though he tried hard not to be too idolatrous to her which is wrong and antisocial of course was still overflowing with tenderness and consideration for her in their common grief but all that seemed merely to make things worse if only somebody would have been cruel to her if only the hierarch would have scolded her or the elder sisters have shown any distant coldness or the other girls have been wanting in sisterly sympathy she might have got angry or brooded over her wrongs whereas now she could do nothing save cry passively with a vain attempt at resignation it was nobodys fault there was nobody to be angry with there was nothing to blame except the great impersonal laws and circumstances of the cosmos which it would be rank impiety and wickedness to question or to gainsay so she endured in silence loving only to sit with clarences hand in hers and the dear doomed baby lying peacefully upon the stole in her lap it was inevitable and there was no use repining for so profoundly had the phalanstery schooled the minds and natures of those two unhappy young parents and all their compeers that grieve as they might they never for one moment dreamt of attempting to relax or set aside the fundamental principles of phalansteric society in these matters  by the kindly rule of the phalanstery every mother had complete freedom from household duties for two years after the birth of her child and clarence though he would not willingly have given up his own particular work in the grounds and garden spent all the time he could spare from his short daily task every one worked five hours every lawful day and few worked longer save on special emergencies by olives side at last the eight decades passed slowly away and the fatal day for the removal of little rosebud arrived olive called her rosebud because she said she was a sweet bud that could never be opened into a fullblown rose all the community felt the solemnity of the painful occasion and by common consent the day darwin december 20 was held as an intraphalansteric fast by the whole body of brothers and sisters  on that terrible morning olive rose early and dressed herself carefully in a long white stole with a broad black border of greek key pattern but she had not the heart to put any black upon dear little rosebud and so she put on her fine flannel wrapper and decorated it instead with the pretty coloured things that veronica and philomela had worked for her to make her baby as beautiful as possible on this its last day in a world of happiness the other girls helped her and tried to sustain her crying all together at the sad event shes a sweet little thing they said to one another as they held her up to see how she looked if only it could have been her reception today instead of her removal but olive moved through them all with stoical resignationdryeyed and parched in the throat yet saying not a word save for necessary instructions and directions to the nursing sisters the iron of her creed had entered into her very soul  after breakfast brother eustace and the hierarch came sadly in their official robes into the lesser infirmary olive was there already pale and trembling with little rosebud sleeping peacefully in the hollow of her lap what a picture she looked the wee dear thing with the hothouse flowers from the conservatory that clarence had brought to adorn her fastened neatly on to her fine flannel robe the physiologist took out a little phial from his pocket and began to open a sort of inhaler of white muslin at the same moment the grave kind old hierarch stretched out his hands to take the sleeping baby from its mothers arms olive shrank back in terror and clasped the child softly to her heart no no let me hold her myself dear hierarch she said without flinching grant me this one last favour let me hold her myself it was contrary to all fixed rules but neither the hierarch nor any one else there present had the heart to refuse that beseeching voice on so supreme and spiritrending an occasion  brother eustace poured the chloroform solemnly and quietly on to the muslin inhaler by resolution of the phalanstery he said in a voice husky with emotion i release you rosebud from a life for which you are naturally unfitted in pity for your hard fate we save you from the misfortune you have never known and will never now experience as he spoke he held the inhaler to the babys face and watched its breathing grow fainter and fainter till at last after a few minutes it faded gradually and entirely away the little one had slept from life into death painlessly and happily even as they looked  clarence tearful but silent felt the babys pulse for a moment and then with a burst of tears shook his head bitterly it is all over he cried with a loud cry it is all over and we hope and trust it is better so  but olive still said nothing  the physiologist turned to her with an anxious gaze her eyes were open but they looked blank and staring into vacant space he took her hand and it felt limp and powerless great heaven he cried in evident alarm what is this olive olive our dear olive why dont you speak  clarence sprang up from the ground where he had knelt to try the dead babys pulse and took her unresisting wrist anxiously in his oh brother eustace he cried passionately help us save us whats the matter with olive shes fainting shes fainting i cant feel her heart beat no not ever so little  brother eustace let the pale white hand drop listlessly from his grasp upon the pale white stole beneath and answered slowly and distinctly she isnt fainting clarence not fainting my dear brother the shock and the fumes of chloroform together have been too much for the action of the heart shes dead too clarence our dear dear sister shes dead too  clarence flung his arms wildly round olives neck and listened eagerly with his ear against her bosom to hear her heart beat but no sound came from the folds of the simple blackbordered stole no sound from anywhere save the suppressed sobs of the frightened women who huddled closely together in the corner and gazed horrorstricken upon the two warm fresh corpses  she was a brave girl brother eustace said at last wiping his eyes and composing her hands reverently olive was a brave girl and she died doing her duty without one murmur against the sad necessity that fate had unhappily placed upon her no sister on earth could wish to die more nobly than by thus sacrificing her own life and her own weak human affections on the altar of humanity for the sake of her child and of the world at large  and yet i sometimes almost fancy the hierarch murmured with a violent effort to control his emotions when i see a scene like this that even the unenlightened practices of the old era may not have been quite so bad as we usually think them for all that surely an end such as olives is a sad and a terrible end to have forced upon us as the final outcome and natural close of all our modern phalansteric civilization  the ways of the cosmos are wonderful said brother eustace solemnly and we who are no more than atoms and mites upon the surface of its meanest satellite cannot hope so to order all things after our own fashion that all its minutest turns and chances may approve themselves to us as light in our own eyes  the sisters all made instinctively the reverential genuflexion the cosmos is infinite they said together in the fixed formula of their cherished religion the cosmos is infinite and man is but a parasite upon the face of the least among its satellite members may we so act as to further all that is best within us and to fulfil our own small place in the system of the cosmos with all becoming reverence and humility in the name of universal humanity so be it     our scientific observations on a ghost   then nothing would convince you of the existence of ghosts harry i said except seeing one  not even seeing one my dear jim said harry nothing on earth would make me believe in them unless i were turned into a ghost myself  so saying harry drained his glass of whisky toddy shook out the last ashes from his pipe and went off upstairs to bed i sat for a while over the remnants of my cigar and ruminated upon the subject of our conversation for my own part i was as little inclined to believe in ghosts as anybody but harry seemed to go one degree beyond me in scepticism his argument amounted in brief to thisthat a ghost was by definition the spirit of a dead man in a visible form here on earth but however strange might be the apparition which a ghostseer thought he had observed there was no evidence possible or actual to connect such apparition with any dead person whatsoever it might resemble the deceased in face and figure but so said harry does a portrait it might resemble him in voice and manner but so does an actor or a mimic it might resemble him in every possible particular but even then we should only be justified in saying that it formed a close counterpart of the person in question not that it was his ghost or spirit in short harry maintained with considerable show of reason that nobody could ever have any scientific ground for identifying any external object whether shadowy or material with a past human existence of any sort according to him a man might conceivably see a phantom but could not possibly know that he saw a ghost  harry and i were two oxford bachelors studying at the time for our degree in medicine and with an ardent love for the scientific side of our future profession indeed we took a greater interest in comparative physiology and anatomy than in physic proper and at this particular moment we were stopping in a very comfortable farmhouse on the coast of flintshire for our long vacation with the special object of observing histologically a peculiar seaside organism the thingumbobbum whatumaycallianum which is found so plentifully on the shores of north wales and which has been identified by professor haeckel with the larva of that famous marine ascidian from whom the professor himself and the remainder of humanity generally are supposed to be undoubtedly descended we had brought with us a full complement of lancets and scalpels chemicals and testtubes galvanic batteries and thermoelectric piles and we were splendidly equipped for a thoroughgoing scientific campaign of the first water the farmhouse in which we lodged had formerly belonged to the county family of the egertons and though an elizabethan manor replaced the ancient defensive building which had been wisely dismantled by henry viii the modern farmhouse into which it had finally degenerated still bore the name of egerton castle the whole house had a reputation in the neighbourhood for being haunted by the ghost of one algernon egerton who was beheaded under james ii for his participation or rather his intention to participate in monmouths rebellion a wretched portrait of the hapless protestant hero hung upon the wall of our joint sittingroom having been left behind when the family moved to their new seat in cheshire as being unworthy of a place in the present baronets splendid apartments it was a few remarks upon the subject of algernons ghost which had introduced the question of ghosts in general and after harry had left the room i sat for a while slowly finishing my cigar and contemplating the battered features of the deceased gentleman  as i did so i was somewhat startled to hear a voice at my side observe in a bland and graceful tone not unmixed with aristocratic hauteur you have been speaking of me i believein fact i have unavoidably overheard your conversationand i have decided to assume the visible form and make a few remarks upon what seems to me a very hasty decision on your friends part  i turned round at once and saw in the easychair which harry had just vacated a shadowy shape which grew clearer and clearer the longer i looked at it it was that of a man of forty fashionably dressed in the costume of the year 1685 or thereabouts and bearing a close resemblance to the faded portrait on the wall just opposite but the striking point about the object was this that it evidently did not consist of any ordinary material substance as its outline seemed vague and wavy like that of a photograph where the sitter has moved while all the objects behind it such as the back of the chair and the clock in the corner showed through the filmly head and body in the very manner which painters have always adopted in representing a ghost i saw at once that whatever else the object before might be it certainly formed a fine specimen of the orthodox and oldfashioned apparition in dress appearance and every other particular it distinctly answered to what the unscientific mind would unhesitatingly have called the ghost of algernon egerton  here was a piece of extraordinary luck in a house with two trained observers supplied with every instrument of modern experimental research we had lighted upon an undoubted specimen of the common spectre which had so long eluded the scientific grasp i was beside myself with delight really sir i said cheerfully it is most kind of you to pay us this visit and im sure my friend will be only too happy to hear your remarks of course you will permit me to call him  the apparition appeared somewhat surprised at the philosophic manner in which i received his advances for ghosts are accustomed to find people faint away or scream with terror at their first appearance but for my own part i regarded him merely in the light of a very interesting phenomenon which required immediate observation by two independent witnesses however he smothered his chagrinfor i believe he was really disappointed at my cool deportmentand answered that he would be very glad to see my friend if i wished it though he had specially intended this visit for myself alone  i ran upstairs hastily and found harry in his dressinggown on the point of removing his nether garments harry i cried breathlessly you must come downstairs at once algernon egertons ghost wants to speak to you  harry held up the candle and looked in my face with great deliberation jim my boy he said quietly youve been having too much whisky  not a bit of it i answered angrily come downstairs and see i swear to you positively that a thing the very counterpart of algernon egertons picture is sitting in your easychair downstairs anxious to convert you to a belief in ghosts  it took about three minutes to induce harry to leave his room but at last merely to satisfy himself that i was demented he gave way and accompanied me into the sittingroom i was half afraid that the spectre would have taken umbrage at my long delay and gone off in a huff and a blue flame but when we reached the room there he was in propriâ personâ gazing at his own portraitor should i rather say his counterparton the wall with the utmost composure  well harry i said what do you call that  harry put up his eyeglass peered suspiciously at the phantom and answered in a mollified tone it certainly is a most interesting phenomenon it looks like a case of fluorescence but you say the object can talk  decidedly i answered it can talk as well as you or me allow me to introduce you to one another gentlemenmr henry stevens mr algernon egerton for though you didnt mention your name mr egerton i presume from what you said that i am right in my conjecture  quite right replied the phantom rising as it spoke and making a low bow to harry from the waist upward i suppose your friend is one of the lincolnshire stevenses sir  upon my soul said harry i havent the faintest conception where my family came from my grandfather who made what little money we have got was a cottonspinner at rochdale but he might have come from heaven knows where i only know he was a very honest old gentleman and he remembered me handsomely in his will  indeed sir said the apparition coldly my family were the egertons of egerton castle in the county of flint armigeri whose ancestor radulphus de egerton is mentioned in domesday as one of the esquires of hugh lupus earl palatine of chester radulphus de egerton had a son  whose history said harry anxious to cut short these genealogical details i have read in the annals of flintshire which lies in the next room with the name you give as yours on the flyleaf but it seems sir you are anxious to converse with me on the subject of ghosts as that question interests us all at present much more than family descent will you kindly begin by telling us whether you yourself lay claim to be a ghost  undoubtedly i do replied the phantom  the ghost of algernon egerton formerly of egerton castle i interposed  formerly and now said the phantom in correction i have long inhabited and i still habitually inhabit by night at least the room in which we are at present seated  the deuce you do said harry warmly this is a most illegal and unconstitutional proceeding the house belongs to our landlord mr hay and my friend here and myself have hired it for the summer sharing the expenses and claiming the sole title to the use of the rooms harry omitted to mention that he took the best bedroom himself and put me off with a shabby little closet while we divided the rent on equal terms  true said the spectre goodhumouredly but you cant eject a ghost you know you may get a writ of habeas corpus but the english law doesnt supply you with a writ of habeas animam the infamous jeffreys left me that at least i am sure the enlightened nineteenth century wouldnt seek to deprive me of it  well said harry relenting provided you dont interfere with the experiments or make away with the tea and sugar im sure i have no objection but if you are anxious to prove to us the existence of ghosts perhaps you will kindly allow us to make a few simple observations  with all the pleasure in death answered the apparition courteously such in fact is the very object for which ive assumed visibility  in that case harry i said the correct thing will be to get out some paper and draw up a running report which we may both attest afterwards a few simple notes on the chemical and physical properties of a spectre will be an interesting novelty for the royal society and they ought all to be jotted down in black and white at once  this course having been unanimously determined upon as strictly regular i laid a large folio of foolscap on the writingtable and the apparition proceeded to put itself in an attitude for careful inspection  the first point to decide said i is obviously the physical properties of our visitor mr egerton will you kindly allow us to feel your hand  you may try to feel it if you like said the phantom quietly but i doubt if you will succeed to any brilliant extent as he spoke he held out his arm harry and i endeavoured successively to grasp it our fingers slipped through the faintly luminous object as though it were air or shadow the phantom bowed forward his head we attempted to touch it but our hands once more passed unopposed across the whole face and shoulders without finding any trace whatsoever of mechanical resistance experience the first said harry the apparition has no tangible material substratum i seized the pen and jotted down the words as he spoke them this was really turning out a very fullblown specimen of the ordinary ghost  the next question to settle i said is that of gravityharry give me a hand out here with the weighingmachinemr egerton will you be good enough to step upon this board  mirabile dictu the board remained steady as ever not a tremor of the steelyard betrayed the weight of its shadowy occupant experience the second cried harry in his cool scientific way the apparition has the specific gravity of atmospheric air i jotted down this note also and quietly prepared for the next observation  wouldnt it be well i inquired of harry to try the weight in vacuo it is possible that while the specific gravity in air is equal to that of the atmosphere the specific gravity in vacuo may be zero the apparitionpray excuse me mr egerton if the terms in which i allude to you seem disrespectful but to call you a ghost would be to prejudge the point at issuethe apparition may have no proper weight of its own at all  it would be very inconvenient though said harry to put the whole apparition under a bellglass in fact we have none big enough besides suppose we were to find that by exhausting the air we got rid of the object altogether as is very possible that would awkwardly interfere with the future prosecution of our researches into its nature and properties  permit me to make a suggestion interposed the phantom if a person whom you choose to relegate to the neuter gender may be allowed to have a voice in so scientific a question my friend the ingenious mr boyle has lately explained to me the construction of his airpump which we saw at one of the friday evenings at the royal institution it seems to me that your object would be attained if i were to put one hand only on the scale under the bellglass and permit the air to be exhausted  capital said harry and we got the airpump in readiness accordingly the spectre then put his right hand into the scale and we plumped the bellglass on top of it the connecting portion of the arm shone through the severing glass exactly as though the spectre consisted merely of an immaterial light in a few minutes the air was exhausted and the scales remained evenly balanced as before  this experiment said harry judicially slightly modifies the opinion which we formed from the preceding one the specific gravity evidently amounts in itself to nothing being as air in air and as vacuum in vacuo jot down the result jim will you  i did so faithfully and then turning to the spectre i observed you mentioned a mr boyle sir just now you allude i suppose to the father of chemistry  and uncle of the earl of cork replied the apparition promptly filling up the wellknown quotation exactly so i knew mr boyle slightly during our lifetime and i have known him intimately ever since he joined the majority  may i ask while my friend makes the necessary preparations for the spectrum analysis and the chemical investigation whether you are in the habit of associating much witherwell with other ghosts  oh yes i see a good deal of society  contemporaries of your own or persons of earlier and later dates  dates really matter very little to us we may have socrates and bacon chatting in the same group for my own part i prefer modern societyi may say the society of the latest arrivals  thats exactly why i asked said i the excessively modern tone of your language and idioms struck me so to speak as a sort of anachronism with your restoration costumean anachronism which i fancy i have noticed in many printed accounts of gentlemen from your portion of the universe  your observation is quite true replied the apparition we continue always to wear the clothes which were in fashion at the time of our decease but we pick up from newcomers the latest additions to the english language and even i may say to the slang dictionary i know many ghosts who talk familiarly of awfully jolly hops and allude to their progenitors as the governor indeed it is considered quite behind the times to describe a lady as vastly pretty and poor mr pepys who still preserves the antiquated idiom of his diary is looked upon among us as a dreadfully slow old fogey  but why then said i do you wear your old costumes for ever why not imitate the latest fashions from pooles and worths as well as the latest cant phrase from the popular novels  why my dear sir answered the phantom we must have something to mark our original period besides most people to whom we appear know something about costume while very few know anything about changes in idiomthat i must say seemed to me in passing a powerful argument indeedand so we all preserve the dress which we habitually wore during our lifetime  then said harry irreverently looking up from his chemicals the society in your part of the country must closely resemble a fancydress ball  without the tinsel and vulgarity we flatter ourselves answered the phantom  by this time the preparations were complete and harry inquired whether the apparition would object to our putting out the lights in order to obtain definite results with the spectroscope our visitor politely replied that he was better accustomed to darkness than to the painful glare of our paraffin candles in fact he added only the strong desire which i felt to convince you of our existence as ghosts could have induced me to present myself in so bright a room light is very trying to the eyes of spirits and we generally take our constitutionals between eleven at night and four in the morning stopping at home entirely during the moonlit half of the month  ah yes said harry extinguishing the candles ive read of course that your authorities exactly reverse our own oxford rules you are all gated i believe from dawn to sunset instead of from sunset to dawn and have to run away helterskelter at the first streaks of daylight for fear of being too late for admission without a fine of twopence but you will allow that your usual habit of showing yourselves only in the very darkest places and seasons naturally militates somewhat against the credibility of your existence if all apparitions would only follow your sensible example by coming out before two scientific people in a welllighted room they would stand a much better chance of getting believed though even in the present case i must allow that i should have felt far more confidence in your positive reality if youd presented yourself in broad daylight when jim and i hadnt punished the whisky quite as fully as weve done this evening  when the candles were out our apparition still retained its fluorescent luminous appearance and seemed to burn with a faint bluish light of its own we projected a pencil through the spectroscope and obtained for the first time in the history of science the spectrum of a spectre the result was a startling one indeed we had expected to find lines indicating the presence of sulphur or phosphorus instead of that we obtained a continuous band of pale luminosity clearly pointing to the fact that the apparition had no known terrestial element in its composition though we felt rather surprised at this discovery we simply noted it down on our paper and proceeded to verify it by chemical analysis  the phantom obligingly allowed us to fill a small phial with the luminous matter which harry immediately proceeded to test with all the resources at our disposal for purposes of comparison i filled a corresponding phial with air from another part of the room which i subjected to precisely similar tests at the end of half an hour we had completed our examinationthe spectre meanwhile watching us with mingled curiosity and amusement and we laid our written quantitative results side by side they agreed to a decimal the table being interesting deserves a place in this memoir it ran as follows  chemical analysis of an apparition    atmospheric air       9645 per cent   aqueous vapour        231       carbonic acid          108      tobacco smoke          016      volatile alcohol       a trace                                                10000     the alcohol harry plausibly attributed to the presence of glasses which had contained whisky toddy the other constituents would have been normally present in the atmosphere of a room where two fellows had been smoking uninterruptedly ever since dinner this important experiment clearly showed that the apparition had no proper chemical constitution of its own but consisted entirely of the same materials as the surrounding air  only one thing remains to be done now jim said harry glancing significantly at a plain deal table in the corner with whose uses we were both familiar but then the question arises does this gentleman come within the meaning of the act i dont feel certain about it in my own mind and with the present unsettled state of public opinion on this subject our first duty is to obey the law  within the meaning of the act i answered decidedly not the words of the fortysecond section say distinctly any living animal now mr egerton according to his own account is a ghost and has been dead for some two hundred years or thereabouts so that we neednt have the slightest scruple on that account  quite so said harry in a tone of relief well then sir turning to the apparition may i ask you whether you would object to our vivisecting you  mortuisecting you mean harry i interposed parenthetically let us keep ourselves strictly within the utmost letter of the law  vivisecting mortuisecting exclaimed the spectre with some amusement really the proposal is so very novel that i hardly know how to answer it i dont think you will find it a very practicable undertaking but still if you like yes you may try your hands upon me  we were both much gratified at this generous readiness to further the cause of science for which to say the truth we had hardly felt prepared no doubt we were constantly in the habit of maintaining that vivisection didnt really hurt and that rabbits or dogs rather enjoyed the process than otherwise still we did not quite expect an apparition in human form to accede in this gentlemanly manner to a personal request which after all is rather a startling one i seized our new friends hand with warmth and effusion though my emotion was somewhat checked by finding it slip through my fingers immaterially and observed in a voice trembling with admiration sir you display a spirit of selfsacrifice which does honour to your head and heart your total freedom from prejudice is perfectly refreshing to the anatomical mind if all subjects were equally ready to be vivisectedno i mean mortuisectedohwellthere i added for i began to perceive that my argument didnt hang together as subjects usually accepted mortuisection with the utmost resignation perhaps it wouldnt make much difference after all  meanwhile harry had pulled the table into the centre of the room and arranged the necessary instruments at one end the bright steel had a most charming and scientific appearance which added greatly to the general effect i saw myself already in imagination drawing up an elaborate report for the royal society and delivering a croonian oration with diagrams and sections complete in illustration of the vascular system of a ghost but alas it was not to be a preliminary difficulty slight in itself yet enormous in its preventive effects unhappily defeated our wellmade plans  before you lay yourself on the table said harry gracefully indicating that article of furniture to the spectre with his lancet may i ask you to oblige me by removing your clothes it is usual in all these operations toahemin short to proceed in puris naturalibus as you have been so very kind in allowing us to operate upon you of course you wont object to this minor but indispensable accompaniment  well really sir answered the ghost i should have no personal objection whatsoever but im rather afraid it cant be done to tell you the truth my clothes are an integral part of myself indeed i consist chiefly of clothes with only a head and hands protruding at the principal extremities you must have noticed that all persons of my sort about whom you have read or heard were fully clothed in the fashion of their own day i fear it would be quite impossible to remove these clothes for example how very absurd it would be to see the shadowy outline of a ghostly coat hanging up on a peg behind a door the bare notion would be sufficient to cast ridicule upon the whole community no gentlemen much as i should like to gratify you i fear the things impossible and to let the whole secret out im inclined to think for my part that i havent got any independent body whatsoever  but surely i interposed you must have some internal economy or else how can you walk and talk for example have you a heart  most certainly my dear sir and i humbly trust it is in the right place  you misunderstand me i repeated i am speaking literally not figuratively have you a central vascular organ on your lefthand side with two auricles and ventricles a mitral and a tricuspid valve and the usual accompaniment of aorta pulmonary vein pulmonary artery systole and diastole and so forth  upon my soul sir replied the spectre with an air of bewilderment i have never even heard the names of these various objects to which you refer and so i am quite unable to answer your question but if you mean to ask whether i have something beating just under my fob excuse the antiquated word but as i wear the thing in question i must necessarily use the name why then most undoubtedly i have  will you oblige me sir said harry by showing me your wrist it is true i cant feel your pulse owing to what you must acknowledge as a very unpleasant tenuity in your component tissues but perhaps i may succeed in seeing it  the apparition held out its arm harry instinctively endeavoured to balance the wrist in his hand but of course failed in catching it we were both amused throughout to observe how difficult it remained after several experiences to realize the fact that this visible object had no material and tangible background underlying it harry put up his eyeglass and gazed steadily at the phantom arm not a trace of veins or arteries could anywhere be seen upon my word he muttered i believe its true and the subject has no internal economy at all this is really very interesting  as it is quite impossible to undress you i observed turning to our visitor may i venture to make a section through your chest in order if practicable to satisfy myself as to your organs generally  certainly replied the goodhumoured spectre i am quite at your service  i took my longest lancet from its case and made a very neat cut right across the sternum so as to pass directly through all the principal viscera the effect i regret to say was absolutely nugatory the two halves of the body reunited instantaneously behind the instrument just as a mass of mercury reunites behind a knife evidently there was no chance of getting at the anatomical details if any existed underneath that brocaded waistcoat of phantasmagoric satin we gave up the attempt in despair  and now said the shadowy form with a smile of conscious triumph flinging itself easily but noiselessly into a comfortable armchair i hope you are convinced that ghosts really do exist i think i have pretty fully demonstrated to you my own purely spiritual and immaterial nature  excuse me said harry seating himself in his turn on the ottoman i regret to say that i remain as sceptical as at the beginning you have merely convinced me that a certain visible shape exists apparently unaccompanied by any tangible properties with this phenomenon i am already familiar in the case of phosphorescent gaseous effluvia you also seem to utter audible words without the aid of a proper larynx or other muscular apparatus but the telephone has taught me that sounds exactly resembling those of the human voice may be produced by a very simple membrane you have afforded us probably the best opportunity ever given for examining a socalled ghost and my private conviction at the end of it is that you are very likely an egregious humbug  i confess i was rather surprised at this energetic conclusion for my own faith had been rapidly expanding under the strange experiences of that memorable evening but the visitor himself seemed much hurt and distressed surely he said you wont doubt my word when i tell you plainly that i am the authentic ghost of algernon egerton the word of an egerton of egerton castle was always better than another mans oath and it is so still i hope besides my frank and courteous conduct to you both tonight and the readiness with which i have met all your proposals for scientific examination certainly entitle me to better treatment at your hands  i must beg ten thousand pardons harry replied for the plain language which i am compelled to use but let us look at the case in a different point of view during your occasional visits to the world of living men you may sometimes have travelled in a railway carriage in your invisible form  i have taken a trip now and then by a night train of course just to see what the invention was like  exactly so well now you must have noticed that a guard insisted from time to time upon waking up the sleepy passengers for no other purpose than to look at their tickets such a precaution might be resented say by an egerton of egerton castle as an insult to his veracity and his honesty but you see the guard doesnt know an egerton from a muggins and the mere word of a passenger to the effect that he belongs to that distinguished family is in itself of no more value than his personal assertion that his ticket is perfectly en règle  i see your analogy and i must allow its remarkable force  not only so continued harry firmly but you must remember that in the case i have put the guard is dealing with known beings of the ordinary human type now when a living person introduces himself to me as egerton of egerton castle or sir roger tichborne of alresford i accept his statement with a certain amount of doubt proportionate to the natural improbability of the circumstances but when a gentleman of shadowy appearance and immaterial substance like yourself makes a similar assertion to the effect that he is algernon egerton who died two hundred years ago then i am reluctantly compelled to acknowledge even at the risk of hurting that gentlemans susceptible feelings that i can form no proper opinion whatsoever of his probable veracity even men whose habits and constitution i familiarly understand cannot always be trusted to tell me the truth and how then can i expect implicitly to believe a being whose very existence contradicts all my previous experiences and whose properties give the lie to all my scientific conceptionsa being who moves without muscles and speaks without lungs look at the possible alternatives and then you will see that i am guilty of no personal rudeness when i respectfully decline to accept your uncorroborated assertions you may be mr algernon egerton it is true and your general style of dress and appearance certainly bears out that supposition but then you may equally well be his satanic majesty in personin which case you can hardly expect me to credit your character for implicit truthfulness or again you may be a mere hallucination of my fancy i may be suddenly gone mad or i may be totally drunkand now that i look at the bottle jim we must certainly allow that we have fully appreciated the excellent qualities of your capital glenlivat in short a number of alternatives exist any one of which is quite as probable as the supposition of your being a genuine ghost which supposition i must therefore lay aside as a mere matter for the exercise of a suspended judgment  i thought harry had him on the hip there and the spectre evidently thought so too for he rose at once and said rather stiffly i fear sir you are a confirmed sceptic upon this point and further argument might only result in one or the other of us losing his temper perhaps it would be better for me to withdraw i have the honour to wish you both a very good evening he spoke once more with the hauteur and grand mannerism of the old school besides bowing very low at each of us separately as he wished us goodnight  stop a moment said harry rather hastily i wouldnt for the world be guilty of any inhospitality and least of all to a gentleman however indefinite in his outline who has been so anxious to afford us every chance of settling an interesting question as you have wont you take a glass of whisky and water before you go just to show theres no animosity  i thank you answered the apparition in the same chilly tone i cannot accept your kind offer my visit has already extended to a very unusual length and i have no doubt i shall be blamed as it is by more reticent ghosts for the excessive openness with which i have conversed upon subjects generally kept back from the living world once more with another ceremonious bow i have the honour to wish you a pleasant evening  as he said these words the fluorescent light brightened for a second and then faded entirely away a slightly unpleasant odour also accompanied the departure of our guest in a moment spectre and scent alike disappeared but careful examination with a delicate test exhibited a faint reaction which proved the presence of sulphur in small quantities the ghost had evidently vanished quite according to established precedent  we filled our glasses once more drained them off meditatively and turned into our bedrooms as the clock was striking four  next morning harry and i drew up a formal account of the whole circumstance which we sent to the royal society with a request that they would publish it in their transactions to our great surprise that learned body refused the paper i may say with contumely we next applied to the anthropological institute where strange to tell we met with a like inexplicable rebuff nothing daunted by our double failure we despatched a copy of our analysis to the chemical society but the only acknowledgment accorded to us was a letter from the secretary who stated that such a sorry joke was at once impertinent and undignified in short the scientific world utterly refuses to credit our simple and straightforward narrative so that we are compelled to throw ourselves for justice upon the general reading public at large as the latter invariably peruse the pages of belgravia i have ventured to appeal to them in the present article confident that they will redress our wrongs and accept this valuable contribution to a great scientific question at its proper worth it may be many years before another chance occurs for watching an undoubted and interesting apparition under such favourable circumstances for careful observation and all the above information may be regarded as absolutely correct down to five places of decimals  still it must be borne in mind that unless an apparition had been scientifically observed as we two independent witnesses observed this one the grounds for believing in its existence would have been next to none and even after the clear evidence which we obtained of its immaterial nature we yet remain entirely in the dark as to its objective reality and we have not the faintest reason for believing it to have been a genuine unadulterated ghost at the best we can only say that we saw and heard something and that this something differed very widely from almost any other object we had ever seen and heard before to leap at the conclusion that the something was therefore a ghost would be i venture humbly to submit without offence to the psychical research society a most unscientific and illogical specimen of that peculiar fallacy known as begging the question     ram das of cawnpore   we germans do not spare trouble where literary or scientific work is on hand and so when i was appointed by the university of breslau to the travelling scholarship in the neosanskritic languages i made up my mind at once to spend the next five years of my life in india i knew already a good deal more hindi and urdu than most english officials who have spent twenty years in the country but i was anxious to perfect my knowledge by practice on the spot and to acquire thorough proficiency in conversation by intercourse with the people themselves i therefore went out to india at once and avoiding the great towns such as calcutta or allahabad which have been largely anglicised by residents and soldiers i took up my abode in the little village of bithoor on the ganges a few miles from cawnpore celebrated as having been the residence of the nana sahib whom you english always describe as the most ferocious rebel in the mutiny here i spent four years in daily intercourse with the native gentry whose natural repugnance to foreigners i soon conquered by invariable respect for their feelings and prejudices at the end of eighteen months i had so won my way to their hearts that the muhammedans regarded me as scarcely outside the pale of islam while the hindoos usually addressed me by the religious title of bhai or brother  of course however the english officials did not look with any favouring eye upon my proceedings especially as i sometimes felt called upon to remonstrate with them upon their hasty and often ignorant method of dispensing justice this coolness towards the authorities increased the friendship felt towards me by the native population and the european sahib who is not a feringhee became a general adviser of many among the poorer people in their legal difficulties i merely mention these facts to account for the confidence reposed in me of which the story i am about to relate is a striking example  i had a syce or groom who passed by the name of lal biro this man was a tall reserved whitehaired old hindoo a jat by caste but with a figure which might have been taken for that of a brahman his manner to me was always cold and sometimes sullen and i found it difficult to place myself on the same terms with him as with my other servants one dark evening however during the cold season i had driven back from cawnpore with him late at night in a small open trap and found him far more chatty and communicative than usual when we reached the bungalow we discovered that the lights were out and the house almost shut up as the servants had fancied that i meant to sleep at the club lal biro accordingly came in with me and helped me to get my supper ready then at my request he sat down crosslegged near the door and continued to give me some reminiscences of the mutiny which had been interrupted by our arrival  yes sahib he said quietly composing himself on a little mat with a respectful inclination of the body i am ram das of cawnpore  i was startled by the confession for i knew the name of ram das as one of the most dangerous petty rebels on whose head government had fixed a large price but i was gratified by the confidence he reposed in me and i begged him to go on with his story i write it down now in very nearly the literal english equivalent of his exact words  yes sahib it is a long story truly i will tell you how it all came about i was a cultivator on the uplands there by cawnpore and i had a nice plot of land in zameendari near the village there good land with wheat and millet and a little tobacco my millet was joar and i got a rupee for eighteen seers good money i was welltodo in those days no man in the village but spoke well of ram das i had a wife and three children and a good mud cottage and i paid my dues regularly to mahadeo oil and grain most properly the brahmans said i was a most pious man and everybody thought well of me  one day shaikh ali a muhammedan a landowner from over the river in oude whom i knew in the bazaar at cawnpore he met me near the bridge resting he said to me well ram das these are strange things coming to pass they say the sepoys have mutinied at meerut and the feringhees are to be driven into the sea  i said that would not do us hindoos much good we should fall under you musalmans again and you would have an emperor at delhi and he would tax us and trouble us as our fathers tell us the moguls did before the feringhees came  shaikh ali said to me are you a good man and true  i answered i pay my dues regularly and do poojah but i dont know what you a musalman mean by a good man  can you keep counsel against the accursed feringhees said he  that is an easy thing to do i answered they tax us and number us and make our salt dear and mean to take our daughters away from us for which purpose they have made a census to see how many young women there are of twelve years and upwards besides they slaughter cows the same as you do  listen to me ram das he said and keep your counsel do you know that they have tried to make all the sepoys lose caste and become like dogs and pariahs by putting cows grease on the cartridges  i know it i replied because my brother is a sepoy at allahabad and he sent me word of it by a son of our neighbour  did we musalmans ever do so he asked again  i never heard it said i but indeed i am ignorant of all these things for i am not an old man and i have only heard imperfectly from my elders still i dont know that you ever tried to make us lose caste  well ram das said the shaikh listen to what we propose the sepoys from meerut have gone to delhi and have proclaimed the king as emperor but now the nana of bithoor has something to say about it if the nana were made king would you fight for him  certainly said i for he is a mahratta and a good hindoo he should by rights be peshwa of the mahrattas and hold power even over your emperor at delhi  that is quite true the shaikh answered the peshwa was always the right hand and director of the emperor if we put the mogul on the throne once more the nana would be his real sovereign and hindoos and musalmans alike would rejoice in the change  but suppose we fall out among ourselves  what does that matter in the end he answered let us first drive out the accursed feringhees and then if allah prosper us we may divide the land as we like between the two creeds we are all sons of the soil hindoo and musalman alike and we can live together in peace but these hateful feringhees they come across the sea they overrun all india they tax us all alike they treat your sindiah and holkar as they treat our nizam and our king of oude they take away our slaves they tax our food they pollute your sacred rivers they destroy your castes and as for us they take their women to picnic in our mosques as i have seen myself at agra shall we not first drive them into the sea  you say well i answered and i shall ask more of this matter at bithoor  that was the first that i heard of it all next day the village was all in commotion it was said that the nana had called on all good hindoos to help him to clear out the feringhees i left my hut and my children and i came to bithoor here then they gave me a rifle and told me i should march with them to cawnpore to kill the feringhees there were not many of the dogs and the gods were on our side and when we had killed them all we should have the whole of india for the hindoos with no landtax or salttax and there should be no more cattle slaughtered nor no more interference with the pilgrims at hurdwar it was a grand day that and the nana dressed out in all the peshwas jewels looked like a very king  well we went to cawnpore and began to besiege the entrenchments which wheeler sahib had thrown up round the cantonment we had great guns and many men both sepoys and volunteers inside the feringhees had only a few and not much artillery we all thought that the gods had given us the feringhees to slay and that there would be no more of them left at all  for twenty days we continued besieging and the feringhees got weaker and weaker they had no food and scarcely any water at last wheeler sahib sent to tell the nana that he would give himself up if the nana would spare their lives the nana was a merciful man and he said i might go on and take the entrenchment and kill you all if i wished but to save time because i want to get away and join the others i will let you off so he took all the money in the treasury and the guns and promised to provide boats to take them all down to allahabad  i was standing about near one of our guns that day when chunder lal a brahman in the nanas troops came up to me and said well ram das what do you think of this  i think said i that it is a sin and a shame after we have broken down the hospital and starved out the feringhees to let them go down the river to allahabad to strengthen the garrison that pollutes that holy city for i hear that they do all kinds of wrong there and insult the brahmans and the bathers and the sacred figtree and if these men go and join them the garrison will be stronger and they will be able to hold out longer against the people which may the gods avert  so i think too ram das said he and for my part i would try to prevent their going  a little later we went down to the river by the nanas orders there some men had got boats together and were putting the feringhees into them it was getting dark and we all went down to guard them a few of them had got into the boats the rest were on the bank i can see it all now the white men with their proud looks abashed going meekly into the boats and the women stepping all afraid and shrinking from the black facesshrinking from us as if we were unclean and they would lose caste by touching us though they were so frightened they were proud still then three guns went off somewhere in the camp chunder lal was near me and he said to me that is the signal for us to fire the nana ordered me to fire when i heard those guns i dont know if it was true perhaps the nana ordered it perhaps chunder lal told a lie but i never could find out the truth about it for they blew chunder lal from the guns at cawnpore afterwards and i have never seen the nana since to ask him at any rate i levelled my musket and fired i hit an officer sahib and wounded him not mortally in a moment there was a great report and i looked round and saw all our men firing i dont know if they had the word of command but i think not i think they all saw me fire and fired because i did and because they thought it a shame to let the feringhees escape as though the head man of a village should entrap a tiger a maneater that had killed many cultivators in their dalfields and then should let it go if a headman ordered the villagers to loose it from the trap do you think they would obey him no and if he loosed it himself they would take muskets and sticks and weapons of all kinds and kill the maneater at once that is what we did with the feringhees  it was a terrible sight and i did not like to see it some of them leapt into the water and were drowned others swam away madly like wild fowl and we shot at them as they swam and then they dived and when they came up again we fired at them again and the water was red with their blood i hit one man on the shoulder and broke his arm but still he swam on with his other arm till somebody put a bullet through his head and he sank i ran into the water as did many others and we followed them down until all the swimmers were picked off some of the boats crossed the river but there was a regiment waiting on the oude shoresome said by accident others that the nana had posted it thereand the sepoys hacked them all to pieces as they tried to escape it was a dreadful sight and i am an older man now and do not like to think of it but i was younger then and our blood was hot with fighting and we thought we were going to drive the feringhees out of the country and that the gods would be well pleased with our days work  some boats got away a little way but they were afterwards sent back the women and children some of them badly wounded we took back into cawnpore we put them in the bibis house near the assembly rooms then in a few days the others who were sent back from futteypore arrived and the nana said what shall i do with them everybody said shoot them so we took out all the men the same day and shot them at once the women and children the nana spared because he was a humane man and he sent them to the others in the bibis house there they were well treated and though they had not punkahs and tattis and cows flesh as formerly yet they got better rations than any of the nanas own soldiers for the feringhees like all you europeans sahib are very luxurious and will not live off rice or dal and a little ghee like other people you have conquered every place in the world from ceylon to cashmere and so you have got luxurious and live off wheaten bread and cows flesh and wine and many such ungodly things but the rest of the world think it a great thing if they have ghee to their rice  after a fortnight the nanas troops were defeated at futteypore and it was said that the feringhee ladies were sending letters to the army then the nana was very angry he said i have spared these womens lives and yet they are sending news to my enemies i will tell you what i will do i will put them all to death so he gave word to have them shot i was one of the guards at the bibis house and i got orders to shoot them then we all tried to bring them out in front of the house but they would not come so we had to go in and put an end to them there with swords and bayonets poor things they shrieked piteously and i was sorry for them because they were some of them young and pretty and it is not the womens fault if the feringhees come here for the feringhee ladies hate india and will all go away again across the water if they can get a chance and then there were the children one poor lady clung to my knees and begged hard for her daughter but i had to obey orders so i cut her down it was very sad but then the feringhee ladies are even prouder than the men and they hate us hindoos they would not care if they killed a thousand of us if their little fingers ached look how they make us salaam and punish us for small faults and compel us to work punkahs and to run on foot after their carriages and insult our gods ah they are a cruel proud race they are lower than the lowest sudra and yet they will treat a twiceborn brahman like a dog  we threw all the bodies into the well at cawnpore where now they have put up an image of one of their godsa cold white god with two wingsto avenge their death then there was great joy in cawnpore we had killed the last of the feringhees and india should be our own soon we might make the nana into a real peshwa and turn against the musalmans and put down all slaughtering of cattle altogether as the rani did at jhansi we should have no more landtax to pay for the musalmans should pay all the taxes as is just but the hindoos should have their land for nothing and live upon chupatties and ghee and honey every day ah that was the grandest day that was ever seen in cawnpore  but that was not the end of it in the mysterious providence of the allwise gods it was otherwise ordained a few days before all this i was standing about in the bazaar when i met a jemadar he said to me so the feringhees are marching from allahabad  the feringhees i said why no we have killed them all off out of india thanks be to the gods at delhi they are all killed and at meerut and at cawnpore here and i believe everywhere but at allahabad and at calcutta  ram das he answered you are a child you know nothing do you think the feringhees are so few they are swarming across the water like locusts across the ganges in a few months they will all come from where they have been helping the sultan of roum against the other christians and they will make the whole doab into a desert as they made rohilcund in the days of hostein sahib1 shall i tell you the news from delhi  yes i said tell me by all means for i dont believe the feringhees will ever again hold rule in india the land of the allwise gods in those days sahib i was very foolish i did not know that the feringhees were in number like the green parrots and that they could send countless shiploads across the water as easily as we could send a cargo of dal down the river to benares  well then he said delhi has been besieged and before long it will be taken and the feringhees have sent up men from calcutta who have reached allahabad and are now on the march for cawnpore when they come they will take us all and kill the nana and there will be an end of the hindoos for ever they are going to make us all into christians by force baptising us with unclean water and making brahmans and pariahs eat together of cows flesh and destroying all caste and modesty and religion altogether  they will do all these things doubtless i replied if they can succeed in catching us but it is impossible the feringhees are but a handful they could never have ruled us if it were not for the sepoys they had all the muskets and the ammunition and they kept them from us but now that the sepoys have mutinied the feringhees are but a few officers and halfadozen regiments and i cannot believe that the gods would allow men like them who are worse than musalmans and have no caste to conquer us who are the best blood in india brahmans and jats and mahrattas  but the jemadar laughed at me i tell you he said this rebellion is all childs play for i have myself been across the water once as an officers servant and have been to england and to their great town london it is so great that a man can hardly walk across it from end to end in a day and if you were to put allahabad or cawnpore down in its midst the people would not know that any new thing had come about they have ships in their rivers as thick as the canes in a sugarfield and iron roads with cars drawn by steam horses they have so many men that they could overrun all india as easily as the people of cawnpore could overrun bihtoor and so when i hear their guns outside the town i will run away to them and i advise you to do so too  i didnt believe him at the time but a few days afterwards i found out that the feringhees were really marching from allahabad and when we killed the ladies they were almost at the door they fought like demons and we know that the demons must all be on their side many times we went out to meet them but in four separate battles they cut our men to pieces like sheep at last just after we had got rid of the ladies they got to cawnpore  then there was no end of the confusion the nana got frightened and fled away we blew up the magazine so that they might not have powder and the feringhees came at once into the town there never were people so savage or angry the sight of the well and the bibis house seemed to drive them wild they were more like tigers than human beings every sepoy whom they caught they shot at once for vengeance because that is their religion and many who were not sepoys and who had not borne arms against them they shot on false evidence every man who had a grudge against another told the feringhees that their enemy had helped to cut down the ladies and the feringhees were so greedy for blood that they believed it all and shot them down at once so much blood was never shed in cawnpore for one life they took ten then we knew it was all true what the jemadar had said and that they would take the whole doab back and put back the landtax and the salttax and we thought too that they would make us all into christians but that they have not done for so long as they get their taxes and have high pay and good bungalows and cows flesh and beer they dont care about or reverence any religion not even their own for we hindoos respect our fakeers and even the musalmans respect their pirs but the feringhees think as little of the missionaries as we do ourselves and care more for dances than for their churches that is why they have not compelled us to become christians  all the time the feringhees were in cawnpore i lay hid in the jemadars house he was a good man though he had gone over to the feringhees as soon as they came in sight and nobody suspected his house because he was now on their side and had given them news of all that took place in the town when we killed the officers and the ladies so i was quite safe there and got dal and water every day and was in no danger at all  presently the feringhees moved off again abandoning cawnpore because havelock sahib who was the most terrible of their generals wanted to go on to lucknow there the musalmans of oude had risen and were besieging the presidency with all the soldiers and officers i would not go to oude because i did not care to fight for musalmans preferring rather to wait the chance of the nana coming back for only a mahratta could now recover the kingdom for the hindoos and the musalmans are almost as bad as the feringhees themselves in a short time however the gwalior men came they were good men the gwalior men for though sindiah their rajah had commanded them not to fight they would not desert the other hindoos when there were feringhees to be killed and they disobeyed sindiah and rebelled and so i joined them gladly they pitched only fifteen miles from cawnpore and there i went out and enlisted with them  byandby most of the gwalior men got frightened and went back again then things became very bad a few of us marched southward and hid in the jungles that slope down towards the jumna we were very frightened because there are tigers in that jungle and two gwalior men were eaten by the tigers but soon some feringhees from etawa heard of our being there and they came out to stalk us it was just like shooting nilghae they came on horseback and closed all round the jungle where we were then they crept on into the jungle and we crept away from them every now and then they drove a man into an open space and then they all shouted like fiends and shot at him when they hit him and rolled him over they laughed and shouted louder still i was hidden under some low bushes and two feringhees passed close to me one on each side of the bushes but they did not see me soon after they started a man who had been a sepoy and he ran back towards my bushes i never said a word then they all fired at him and killed him but one bullet hit me on the arm and went through the flesh of my arm and partly splintered the bone but still i said nothing all day long i lay moaning to myself very low and the feringhees scoured all the jungle and killed everybody but me and went away saying to themselves that they had had a good days sport for they hunted us just as if we were antelopes  i lay for a fortnight wounded in the jungle and had nothing to eat but mahua berries i was feverish and wandered in my mind but at the end of a fortnight i could crawl out and managed to drag along my wounded arm then i went to the nearest village and gave out that i was a cultivator who had been wounded by the gwalior men in trying to defend a tuhseelie2 for the feringhees for that they took great care of me and sent me on to cawnpore  i was not afraid to go back to the town for my own people would not know me again in that fortnight i had grown from a young man into the man you see me only i was olderlooking then than i am now for i have got younger in the sahibs service my hair had turned white and so had my beard which was longer and more matted than before my forehead was wrinkled and my cheeks had fallen away as soon as i had got to cawnpore i went straight to the jemadars house to see if he would recognize me but he did not for even my voice was hoarser and harsher than of old through fever and exposure so i went and told my story to the feringhee doctor how i had been wounded in keeping the tuhseelie for his people and he tended my arm and made it well again for though the feringhees are savage like tigers to their enemies if you befriend them they will treat you well in that they are better than the musalmans  soon after i went out to the parade ground because i heard there was to be a dreadful sight they were going to blow the rebels they had taken from the guns i went out and looked on then they took all the men brahmans and chumars alike and broke caste and tied them each to a gun i could not have done it though i cut down the feringhee ladies but they did it and made a light matter of it then they fired the guns and in a whiff their bodies were all blown away utterly so that there was nothing left of them this they did so as utterly to destroy the rebels leaving neither body nor soul but annihilating them altogether which is worse than death they would have done it to me if they had caught me do you wonder that i hate the feringhees sahib why they did it even to the twiceborn brahmans let alone a jat the gods will avenge it on them  then i went out to look at my plot of land the feringhees knew of me from many traitors some of whom had given up my name to save themselves from being blown awayand no wonder they had seized my plot and sold it to another man a zameendar a kayath in cawnpore who had made money by supplying them with foodthe curse of all the gods upon him and as for my wife and children they had gone wandering out and i have never seen them since my wife was with child and she went into cawnpore and thence elsewhere i know not where and starved to death i suppose or died in some other shameful way but one of my daughters a missionary got and sent her to meerut to a school and there they are teaching her to be a christian and to hate her own gods and her own people and to love the feringhees who suck the blood of india and grind down the poor with taxes and dispossess the thakurs who ought of course by right to own the land this much i learned by inquiring at cawnpore but how my wife died or whether they killed her or what that i have never been able to learn  so that was the end of it all the nana was hidden away somewhere up nepaul way and the feringhees had got back lucknow and all over the doab and the punjab they were established again and the hopes of the people were all broken and i had lost my land and my wife and my children and had nothing to live upon or to live for and we had not driven out the accursed strangers after all but on the contrary they made themselves stronger than ever and sent more soldiers as the jemadar had prophesied and put down the company who used to be their rajah and sent up a maharani instead who is now empress of india and they made new taxes and a new census and all sorts of imposts but since that time they have been more afraid of us and are not so insolent to the temples or the pilgrims or to the sacred monkeys and i came to bithoor and became a syce and i have been a syce ever since that is all i know about the mutiny sahib  the old man stopped suddenly having told all his story in a dull monotonous voice with little feeling and no dramatic display i have tried to reproduce it just as he said it there was no passion no fierceness no cruelty in his manner but simply a deep settled uniform tone of hatred to the english it was the only time i had ever heard the story of the mutiny from a native point of view and i give it as i heard it without mitigating aught either of its horror or its truth  and you are not afraid of telling me all this i asked  he shook his head the sahib has a white face he answered but his heart is black  and the nana i inquired do you know if he is living still  his eyes flashed fire for the first time since he had begun ay he cried he is living that i know from many trusty friends and he will come again whenever there is trouble between the feringhees and the other christians and then we shall have no quarrelling among ourselves but sindiah and holkar and the nizam and the oude people and even the bengalis will rise up together and we will cut every feringhees throat in all india and the gods will give us the land for ever after good night sahib my salaam to you and he glided like a serpent from the room  footnotes
