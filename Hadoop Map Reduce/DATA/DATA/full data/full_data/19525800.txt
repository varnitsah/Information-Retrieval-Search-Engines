19525800	love and life  an old story in eighteenth century costume   by charlotte m yonge    transcribers note there are numerous examples throughout this text of words appearing in alternate spellings madamemadam practise practice ladyshipladyship c we can only wonder what the publisher had in mind i have left them unchangeddl     preface to the second edition   the first edition of this tale was put forth without explaining the old fable on which it was foundeda fable recurring again and again in fairy myths though not traceable in the classic world till a very late period when it appeared among the tales of apuleius of the province of africa sometimes called the earliest novelist there are however fragments of the same story in the popular tales of all countries so that it is probable that apuleius availed himself of an early form of one of these they are to be found from india to scandinavia adapted to the manners and fancy of every country in turn beauty and the beast and the black bull of norroway are the most familiar forms of the tale and it seemed to me one of those legends of such universal property that it was quite fair to put it into 18th century english costume  some have seen in it a remnant of the custom of some barbarous tribes that the wife should not behold her husband for a year after marriage and to this the indian versions lend themselves but apuleius himself either found it or adapted it to the idea of the soul the life awakened by love grasping too soon and impatiently then losing it and unable to rest struggling on through severe toils and labours till her hopes are crowned even at the gates of death psyche the soul or life whose emblem is the butterfly thus even in heathen philosophy strained towards the higher love just glimpsed at for a while  christians gave a higher meaning to the fable and saw in it the soul or the church to whom her bridegroom has been for a while made known striving after him through many trials to be made one with him after passing through death the spanish poet calderon made it the theme of two sacred dramas in which the lesson of faith not sight was taught with special reference to the holy eucharist  english poetry has however only taken up its simple classical aspect in the early part of the century mrs tighe wrote a poem in spenserian stanza called psyche which was much admired at the time and mr morris has more lately sung the story in his earthly paradise this must be my excuse for supposing the outline of the tale to be familiar to most readers  the fable is briefly thus  venus was jealous of the beauty of a maiden named psyche the youngest of three daughters of a king she sent misery on the land and family and caused an oracle to declare that the only remedy was to deck his youngest daughter as a bride and leave her in a lonely place to become the prey of a monster cupid was commissioned by his mother to destroy her he is here represented not as a child but as a youth who on seeing psyches charms became enamoured of her and resolved to save her from his mother and make her his own he therefore caused zephyr to transport her to a palace where everything delightful and valuable was at her service feasts spread music playing all her wishes fulfilled but all by invisible hands at night in the dark she was conscious of a presence who called himself her husband showed the fondest affection for her and promised her all sorts of glory and bliss if she would be patient and obedient for a time  this lasted till yearnings awoke to see her family she obtained consent with much difficulty and many warnings then the splendour in which she lived excited the jealousy of her sisters and they persuaded her that her visitor was really the monster who would deceive her and devour her they thus induced her to accept a lamp with which to gaze on him when asleep she obeyed them then beholding the exquisite beauty of the sleeping god of love she hung over him in rapture till a drop of the hot oil fell on his shoulder and awoke him he sprang up sorrowfully reproached her with having ruined herself and him and flew away letting her fall as she clung to him  the palace was broken up the wrath of venus pursued her ceres and all the other deities chased her from their temples even when she would have drowned herself the river god took her in his arms and laid her on the bank only pan had pity on her and counselled her to submit to venus and do her bidding implicitly as the only hope of regaining her lost husband  venus spurned her at first and then made her a slave setting her first to sort a huge heap of every kind of grain in a single day the ants secretly commanded by cupid did this for her next she was to get a lock of golden wool from a ram feeding in a valley closed in by inaccessible rocks but this was procured for her by an eagle and lastly venus declaring that her own beauty had been impaired by attendance on her injured son commanded psyche to visit the infernal regions and obtain from proserpine a closed box of cosmetic which was on no account to be opened psyche thought death alone could bring her to these realms and was about to throw herself from a tower when a voice instructed her how to enter a cavern and propitiate cerberus with cakes after the approved fashion  she thus reached proserpines throne and obtained the casket but when she had again reached the earth she reflected that if venuss beauty were impaired by anxiety her own must have suffered far more and the prohibition having of course been only intended to stimulate her curiosity she opened the casket out of which came the baneful fumes of death just however as she fell down overpowered her husband who had been shut up by venus came to the rescue and finding himself unable to restore her cried aloud to jupiter who heard his prayer reanimated psyche and gave her a place among the gods   chapters          i   a syllabub party       ii

syllabub party       oft had i shadowed such a group       of beauties that were born     in teacup times of hood and hoop       and when the patch was worn     and legs and arms with loveknots gay       about me leaped and laughed     the modish cupid of the day       and shrilled his tinselled shafttennyson   if times differ human nature and national character vary but little and thus in looking back on former times we are by turns startled by what is curiously like and curiously unlike our own sayings and doings  the feelings of a retired officer of the nineteenth century expecting the return of his daughters from the first gaiety of the youngest darling are probably not dissimilar to those of major delavie in the earlier half of the seventeen hundreds as he sat in the deep bay window of his bedroom though he wore a green velvet nightcap and his whole provision of mental food consisted of half a dozen worn numbers of the tatler and a gazette a fortnight old the chair on which he sat was elbowed and made easy with cushions and pillows but that on which his lame foot rested was stiff and angular the cushion was exquisitely worked in chainstich as were the quilt and curtains of the great fourpost bed and the only carpeting consisted of three or four narrow strips of woolwork the walls were plain plaster whitewashed and wholly undecorated except that the mantelpiece was carved with the hideous caryatides of the early stewart days and over it were suspended a long cavalry sabre and the accompanying spurs and pistols above them the miniature of an exquisitely lovely woman with a white rose in her hair and a white favour on her breast  the window was a deep one projecting far into the narrow garden below for in truth the place was one of those old manor houses which their wealthy owners were fast deserting in favour of new specimens of classical architecture as understood by louis xiv and the room in which the major sat was one of the few kept in habitable repair the garden was rich with white pinks peonies lilies of the valley and early roses and there was a flagged path down the centre between the front door and a wicketgate into a long lane bordered with hawthorn hedges the blossoms beginning to blush with the advance of the season beyond rose dimly the spires and towers of a cathedral town one of those county capitals to which the provincial magnates were wont to resort during the winter keeping a mansion there for the purpose and providing entertainment for the gentry of the place and neighbourhood  twilight was setting in when the major began to catch glimpses of the laced hats of coachman and footmen over the hedges a lumbering made itself heard and by and by the vehicle halted at the gate such a coach it was only the second best and the glories of its landscapepainted sides were somewhat dimmed the green and silver of the fittings a little tarnished to a critical eye yet it was a splendid article commodious and capacious though illprovided with air and light however nobody cared for stuffiness certainly not the three young ladies who fan in hand came tripping down the steps that were unrolled for them the eldest paused to administer a fee to their entertainers servants who had brought them home and the coach rolled on to dispose of the remainder of the freight  the father waved greetings from one window a rosy little audacious figure in a nightdress peeped out furtively from another and the housedoor was opened by a tall old soldierservant stiff as a ramrod with hair tightly tied and plastered up into a queue and a blue and brown livery which sat like a uniform  well young ladies he said i hope you enjoyed yourselves  vastly thank you corporal palmer and how has it been with my father in our absence  purely miss harriet he relished the friars chicken that miss delavie left for him and he amused himself for an hour with master eugene after which he did me the honour to play two plays at backgammon  i hope said the eldest sister coming up that the little rogue whom i saw peeping from the window has not been troublesome  he has been as good as gold madam he played in masters room till nannerl called him to his bed when he went at once true to his orders says the master a fine soldier he will make says i to my master  therewith the sisters mounted the uncarpeted but wellpolished oak stair knocked at the fathers door and entered one by one each dropping her curtsey and though the eldest was fiveandtwenty neither speaking nor sitting till they were greeted with a hearty come my young maids sit you down and tell your old father your gay doings  the eldest took the only unoccupied chair while the other two placed themselves on the windowseat all bolt upright with both little high heels on the floor in none of the easy attitudes of damsels of later date talking over a party all three were complete gentlewomen in air and manners though betty had high cheekbones a large nose rough complexion and red hair and her countenance was more loveable and trustworthy than symmetrical the dainty decorations of youth looked grotesque upon her and she was so well aware of the fact as to put on no more than was absolutely essential to a lady of birth and breeding harriet pronounced hawyot the next in age had a small wellset head a pretty neck and fine dark eyes but the smallpox had made havoc of her bloom and left its traces on cheek and brow the wreck of her beauty had given her a discontented fretful expression which rendered her far less pleasing than honest homely betty though she employed all the devices of the toilette to conceal the ravages of the malady and enhance her remaining advantages of shape and carriage  there was an air of vexation about her as her father asked well how many conquests has my little aurelia made she could not but recollect how triumphantly she had listened to the same inquiry after her own first appearance scarcely three short years ago yet she grudged nothing to aurelia her junior by five years who was for the first time arrayed as a fullgrown belle in a pale blue tightsleeved longwaisted silk open and looped up over a primrose skirt embroidered by her own hands with tiny blue butterflies hovering over harebells there were blue silk shoes likewise homemade with silver buckles and the long mittens and deep lace ruffles were of bettys fabrication even the dress itself had been cut by harriet from old wedding hoards of their mothers and made up after the last mode imported by madam churchill at the deanery  the only part of the equipment not of domestic handiwork was the structure on the head the carminster hairdresser had been making his rounds since daylight taking his most distinguished customers last and as the misses delavie were not high on the roll harriet and aurelia had been under his hands at nine am from that time till three when the coach called for them they had sat captive on low stools under a tent of tablecloth over tall chairbacks to keep the dust out of the frosted edifice constructed out of their rich dark hair of the peculiar tint then called mousecolour betty had refused to submit to this durance what sort of dinner would be on my fathers tablecloth if i were to sit under one all day said she in answer to harriets representation of the fitness of things la my dear what matters it what an old scarecrow like me puts on  old maidenhood set in much earlier in those days than at present the sisters acquiesced and betty had run about as usual all the morning in her mobcap and chintz gown tucked through her pocketholes and only at the last submitted her head to the manipulations of corporal palmer who daily powdered his masters wig  strange and unnatural as was the whitening of the hair it was effective in enhancing the beauty of aurelias dark arched brows the soft brilliance of her large velvety brown eyes and the exquisite carnation and white of her colouring her features were delicately chiselled and her face had that peculiar fresh innocent soft untouched bloom and undisturbed repose which form the special charm and glory of the first dawn of womanhood her little head was well poised on a slender neck just now curving a little to one side with the fatigue of the hours during which it had sustained her headgear this consisted of a tiny flat hat fastened on by long pins and adorned by a cluster of campanulas like those on her dress with a similar blue butterfly on an invisible wire above them the dainty handiwork of harriet  the inquiry about conquests was a matter of course after a young ladys first party but aurelia looked too childish for it and betty made haste to reply  aurelia was a very good girl no one could have curtsied or bridled more prettily when we paid our respects to my lady herries and mrs churchill and the dean highly commended her dancing  you danced fine doings i thought you were merely invited to look on at the game at bowls who had the best of the match  the first game was won by canon boltby the second by the dean said betty but when they would have played the conqueror lady herries interfered and said the gentlemen had kept the field long enough and now it was our turn so a cow was driven on the bowlinggreen with a bell round her neck and pink ribbons on her horns  a cow what will they have next  they say tis all the mode in london interposed harriet  pray was the cow to instruct you in dancing continued the major  no sir said aurelia whom he had addressed she was to be milked into the bowl of syllabub  this was received with a great ho ho and a demand who was to act as milker  that was the best of it said aurelia soon came miss herries in a straw hat and the prettiest green petticoat under a white gown and apron as a dairymaid but the cow would not stand still for all the man who led her kept scolding her and saying coop coop no sooner had miss herries seated herself on the stool than moolly swerved away and it was a mercy that the fine china bowl escaped every one was laughing and poor miss herries was ready to cry when forth steps my sister coaxes the cow bids the man lend his apron sits down on the stool and has the bowl frothing in a moment  i would not have done so for worlds said harriet i dreaded every moment to be asked where miss delavie learnt to be a milkmaid  you were welcome to reply in her own yard said betty you may thank me for your syllabub  which after all you forbade poor aura to taste  assuredly i was not going to have her turn sick on my hands she may think herself beholden to me for her dance with that fine young beau who was he aura  how now said the major in a tone of banter while harriet indulged in a suppressed giggle you let aura dance with a stranger where was your circumspection mrs betty aurelia coloured to the roots of her hair and faltered it was lady herries who presented him  yes the child is not to blame said betty i left her in charge of mrs churchill while i went to wash my hands after milking the cow which these fine folk seemed to suppose could be done without soiling a finger  thats the way with chloe and phyllida in arcadia said her father  but not here said betty in the house i was detained a little while for the housekeeper wanted me to explain my recipe for taking out the grease spots  a little while sister said harriet it was through the dancing of three minuets and the country dance had long been begun  i was too busy to heed the time said betty for i obtained the recipe for those delicious almondcakes and showed mrs waldron the vienna mode of clearing coffee when i came back the fiddles were playing and aurelia going down the middle with a young gentleman in a scarlet coat poor little robert rowe was too bashful to find a partner though he longed to dance so i made another couple with him and thus missed further speech save that as we took our leave both sir george and the dean complimented me and said what there is no occasion to repeat just now sir when i ought to be fetching your supper  ha is it too flattering for little aura asked her father come never spare she will hear worse than that in her day ill warrant  it was merely said betty reluctantly that the dean called her the star of the evening and declared that her dancing equalled her face  well said of his reverence and his honour the baronet what said he  he said sir that so comely and debonnaire a couple had not been seen in these parts since you came home from flanders and led off the assize ball with mistress urania delavie  there aura tis my turn to blush cried the major comically hiding his face behind bettys fan but all this time you have never told me who was this young spark  that i cannot tell sir returned betty we were sent home in the coach with mistress duckworth and her daughters who talked so incessantly that we could not open our lips who was he aura  my lady herries only presented him as sir amyas sister replied aurelia  sir amyas cried her auditors all together  nothing more said aurelia indeed she made as though he and i must be acquainted and i suppose that she took me for harriet but i knew not how to explain  no doubt said harriet i was sick of the music and folly and had retired to the summerhouse with peggy duckworth who had brought a sweet sonnet of mr ambrose phillips defying cupid  her father burst into a chuckling laugh much to her mortification though she would not seem to understand it and betty took up the moral  sir amyas are you positive that you caught the name child  i thought so sister said aurelia with the insecurity produced by such crossquestioning but i may have been mistaken since of course the true sir amyas belamour would never be here without my fathers knowledge  nor is there any other of the name said her father except that melancholic uncle of his who never leaves his dark chamber  depend upon it said harriet lady herries said sir ambrose no doubt it was sir ambrose watford  nay harriet i demur to that said her father drolly i flatter myself i was a more personable youth than to be likened to watford with his swollen nose what like was your cavalier aura  indeed sir i cannot describe him i was so much terrified lest he should speak to me that i had much ado to mind my steps i know he had white gloves and diamond shoebuckles and that his feet moved by no means like those of sir ambrose  aura is a modest child and does credit to her breeding said betty thus much i saw that the young gentleman was tall and personable enough to bear comparison even to you sir not more than nineteen or twenty years of age in a laced scarlet uniform as i think of the dragoon guards and with a little powder but not enough to disguise that his hair was entire gold  that all points to his being indeed young belamour said her father age military appearance and alli wonder what this portends  what a disaster exclaimed harriet that my sister and i should have been out of the way and only a chit like aura be there to be presented to him  if young ladies will defy cupid began her fatherbut at that moment corporal palmer knocked at the door bringing a basin of soup for his master and announcing supper is served young ladies  each of the three bent her knee to receive her fathers blessing and kiss then curtseying at the door departed betty lingering behind her two juniors to see her father taste his soup and to make sure that he relished it     chapter ii the house of delavie       all his paphian mother fear     empress all thy sway revere                             euripedes anstice   the parlour where the supper was laid was oak panelled but painted white like a little island in the vast polished slippery floor lay a square muchworn carpet just big enough to accommodate a moderatesized table and the surrounding highbacked chairs there was a tentstitch rug before the dutchtiled fireplace and on the walls hung two framed printsone representing the stately and graceful duke of marlborough the other the small dark pinched but fiery prince eugene on the spotless white cloth was spread a frugal meal of bread butter cheese and lettuce a jug of milk another of water and a bottle of cowslip wine for the habits of the family were more than usually frugal and abstemious  frugality and health alike obliged major delavie to observe a careful regimen he had served in all marlboroughs campaigns and had afterwards entered the austrian army and fought in the turkish war until he had been disabled before belgrade by a terrible wound of which he still felt the effects returning home with his wife the daughter of a jacobite exile he had become a kind of agent in managing the family estate for his cousin the heiress lady belamour who allowed him to live rentfree in this ruinous old manorhouse the cradle of the family  this was all that harriet and aurelia knew the latter had been born at the manor and young girls if not brought extremely forward were treated like children but elizabeth the eldest of the family who could remember vienna was so much the companion and confidante of her father that she was more on the level of a mother than a sister to her juniors  then you think aurelias beau was really sir amyas belamour said harriet as they sat down to supper  so it appears said betty gravely  do you think he will come hither sister i would give the world to see him continued harriet  he said something of hoping for better acquaintance softly put in aurelia  oh did he so cried harriet for demure as you are miss aura i fancy you looked a little above the diamond shoebuckles  fie harriet exclaimed betty i will not have the child tormented he ought to come and pay his respects to my father  have you ever seen my lady asked aurelia  that have i miss aurelia interposed corporal palmer and a rare piece of beauty she would be if one could forget the saying handsome is as handsome does  i never knew what she has done said aurelia  tis a long story hastily said betty too long to tell at table i must make haste to prepare the poultice for my father  she quickly broke up the supper party and the two younger sisters repaired to their chamber both conscious of having been repressed the one feeling injured the other rebuked for forwardness and curiosity the three sisters shared one long low room with a large light closet at each end one of these was sacred to powder the other was bettys private property harriet had a little white bed to herself betty and aurelia nightly climbed into a lofty and solemn structure curtained with ancient figured damask each had her own toilettetable and a press for her clothes where she contrived to stow them in a wonderfully small space  harriet and aurelia had divested themselves of their finery before betty came in and they assisted her operations harriet preferring a complaint that she never would tell them anything  i have no objection to tell you at fitting times said betty but not with palmer putting in his word you should have discretion harriet  the deans servants never speak when they are waiting at table said harriet with a pout  but ill warrant them to hear retorted betty  and i had rather have our dear old honest corporal than a dozen of those fine lackeys said aurelia but you will tell us the story like a good sister while we brush the powder out of our hair  they put on powdering gowns after releasing themselves from the armour of their stays and were at last at ease each seated on a wooden chair in the powdering closet brush in hand with a cloud of white dust flying round and the true colour of the hair beginning to appear  then it is indeed true that my lady is one of the greatest beauties of queen carolines court if not the greatest said harriet  truly she is said betty and though in full maturity she preserves the splendour of her prime  tell us more particularly said aurelia can she be more lovely than our dear mamma  no indeed lovely was never the word for her to my mind said betty her face always seemed to me more like that of one of the marble statues i remember at vienna perfect but clear cold and hard but i am no judge for i did not love her and in a child admiration accompanies affection  what did palmer mean by handsome is that handsome does surely my father never was illtreated by lady belamour  let me explain said the elder sister the ancient custom and precedent of our family have always transmitted the estates to the male heir but when charles ii granted the patent of nobility to the first baron delavie the barony was limited to the heirs male of his body and out grandfather was only his brother the last lord had three sons and one daughter urania who alone survived him  i know all that from the monument said aurelia one was drowned while bathing one died of spotted fever and one was killed at the battle of ramillies how dreadful for the poor old father  and there is no lord delavie now said harriet why since my lady could not have the title did it not come to our papa  because his father was not in the patent said betty however it was thought that if he were married to mistress urania there would be a fresh creation in their favour so as soon as the last campaign was over our father who had always been a favourite at the great house was sent for from the army and given to understand that he was to conduct his courtship with the cousin he had petted as a little child as speedily as was decorous however in winter quarters at tournai he had already pledged his faith to the daughter of a scottish gentleman in the austrian service this engagement was viewed by the old lord as a trifling folly which might be set aside by the head of the family he hinted that the proposed match was by no means disagreeable to his daughter and scarcely credited his ears when his young kinsman declared his honour forbade him to break with miss murray  dear father ejaculated aurelia so he gave up everything for her sake  and never repented it said betty  now said harriet i understand why he entered the army  it was all he had to depend on said betty and he had been favourably noticed by prince eugene at the siege of lisle so that he easily obtained a commission he believed that though it was in the power of the old lord to dispose of part of his estates by will yet that some of the land was entailed in the male line so that there need not be many years of campaigning or poverty for his bride even if her father never were restored to his scottish property as you know our grandfather sir archibald murray died for his loyalty in the rising of 15 and two years later our father received at belgrade that terrible wound which closed his military career meantime urania had married sir jovian belamour and lord delavie seemed to have forgotten my fathers offence and gave him the management of the estate with this old house to live in showing himself glad of the neighbourhood of a kinsman whom he could thoroughly trust all went well till my lady came to visit her father then all old offences were renewed lady belamour treated my mother as a poor dependant she daughter to a noble line of pedigree far higher than that of the delavies might well return her haughty looks and would not yield an inch nor join in the general adulation there were disputes about us children poor archie was a most beautiful boy and though you might not suppose it i was a very pretty little girl this nose of mine being then much more shapely than the little buttons which grow to fair proportions on the other hand the little belamours were puny and sickly indeed as you know this young sir amyas who was not then born is the only one of the whole family who has been reared then we had been carefully bred could chatter french recite poetry make our bow and curtsey bridle and said sir and madam while the poor little cousins who had been put out to nurse had no more manners than the calves and pigs people were the more flattering to us because they expected soon to see my father in his lordships place and on the other hand officious tongues were not wanting to tell my lady how mrs delavie contrasted the two sets of children very bitter offence was taken nor has my lady ever truly forgiven whatever our dear good father may believe when the old lord died a will was found bequeathing all his unentailed estates to his daughter and this was of course strong presumption that he believed in the existence of a deed of entail but none could ever be found and the precedents were not held to establish the right  did he leave my father nothing asked harriet  he left him three hundred pounds and made him joint executor with sir jovian there was no mention of this house which was the original house of the family the first lord having built the great house and both my father and sir jovian were sure the lord delavie believed it would come to him but no proofs were extant and my lady would only consent to his occupying it as before as her agent  i always knew we were victims to an injustice said harriet though i never understood the matter exactly  you were a mere child and my father does not love to talk of it he ceased to care much about the loss after our dear archie died  not for eugenes sake  eugene was not born for two years after archies death my dear mother had drooped from the time of the disappointment blaming herself for having ruined my father and scarce accepting comfort when he vowed that all was well lost for her sake she reproached herself with having been proud and unconciliatory though i doubt whether it made much difference then her spirit was altogether crushed by the loss of archie she never had another days health eugene came to her like ichabod to phinehas wife and she was soon gone from us said betty wiping away a tear  leaving us a dear sister to be a mother to us said aurelia raising her sweet face for a kiss  harriet pondered a little and said my lady is not at enmity with us since my father keeps the house and agency  we should be reduced to poverty indeed without them said betty and sir jovian an upright honourable man the only person whom my lady truly respected insisted on his continuance as long as my lady regards his memory we are safe but no one can trust to her caprice  she never comes here nor disturbs my father  no but she makes heavy calls on the estate and is displeased if he refuses to overpress the tenants or hesitates to cut the timber  i have heard say added harriet that her debts in town and her losses at play drove her to accept her present husband mr wayland a hideous old fellow who had become vastly rich through some discovery about cannon  he is an honourable and upright man said betty i should have fewer anxieties if he had not been sent out to gibraltar and minorca to superintend the fortifications  meantime my lady makes the money fly by the help of the gallant colonel mar said harriet lightly  fie harriet returned the elder sister i have allowed you too far my father calls lady belamour his commanding officer and permits no scandal to be spoken of her  any more than of prince eugene said harriet laughing  but oh sister cried aurelia let us stay a little longer i have not half braided my hair and i long to hear who is the gentleman of whom my father spoke as living in the dark  mr amyas belamour sir jovians brother ah that is a sad story replied betty though i am not certain that i have it correctly having only heard it discussed between my father and mother when i was a growing girl sitting at my sampler i think he was a barrister i know he was a very fine gentleman and a man of parts who had made the grand tour for when he was staying at the great house he said my mother was the only person he met who could converse with him on the old masters or any other subject of virtu and that being reported to my lady increased her bitterness all the more because mr belamour was a friend of mr addison and sir richard steele and had contributed some papers to the spectator he was making a good fortune in his profession and had formed an engagement with a young lady in hertfordshire of a good old family but one which had always been disliked by lady belamour it is said too that miss sedhurst had been thought to have attracted one of my ladys many admirers and that the latter was determined not to see her rival become her sisterinlaw and probably with the same title since mr belamour was on the verge of obtaining knighthood so if she be not greatly belied lady belamour plied all parties with her confidences till she contrived to breed suspicion and jealousy on all sides until finally miss sedhursts brother a crackbrained youth offered such an insult to mr belamour that honour required a challenge it was thought that as mr belamour was the superior in age and position the matter might have been composed but the young man was fiery and hot tempered and would neither retract nor apologise and mr belamour had been stung in his tenderest feeling they fought with pistols an innovation that as you know my father hates as far more deadly and unskilful than the noble practice of fencing and the result was that mr sedhurst was shot dead and mr belamour received a severe wound in the head the poor young lady being always of a delicate constitution fell into fits on hearing the news an died in a few weeks the unfortunate mr belamour survives but whether from injury to the brain or from grief and remorse he has never been able to endure either light or company but has remained ever since in utter darkness and seclusion  utter darkness how dreadful cried aurelia shuddering  how long has this been sister inquired harriet  about nine years said betty the lamentable affair took place just before sir jovians death and the shock may have hastened it for he had long been in a languishing state it was the more unfortunate since he had made mr belamour sole personal guardian to his only surviving son and appointed him together with my father and another gentleman trustee for the belamour property and there has been much difficulty in consequence of his being unable to act or to do more than give his signature  ah sister i wish you had not told me said aurelia i shall dream of the unfortunate gentleman all night nine years of utter darkness  we know who is still child enough to hate darkness said harriet  take care said betty you must make haste or i shall leave you to it     chapter iii among the cowslips       the insect youth are on the wing     eager to taste the honeyed spring         and float amid the liquid noon     some lightly on the torrent skim     some show their gaily gilded trim         quick glancing to the sungray   though hours were early the morning meal was not served till so late as really to deserve the title of breakfast  when the three sisters sat down at nineoclock in mob caps and the two younger in white dresses all had been up at least two hours aurelia led forward little eugene in a tailed red coat longbreasted buff waistcoat buff tights and knitted stockings with a deep frilled collar under the flowing locks on his shoulders in curls which emulated a wig she had been helping him to prepare his tasks from the wellthumbed but stronglybound books which had served poor archie before him they were deposited on the windowseat to wait till the bowls of bread and milk were discussed since tea and coffee were only a special afternoon treat not considered as wholesome for children so that aurelia had only just been promoted to them along with powder and fan  harriet wore her favourite pistachio ribbon round her cap and as a breastknot and her cheeks bore token of one of the various washes with which she was always striving to regain the smoothness of her complexion knowing what this betokened an eldersisterly instinct of caution actuated betty to remind her juniors of an engagement made with dame jewel of the upland farm for the exchange of a setting of white ducks eggs for one of fivetoed fowls and to request them to carry the basket  eugene danced on his chair and begged to be of the party but harriet pouted and asked why the odd boy could not be sent  because as you very well know if he did not break he would addle every egg in the basket  there can be no need to go today  the speckled hen is clocking to brood and she is the best mother in the yard besides it is time that the cowslip wine were made and i will give you some bread and cheese and gingerbread for noonchin so that you may fill your baskets in the meadows before they are laid up for grass mrs jewel will give you a drink of milk  o let me go sister pleaded eugene she gives us bread and honey and i want to hear the lapwings in the meadows cry peewit  we shall have you falling into the river said harriet rather fretfully  no indeed if you fall in i will pull you out young maids should not run about the country without a gentleman to take care of them should they sister cried the doughty seven years old champion  who taught you that sir asked betty trying to keep her countenance  i heard mrs churchill say so to my papa returned the boy so now theres a good sister do pray let me go  if you say your tasks well and will promise to be obedient to harriet and to keep away from the river and not touch the basket of eggs  eugene was ready for any number of promises and harriet seeing there was no escape for her went off with aurelia to put on their little threecornered muslin handkerchiefs and broadbrimmed straw hats while eugene repeated his tasks namely a fragment of the catechism half a column of spelling from the universal spellingbook and bettys special pride his portion of the orbis sensualium pictus of johannes amos comenius the wonderful vocabulary with still more wonderful cuts that was then the small boys path to latinity  the eagle aquila the king of birds rex avium looketh at the sun intuetur solem as indeed he could hardly avoid doing since in the cut the sun was within a hairsbreath of his beak while his claws were almost touching a crow corvus perched on a dead horse to exemplify how aves raptores fed on carrion  thanks to aurelias private assistance eugene knew his lessons well enough for his excitement not to make him stumble so often as to prevent bettys pronouncing him a good boy and dispensing with his copy sum piece and reading until the evening these last were very tough affairs the recitation being from shakespeare and the reading from the spectator there were no childrens books properly so called except the ballads chapbooks brought round by pedlers often far from edifying and the plunge from the hornbook into general literature was to say the least of it bracing  the delavie family was cultivated for the time french had been brought home as a familiar tongue though telemaque racine and le grand cyrus were the whole library in that language and there was not another within thirty miles on two days in the week the sisters became mesdemoiselles elisabeth henriette and aurelie and conversed in french over their spinning seams lace or embroidery nor was aurelia yet emancipated from reciting racine on alternate days with milton and shakespeare  betty could likewise talk german with the old austrian maid nannerl who had followed the family from vienna but the accomplishment was not esteemed and the dialect was barbarous from the time of her mothers death betty had been a strict and careful though kind ruler to her sisters and the long walk was a greater holiday to aurelia than to eugene releasing her from her book and work whereas he would soon have been trundling his hoop and haunting the steps of palmer who was gardener as well as valet butler and a good deal besides and moreover drilled his young master thus eugene carried his head as erect as any grenadier in the service and was a thorough little gentleman in miniature a perfect little beau as his sisters loved to call the darling of their hearts and hopes  even harriet could not be cross to him though she made aurelia carry the eggs and indulged in sundry petulant whisks of the fan which she carried by way of parasol now why does betty do this she exclaimed as soon as they were out of hearing is it to secure to herself the whole enjoyment of your beau  you forget said aurelia you promised to fetch the eggs when we met mrs jewel jogging home from market on her old blind white horse last saturday because you said no eggs so shaken could ever be hatched  you demure chit exclaimed harriet would you make me believe that you have no regrets for so charming a young gentleman my ladys son and our kinsman  if he spoke to me i should not know how to answer and then you would blame my rudeness besides she added with childish sagacity he can be nothing but a fine london macaroni only think of the cowslips a whole morning to make cowslip balls she added with a little frisk i would not give one for all the macaronies in england with their powder and their snuffboxes faugh  ah child you will sing another note perhaps when it is too late said her sister with a sigh between envy and compassion  it floated past aurelia unheeded as she danced up one side of a stile and sprang clear down into a green park jumped eugene down after her by both hands and exclaimed harriet is in her vapours come let us have a race  she was instantly careering along like a white butterfly in the sunshine flitting on as the child tried to catch her among the snowy hawthorn bushes or sinking down for very joy and delight among the bank of wild hyacinths life and free motion were joy and delight enough for that happy being with her childish heart and the serious business of the day was all delight there lay the rich meadows basking in the sun and covered with short grass just beginning its summer growth but with the cowslips standing high above it hanging down their rich clusters of soft pure delicatelyscented bells from their pinky stems over their pale crinkled leaves interspersed here and there with the deep purple of the fools orchis and the pale brown quivergrass shaking out its trembling awns on their invisible stems no flower is more delightful to gather than the cowslip fragrant as the breath of a cow and aurelia darted about piling the golden heap in her basket with untiring enjoyment then producing a tape called on harriet who had been working in a more leisurely fashion to join her in making a cowslip ball and charged eugene not to nip off the heads too short  the sweet soft golden globe was made and even harriet felt the delicious intoxication the young things tossed it aloft flung from one to the other caught it caressed it buried their faces in it and threw it back with shrieks of glee  suddenly harriet checked her sister with a peremptory sign she heard horsehoofs in the lane divided from the field by a hedge of pollard willows so high that she had never thought of being overlooked till the cessation of the trotting sound struck her and looking round she saw that a horseman had halted at the gate and was gazing at their sports it was from the distance of a field but this was enough to fill harriet with dismay she drew herself up in a moment signing peremptorily to aurelia who was flying about her hat off her one long curl streaming behind as she darted hither and thither evading eugene who was pursuing her  as she paused and eugene clutched her dress with a shout of ecstasy harriet came up glancing severely toward the gate and saying as she handed her sister the hat this comes of childishness that we should be seen thus what a hoyden he will think you as the hoofs went on and the red coat vanished  he who not the farmer said aurelia this is not laid up for hay  no indeed i believe it is he said harriet mysteriously  he repeated aurelia not mr arden for he would be in black and at harriets disgusted gesture i beg your pardon but i did not know you had a new he oh surely you are not thinking of the young baronet  i am sure it was his figure  you did not see him yesterday  no but his air had too much distinction for any one from these parts  could you see what his air was from this distance i should never have guessed it but you have more experience being older come eugene another race  no i will have no more folly i was too goodnatured to allow it i am vexed beyond measure that he should have seen such rusticity  never mind dear harriet most likely it was no such person for it was not wellbred to sit staring at us and if it were he you were not known to him  you were  then he must have eyes as sharp as yours are for an air of distinction having only seen me in my blue and primrose suit how should he know me in my present trim besides i believe it was only young dick jewel in a cast coat of squire humphreys  the charm of the cowslip gathering was broken eugene found himself very hungry and the noonchin was produced after which the walk was continued to the farmhouse where the young people were made very welcome  farmers were as a rule more rustic than the present labourer but they lived a life of far less care if of more toil than their successors having ample means for their simple needs and enjoying jocund plenty the clean kitchen with the stone floor the beaupot of maythorn on the empty hearth the shining walnutwood table the spinningwheel wooden chairs and forms all looked cool and inviting and the visitors were regaled with homemade brown bread delicious butter and honey and a choice of new milk mead and currant wine  dame jewel in a white frill under a black silken hood a buff turnover kerchief stout stuff gown and white apron was delighted to wait on them and eugenes bliss was complete among the young kittens and puppies in baskets on opposite sides of the window the chickens before their coops the ducklings like yellow balls on the grass and the huge family of little spotted piglings which to the scandal of his sisters he declared the most delightful of all  their hostess knew nothing of the young baronet being in the neighbourhood and was by no means gratified by the intelligence  lackaday miss harriet you dont mean that the family is coming down here i dont want none of them tis bad times for the farmer when any of that sort is nigh they make nothing of galloping their horses a hunting right through the crops ay and horsewhipping the farmer if he do but say a word for the sweat of his brow  o mrs jewel cried aurelia in whose ear lingered the courteous accents of her partner they would never behave themselves so  bless you miss orreely ill tell you what ive seen with my own eyes my own good man the master here with the horsewhip laid about his shoulders at that very thornbush by one of the fine gentlefolks just because he had mended the gap in the hedge they was used to ride through and my lady sitting by in her laced scarlet habit on her fine horse smiling like a painted picture and saying thank you sir the rascals need to learn not to interfere with our sport all in that gentle sounding low voice of hers enough to drive one mad  i thought sir jovian had been a kind master said harriet  this was not sir jovian poor gentleman he was not often out ahunting this was one of the fine young rakish fellows from lunnun as were always swarming about my lady like bees over that maybush sir thomas donne i think they called him they said he got killed by a wild boar hunting in foreign parts afterwards and serve him right but there they would all do her bidding whether for bad or good so maybe it was less his fault than hers she is a bitter one is my lady for all she looks so sweet and this her young barrowknight will be his own mothers son and i dont want none of em down here tis a good job we have your good papa the major to stand between her and us i only wish he had his own for a rare good landlord he would be  the dames vain wishes were cut short by shrieks from the poultryyard where eugene was discovered up to his ankles in the black ooze of the horsepond waving a little stick in defiance of an angry gander who with white outspread wings snakelike neck bent and protruded and frightful screams and hisses was no bad representation of his namesake the dragon especially to a child not much exceeding him in height  the monster was put to rout the champion dragged out of the pond breathlessly explaining that he only wanted to look at the goslings when the stupid geese cackled and the gander wanted to fly at his eyes and i didnt see where i was going for i had to keep him off so i got into the mud will sister be angry he concluded ruefully surveying the dainty little stockings and shoes coated with black mud  but before the buckled shoon had been scraped or the hosen washed and dried the cheerful memory of boyhood had convinced itself that the enemy had been put to flight by his manful resistance and he turned a deaf ear to aurelias suggestion that the affair had been retribution for his constant oblivion of comenius assertion that auser gingrit the goose gagleth  they went home more soberly having been directed by mrs jewel to a field bordered by a copse where grew the most magnificent of titanias pensioners tall wearing splendid rubies in their coats and in due time the trio presented themselves at home weary but glowing with the innocent excitement of their adventures harriet was the first to proclaim that they had seen a horseman who must be sir amyas had sister seen him  only through the window of the kitchen where i was making puff paste  he called then did my papa see him  my father was in no condition to see any one being under the hands and razor of palmer  la what a sad pity did he leave no message  he left his compliments and hoped his late partner was not fatigued  is he at the great house will he call again  he is on his way to make a visit in monmouthshire together with a brother office who is related to my lady herries and finding that their road led them within twenty miles of our town the decided on making a diversion to see her it was only from her that sir amyas understood how close he was to his mothers property for my lady is extremely jealous of her prerogative  how did you hear all this sister  sir george herries rode over this afternoon and sat an hour with my father delighting him by averring that the young gentleman has his mothers charms of person together with his fathers solidity of principle and character and that he will do honour to his name  o i hope he will come back by this route cried harriet  of that there is small likelihood said betty his mother is nearly certain to prevent it since she is sure to take umbrage at his having visited the great house without her permission     chapter iv my ladys missive       to the next coffeehouse he speeds     takes up the news some scraps he readsgay   though carminster was a cathedral city the special general post only came in once a week and was liable to delay through storms snows mire and highwaymen so that its arrival was as great an event as is now the coming in of a mail steamer to a colonial harbour the post was a stout countryman with a red coat tall jackboots and a huge hat he rode a strong horse which carried en croupe an immense pack covered with oiled canvas rising high enough to support his back while he blew a long horn to announce his arrival  letters were rare and very expensive articles unless franked by a member of parliament but gazettes and newsletters formed a large portion of his freight no private gentleman except the dean and sir george herries went to the extravagance of taking in a newspaper on his own account but there was a club who subscribed for the daily gazetteer the tatler and one or two other infant forms of periodical literature these were hastily skimmed on their first arrival at the clubroom at the white dragon lay on the table to be more deliberately conned for a week and finally were divided among the members to be handed about among the families and dependants as long as they would hold together  major delavie never willingly missed the coming of the mail for his foreign experiences gave him keen interest in the war between france and austria and he watched the campaigns of his beloved prince eugene with untiring enthusiasm being moreover in the flattering position of general interpreter and guide to his neighbours through the scanty articles on foreign intelligence  it was about ten days after the syllabub party when he had quite recovered his ordinary health that he mounted his stout pony in his military undress his cocked hat perched on his wellpowdered bobwig with a queue halfway down his dark green goldlaced coat and with his long jackboots carefully settle by palmer over the knee that would never cease to give him trouble  thus he slowly ambled into the town catching on his way distant toots of the postmans horn in due time he made his way into the high street broad and unpaved with rows of lime or poplar trees before the principal houses the most modern of which were of red brick with heavy sashwindows large stone quoins and steps up to the doors  the white dragon dating from the times of the mortimer badge was built of creamy stone and had an archway conducting the traveller into a courtyard worthy of chaucer with ranges of galleries running round it the balustrades of dark carved oak suiting with the timbers of the latticed window and gables and with the noble outside stair at one angle by which they communicated with one another to these beauties the good major was entirely insensible he only sighed at the trouble it gave his lame knee to mount the stair to the first storey and desired the execution of the landlords barbarous design of knocking down the street front to replace it with a plain oblong assembly room red brick outside and within blue plaster adorned with wreaths and bullocks faces in stucco  such were the sentiments of most of the burly squires who had ridden in on the same errand and throwing the reins to their grooms likewise climbed the stair to the clubroom with its oriel looking over the street there too were several of the cathedral clergy the rubicund doublechinned face of the canon in residence set off by a white cauliflower wig under a shovel hat while the humbler minor canons who served likewise as curates to all the country round only powdered their own hair and wore gowns and cassocks of quality very inferior to that which adorned the portly person of their superior his white bands were of fine cambric theirs of coarser linen his stockings were of ribbed silk theirs of black worsted his buckles of silver theirs of steel and the line of demarcation was as strongly marked as that between the neat deferential tradesman and the lawyer in his spruce snuffcoloured coat or the doctor as black in hue as the clergy though with a secular cut a smaller wig and a goldheaded cane each had as in duty bound ordered his pint of port or claret for the good of the house and it was well if these were not in the end greatly exceeded and some had lighted long clay pipes but these were mostly of the secondary rank who sat at the table farthest from the window and whose drink was a measure of ale  the letters had not yet been sorted but the newspaper had been brought in and the canon boltby had possessed himself of it and was proclaiming scraps of intelligence about the king queen and sir robert walpole the character of marshal berwick recently slain at philipsburg an account of spanish outrages at sea or mayhap the story of a marvelous beast halftiger halfwolf reported to be running wild in france the other gentlemen waiting till the mailbags were opened listened and commented while one or two of the squires and a shabby disreputablelooking minor canon made each notable name the occasion of a toast whether of health to his majestys friends or confusion to his foes a squabble as to whether the gallant berwick should be reckoned as an honest frenchman or as a traitor englishman was interrupted by the majors entrance and the congratulations on his recovery  one of the squires inquired after his daughters and pronounced the little one with the outlandish name was becoming a belle and would be the toast of the neighbourhood a hint of which the topers were not slow to take advantage while one of the guests at the recent party observed young belamour seemed to be of that opinion  may it be so said the canon that were a step to the undoing of a great wrong  mr scrivener will tell you sir that there was no justice in the eye of the law said the major  summum jus summa injuria quoted sotto voce mr arden a minor canon who being well born scholarly scientific and gentlemanly occupied a middle place between his colleagues and the grandees he was not listened to each knot of speakers was becoming louder in debate and dr boltbys voice was hardly heard when he announced that a rain of blood had fallen on the macgillicuddy mountains in ireland testified to by numerous respectable protestant witnesses and attributable either to the late comet or to the pretender  at that moment the letters were brought in by the postman and each recipient hadnot without murmursto produce his purse and pay heavily for them there were not many the doctor had two mr arden one mr scrivener no less than five but of them two were franked and a franked letter was likewise handed over to major delavie with the word aresfield written in the corner  from my lady said an unoccupied neighbour  aye aye said the major putting it into his pocket being by no means inclined to submit the letter to the general gaze  a good omen said canon boltby looking up from his paper and the major smiled in return put a word or two into the discussion on affairs and then as soon as he thought he could take leave without betraying anxiety he limped down stairs and called for his horse lady belamours letters were wont to be calls for money not easily answered and were never welcome sights and this hung heavy in the laced pocket of his coat  palmer met him at the back gate and took his horse but judged it advisable to put no questions about the news while his master made his way in by the kitchen entrance of the rambling old manor house and entered a stonepaved low room a sort of office or study where he received and paid money for my lady and smoked his pipe here he sat down in his wooden armchair spread forth his legs and took out the letter opening it with careful avoidance of defacing the large red seal covered with many quarterings and the delavie escutcheon of pretence reigning over all  it opened as he expected with replies to some matters about leases and repairs and then followed  i am informed that you have a large family and daughters growing up whom it is desirable to put in the way of making a good match or else an honourable livelihood i am therefore willing for the sake of our family connection to charge myself with your youngest girl whose name i understand to be aurelia i will cause her to be trained in useful works in my household expecting her in return to assist in the care and instruction of my young children and if she please me and prove herself worthy and attentive i will bestow her marriage upon some suitable person this is the more proper and convenient for you because your age and health are such that i may not long be able to retain you in the charge of my estatein which indeed you are continued only out of consideration of an extremely distant relationship although a younger and more active man bred to the profession would serve me far more profitably  when betty came into the room a few minutes later to pull off her fathers boots she found him sitting like one transfixed he held out the letter saying read that child  betty stood by the window and read only giving one start and muttering between her teeth insolent woman but not speaking the words aloud for she knew her father would treat them as treason he always had a certain tender deference for his cousin urania mixed with something akin to compunction as if his loyalty to his betrothed had been disloyalty to his family thus he exceeded the rest of his sex in blindness to the defects that had been so evident to his wife and daughter and whatever provocation might make him say of my lady himself he never permitted a word against her from any one else he looked wistfully at betty and said my little aura it is a kindly thought her son must have writ of the child but i had liefer she had asked me for the sight of my old eyes  the question is said betty in clear incisive tones whether we surrender aurelia or your situation  nay nay betty you always do my cousin less than justice she means well by the child and by us all come come say what is in your mind he add testily  am i at liberty to express myself sir  of course you are i had rather hear the whole discharge of your battery than see you looking constrained and satirical  then sir my conclusion is this the young baronet has shown himself smitten with out pretty aurelia and has spoken of tarrying on his return to make farther acquaintance my lady is afraid of his going to greater lengths and therefore wishes to have her at her disposal  she proposes to take her into her own family that is not taking her out of his way  i am sure of that  you are prejudiced like your poor dear motherthe best of women if only she could ever have done justice to her ladyship dont you see child aurelia would not be gone before his return supposing he should come this way  his visit was to be for six weeks did you not see the postscript  no the letter was enough for one while  here it is i shall send dove in the space of about a fortnight or three weeks to bring to town the young coach horses you mentioned his wife is to return with him as i have occasion for her in town and your daughter must be ready to come up with them  bless me that is prompt but it is thoughtful mrs dove is a good soul it seems to me as if my lady though she may not choose to say so wishes to see the child and if she approve of her breed her up in the accomplishments needed for such an elevation  if you hold that opinion dear sir it is well  if i thought she meant other than kindness toward the dear maid i had rather we all pinched together than risk the little one in her hands i had ratherif it comes to thatlive on a crust a day than part with my sweet child but if it were for good betty it is hard for you all three to be cooped up together here with no means of improving your condition and this may be an opening that i ought not to reject what say you betty  if i were to send her out into the world i had rather bind her apprentice to the misses rigby to learn mantuamaking  nay nay my dear so long as i live there is no need for my children to come to such straits  as long as you retain your situation sir but you perceive how my lady concludes her letter  an old song betty which she sings whenever the coin does not come in fast enough to content her she does not mean what she says i know urania of old no i will write back to her thanking her for her good offices but telling her my little girl is too young to be launched into the world as yet though if it were harriet she might not be unwilling  harriet would be transported at the idea but it is not she whom the lady wants and indeed i had rather trust little aurelia to take care of herself than poor harriet  we shall see we shall see meantime do not broach the subject to your sisters  betty assented and departed with a heavy heart feeling that whatever her father might believe the choice would be between the sacrifice of aurelia or of her fathers agency which would involve the loss of home of competence and of the power of breeding up her darling eugene according to his birth she did not even know what her father had written and could only go about her daily occupations like one under a weight listening to her sisters prattle about their little plans with a strange sense that everything was coming to an end and constantly weighing the comparative evils of yielding or refusing aurelia  no one would have more valiantly faced poverty than elizabeth delavie had she alone been concerned cavalier and jacobite blood was in her veins and her unselfish character had been trained by a staunch and selfdevoted mother but her fathers age and eugenes youth made her waver she might work her fingers to the bone and live on oatmeal to give her father the comforts he required but to have eugene brought down from his natural station was more than she could endure his welfare must be secured at the cost not only of aurelias sweet presence but of her happiness and betty durst not ask herself what more she dreaded knowing too that she would probably be quite incapable of altering her fathers determination whatever it might be and that he was inclined to trust lady belamour the only chance of his refusal was that he should take alarm at the manner of requiring his daughter from him     chapter v the summons       but when the king knew that the thing must be     and that no help there was in this distress     he bade them have all things in readiness     to take the maiden outmorris   the second sunday of suspense had come the sundays of good young ladies little resembled those of a century later though they were not devoid of a calm peacefulness worthy of the sweet day so cool so calm so bright the inhabited rooms of the old house looked bright and festal there were fresh flowers in the pots honey as well as butter on the breakfast table the major and palmer were both in full uniform wonderfully preserved eugene a marvel of prettiness with his curled hair and little velvet coat contrived by his sisters out of some ancestral hoard betty wore thick silk brocade from the same store harriet a fresh gay chintz over a crimson skirt and aurelia was in spotless white with a broad blue sash and blue ribbons in her hat for her father liked to see her still a child so her hair was only tied with blue while that of her sisters was rolled over a cushion and slightly powdered  the church was so near that the major could walk thither leaning on his stout crutchhandled stick and aided by his daughters arm as he proceeded down the hawthorn lane sweet with the breath of may exchanging greetings with whole families of the poor the fathers in smock frocks wrought with curious needlework on the breast and back the mothers in highcrowned hats and stout dark blue woollen gowns the children either patched or ragged and generally barefooted but by no means illfed  no sunday school had been invented the dame who hobbled along in spectacles dropping a low curtsey to the quality taught the hornbook and the primer to a select few of the progeny of the farmers and artisans and the young ladies would no more have thought of assisting her labours than the blacksmiths they only clubbed their pocket money to clothe and pay the schooling of one little orphan who acknowledged them by a succession of the lowest bobs as she trotted past proud as margery twoshoes herself of the distinction of being substantially shod  the church was small and with few pretensions to architecture at the best it had been nearly a ruin when stirred by the major the churchwardens had taken it in hand so that owing to richard stokes and john ball as they permanently declared in yellow letters on a blue ground the congregation were no longer in danger of the roof admitting the rain or coming down on the congregation they had further beautified the place with a huge board of the royal arms and with moses and aaron in white cauliflower wigs presiding over the tables of the commandments four long dark timber pews and numerous benches ruthlessly constructed out of old carvings occupied the aisle and the chancel was more than half filled with the lofty closet of the great house family hither the delavie family betook themselves and on her way betty was startled by the recognition in the seat reserved for the servants of a broad back and curled wig that could belong to no one but jonah dove she did her utmost to keep her mind from dwelling on what this might portend though she followed the universal custom by exchanging nods and curtsies with the duckworth family as she sailed up the aisle at the head of the little procession  there was always a little doubt as to who would serve the church one of the canons was the incumbent and the curate was mr arden the scientific minor canon but when his services were required at the cathedral one of his colleagues would supply his place usually in a sadly perfunctory manner however he was there in person as his voice a clear and pleasant one showed the denizens of the closet for they could not see out of it except where eugene had furtively enlarged a motheaten hole in the curtain through which when standing on the seat he could enjoy an oblique view of the back of an ironmoulded surplice and a very illpowdered wig this was a comfort to him it would have been more satisfactory to have been able to make out whence came the stentorian amen that responded to the parson totally unaccompanied save by the good major who always read his part almost as loud as the clerk from a great octavo prayerbook bearing on the lid the delavie arms with coronet supporters and motto ma vie et ma mie it would have been thought unladylike if not unscriptural to open the lips in church yet for all her silence good betty was striving to be devout and attentive praying earnestly for her little sisters safety and hailing as a kind of hopeful augury this verse from the singers                    at home abroad in peace in war                     thy god shall thee defend                   conduct thee through lifes pilgrimage                     safe to the journeys end   much cannot be said for the five voices that sang nor for the two fiddles that accompanied them eugene had scarcely outgrown his terror at the strains and still required aurelia to hold his hand under pretext of helping him to follow the words not an easy thing since the last lines were always repeated three or four times  somehow the repetition brought them the more home to bettys heart and they rang consolingly in her ears all through the sermon of which she took in so little that she never found out that it was an elaborate exposition of the newtonian philosophy including mr ardens views of the miracle at the battle bethhoron in the lesson for the day  the red face and belamour livery looked doubly ominous when she came out of church but she had to give her arm to her father till they were overtaken by mr arden who always shared the sunday roast beef and plum pudding betty feared it was the best meal he had in the week for he lived in lodgings and his landlady was not too careful of his comforts while he was wrapped up in his books and experiments there was a hole singed in the corner of his black gown which eugene pointed out with great awe to aurelia as they walked behind him  see there aura dont you think he has been raising spirits like friar bacon  what do you know about friar bacon asked harriet  he is in a little book that i bought of the pedlar he had a brazen head that said                          time is                          time was                          time will be  i wonder if mr arden would show me one like it  you ridiculous little fellow to believe such trash said harriet  but hatty he can really light a candle without a tinderbox said eugene his landlady told palmer so and palmer says the devil flew away with friar bacon but my book says he burnt all his books and gave himself to the study of divinity and dug his grave with his own nails  little boys should not talk of such things on sundays said harriet severely  one does talk of the devil on sunday for he is in the catechism returned eugene if he carries mr arden off do you think there will be a great smoke and that folk will see it  aurelias silvery peal of laughter fell sadly upon bettys ears in front and her father and mr arden turned to ask what made them so merry aurelia blushed in embarrassment but harriet was ready  you will think us very rude sir but my little brother has been reading the life of friar bacon and he thinks you an equally great philosopher  indeed my little master you do me too much honour you will soon be a philosopher yourself i did not expect so much attention in so young an auditor said mr arden thinking this the effect of his sermon on the solar system  whereupon eugene begged to inspect the grave he was digging with his own nails  they were at home by this time and betty was aware that they had been followed at a respectful distance by palmer and the coachman anxious as she was she could not bear that her fathers dinner should be spoilt or that he in his openhearted way should broach the matter with mr arden so she repaired to the garden gate and on being told that mr dove had a packet from my lady for the major she politely invited him to dinner with the servants and promised that her father should see him afterwards  this gave a long respite since the servants had the reversion of the beef so the mr arden had taken leave and gone to see a bedridden pauper and the major had time for his forty winks while betty though her heart throbbed hard beneath her tightlylaced boddice composed herself to hear eugenes catechism and the two sisters each with a good book slipped out to the honeysuckle arbour in the garden behind the house harriet had sherlock in death her regular sunday study though she never got any further than the apparition of mrs veal over which she gloated in a dreamy state aurelias study was a darkcovered palelettered copy of the ikon basilike with the strange attraction that youth has to pain and sorrow and sat musing over the resigned outpourings of the perplexed and persecuted king with her bright eyes fixed on the deep blue sky and the honeysuckle blossoms gently waving against it now and then visited by bee or butterfly while through the silence came the throbbing notes of the nightingale followed by its jubilant burst of glee and the sweet distant chime of the cathedral bells rose and fell upon the wind what peace and repose there was in all the air even in the gentle breeze and the floating motions of the swallows skimming past  the stillness was first broken by the jangle of their own little church bell for mr arden was a more than usually diligent minister and always gave two services when he was not in course at the cathedral the young ladies always attended both but as harriet and aurelia crossed the lawn their brother ran to meet them saying we are not to wait for sister  i hope my papa is well said aurelia  oh yes said eugene but the man in the goldlaced hat has been speaking with him palmer says it is mrs doves husband and he is going to take lively tom and brown bet and the two other colts to london he asked if i should like to ride acockhorse there with him dearly i said and then he laughed and said it was not my turn but he should take miss aurelia instead  aurelia laughed and harriet said extremely impudent  little she guessed what betty was at that moment reading  i am astonished wrote lady belamour to her cousin that you should decline so highly advantageous an offer for your daughter i can only understand it as a token that you desire no further connection with nor favour from me and i shall therefore require of you to give up the accounts and vacate the house by michaelmas next ensuing however as i am willing to allow some excuse for the weakness of parental affection if you change your mind within the next week and send up your daughter with dove and his wife i will overlook your first hasty and foolish refusal ungrateful as it was and will receive your daughter and give her all the advantages i promised otherwise your employment is at an end and you had better prepare your accounts for hargraves inspection  there is no help for it then said betty  and if it be for the childs advantage we need not make our moan said her father tis like losing the daylight out of our house but we must not stand in the way of her good  if i were only sure it is for her good  why child theres scarce a wench in the county who would not go down on her knees for such a chance see what madam duckworth would say to it for miss peggy  betty said no more the result of her cogitations had been that since aurelia must be yielded for the sake of her father and eugene it was better not to disturb him with fears which would only anger him at the moment and disquiet him afterwards she was likewise reassured by mrs doves going with her since that good woman had been nurse to the little belamour cousins now deceased and was well known as an excellent and trustworthy person so that if she were going to act in the same capacity to my ladys second family aurelia would have a friend at hand so the major cheated his grief by greeting the churchgoers with the hilarious announcement  heres great news what says my little aura to going london to my ladys house  o sir are you about to take us  not i my lady wants pretty young maidens not battered old soldiers  nor my sisters o then if you please sir i would rather not go  silly children cannot choose no no aura you must go out and see the world and come back to us such a belle that your poor old father will scarce know you  i do not wish to be a belle said the girl o sir let me stay with you and sister  do not be so foolish aura put in harriet it will be the making of you i wish i had the offer  o harriet could not you go instead  no aurelia said betty there is no choice and you must be a good girl and not vex my father  the gravity of her eldest sister convinced aurelia that entreaties would be vain and there was soon a general outburst of assurances that she would see all that was delightful in london the lions in the tower the new st pauls the monuments ranelagh the court ladies may be the king and queen themselves until she began to feel exhilarated and pleased at the prospect and the distinction  then came monday and the bustle of preparing her wardrobe the main body of it was to be sent in the carriers waggon for she was to ride on a pillion behind mr dove and could only take a valise upon a grooms horse there was no small excitement in the arrangement and in the farewells to the neighbours who all agreed with harriet in congratulating the girl on her promotion betty did her part with all her might washed lace and trimmed sleeves and made tuckers giving little toilette counsels while her heart ached sorely all the time  when she could speak to mrs dove alone she earnestly besought that old friend to look after the child her health her dress and above all to supply here lack of experience and give her kind counsel and advice  i will indeed maam as though she were my own promised mrs dove  o nurse i give my sweet jewel to your care you know what a great house in london is better than i do you will warn her of any danger  i will do my endeavour maam we servants see and hear much and if any harm should come nigh the sweet young miss ill do my best for her  thank you nurse i shall never never see her more in her free artless childishness said betty sobbing as if her heart would break but oh nurse i can bear the thought better since i have known that you would be near her  and at night when her darling nestled for the last time in her arms the elder sister whispered her warnings her knowledge of the great world was limited but she believed it to be a very wicked place and she profoundly distrusted her brilliant kinswoman yet her warnings took no shape more definite thanmy dearest sister will never forget her prayers nor her bible there was a soft response and fresh embrace at each pause nor play cards of a sunday nor ever play high and my aura must be deaf to rakish young beaux and their compliments they never mean well by poor pretty maids if you believe them they will only mock flout and jeer you in the end and if the young baronet should seek converse with you promise me oh promise me aurelia to grant him no favour no not so much as to hand him a flower or stand chatting with him unknown to his mother promise me again child for naught save evil can come of any trifling between you and aurelia go to nurse dove in all your difficulties she can advise you where your poor sister cannot it will ease my heart if i know that my child will attend to her you will not let yourself be puffed up with flattery nor be offended if she be open and round with you think that your poor sister betty speaks in her pray our old prayers go to church and read your psalms and lessons daily and oh never never cheat your conscience o may god in his mercy keep my darling  so aurelia cried herself to sleep while betty lay awake till the early hour in the morning when all had to be prepared for the start there was to be a ride of an hour and a half before breakfast so as to give the horses a rest it was a terrible separation in many respects more complete than if aurelia had been going in these days to america for communication by letter was almost as slow and infinitely more expensive  no doubt the full import of what he had done had dawned even on major delavie during the watches of that last sorrowful night for he came out a pale haggard man looking as if his age had doubled since he went to bed wrapped in his dressing gown his head covered with his nightcap and leaning heavily on his staff he came charged with one of the long solemn discourses which parents were wont to bestow on their children as valedictions but when aurelia in her camlet riding cloak and hood brought her tearstained face to crave his blessing he could only utter broken fragments bless thee my child take heed to yourself and your ways it is a bad world beset with temptations oh heaven forgive me for sending my innocent lamb out into it oh what would your blessed mother say  dear sir said betty who had wept out her tears and was steadily composed now this is no time to think of that we must only cheer up our darling and give her good counsel if she keep to what her bible her catechism and her conscience tell her she will be a good girl and god will protect her  true true your sister is right aura my little sweetheart i had much to say to you but it is all driven out of my poor old head  aura aura the horses are coming ten of them shouted eugene come along oh if i were but going how silly of you to cry i dont  there there go my child and god in his mercy protect you  aurelia in speechless grief passed from the arms of one sister to the embrace of the other hugged eugene was kissed by nannerl who forced a great piece of cake into her little bag and finally was lifted to her pillion cushion by palmer who stole a kiss of her hand before dove put his horse in motion while betty was still commending her sister to his wifes care and receiving reiterated promises of care     chapter vi disappointed love       i know thee well thy songs and sighs        a wicked god thou art     and yet most pleasing to the eyes        and witching to the heart                              w mackworth praed   the house was dull when aurelia was gone her father was ill at ease and therefore testy betty too sore at heart to endure as cheerfully as usual his unwonted illhumour harriet was petulant and eugene troublesome and the two were constantly jarring against one another since the one missed her companion the other his playmate and they were all more sensible than ever how precious and charming an element was lost to the family circle  on the next ensuing sunday eugene had made himself extremely obnoxious to harriet by persisting in kicking up the dust and betty who had gone on before with her father was availing herself of the shelter of the great pew to brush with a sharp hand the dust from the little legs when even in the depths of their seclusion the whole party were conscious of a sort of breathless sound of surprise and admiration a sweep of bows and curtsies and the measured tread of boots and clank of sword and spurs coming neareryes to the very chancel their very door was opened by the old clerk with the most obsequious of reverences and there entered a gorgeous vision of scarlet and gold bowing gracefully with a wave of a cocked and plumed hat  the major started and was moving out of his cornerthe seat of honourbut the stranger forbade this by another gesture and took his place after standing for a moment with his face hidden in his hat then he took an anxious survey not without an almost imperceptible elevation of eyebrow and shoulder as if disappointed and accepted the prayerbook which the major offered him  betty kept her eyes glued to her book and when that was not in use upon the mittened hands crossed before her resolute against distraction and every prayer turning into a petition for her sisters welfare but eugene gazed openeyed and openmouthed oblivious of his beloved hole and harriet though keeping her lids down and her book open contrived to make a full inspection of the splendid apparition  it was tall and slight youthfully undeveloped yet with the grace of personal symmetry high breeding and military training upright without stiffness with a command and dexterity of movement which prevented the sword and spurs from being the annoyance to his pewmates that country awkwardness usually made these appendages the spurs were on cavalry boots guarding the knee and met by white buckskins both so little dusty that there could have been no journey that morning the bright goldlaced scarlet coat of the household troops entirely effaced the majors old austrian uniform and over it the hair of a light golden brown was brushed back tied with black ribbon and hung down far behind in a queue only leaving little gold rings curling on the brow and temples the face was modelled like a cameo faultless in the outlines with a round peachlike fresh contour and bloom on the fair cheek which had much of the child though with a firmness in the lip and strength in the brow that promised manliness indeed there was a wonderful blending of the beauty of manhood and childhood about the youth and his demeanour was perfectly decorous and reverent no small merit in a young officer and london beau indeed betty could almost have forgotten his presence if gleams from his glittering equipments had not kept glancing before her eyes turn them where she would and if mr ardens sermon had not been of solomons extent of natural philosophy and so full of hebrew greek and latin that she could not follow it at all  after the blessing the young gentleman with a bow the pink of courtesy offered a hand to lead her out nor could she refuse though to use her own expression she hated the absurdity of mincing down the aisle with a fine young spark looking like her grandson while her poor father had to put up with harriets arm outside came the greetings the flourish of the hat the i may venture to introduce myself and to beg of you sir and of my fair cousins to excuse my sudden intrusion  no apology can be needed for your appearance in your own pew sir amyas said the major with outstretched hand it did my heart good to see you there  i would not have taken you thus by surprise continued the youth but one of my horses lost a shoe yesterday and we were constrained to halt at portkiln for the night and ride on this morning herries went on to the deanery and i hoped to have seen you before church but found you had already entered  portkiln was so near that this sabbath days journey did not scandalise betty and her father eagerly welcomed his kinsman and insisted that he should go no farther sir amyas accepted the invitation nothing loth only asking with a little courtly diffidence if it might not be convenient for him to sleep at the great house and begging the ladies to excuse his riding dress  his eyes wandered anxiously as though in search of something in the midst of all his civility and while the major was sending eugene to bring mr ardenwho was hanging back at the churchyard gate unwilling to thrust himself forwardthe faltering question was put while the cheeks coloured like a girls i hope my fair partner my youngest cousin miss aurelia delavie is in good health  we hope so sir thank you returned betty but she left us six days ago  left you he repeated in consternation that overpowered his courtliness  yes sir said harriet my lady your mother has been good enough to send for her to london  my lady he murmured to himself i never thought of that how and when did she go  the answer was interrupted by the major coming up sir amyas belamour permit me to present to you the reverend richard arden the admirable divine to whom we are beholden for the excellent and learned discourse of this morning youll not find such another scholar in all carminster  i am highly honoured returned the baronet with a bow in return for mr ardens best obeisance such as it was and harriet seeing peggy duckworth in the distance plumed herself on her probable envy  before dinner was served sir amyas had obtained the information as to aurelias departure and even as to the road she had taken and he had confessed that of course he had write to his mother that he had danced with the most exquisitely beautiful creature he had ever seen and that he longed to know his cousins better no doubt his mother having been thus reminded of her connections had taken the opportunity of summoning aurelia to london to give her the advantages of living in her household and acquiring accomplishments the lad was so much delighted at the prospect of enjoying her society that he was almost consoled for not finding her at the manor house and his elaborate courtesy became every moment less artificial and more affectionate as the friendly atmosphere revealed that the frankness and simplicity of the boy had not been lost captain in the dragoon guards as he was thanks to interest though he had scarcely yet joined his troop he had been with a tutor in the country until two years ago when his stepfather mr wayland had taken him still with his tutor on the expedition to the mediterranean he had come home from gibraltar and joined his regiment only a few weeks before setting out with his friend captain herries to visit battlefield lady aresfields estate in monmouthshire he was quartered in the whitehall barracks but could spend as much time as he pleased at his mothers house in hanover square  bettys mind misgave her as she saw the brightening eye with which he said it but she could not but like the youth himself he was so bright unspoilt and engaging that she could not think him capable of doing wilful wrong to her darling yet how soon would the young soldier plunged into the midst of fashionable society learn to look on the fair girl with the dissipated eyes of his associates there was some comfort in finding that mr wayland was expected to return in less than a year and that his stepson seemed to regard him with unbounded respect as a good just and wise man capable of everything indeed sir amyas enlightened mr arden on the scientific construction of some of mr waylands inventions so as to convince both the clergyman and the soldier that the lad himself was no fool and had profited by his opportunities  major delavie produced his choice tokay a present from an old hungarian brotherofficer and looked happier than since aurelias departure he was no matchmaker and speculated on no improbable contingencies for his daughter but he beheld good hopes for the delavie property and tenants in an heir such as this and made over his simple loyal heart to the young man presently he inquired whether the unfortunate mr belamour still maintained his seclusion  yes sir was the reply he still lives in two dark rooms with shutters and curtains excluding every ray of light he keeps his bed for the greater part of the day but sometimes on a very dark night will take a turn on the terrace  poor gentleman said betty has he no employment or occupation  mr wayland contrived a raised chess and draught board and persuaded him to try a few games before we went abroad but i do not know whether he has since continued it  does he admit any visits  oh no he has been entirely shut up except from the lawyer hargrave on business mr wayland indeed strove to rouse him from his despondency but without success except that latterly he became willing to receive him  have you ever conversed with him  there was an ingenuous blush as the young man replied i fear i must confess myself remiss mr wayland has sometimes carried me with him to see my uncle but not with my good will and my mother objected lest it should break my spirits however when i left gibraltar my good father charged me to endeavour from time to time to enliven my uncles solitude but there were impediments to my going to him and i take shame to myself for not having striven to overcome them  rightly spoken my young kinsman cried the major there are no such impediments as a mans own distaste  and pity will remove that said betty  soon after the removal of the cloth the ladies withdrew and eugene was called to his catechism but he was soon released for the tokay had made her father sleepy while it seemed to have emboldened mr arden since he came forth with direct intent to engross harriet and sir amyas wandered towards betty apologising for the interruption  it is a rare occasion said she as her pupil scampered away  happy child to be taught by so good a sister said the young baronet regretfully  your young halfbrothers and sisters must be of about the same age said betty  my little brother archer is somewhat younger he is with my mother in london the darling of the ladies who think him a perfect beauty and laugh at all his mischievous pranks as to my little sisters you will be surprised to hear that i have only seen them once when i rode with their father to see them at the farm houses at which they are nursed  no doubt they are to be fetched home since mrs dove is gone to wait on them and my lady said something of intending my sister to be with her young children  nay she must have no such troublesome charge my mother cannot intend anything of the kind i shall see that she is treated as  betty beginning to perceive that he knew as little of his own mother as did the rest of his sex here interrupted him excuse me sir i doubt not of your kind intentions but let me speak for aurelia is a very precious child to me and i am afraid that any such attempt on your part might do her harm rather than good she must be content with the lot of a poor dependant  never he exclaimed she is a delavie and besides no other ever shall be my wife  hush hush betty had been saying before the words were out of his you are but a silly boy begging your honours pardon though you speak i know with all your heart what would your lady mother say or do to my poor little sister if she heard you  she could but send her home and then flood and fire could not hold me from her  i wish that were the worst she could do no sir amyas belamour if you have any kindness for the poor helpless girl under your mothers roof you will make no advance to excite alarm or anger against her remember it is she who will be the sufferer and not yourself the woman however guiltless is sure to fall under suspicion and bear the whole penalty and oh what would become of her defenceless simple unprotected as she is  yet you sent her said he  yes said betty sadly because there was no other choice between breaking with my lady altogether  he made an ejaculation under his breath half sad half violent and exclaimed would that i were of age or my father were returned  but now you know all you will leave my child in peace said betty  what you would give me no hope  only such as you yourself have held out said betty when you are your own master if you keep in the same mind till then and remain truly worthy i cannot tell what my father would answer  i am going to speak to him this very day i came with that intent  do no such thing i entreat cried betty he would immediately think it his duty to inform my lady then no protestation would persuade her that we had not entrapped your youth and innocence his grey head would be driven out without shelter and what might not be the consequence to my sister you could not help us and could only make it worse no do nothing rash incautious or above all disobedient it would be selflove not true love that would risk bringing her into peril and trouble when she is far out of reach of all protection  trust me trust me cousin betty cried the youth only let me hope and ill be caution itself but oh what an endless eternity is two years to wait without a sign  but here appeared the major accompanied by captain herries and dean churchill who had ordered out his coach sunday though it were to pay his respects to my ladys son and carry him and his hosts back to sup at the deanery it was an age of adulation but betty was thankful that perilous conversations were staved off     chapter vii all alone       by the simplicity of venus doves                                  merchant of venice   that sunday was spent by aurelia at the bear inn at reading her journey had been made by very short stages one before breakfast another lasting till noon when there was a long halt for dinner and rest for horse and rider and then another ride never even in these longest summer days prolonged beyond six or seven oclock at latest such was the danger of highwaymen being attracted by the valuable horses although the grooms in charge were so well armed that they might almost as well have been troopers  the roads at that time of year were at their best and aurelia and mrs dove were mounted on steady old nags accustomed to pillions aurelia could have ridden single but this would not have been thought fitting on a journey with no escort of her own rank and when she mounted she was far too miserable to care for anything but hiding her tearful face behind mr doves broad shoulders mrs dove was perched behind a wiry lightweighted old groom whom she kept in great order much to his disgust  after the first wretchedness aurelias youthful spirits had begun to revive and the novel scenes to awaken interest the glastonbury thorn was the first thing she really looked at the abbey was to her only an old gothic melancholy ruin not worthy of a glance but the breezy air of the cheddar hills the lovely cliffs and the charm of the open country with its strange islands of hills dotted about raised her spirits as she rode through the meadows where hay was being tossed and the scent came fragrant on the breeze mr dove would tell her over his shoulder the names of places and their owners when they came to parks bordering the road and castles bosomed high in the tufted trees or he would regale her with legends of robberies and point to the frightful gibbets one so near to the road that she shut her eyes and crouched low behind him to avoid seeing the terrible burthen she had noted the white horse and shuddered at the monument at devizes commemorating the judgment on the lying woman and a night had been spent at marlborough that miss might see a strolling company of actors perform in a barn but as the piece was the yorksire tragedy the ghastly performance overcame her so completely that mrs dove had to take her away declaring that no inducement should ever take her to a theatre again  mr dove was too experienced a traveller not to choose well his quarters for the night and aurelia slept in the guest chambers shining with cleanliness and scented with lavender mrs dove always sharing her room miss was treated with no small regard as a lady of the good old blood and though the coachman and his wife talked freely with her they paid her all observance never ate at the same table and provided assiduously for her comfort and pleasure once they halted a whole day because even mr dove was not proof against the allurements of a bullbaiting though he carefully explained that he only made a concession to the grooms to prevent them from getting discontented and went himself to the spectacle to hinder them from getting drunk in which be it observed he did not succeed  so much time was spent on thus creeping from stage to stage that aurelia had begun to feel as if the journey had been going on for ages and as if worlds divided her from her home when on sunday she timidly preceded mrs dove into reading abbey church and afterwards was shown where rolled father thames the travellers took early morning with them for maidenhead thicket and breakfasted on broiled trout at the kings arms at maidenhead bridge while aurelia felt her eye filled with the beauty of the broad glassy river and the wooded banks and then rose onwards looking with loyal awe at majestic windsor where the flag was flying they slept at a poor little inn a longford rather than cross hounslow heath in the evening and there heard all the last achievements of the thieves so that aurelia in crossing the next day looked to see a masked highwayman start out of every bush but they came safely to the broad archway of the inn at knightsbridge their last stage mrs dove took her charge up stairs at once to refresh her toilette before entering london and being presented to my lady  but a clattering and stamping were heard in the yard and aurelia looking from the window called mrs dove to see four horses being harnessed to a coach that was standing there  lawkaday cried the good woman if it be not our own old coach as was the best in poor sir jovians time ay there be our colours you see blue and gold and my ladys quartering why twas atop of that very blue hammercloth that i first set eyes on my dove so my lady has sent to meet you missie well i do take it kind of her now you will not come in your riding hood all frowsed and dusty but can put on your pretty striped sacque and blue hood that you wore on sunday and look the sweet pretty lady you are  mrs doves intentions were frustrated for the maid of the inn knocked at the door with a message that the coach had orders not to wait but that miss was to come down immediately  dear dear sighed mrs dove tell the jackanapes not to be so hasty he must give the young lady time to change her dress and eat a mouthful  this brought dove up to the door never mind dressing and fallals he said this is a strange fellow that says he is hired for the job and his orders are precise miss must take a bit of cake in her hand come dame you have not lived so long in my ladys service as to forget what it is to cross her will or keep her waiting  therewith he hurried aurelia down stairs his wife being in such a state of deshabille that she could not follow he handed the young lady into the carriage gave her a parcel of slices of bread and meat with a piece of cake shut the door and said be of good heart missie well catch you up by the time you are in the square all right  off went aurelia in solitude within a large carriage once gaily fitted though now somewhat faded and tarnished she was sorry to be parted from the doves whom she wanted to give her courage for the introduction to my lady and to explain to her the wonders of the streets of london which she did not quite expect to see paved with gold she ate her extemporised meal gazing from the window and expecting to see houses and churches thicken on her and hurrying to brush away her crumbs and put on her gloves lest she should arrive unawares for she had counted halfadozen houses close together no here was another field more fields and houses the signs of habitation were so far from increasing growing more scanty and looked strangely like what she had before passed could this be the right road how foolish to doubt when this was my ladys own coach but oh that it had waited for mrs dove she would beg her to get in when the riders overtook her when would they no sign of them could be seen from the windows and here were more houses surely this was turnham green again or there must be another village green exactly like it in the heart of london how many times did not poor aurelia go through all these impressions in the course of the drive she was absolutely certain that she was taken through brentford again this time without a halt but after this the country became unknown to her and the road much worse it was in fact for the most part a mere ditch or cart track so rough that the four horses came to a walk aurelia had read no novels but telemaque and le grand cyrus so her imagination was not terrified by tales of abduction but alarm began to grow upon her she much longed to ask the coachman whither he was taking her but the check string had been either worn out or removed she could not open the door from within nor make him hear and indeed she was a little afraid of him  twilight began to come on it was much later than mr dove had ever ventured to be out but here at last there was a pause and the swing of a gate the road was smoother and she seemed to be in a wood probably private ground on and on for an apparently interminable time went the coach with the wearied and affrighted girl through the dark thicket until at last she emerged into a park where she could again see the pale afterglow of the sunset and presently she found herself before a tall house perfectly dark with strange fantastic gables and chimneys ascending far above against the sky  all was still as death except the murmuring caws of the rooks in their nests and the chattering shriek of a startled blackbird the servant from behind ran up the steps and thundered at the door it was opened a broad line of light shone out some figures appeared and a man in livery came forward to open the carriage door but to aurelias inexpressible horror his face was perfectly black with negro features rolling eyes and great white teeth  she hardly knew what she did the dark carriage was formidable on one side the apparition on the other the only ray of comfort was in the face of a stout comely rosy maidservant who was holding the candle on the threshold and with one bound the poor traveller dashed past the black hand held out to help her and rushing up to the girl caught hold of her and gasped out oh what is that where am i where have they taken me  lawk maam said the girl with a broad grin that ere bees only mr jumbo a wont hurtee see heres mistress aylward  a tall whitecapped blackgowned elderly woman turned on the newcomer a pale grave unsmiling face saying your servantmiss aurelia delavie as i understand  bending her head and scarcely able to steady herself for she was shaking from head to foot aurelia managed to utter the query  where am i  at bowstead park madam by order of my lady  much relieved and knowing this was the belamour estate aurelia said please let me wait till mrs dove comes before i am presented to my lady  my lady is not here madam said mrs aylward allow me and she led the way across a great empty hall that seemed the vaster for its obscurity then along a matted passage and down some steps into a room surrounded with presses and cupboards evidently belonging to the to the housekeeper she set a chair for the trembling girl saying you will excuse the having supper here tonight madam the south parlour will be ready for you tomorrow  is not mrs dove coming faintly asked aurelia  mrs dove is gone to london to attend on little master wayland you are to be here with the young ladies maam  what young ladies asked the bewildered maiden  my ladys little daughtersthe misses wayland i thought she had sent you her instructions but i see you are over wearied and daunted she added more kindly you will be better when you have taken some food molly i say you sluggard of a wench bring the ladys supper and dont stand gaping there  mrs aylward hurried away to hasten operations and aurelia began somewhat to recover her senses though she was still so much dismayed that she dreaded to look up lest she should see something frightful and started at the first approach of steps  a dainty little supper was placed before her but she was too faint and sick at heart for appetite and would have excused herself however mrs aylward severely said she would have no such folly filled a glass of wine and sternly administered it then setting her down in a large chair helped her to a delicate cutlet she ate for very fright but her cheeks and eyes were brightened the mists of terror and exhaustion began to clear away and when she accepted a second help she had felt herself reassured that she had not fallen into unkindly hands if she could only have met a smile she would have been easier but mrs aylward was a woman of sedate countenance and few words and the straight set line of lips encouraged no questioning so she merely uttered thanks for each act of hospitality  there you will take no more roll you are better now but you will not be sorry to go to your bed said mrs aylward taking up a candle and guiding her along the passage up a long stair to a pretty room wainscoted and curtained with fresh white dimity and the window showing the young moon pale in the light of the western sky  bedrooms were little furnished and this was more luxurious than the dear old chamber at home but the girl had never before slept alone and she felt unspeakably lonely in the dreariness longing more than ever for bettys kisseven for bettys blameor for a whine from harriet and she positively hungered for a hug from eugene as she gazed timidly at the corners beyond the influence of her candle and instead of unpacking the little riding mail she kissed it and laid her cheek on it as the only thing that came from home and burst into a flood of despairing tears  in the midst there fell on her ears a low strain of melancholy music rising and falling like the wailing of mournful spirits she sprang to her feet and stood listening with dilated eyes then as a louder note reached her in terror uncontrollable she caught up her candle rushed down the stairs like a wild bird and stood panting before mrs aylward who had a big bible open on the table before her  oh maam she cried between her panting sobs i cant stay there i shall die  what means this madam said mrs aylward stiffly making the word sound much like foolish child  thethe music she managed faintly to utter falling again into the friendly chair  the music said mrs aylward considering then with a shade of polite contempt o jumbos fiddle i did not know it could be heard in your room but no doubt the windows below are open  is jumbo that black man asked aurelia shuddering for negro servants though the fashion in town had not penetrated into the west  mr belamours blackamoor he often plays to him half the night  oh with another quivering sound of alarm is mr belamour the gentleman in the dark  even so madam but you need have no fears he keeps his room and admits no one though he sometimes walks out by night you will only have to keep the children from a noise making near his apartments good night madam  oh pray if i do not disturb you would you be pleased to let me stay till you have finished your chapter i might not be so frightened then  in common humanity mrs aylward could not refuse and aurelia sat silently grasping the arms of her chair and trying to derive all the comfort she could from the presence of a bible and a good woman her nerves were in fact calmed by the interval and when mrs aylward took off her spectacles and shut up her book it had become possible to endure the terrors of the lonely chamber     chapter viii the enchanted castle       a little she began to lose her fearmorris   aurelia slept till she was wakened by a bounce at the door and the rattling of the lock but it was a little childs voice that was crying i will i will i will go in and seem by cousin  then came mrs aylwards severe voice no miss you are not to waken your cousin come away where is that slut jenny  then there was a scuffle and a howl as if the child were being forcibly carried away aurelia sprang out of bed for sunshine was flooding the room and she felt accountable for tardiness she had made some progress in dressing when again little hands were on the lock little feet kicking the door and little voices calling let me in  she opened the door and white nightgowns all tumbled back one over the other  my little cousins she said come and kiss me  one came forward and lifted up a sweet little pale face but the other two stood each with a finger in the mouth right across the threshold in a manner highly inconvenient to aurelia who was only in her stiff stays and dimity petticoat with a mass of hair hanging down below her waist she turned to them with arms outstretched but this put them instantly to the rout and they ran off as fast as their bare pink feet could carry them till one stumbled and lay with her face down and her plump legs kicking in the air aurelia caught her up but the capture produced a powerful yell and out all at once hurried into the corridor mrs aylward a tidy maid servant a stout buxom countrywoman and a rough girl scarcely out of bed but awake enough to snatch the child out of the young ladys arms and carry her off the housekeeper began scolding vigorously all round and aurelia escaped into her room where she completed her toilette looking out into a garden below laid out in the formal dutch fashion with walks and beds centring in a fountain the grass plats as sharply defined as possible and stiff yews and cypresses dotted at regular intervals or forming straight alleys she felt strange and shy but the sunshine the cheerfulness and the sight of the children had reassured her and when she had said her morning prayer she had lost the last nights sense of hopeless dreariness and unprotectedness when another knock came she opened the door cheerfully but there was a chill in meeting mrs aylwards grave cold face and stiff salutation if you are ready madam she said i will show you to the south parlour where the children will eat with you  aurelia ventured to ask about her baggage and was told that it would be forwarded from brentford mrs aylward then led the way to a wide stone staircase with handsome carved balusters leading down into the great hall with doors opening from all sides all was perfectly empty and so still that the sweep of the dresses and the tap of the heels made an echo and the sunshine streaming in at the large window marked out every one upon the floor in light and shadow and exactly repeated the brownshaded yellowframed medallions of painted glass upon the pavement there was something awful and oppressive in the entire absence of all tokens of habitation among those many closed doors  one however at the foot of the stairs was opened by mrs aylward it led to a sort of narrow lobby with a sashed window above a low door opening on stone steps down to the terrace and garden to the right was an open door giving admittance to a room hung with tapestry with a small carpet in the centre of the floor and a table prepared for the morning meal there was a certain cheerfulness about it though it was bare of furniture but there was an easy chair a settee a long couch a spinnet and an embroidery frame so that altogether it had capabilities of being lived in  here you will sit madam with the young ladies said mrs aylward they have a maidservant who will wait on you and if you require anything you will be pleased to speak to me my lady wishes you to take charge of them and likewise to execute the piece of embroidery you will find in that frame with the materials this will be your apartment and you can take the young ladies into the garden and park wherever you please except that they must not make a noise before the windows of the other wing which you will see closed with shutters for those are mr belamours rooms  with these words mrs aylward curtsied as if about to retire aurelia held out her hand in entreaty oh cannot you stay with me  no madam my office is the housekeepers was the stiff response molly will call me if you require my services i think you said you preferred bread and milk for breakfast dinner will be served at one  mrs aylward retreated leaving a chill on the heart of the lonely girl  she was a clergymans widow though with no pretensions to gentility and was a plain conscientious godly woman but with the narrow selfconcentrated piety of the time which seemed to ignore all the active part of the duty to our neighbour she had lived many years as a faithful retainer to the belamour family and avoided perplexity by minding no ones business but her own and that thoroughly naturally reserved and disapproving much that she saw around her she had never held it to be needful to do more than preserve her own integrity and the interests of her employers and she made it a principle to be in no wise concerned in family affairs and to hold aloof from perilous confidences  thus aurelia was left to herself till three bowls of milk were borne in by molly who was by no means loth to speak  the little misses will be down directly maam she said that is two on em the little one she wont leave jenny bowles but dame wheatfield shell bring down the other two you see maam they be only just taken home from being out at nurse and dont know one another nor the place and a pretty handful we shall have of em  here came a call for molly and the girl with a petulant exclamation sped away leaving aurelia to the society of the tapestry it was of that set of gobelin work which represents the four elements personified by their goddesses and aurelias mythology founded on fenelon was just sufficient to enable her to recognise the forge of vulcan and the car chariotdl of venus then she looked at the work prepared for her a creamy piece of white satin and a most elaborate pattern of knots of roses lilacs hyacinths and laburnums at which her heart sank within her however at that moment the stout woman she had seen in the morning appeared at the open door with a little girl in each hand both in little round muslin caps long white frocks and blue sashes  one went up readily to aurelia and allowed herself to be kissed and lifted to a chair the other clung to dame wheatfield in spite of coaxing entreaties speak pretty my dear speak to the pretty lady dont ye see how good your sister is it wont do miss to aurelia shes daunted is my pretty lamb if i might just give her her breakwistfor it is the last time i shall do itthen she might get used to you before my good man comes for me  aurelia was only too glad to instal dame wheatfield in a chair with her charge in her lap the other child was feeding herself very tidily and independently and aurelia asked her if she were the eldest  yes she said  and what shall i call you my dear  im missy  no missy meme eldest cried the other  bless the poor children exclaimed mrs wheatfield laughing they be both of em eldest as one may say  they are twins then said aurelia  more than thatall three of them came together ive heard tell of such a thing once or twice but never of all living and thriving folk said it was a judgment on my lady that she spoke sharp and hard to a poor beggar woman with a child on each arm it was not a week out before my lady herself was down quite unexpected as i may say for she was staying here for a week with a lot of company when these three was born they do say she was nigh beside herself that the like of that should have happened to her mr wayland he was not so ill pleased but the poor little things had to be got out of the house any way for she could not abear to hear of them mrs rolfe as was an old servant of the family took that one and i was right glad to have you my pretty one for i had just lost my babe at a fortnight old and the third was sent to goody bowles for want of a better they says as how my lady means to bring them out one by one and to make as this here is bigger and the other up stairs is lesser and never let on that they are all of an age  the good gossip must have presumed greatly on the childrens want of comprehension if she did not suppose that they understood her at least as well as the young lady to whom her dialect was strange  and has she not seen them  never till last monday if youll believe me miss when she drove down in her coach and the children were all brought home i thought she might have said something handsome considering the poor little babe as my missy here was when i had hernot so long as my handand scarce able to cry enough to show she was alive the work i and my good man had with her he would walk up and down half the night with her not as we grudged it he is as fond of the child as myself and mr wayland he knew it she has a good nurse dame says he to me with the water in his eyes before he went to foreign parts but my lady when the little one as had been with goody bowlesan ignorant woman you seecried and clung to her and kicked little savages all says my lady there was thanks to them that had had more work to rear her children than ever with one of her own perfect little rustics she said even when you made your curtsey as pretty as could be didnt you my little lammie  mammy rolfe taught me to make my curtsey like a london lady said the other child the most advanced in manners  aha little pitchers have long ears but bless you they dont know what it means said dame wheatfield too glad to talk to check herself on any account not so much as a kiss for them poor little darlings folks say she does not let even master wayland kiss aught but her hands for fear of her fine colours a plague on such colours i say  poor little things whispered aurelia  youll be good to them wont you miss  indeed i hope so i am only just come from home and they will be all i have to care for here  ay you must be lonesome in this big place but im right glad to have seen you miss i can part with the little dear with a better heart for mrs aylward dont care for children and jenny bowles is a rough wench wrapped up in her own child and wont be no good to the others go to the lady my precious she added trying to put the little girl into her cousins lap but this was met with struggles and vehement cries of  no stay with mammy  the little sister who had not brought her nurse was however well contented to be lifted to aurelias knee and returned her caresses  and have you not a name my dear we cant call you all missie  fay the child lisped fayfiddly wayland  lawkadaisy and mrs wheatfield fell back laughing ill tell you how it was maam when no one thought they would live an hour squire wayland he sent for parson and had em half baptised faith hope and charity they says his own mothers was called faith and the other two came natural after it and would do as well to be buried by as aught so thats what she means by fay and this here is miss charity  she said something besides faith  well when my lady got about again they say if she was mad at their coming all on a heap she was madder still at their name bible wasnt grand enough for her i did hear tell that she throwed her slipper at her husbands head and was like to go into fits so to content her he came down and took each one to church and had a fine london name of my ladys choosing tacked on in parsons register for them to go by but to my mind it aint like their christened name mine here got called for her share amoretta  a little love cried aurelia oh that is pretty and what can your name be my dear little fay will you tell me again  when repeated it was plainly fidelia and it appeared that hope had been also called letitia as to age mrs wheatfield knew it was five years last michaelmas since the child had been brought to her from whom she was so loth to part that she knew not how to go when her husband came for her in his cart he was a farmer comfortably off though very homely and there were plenty of children at home so that she had been ill spared to remain at the park till aurelias arrival thus she took the opportunity of going away while the little one was asleep  aurelia asked where she lived now at sedhurst in the next parish she was told but she would not accept a promise that her charge should soon be brought to visit her better not maam thank you all the same not till shes broke in shell pine the less if she dont see nor hear nothing about the old place nor daddy and sally and davie if you bring her soon youll never get her away again thats the worst of a nursechild i was warned it just breaks your heart  so away went the good fostermother sobbing and aurelias charge began fay claimed her instantly to explore the garden and house the child had been sent home alone on the sudden illness of her nurse and had been very forlorn so that her cousins attention was a great boon to her hope was incited to come out but jenny bowles kept a jealous watch over her and treated every one else as an enemy and before aurelias hat was on came the terrible woe of amorets awakening her sobs and wailings for her mammy were entirely beyond the reach of aurelias soothings and caresses and were only silenced by mollys asseveration that the black man was at the door ready to take her into the dark room that this was no phantom was known to the poor child and was a lurking horror to aurelia herself no wonder that the little thing clung to her convulsively and would not let her hand go for the rest of the day every now and then moaning out entreaties to go home to mammy  with the sad little being hanging to her hand aurelia was led by fay round their new abiding place the house was of brick shaped like the letter h dutch and with a tall wing at each end of the main body projecting and finishing in fantastic gables edged with stone one of these square wings was appropriated to aurelia and her charges the other to the recluse mr belamour the space that lay between the two wings on the garden front was roofed over and paved with stone descending in several broad shallow steps at the centre and ends guarded at each angle by huge carved eagles the crest of the builder of the most regular patchwork and kept in spite of the owners nonresidence in perfect order the strange thing was that this fair and stately place basking in the sunshine of early june should be left in complete solitude save for the hermit in the opposite wing the three children and the girl who felt as though in a kind of prison  the sun was too hot for aurelia to go out of doors till late in the day when the shadow of the house came over the steps she was sitting on one with amoret nestled in her lap and was crooning an old german lullaby of nannerls which seemed to have a wonderful effect in calming the child who at last fell into a doze aurelia had let her voice die away and had begun to think over her strange situation when she was startled by a laugh behind her and looking round hardly repressed a start or scream at the sight of fay enjoying a game at bopeep withyesit actually wasthe negroover the lowsashed door  i beg pardon maam said jumbo twitching his somewhat grizzled wool i heard singing and little missy  unfortunately amoret here awoke and with a shriek of horror cowered in her arms  i am so sorry said aurelia anxious not to hurt his feelings she knows no better  jumbo grinned bowed and withdrew fay running after him for she had made friends with him during her days of solitude being a fearless child and not having been taught to make a bugbear of him the soot wont come off she said  aurelia had not a moment to herself till fay had said the lords prayer at her knee and amoret with much persuasion had been induced to lisp out                    matthew mark luke and john                    bless the bed i sleep upon                    four corners to by bed                    four angles round my head                    one to read and one to write                    and two to guard my soul at night  another agony for mammy ensued nor could aurelia leave the child till sleep had hushed the wailings then only could she take her little writingcase to begin her letter to betty it would be an expensive luxury to her family but she knew how it would be longed for and though she cried a good deal over her writing she felt as if she ought to make the best of her position for had not betty said it was for her fathers sake no her tears must not blot the paper to distress those loving hearts yet how the drops would come gathering fast and blinding her presently through the window came the sweet mysterious strains of the violin not terrifying her as before but filling her with an inexpressible sense of peace and calmness she sat listening almost as one in a dream with her pen suspended and when the spell was broken by mollys entrance with her supper she went on in a much more cheerful strain than she had begun it was dull and it was a pity that her grand wardrobe to say nothing of bettys good advice should be wasted but her sister would rejoice in her seclusion from the grand fashionable world and her heart went out to the poor little neglected children whose mother could not bear the sight of them     chapter ix the triad       i know sisters sisters three   ere many days had passed aurelia had drifted into what would now be regarded as the duties of a nursery governess to her little companions  fay and amoret were always with her and depended on her for everything jenny bowles with a sort of animal jealousy tried to monopolise her charge letitia the child was attracted by the sounds of her sisters sports and there was no keeping her from them or from their cousin then the rude untaught jenny became cross moped showed spite to the other children and insolence to the young lady and was fortunately overheard by mrs aylward and dismissed letty did not seem to mind the loss as amoret had felt that of her fostermother for indeed jenny had been almost as disagreeable to her as to the others during these days of jealousy  the triad were not much alike amoret was the largest of the three plump blueeyed goldenhaired rosycheeked a picture of the cherubtype of child letitia had the delicate delavie features and complexion and fidelia the least pretty was pale and rather sallow with deep blue eyes set under a broad forehead and dark brows with hair also dark though the smallest she was the most advanced and showed signs of good training she had some notion of good manners and knew as much of her hornbook a childs primer consisting of a sheet of parchment or paper protected by a sheet of transparent horndl and catechism as little girls of five were wont to know the other two were perfectly ignorant but mrs aylward procured hornbooks primers and slates and aurelia began their education in a small way  it was a curious life there was the great empty house through whose long corridors and vacant rooms the children might wander at will peeping at the swathed curtains of velvet pile the rolls of carpet and the tapestry pictures on the walls running and shouting in the empty passages or sometimes in a fit of nameless fright taking refuge in aurelias arms or they might play in the stately garden provided they trod on no borders and meddled with neither flower nor fruit the old gardener began by viewing them as his natural enemies but soon relaxed in amusement at their pretty sportive ways gave them many precious spoils and forgave more than one naughty little inroad which greatly alarmed their guardian  or if the little party felt enterprising there lay beyond the park its slopes covered with wild strawberries and with woods where they could gather flowers unchecked further there was no going except on alternate sundays when there was service in the tumbledown church at the park gate it was in far worse condition than the church at home and was served by a poor forlornlooking curate who lived at brentford and divided his services between four parishes each of which was content to put up with a fortnightly alternate morning and evening service the belamour seat was a square one without the comfortable appliances of the delavie closet and thus permitting a much fuller view but there was nothing to be seen except a row of extremely gaudy belamour hatchments displaying to the full the saltirwise sheafs of arrows on the shields or lozenges supported by grinning skulls the mens shields preserved their eagle crest the women had only lozenges and the family motto amo et amabo was exchanged for the more pious resurgam  aurelia found that the family seat whither she was marshalled by mrs aylward was already occupied by two ladies who rose up and made her stately curtsies with a decidedly disgusted air although there was ample space for her and fidelia the only one of her charges whom she had ventured to take with her they wore the black hoods laced boddices long rolls of towering curl and open upper skirts of queen annes day and in the eyes of thirty years later looked so ridiculous that fay could not but stare at them the whole time and whenever aurelia turned her glances from her book to see whether her little companion was behaving herself the big blue considering eyes were always levelled full upon the two forms before her  the ladies were in keeping with their dress thin stiff and angular with worn and lined faces highly rouged and enormous longhandled fans and aurelia was almost as much astonished as the child  there was a low curtseying again and much ceremony before it was possible to get out of the pew and the two ladies mounted at the door on lofty pattens which added considerably to their height and attended by a loutishlooking man in livery who carried their books stalked of into the village  aurelia found from the communicative molly that they were mistress phoebe and mistress delia treforth kinswomen of the belamour family who had in consequence a life residence rentfree in a tall thin red square house near the churchyard where a very gay parrot was always to be seen in the windows they no doubt regarded miss delavie and the little waylands as interlopers at bowstead and their withering glances made churchgoing a trying affairindeed the first time that aurelia took little amoret they actually drove the sensitive child into a sobbing fit so that she had to be carried out begging to know why those ladies looked so cross at her  the life on the whole was not unhappy except for fits of homesickness and longing for letters the arrival of the boxes from the carrier was the first comfort and then at last came a thick letter from home franked by sir george herries and containing letters from everybodyeven a few roundhand lines from eugene  her father wrote at length all the excellent moral and religious essay which had stuck in his throat at the parting neither was bettys letter deficient in good advice though she let it appear that the family were much amused at lady belamours affliction in her triad of daughters the secret having been hitherto so carefully kept that they supposed her to have only one  it will be your charge wrote betty so far as in you lies to render them not merely the graces as my father terms them but the true and faithful guardian to these infant spirits though their mother has shown no care or heed in entrusting them to you yet remember that it is truly the good providence of their heavenly father that has put these little children of his in your charge to receive from you the first principles of religion and morals which may mould their whole lives and i trust that you will do the work faithfully and successfully it may be dull and tedious at bowstead but i had much rather hear of you thus than exposed to the glare of my ladys saloon in london no doubt harriet has write to you of the visit of young sir amyas the sunday after your departure we have since heard that his expedition to monmouthshire was with a view to his marriage to lady aresfields daughter and this may well be so that if he fall in your way you will be warned against putting any misconstruction on any civil attentions he may pay to you ever since your departure mr arden has redoubled his assiduities in a certain quarter and as it is thought the dean and chapter are not unlikely to present him to a good vicarage in buckinghamshire it is not unlikely that ere long you may hear of a wedding in the family although harriet would be extremely angry with me for daring to give such a hint  certainly aurelia would not have gathered the hint from harriets letter which was very sentimental about her own loneliness and lack of opportunity in contrast with aurelia who was seeing the world that elegant beau sir amyas had just given a sample to tantalise their rusticity and then had vanished and here was that oddity mr arden more wearisome and pertinacious than ever so tiresome     chapter x the dark chamber       or singst thou rather under force        of some divine command     commissioned to presage a course        of happier days at hand                               cowper   aurelia was coming down stairs in the twilight after singing her charges to sleep about three weeks after her arrival when she saw jumbo waiting at the bottom of the stairs  she had long ceased to be afraid of him indeed he had quite amazed her by his goodnature in helping to lift down naughty little letitia who was clambering up to the window of his masters chamber to look through the crevices of the shutters he had given the children a gaily dressed rag doll and was as delighted as they were when he played his fiddle to them and set them dancing  still the whites of his eyes his shining teeth and the gold lace of his livery had a startling effect in the darkness and aurelia wished he would move away but he was evidently waiting for her and when she came near he addressed her thus misr belamour present compliment and would miss delavie be good enough to honour him with her company for a short visit  the girl started dismayed alarmed yet unwilling to be unkind to the poor recluse while she hoped that decorum and propriety would put the visit out of the question she replied that she would ask mrs aylward whether she might and jumbo followed her to the stillroom saying on the way masr heard miss delavie sing he always has the window opened to hear her it makes him hum the airbe merry he has not asked to speak with lady since he heard the bad newslong long ago  then aurelia felt that nothing short of absolute impropriety ought to make her gratify her shrinking reluctance mrs aylward seemed to think her doubts uncalled for and attributed her hesitation to fear of the dark room  oh no i am not so childish said the young lady with nervous dignity but would it be proper  bless me madam he is as old as your father and as civil a gentleman as lives i would come in with you but that i am expecting mr potts with the tallies you need have no scruples  there was no excuse nor escape and aurelia followed the negro in trepidation crossing the hall he opened for her the door of the lobby corresponding to her own and saying allow me maam passed before her and she heard another door unclosed and a curtain withdrawn beyond she only saw a gulf of darkness but out of it came a deep manly voice subdued and melancholy but gentlemanlike and deferential  the young lady is so kind as to come and cheer the old hermit a thousand thanks madam permit me  aurelias hand was taken by one soft for want of use and she was led forward on a deep piled carpet and carefully placed on a chair in the midst of the intense black darkness there was a little movement and then the voice said i am most sensible of your goodness madam  ii am glad you are very good sir murmured aurelia oppressed by the gloom and the peculiar atmosphere coolfor the windows were open behind the shuttersbut strangely fragrant  how does my excellent friend major delavie  i thank you sir he is well though his wound troubles him from time to time  commend me to him when you write if you are good enough to remember it  i thank you sir he will be rejoiced to hear of you  he does me too much honour  these conventionalities being exhausted a formidable pause ensued first broken by mr belamour may i ask how my fair visitor likes bowstead  it is a fine place sir  but somewhat lonely for so youthful a lady  i have the children sir  i often hear their cheerful voices  i hope we do not disturb you sir i strive to restrain them but i fear we are all thoughtless  nay the innocent sounds of mirth ring sweetly on my ears like the notes of birds and when i have heard a charming voice singing to the little ones i have listened with delight would it be too presumptuous to beg the air songstress to repeat her song for the old recluse  o sir i have only nursery ditties caught from our old german maid cried aurelia in dismay  that might not diminish the charm to me he said in especial there was one song whose notes jumbo caught as you accompanied yourself on the spinnet  and jumbo who seemed able to see in the dark played a bar on his violin while aurelia trembled with shyness  the nightingale song she said my dear mother learnt the tune abroad and i believe that she herself made the english words when she was asked what the nightingales say  may i hear it nightingales can sing in the dark refusal was impossible and jumbos violin was a far more effective accompaniment than her own very moderate performance on the spinnet so in a sweet soft pure untrained and trembling voice she sang    o life and light are sweet my dear   o life and light are sweet   but sweeter still the hope and cheer     when love and life shall meet   oh then it is most sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet   but love puts on the yoke my dear   but love puts on the yoke   the dart of love calls forth the tear     as though the heart were broke   the very heart were broke broke broke broke broke broke   and love can quench lifes light my dear   drear dark and melancholy   seek light and life and jocund cheer     and mirth and pleasing folly   be thine lighthearted folly folly folly folly folly folly   nay nay she sang yoke pain and tear     for love i gladly greet   light life and mirth are nothing here     without loves bitter sweet   give me loves bitter sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet   accept my fervent thanks kind songstress so that is the nightingales song and your honoured mothers  yes sir my father often makes us sing it because it reminds him of her  philomel could not have found a better interpreter said the grave voice sounding so sad that aurelia wished she could have sung something less affecting to his spirits  i gather from what you said that you are no longer blessed with the presence of the excellent lady your mother presently added mr belamour  no sir we lost her seven years ago  and her husband mourns her still well he may she was a rare creature so she is gone i have been so long in seclusion that no doubt time has made no small havoc and my friends have had many griefs to bewail  aurelia knew not what answer to make and was relieved when he collected himself and said  i will trespass no longer on my fair visitors complaisance but if she have not found the gloom of this apartment insupportable it would be a charitable action to brighten it once more with her presence  o sir i will come whenever you are pleased to send for me she exclaimed all her doubts fears and scruples vanishing at his tone of entreaty my father would be so glad i will practise my best song to sing to you tomorrow  my best thanks are yours and her hand was taken she was carefully conducted to the door and dismissed with a gentle pressure of her fingers and a courteous goodnight madam au revoir if i may venture to say so  by contrast the hall looked almost light and aurelia could see the skip of joy with which jumbo hurried to fetch a candle as he gave it to her he made his teeth flash from ear to ear as he exclaimed pretty missy bring new life to masr  thus did a new element come into aurelias life she carefully prepared harriets favourite song a french romance but mr belamour did not like it equally well with the nightingale which he made her repeat rewarding her by telling her of the charming looks and manners of her mother so that she positively enjoyed her visit the next night he made inquiries into her walks at bowstead asking after the favourite nooks of his childhood and directing her to the glades where grew the largest dewberries and sweetest blackberries this led to her recital of a portion of midsummer nights dream for he drew her on with thanks at every pause i have enjoyed no such treat for many years he said  there are other pieces that i can recite another time said aurelia timidly  you will confer a great favour on me he answered  so she refreshed her memory by a mental review of paradise lost over her embroidery frame and was ready with adams morning hymn which was much relished compliments on her elocution soon were turned by her into the praise of sister and as she became more at ease the strange man in the dark listened with evident delight to her pretty fresh prattle about sister and brother and father and home thus it had become a daily custom that she should spend the time between half past seven and nine in the company of the prisoner of darkness and she was beginning to look forward to it as the event of the day she scarcely expected to be sent for on sunday evening but jumbo came as usual with the invitation and she was far from sorry to quit a wormeaten baxters saints rest which she had dutifully borrowed from mrs aylward  well my fair visitor said the voice which had acquired a tone of pleased anticipation what mental repast has your goodness provided  it is sunday sir  ah as if it had not occurred to him and with some disappointment  i could say the psalms by heart sir if you would like it for it is the 20th day of the month  thank you your voice can make anything sweet  aurelia was shocked and knew that betty would be more so but she was too shy to do anything except to begin praise thou the lord o my soul  it was a fortunate thing that it was a psalm of such evident beauty for it fell less familiarly on his ear than her passages from the poets at the end he said yes that is true poetry praise fits well with happy young lips you have been to church  no sir mr greaves does not come today  then how did the gentle saint perform her orisons  please do not so call me sir i tried to read the service but i could not get the children to be still so i had to tell them about joseph and i found a beautiful bible full of pictures like our dutch one at home  you found the old bible my mother used to show it to my brother and memy poor mother  he mentioned one or two of the engravings which he had never forgotten but the evening was less of a success than usual and aurelia doubted whether we would wish for her that day sennight all her dread of him was gone she knew she had brought a ray of brightness into his solitary broken life and her mind was much occupied with the means of affording him pleasure indeed she might have wearied of the lack of all companionship save that of the young children and converse with a clever highly cultivated mind was stimulating and expanding all her faculties when the stores or her memory were becoming exhausted jumbo was bidden to open a case of books which had lain untouched since they were sent sown from mr belamours chambers at the temple and they were placed at her disposal here was mr alexander popes translation of the iliad of homer which had appeared shortly before the fatal duel and aurelia eagerly learnt whole pages of it by heart for the evenings amusement enjoying extremely the elucidations and criticisms of her auditor who would dwell on a passage all day beg to have it repeated a second time in the evening and then tell her what his memory or his reflection had suggested about it moreover having heard some inexplicable report through jumbo of the porteous mob mr belamour became curious to learn the truth and this led to his causing the newspapers to be sent weekly to be read and reported to him by aurelia it seemed incredible that a man of much ability should have been content to spend all these years in the negros sole society but no doubt the injury done to the brain had been aggravated by grief and remorse so that he had long lain with suspended faculties in a species of living death whence he had only gradually and as it were unconsciously advanced to his present condition perhaps mr waylands endeavours to rouse him had come too soon or in a less simple and attractive form for they had been reluctantly received and had proved entirely unsuccessful while the childlike efforts of the girl following his lead instead of leading him were certainly awakening him and renewing his spirits and interest in the world at large in an unlookedfor manner     chapter xi a voice from the grave       he hath a word for thee to speak                                   keble   no difference was made to aurelias visits to mr belamour on sunday evenings but he respected her scruples against indulgence in profane literature and encouraged her to repeat passages of scripture beginning to taste the beauty of the grand cadences falling from her soft measured voice thus had she come to the sermon on the mount and found herself repeating the expansion of the sixth commandment ending with and thou be cast into prison verily i say unto thee thou shalt not come out thence until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing  a groan startled her then came the passage and the unhappy mans history with a sudden stab a horror of the darkness fell on her she felt as if he were in the prison and she reproaching him and cried outo sir forgive me i forgot i did not say it on purpose  no my child it was mary speaking by your voice no mary i shall never come out it will never be paid  she shook with fright as jumbo touched her saying missee go masr bear no more but as she rose to go away a sweet impulse made her pause and say it is paid he paid you know who didin his own blood  jumbo drew her away almost by force and when outside exclaimed missee never speak of blood or kill to masrhe not bear it head turn againsee shapes as bad as ever  the poor child cried bitterly calling herself cruel thoughtless presumptuous and for the next few days jumbos eyes glared at her as he reported his master to be very ill but on the third day he came for her as usual she thought mr belamours tones unwontedly low and depressed but no reference was made to the sunday and she was glad enough to plunge into the council of olympus  a day or two later dame wheatfield sent her husband with an urgent invitation to miss amoret with her sisters and cousin to be present at her harvest home mrs aylward with a certain tone of contempt gave her sanction to their going with molly by the help of the little pony cart used about the gardens aurelia in high glee told mr belamour who encouraged her to describe all her small adventures and was her oracle in all the difficult questions that fidelias childish wisdom was wont to start  to wheatfields farm did you say that is in sedhurst there are but three fields between it and the church  presently he added i am tempted to ask a great kindness though i know not whether it will be possible to you  indeed sir i will do my utmost  there are two graves in sedhurst church i have never dared to inquire about them would it be asking too much from my gentle friend to beg of her to visit them and let me hear of them  i will i will sir with all my heart  by eight oclock the next evening she was again with him apologizing for being late  i scarcely expected this pleasure tonight these rural festivities are often protracted  o sir i was heartily glad to escape and to get the children away the people were becoming so rude and riotous that i was frightened i never would have gone had i known what it would be like but at home the people are fond of asking us to their harvest feasts and they always behave well whilst we are there  no doubt they hold your father in respect  yes said aurelia unwilling to tell him how much alarmed and offended she had been though quite unintentionally dame wheatfield only intended hospitality but in her eyes miss was merely a poor governess and that to the little waylandsmere interlopers in the eyes of the belamour tenantry so the good woman had no idea that the rough gallantry of the young farmer guests was inappropriate viewing it as the natural tribute to her guests beauty and mistaking genuine offence for mere coyness until finding it was real earnest considerable affront was taken at young madams fine airs and she only a poor kinswoman of my ladys quite as ill was it received that the young lady had remonstrated against the indigestible cakes and strange beverages administered to all her charges and above all to amoret she had made her escape on the plea of early hours for the children leaving molly behind her just as the boisterous song was beginning in which jack kisses bet joe kisses sue tom kisses nan c down to poor dorothy draggletail who is left in the lurch the farewell had been huffy a good evening to you madam i am sorry our entertainment was not more to your taste she had felt guilty and miserable at the accusation of pride and she could not imagine how mrs aylward could have let her go without a warning the truth being that mrs aylward despised her taste but thought she knew what a harvest supper was like  all this was passed over in silence by aurelias pride and delicacy she only described the scene when the last waggon came in with its load the horses decked with flowers and ribbons and the farmers youngest girl enthroned on the top of the shocks upholding the harvest doll this was a little sheaf curiously constructed and bound with straw plaits and ribbons the farmer on the arrival in the yard stood on the horseblock and held it high over the heads of all the harvesters and the chorus was raised                   a knack a knack a knack                     well cut well bound                     well shocked well saved from the ground                   whoop whoop whoop  after which the harvest doll displaced her last years predecessor over the hearth where she was to hang till next year  all this aurelia described comparing the customs with those of her own county her heart beating all the time under the doubt how to venture on describing the fulfilment of her commission at last mr belamour said  in such a scene of gaiety no doubt the recollection of sorrow had no place  o sir you could not think i should forget  i thought i might have asked more than was possible to you  it was the only part of the day that i enjoyed i took little fay with me for no one seemed to care for her while amy was queening it with all the wheatfields and letty was equally happy with her foster mother i could see the church spire so i needed not to ask the way and we crossed the stubble fields while the sun sent a beautiful slanting light through the tall elm trees that closed in the churchyard but let one window glitter between them like a great diamond it looked so peaceful after all the noise we left behind even little fay felt it and said she loved the quiet walk along the green baulks an unplowed strip of landdl the churchyard has a wooden rail with steps to cross it on either side and close under the church wall is a tomb a great square simple block surmounted by an urn  yes let me hear said the voice eager though stifled  i thought it might be what you wished me to see and went up to read the names  do not spare never fear let me hear the very words  on one face of the block there was a name                      william sedhurst                         aged 27                     died may 13 1729   on the other side was this inscription                           mary         only daughter of george sedhurst esquire                        aged 19                  died august 1st 1729                  love is strong as death          sorrow not as others that have no hope   in smaller letters down below this epitaph is at her own special request  sir continued aurelia it was very curious i should not have observed those words if it had not been that a large beautiful butterfly with rainbow eyes on its wings sat sunning itself on the white marble and fay called me to look at it  her message may i ask you to repeat it again  the texts love is strong as death sorrow not as others that have no hope  did you call them scripture texts  yes sir i know the last is in one of the epistles and i will look for the other  it matters not she intended them for a message to me who lay in utter darkness and imbecility well befitting her destroyer  nay they have come to you at last said aurelia gently you really never knew of them before  no i durst not ask nor did any one dare to speak to me my brother who alone would have done so died i scarcely know when but ere the very consciousness of my own wretched existence had come back to me once again repeat the words gentle messenger of mercy  she obeyed but this time he mournfully murmured hope what hope for their destroyer  they are gods words as well as hers the girl answered with diffident earnestness but in reply she only heard tightened breaths which made her say you cannot bear more sir let me call jumbo and bid you good night  jumbo came at the mention of his name somehow he was so unlike other human beings and so wholly devoted to his master that it never seemed to be a greater shock to find that he had been present than if he had been a faithful dog  a few days later he told aurelia that masr was not well enough to see her he had set forth as soon as the moon had set and walked with his trusty servant to sedhurst where he had traced with his finger the whole inscription lingering so long that the sun was above the horizon before he could get home and he was still lying on the bed where he had thrown himself on first coming in having neither spoken nor eaten since jumbo could not but grumble out that masr was better left to himself  yet when aurelia on the third evening was recalled there was a ring of refreshment in the voice it was still melancholy but the dejection was lessened and though it was only of achilles and patroclus that they talked she was convinced that the pressure of the heavy burthen of grief and remorse was in some degree lightened     chapter xii the shafts of phoebe                     her golden bow she bends     her deadly arrows sending forth                          greek hymn keightley   on coming in from a walk aurelia was surprised by the tidings that mistress phoebe treforth had come to call on her and had left a billet the said billet was secured with floss silk sealed down in the antiquated fashion and was written on fullsized quarto paper these were the contents   madam     my sister and myself are desirous of the honour of your     acquaintance and shall be happy if you will do use the     pleasure of coming to partake of dinner at three oclock     on tuesday the 13th instant                           i remain                               yours to command                                   delia treforth   aurelia carried the invitation to her oracle  my cousins are willing to make your acquaintance said he that is well jumbo shall escort you home in the evening  thank you sir but must i accept the invitation  it could not be declined without incivility moreover the mistresses treforth are highly respected and your father and sister will certainly think it well for you to have female friends  do you think those ladies could ever be my friends sir she asked with an intonation that made him reply with a sound of amusement  i am no judge in such matters but they are ladies connected and esteemed who might befriend and counsel you in case of need and at any rate it is much more suitable that you should be on terms of friendly intercourse with them i am heartily glad they have shown you this attention  i do not mean to be ungrateful sir  and i think you have disproved that                        crabbed age and youth                         cannot live together  if they were only like you sir  what would they say to that he said with the slight laugh that had begun to enliven his voice i suppose your charges are not included in the invitation  no but molly can take care of them if my lady will not object to my leaving them  she cannot reasonably do so  and sir shall i be permitted to come home in time for you to receive me  i fear i must forego that pleasure the ladies will insist on cards and supper jumbo shall come for you at nine oclock  aurelia submitted and tripped down arrayed in the dress that recalled the fete at carminster except that only a little powder was sprinkled on her temples the little girls jumped round her in admiring ecstasy and under mollys charge escorted her to the garden gate and hovered outside to see her admitted while she knocked timidly at the door in the bashful alarm of making her first independent visit  the loutish man ushered her into a small close room containing a cat a little spaniel a green parrot a spinningwheel and an embroidery frame there were also the two old ladies dressed with oldfashioned richness a little faded and a third in a crimson goldlaced joseph a long riding coat with a small cape worn by women in the 18th centurydl stout rubicund and hearty to whom aurelia was introduced thus  mrs hunter allow me to present to you miss delavie a relative of my lady belamour miss delavie mrs hunter of brentford  i am most happy to make your acquaintance miss said the lady in a jovial voice and aurelia made her curtsey but at that moment the man announced that dinner was served whereupon mrs delia handed mrs hunter in and mrs phoebe took the younger guest  the ladies faces both bore token of their recent attention to the preparation of the meal and the curious dishes would have been highly interesting to betty but there was no large quantity of any and a single chicken was the piece de resistance whence very tiny helps were dealt out and there was much unnecessary pressing to take a little more both of that and of the brace of partridges which succeeded it as to conversation there was room for none except hospitable invitations from the hostesses to take the morsels that they cut for their guests praises of the viands from mrs hunter and endeavours to fish at the recipes which the owners guarded jealously as precious secrets aurelia sat perfectly silent as was then reckoned as proper in a young lady of her age except when addressed a good deal of time was also expended in directing john stiggins the ladies own man and george brown who had ridden with mrs hunter from brentford in the disposal of the dishes and the handing of the plates george brown was the more skilled waiter and as the man who was at home did not brook interference their disputes were rude and audible and kept the ladies in agonies lest they should result in ruin to the best china  at last however the cloth was removed walnuts apples pears and biscuits were placed on the table a glass of wine poured out for each lady and the quartette with the cat and dog drew near the sunny window where there was a little warmth it was a chilly day but no one ever lighted a fire before the 5th of november old style  then began one of those catechisms which fortunately are less unpleasant to youth and simplicity than they are to persons of an age to resent inquiry and who have more resources of conversation in truth aurelia was in the eyes of the treforth sisters descendants of a former sir jovian only my ladys poor kinswoman sent down to act gouvernante to the wayland brats who had been impertinently quartered in the belamour household she would have received no further notice had it not been reported through the servants that young miss spent the evenings with their own cousin from whom they had been excluded ever since his illness  the subject was approached through interrogations on miss delavies home and breeding how she had travelled and what were her accomplishments also whether she were quite sure that none of the triad was either imbecile nor deformed mrs hunter seemed to have heard wonderful rumours about the poor children  has their lady mother seen them  yes madam she had been there with them shortly before my arrival  only once in their lives there was a groan of censure such as would have fired the loyal major in defence  no wonder sister phoebe my lady belamour does not lead the life of a tender mother  she has the little boy archer with her in london aurelia ventured to say  and a perfect puppet she makes of the poor child said mrs hunter my sister chetwynd saw him with his mother at a masquerade my lady belamour flaunting as venus and he when he ought to have been in his bed dressed in rosecolour and silver with a bow and arrows and gauze wings on his shoulders  what will that child come to  remember sister delia he is no kin of ours he is only a wayland returned mrs phoebe in an accent as if the waylands were the most contemptible of vermin  i hope added mrs delia that these children are never permitted to incommode our unfortunate cousin mr belamour  i trust not madam said aurelia their rooms are at a distance from his they are good children and he says he likes to hear young voices in the gardens  you have then seen mr belamour  i cannot say that i have seen him said aurelia modestly but i have conversed with him  indeed alone with him  jumbo was there  the two old ladies drew themselves up while mrs hunter chuckled and giggled indeed said mrs phoebe we should never see a gentleman in private without each others company or that of some female companion  i consulted mrs aylward returned aurelia and she said he was old enough to be my father  mrs aylward may be a respectable housekeeper though far too lavish of butchers meat but i should never have recourse to her on a matter of decorum said mrs phoebe  aurelias cheeks burnt but she still defended herself i have heard from my father and my sister she said and they make no objection  hoitytoity what means this heat miss exclaimed mrs phoebe i am only telling you as a kindness what we should have thought becoming with regard even to a blood relation of our own  thank you maam said aurelia but you see you are so much nearer his age that the cases are not alike  she said it in all simplicity and did not perceive at first why the two sisters drew themselves up in so much offence or why mrs hunter cried oh fie for shame you saucy chit bless me she continued more goodnaturedly cousin phoebe times are changed since we were young and poor sir jovian and his brother were the county beaux the child is right enough when one comes to think of it and for my part i should be glad that poor mr amyas had some one young and cheerful about him it is only a pity his nephew the young baronet never comes down to see him  like mother like son said mrs phoebe i grieve to think what the old place will come to  well said mrs hunter i do not hear the young gentleman ill spoken of though mores the pity he is in a bad school with colonel mar for his commanding officer the fine gallant who is making his mother the talk of the town  the gossip and scandal then waxed fast and furious on the authority of mrs hunters sister but no one paid any more attention to aurelia except that when there was an adjournment to the next room she was treated with such double stiffness and ceremony as to make her feel that she had given great offence and was highly disapproved of by all but mrs hunter and aurelia could not like her for her gossip had been far broader and coarser than that of the mistresses treforth who though more bitter were more of gentlewomen happily much of what passed was perfectly unintelligible to bettys carefully shielded pupil who sat all the time with the cat on her lap listening to its purring music but feeling much more inclined to believe nothing against my lady after her fathers example than to agree with those who were so evidently prejudiced tea was brought in delicate porcelain cups then followed cards which made the time pass less drearily till supper this consisted of dishes still tinier than those at dinner and it was scarcely ended when it was announced that jumbo had come for miss delavie  gladly she departed after an exchange of curtsies happily not hearing the words behind her  an artful young minx  and imagine the impudence of securing jumbos attendance forsooth  nay said mrs hunter she seemed to me a pretty modest young gentlewoman enough  pretty yes she comes of my ladys own stock and will be just such another  yes it is quite plain that it is true that my lady sent her here because she had been spreading the white apron for the young baronet  and now she is trying her arts on poor cousin amyas belamour you heard how she would take no advice and replied with impertinence  shall you give my lady a hint  not i i have been treated with too much insolence by lady belamour to interfere with her again said mrs phoebe drawing herself up i shall let things take their course unless i can remonstrate with my own kinsman     chapter xiii the flutter of his wings       then is loves hour to stray     oh how he flies awayt moore   meanwhile aurelia mounted on a pair of pattens brought by the negro to keep her above the dew was crossing the park by the light of a fine hunters moon jumbo marching at a respectful distance in the rear he kept on chuckling to himself with glee and when she looked round at him he informed her with great exultation that masr had not been alone his honour had been to see him masr so glad  sir amyas exclaimed aurelia is he there still  no missie he went away before supper  did he see the young ladies  oh yes missie he came before masr up quite promiskius said jumbo who loved a long word i tell him wait till masr be dress and took him to summer parlour he see little missies out in garden ask what chilren it was his hounours sisters miss fay missie letty missie amy i say his honour wonder my sisters he say my sisters here and out he goes like a flash of lightning and was in among them  aurelias first thought was oh i hope they were clean and neat and that they behaved themselves i wish i had been at home wherewith followed the recollection that sir amyas had been called her beau and her cheeks burnt but the recent disagreeable lecture on etiquette showed her that it would only have led to embarrassment and vexation to have had any question of an interview with a young gentleman by so little her elder nor would she have known what to say to him old mr belamour in the dark was a very different matter and she had probably had an escape from much awkwardness  molly received her with her favourite exclamation lawk miss and who do you think have been here  jumbo told me molly  aint he a perfect pictur of a man and such a gentleman he gave me a whole goolden guinea for my good care of his little sisters and says he their father shall hear of them and what little ladies they be  i am glad they behaved themselves prettily  yes that they did maam it was good luck that they had not been grubbing in their gardens as you lets em do maam but they was all as clean as a whistle a picking up horsechestnuts under the big tree at the corner of the bowling green when out on the steps we sees him looking more like an angel than a man in his red coat and the goold things on his shoulders and out he comes miss amy she was afeard at first be the soldiers a coming says she and runs to me but miss letty she holds out her arms and says its my papa and miss fay she stood looking without a word then when his honour was in among them my little sisters my dear little sisters says he dont you know me and down he goes on one knee in the grass never heeding his beautiful white smallclothes if youll believe me miss and holds out his arms and gets miss fay into one arm and miss letty into tother and then miss amy runs up and he kisses them all then miss letty says again are you my papa from foreign parts and he laughs and says no little one im your brother did you never hear of your brother amyas and miss fay stood off a little and clapped her little hands and says o brother amyas how beautiful you are  aurelia could not help longing to know whether she had been mentioned but she did not like to inquire and she was obliged to rest satisfied with the assurance that her little girls had comported themselves like jewels like lambs like darling lumps of sugar or whatever metaphors were suggested by the imagination of molly who had apparently usurped the entire credit of their good manners it was impossible to help feeling a little aggrieved or maugre in spite ofdl all inconvenient properties to avoid wishing to have been under the horsechestnut tree even though she might have shown herself just such a bashful little speechless fool as she had been when sir amyas had danced with her at carminster  she was destined to hear a good deal more of the visitor the next day the children met her with the cry of cousin aura our brotherour big beautiful brotherbrother amyasthey were with difficulty calmed into saying their prayers and amoret startled the little congregation by adding to bless by father my mother my brothers and sisters and pray bless big brother amyas best of all for i love him very much indeed  all day little facts about brother amyas kept breaking out brother amyas had beautiful gold lace brother amyas had a red and white feather brother amyas had given fay and letty each a ride on his shoulder but amy was afraid brother amyas said their papa would love them very much he had given them each a new silver shilling and amoret had in return presented him with her dolls beautiful pink backstring that cousin aura had made for her this wonderful brother had asked who had taught them to be such pretty little gentlewomen and at this aurelias heart beat a little but provoking fidelia replied i told him my mammy rolfe taught me to be genteel and letty added and he said fay was a conceited little pussy cat  a strange indefinable feeling between selfrespect and shyness made aurelia shrink from the pointblank question whether the ungrateful little things had acknowledged their obligations to her she was always hoping they would say something of their own accord and always disappointed  evening came and she eagerly repaired to the dark room wondering yet half dreading to enter on the subject and beginning by an apology for having by no means perfected herself in priams visit to achilles  if you have been making visits said mr belamour i too have had a visitor  the children told me so she answered  he was greatly delighted with them said mr belamour  while they poor little things never were more happy in their lives he must have been very kind to them yet he did not know that they were here  his mother is not communicative respecting them ladies who love power seek to preserve it by making little mysteries  it was to see you sir that he came  yes he ingenuously avowed that he had always been urged to do so by his stepfather but his mother has always put obstacles in the way and assured him that he would not gain admission i have certainly refused to see her but this is a very different mattermy brothers only child my godson and my ward  i am very glad he has come to see you sir and i am sure it has given you pleasure  pleasure in seeing that he is a lad of parts and of an ingenuous affectionate honest nature but regret in perceiving how i failed in the confidence that his father reposed in me  but sir you could not help it  once i could not it was i know not how long before i knew that my brother was no more and thinking myself dead to the world and the world to me i took no heed to what it now seems to me i was told of guardianship to the boy i was incapable of fulfilling any such charge and i shunned the pain of hearing of it he continued rather as if talking to himself than to his auditor when i could i gave them my name and they asked no more yet what did they tell me of a sealed letter from my brother addressed to me true i heard of it more than once but i could ask no one to read it to me and i closed my ears in waylands hands i knew the youth was well cared for and only now do i feel that i have ill requited my brothers confidence  indeed sir i cannot see how you could have done otherwise said aurelia who could not bear to hear his tone of selfreproach  my amiable visitor he exclaimed as though recalled to a sense of her presence excuse the absence of mind which has inflicted on you the selfish murmurs of the old recluse tell me how you prospered with my cousins whom i remember as sprightly maidens phoebe had somewhat of the prude delia of the coquette  i could imagine what you say of mistress phoebe sir better than of mistress delia  had they any guests to meet you  a mrs hunter sir from brentford a doctors wife i suppose  you are right she was a cousin of theirs on the other side of the house a loudvoiced buxom lass who was thought to have married beneath here when she took dr hunter but apparently they have forgiven her  mr belamour was evidently much interested and amused by aurelias small experiences and observations such as they were in spite of the sense of past omission which had been aroused by his nephews visit it had evidently raised his spirits for he laughed when aurelia spiced her descriptions with a little playful archness and his voice became more cheery  so too it was on the ensuing evening when aurelia to compensate for the last days neglect came primed with three or four pages of the conversation between priam and achilles which she rehearsed with great feeling thinking like pelides himself of her own father and home it was requited with a murmured bravo and mr belamour then begged of her if she were not weary to favour him with the nightingale song jumbo as usual accompanying her with his violin at the close there was again a bravo truly exquisite in a tone as if the hermit were really finding youth and life again once more at his request she sang and was applauded with even more fervour with a certain tremulous eagerness in the voice yet there was probably a dread of the excitement being too much for this was followed by thank you kind songstress i could listen for ever but it is becoming late and i must not detain you longer  she found herself handed out of the room with somewhat curtailed good nights although nine oclock her usual signal had not yet struck when she came into the lamplit hall jumbo was grinning and nodding like a maniac and when she asked what was the matter he only rolled his eyes and said missie good masr like music  the repressed excitability she had detected made her vaguely nervous not that she would have so called herself and as the next day was the blank sunday she appeased and worked off her restlessness by walking with the children to sedhurst church it was the sixteenth sunday after trinity and the preacher who had caught somewhat of the fire of wesley and whitfield preached a sermon which arrested her attention and filled her with new thoughts taking the epistle and gospel in connection he showed the deathinlife of indifference and the quickening touch of the divine love awakening the dead spirit into true life on that life with its glow of love hope and joy the preacher dwelt with enthusiasm such as aurelia had never heard and which carried her quite out of herself tears of emotion trembled in her eyes and she felt a longing desire to walk on in that path of love to her maker whom she seemed to have never known before  she talked with a new fervour to the children of the birds and flowers and all the fair things they loved as the gifts of their father in heaven and when she gathered them round the large pictured bible it was to the gospel that she turned as she strove to draw their souls to the appreciation of the redeeming love there shown she saw in fays deep eyes and thoughtful brow that the child was taking it in though differently from amy who wanted to kiss the picture while letty asked those babyish material questions about heaven that puzzle wiser heads than aurelias to answer  so full was she of the thought that she forgot her sense of something strange and unaccountable in mr belamours manner before the evening nor was there anything to remind her of it afresh for he was as calmly grave and kindly courteous as ever and he soon led her to pour forth all her impressions of the day indeed she repeated to him great part of the sermon with a voice quivering with earnestness and emotion he was not stirred in the same way as she had been saying in his pensive meditative way the preacher is right love is life the misfortune is when we stake our all on one love alone and that melts from us then indeed there is deathliving death  but there is neverfailing love and new life that never dies cried aurelia almost transported out of herself  may you ever keep hold of both unobscured my sweet child he returned with a sadness that repressed and drove her back into herself again feeling far too childish and unworthy to help him to that new life and love though her young heart yearned over him in his desolation and her soul was full of supplication for him     chapter xiv the canon of windsor       turn gentle hermit of the dalegoldsmith   my child will you do me a favour said mr belamour the next evening in a tone no longer formal but paternal take this packet he put one into the girls hand to the light and inform me what is the superscription  it was a thick letter with a large red wax seal bearing the well known arms of belamour and delavie and the address was                   to amyas belamour esq kc                  of the inner temple london to be opened after my death                                   jovian belamour                                  dec 14th 1727   i thought so said mr belamour when she returned to him with intelligence little did my poor brother guess how long it would be unopened will my gentle friend confer another obligation on me  aurelia made her ready assent hoping to be asked to read the letter when he continued i cannot read this myself even could i bear the light the attempt to fix my eyes sends darts shooting through my brain which would take away my very power of comprehension but he continued there are only two men living to whom i could entrust my brothers last words to me one your own good father is out of reach the other has frequently proffered his good offices and has been rejected would you add to your kindness that of writing to entreat my old friend dr godfrey to favour with a visit one who has too often and ungratefully refused him admission  feminine curiosity felt balked but aurelia was ashamed of the sensation and undertook the task instructions were given her that she was to write    if amyas belamours old schoolfellow and friend can overlook and   pardon the undeserved rebuffs to his constancy and solicitude for   a lonely and sullen wretch and will once more come and spend a   night at bowstead he will confer an inestimable favour upon one   who is more sensible of his goodness than when it has been   previously offered   this letter written in aurelias best italian hand on a large sheet of paper she brought with her the next evening she was bidden to fold down the exact place for the signature which mr belamour proceeded to affix and she was then to carry it to the candles in the lobby and there fold seal and address it to the reverend edward godfrey dd canon of windsor windsor she found the a belamour very fairly written except that it was not horizontal and she performed the rest of the task with ladylike dexterity sealing it with a ring that had been supplied for the purpose it did not as she expected bear the belamour sheaf of arrows but was a gem representing a sleeping cupid with folded wings so beautiful that she asked leave to take another impression for harriet who collected seals after the fashion of the day  you are welcome mr belamour replied i doubt its great antiquity since the story of cupid and psyche cannot be traced beyond apuleius i used it because dr godfrey will remember it he was with me at rome when i purchased it  the ring was of the size for a ladys finger and aurelia durst ask no more  how the letter was sent she knew not but mrs aylward was summoned to mr belamours room and desired to have a room ready at any time for his friend  three days later towards sunset a substantiallooking clergyman attended by two servants rode up to the door and was immediately appropriated by jumbo disappearing into the mysterious apartments aurelia expected no summons that night but at the usual hour the negro brought a special request for the honour of her society and as she entered the dark room mr belamour said my fair and charitable visitor will permit me to present to her my old and valued friend dr godfrey he laid the hand he had taken on one that returned a little gentlemanly acknowledgment while a kind fatherly voice said the lady must pardon me if i do not venture to hand her to her chair  thank you sir i am close to my seat  your visitors acquire blind eyes belamour said dr godfrey cheerfully  more truly they become eyes to the blind was the answer i feel myself a man of the world again since this amiable young lady has conned the papers on my behalf and given herself the trouble of learning the choicest passages of the poets to repeat to me  you are very good sir returned aurelia it is my great pleasure  that i can well believe said dr godfrey have these agreeable recitations made you acquainted with the new poem on the seasons by mr james thomson  no replied mr belamour my acquaintance with the belles letters ceased nine years ago  the descriptions have been thought extremely effective those of autumn were recalled to my mind on my way  dr godfrey proceeded to recite some twenty lines of blank verse for in those days people had more patience and fewer books and exercised their memories much more than their descendants do listening was far from being thought tedious               but see the fading manycoloured roads               shade deepening over shade the country round               imbrown a crowded umbrage dusk and dim               of every hue from wan declining green               to sooty dark   the lines had a strange charm to one who had lived in darkness through so many revolving years mr belamour eagerly thanked his friend and on the offer to lend him the book begged that it might be ordered for him and that any other new and interesting work might be sent to him that was suitable to the fair lips on which he was dependent  you are secure with mr thomson said the doctor hear the conclusion of his final hymn               when even at last the solemn hour shall come               and wing my mystic flight to future worlds               i cheerful will obey there with new powers               will rising wonders sing  i cannot go               where universal love not smiles around               sustaining all yon orbs and all their suns               from seeming evil still educing good               and better thence again and better still               in infinite progression  but i lose               myself in him in light ineffable               come then expressive silence mine the praise   universal love repeated mr belamour the poet sings as you do my amiable friend i can conceive the idea better than i could a few months ago              from seeming evil still educing good  quoted dr godfrey earnestly as if feeling his way  more of this another time said mr belamour hastily what say the critics respecting this new aspirant  the ensuing conversation much interested aurelia as it was on the men of letters whose names had long been familiar to her and whom the two gentlemen had personally known she heard of pope still living at twickenham and of his bickerings with lady mary wortley montagu of young horace walpole who would never rival his father as a politician but who was beginning his course as a dilettante and actually pretending to prefer the barbarous gothic to the classic italian however his taste might be improved since he was going to make the grand tour in company with mr gray a rising young poet in whom dr godfrey took interest as an etonian and a cantab  at nine oclock mr belamour requested miss delavie to let him depute to her the doing the honours of the supper table to his friend who would return to him when she retired for the night  then it was that she first saw the guest a fine dignified clergyman in a large grey wig with a benignant countenance reminding her of the dean of carminster when she was little the dean had bestowed on her comfits and kisses but since she had outgrown these attentions he was wont to notice her only by a condescending nod and she would no more have thought of conversing with him at table than in his stall in the cathedral thus it was surprising to find herself talked to as betty might have been by this reverend personage who kindly satisfied her curiosity about the king queen and princesses but with a discretion which did not diminish that blind loyalty which saw no defects in our good king though he was george ii she likewise answered a few questions about mr belamours tastes and habits put in a very different manner from those of the mistress treforth and as soon as supper was over she rose and retired  she did not see dr godfrey again until he was ready for a late breakfast having been up nearly the whole night with his friend his horses were ordered immediately after the meal as he had an appointment in london and he presently looked up and said  madam you must excuse me i was silent from thinking how i can adequately express my respect and gratitude for you  i beg your pardon sir exclaimed aurelia thinking her ears mistaken  my gratitude he repeated for the inestimable blessing you have been to my dear and much valued friend in rousing him from that wretched state of despondency in which no one could approach him  you are too good sir returned aurelia it was he who sent for me  i know you did it in all simplicity my dear childforgive the epithet i have daughters of my own and thankful should i be if one of them could have produced such effects i tell you madam my dear friend one of the most estimable and brilliant men of his day was an utter wreck both in mind and body through the cruel machinations of an unprincipled woman how much was to the actual injury from his wound how much to grief and remorse heaven only knows but the death of his brother who alone had authority with him left him thus to cut himself off entirely in this utter darkness and despair i called at first monthly then yearly after the melancholy catastrophe and held many consultations with good mr wayland but all in vain it was reserved for your sweet notes to awaken and recall him to what i trust is indeed new life  tears filled aurelias eyes and she could only murmur something about being very glad  yes pursued dr godfrey it is as if i saw him rising from his living tomb in all senses of the word i find that your artless sunday evening conversations have even penetrated the inner hopeless gloom still more grievous than the outer darkness in which he lived  indeed sir i never meant to be presumptuous  gods blessing on such presumption my good child if you had been fully aware of his state of mind you might never have ventured nor have touched the sealed heart as you have done as i perceive in your ignorance out of your obedient reverence to the lords day am i not right  yes sir i thought one could not repeat plays and poems on sunday and i was frightened when i found those other things were strange to him but he bade me go on  for the sake of the music of your voice as he tells me at first but afterwards because you became the messenger of hope to one who had long lain in the shadow of death thinking pardon and mercy too much out of reach to be sought for you have awakened prayer within him once more  she could not speak and dr godfrey continued you will be glad to hear that i am to see the curate on my way through brentford and arrange with him at times to read prayers in the outer room what is it he added you look somewhat doubtful  only sir perhaps i ought not to say so but i cannot think mr belamour well ever care for poor mr greaves if he could only hear that gentleman who comes to sedhurst i never knew how much fire could be put into the service itself and yet i have often been at carminster cathedral  true my dear young lady these enthusiasts seem to be kindling a new fire in the church but i am not yet so convinced of their orthodoxy and wisdom as to trust them unreservedly and zeal pushed too far might offend our poor recluse and alienate him more than ever he is likely to profit more by the direct words of the church herself read without personal meaning than by the individual exhortations of some devout stranger  yes sir thank you i never meant to question your judgment indeed i did not  the horses were here announced and dr godfrey said  then i leave him to you with a grateful heart i am beginning to hope that there is much hypochondriacism in his condition and that this may pass away with his despondency i hope before many weeks are over to come and visit him again before i go to my parish in dorsetshire  then with a fatherly blessing the canon took his leave  he was scarcely gone before there was a great rustling in the hall and mrs phoebe and mrs delia treforth were announced aurelia was surprised for she had been decidedly sensible of their disapproval when she made her visit of ceremony after her entertainment by them she however had underrated the force of the magnet of curiosity they had come to inquire about the visitor who had actually spent a night at the park they knew who he was for ned godfrey had been a frequent guest at bowstead in the youth of all parties and they were annoyed that he had not paid his respects to them  it would have been only fitting to have sent for us as relations of the family to assist in entertaining him said mrs phoebe pray miss did my eccentric cousin place you in the position of hostess  it fell to me madam said aurelia  you could have asked for our support said mrs phoebe severely it would have become you better above all then sir amyas belamour himself was here  he has only been here while i was with you madam and was gone before my return  that is true but mrs phoebe looked at the girl so inquisitively that her colour rose in anger and exclaimed madam i know not what you mean  there sister said mrs delia more kindly she is but a child and bet batley is a gossip she would not know his honour in the dark from the blackamoor going down to visit his sweetheart  very glad was aurelia when the ladies curtsied themselves out of her summer parlour declaring they wished to speak to mrs aylward who she knew could assure them of the absurdity of these implied suspicions  and mrs aylward who detested the two ladies and repelled their meddling stiffly assured them both of miss delavies discretion and her own vigilance which placed visits from the young baronet beyond the bounds of possibility supposing his honour should again visit his uncle she should take care to be present at any interview with the young lady she trusted that she knew her duty and so did miss delavie     chapter xv the queen of beauty       o bright regina who made thee so faire     who made thy colour vermeilie and white     now marveile i nothing that ye do hight     the quene of lovechaucer   only a week had elapsed before the quiet of bowstead was again disturbed by the arrival of two grooms with orders that everything should be made ready the next day for the arrival of my lady who was on her way to carminster for a few weeks and afterwards to bath forthwith mrs aylward and her subordinates fell into a frenzy of opening shutters lighting fires laying down carpets and uncovering furniture scrubbing was the daily task for the maids and there was nothing extra possible in that line but there was hurry enough to exacerbate the temper and when aurelia offered her services she was tartly told that she could solely be useful by keeping the children out of the way for in spite of all rebuffs they persisted in haunting the footsteps of the housekeeper and maids fay gazing with delight at the splendours that were revealed amy proffering undesired aid letty dancing in the most inconvenient places romancing about her mamma and little brother and making sure that her big beautiful brother was also coming  the were very unwilling to let aurelia call them away to practise them in bridling curtseying and saying yes madam according to the laws of good breeding so carefully inculcated by sister at home so anxious was she that she tried them over and over again till they were wearied out and became so cross and naughty that nothing restored goodhomour except gathering blackberries to feast brother archer  the intelligence produced less apparent excitement in the dark chamber when aurelia in an eager awestricken voice began o sir have you heard that my lady is coming he calmly replied  the sounds in the house have amply heralded her to say nothing of jumbo  i wonder what she will do  you will not long have known her my fair friend without discovering that she is one of the most inscrutable of her sex the mere endeavour to guess at her plans only produces harassing surmises and alarms  do you think sir she can mean to take me away  i suppose that would be emancipation to you my poor child  i should dance to find myself going home said aurelia yet how could i bear to leave my little girls or you sir oh if you could only live at the great house at home i should be quite happy  then you would not willingly abandon the recluse  indeed she said with a quivering in her voice i cannot endure the notion you have been so kind and good to me sir and i do so enjoy coming to you and you would be all alone again with jumbo oh sir could you not drive down if all the coach windows were close shut up you would have my papa to talk to  and what would your papa say to having a miserable old hermit inflicted on him  he would be only too glad  no no my gentle friend there are other reasons i could not make my abode in lady belamours house while in that of my nephew my natural home i have a right to drag out what remains of the existence of mine nay are you weeping my sweet child that must not be your young life must take no darkness from mine even should lady belamours arbitrary caprice bear you off without another meeting remember that you have given me many more happy hours than i ever supposed to be in store for me and have opened doors which shall not be closed again  you will get some one to recite to you entreated aurelia her voice most unsteady  godfrey shall seek out some poor scholar or exhausted poetaster with a proviso that he never inflicts his own pieces on me said mr belamour in a tone more as if he wished to console her than as it were a pleasing prospect never fear gentle monitress i will not sink into the stagnation from which your voice awoke me neither godfrey nor my nephew would allow it come let us put it from our minds it has always been my experience that whatever i expected from my much admired sisterinlaw that was the exact reverse of what she actually did therefore let us attend to topics though i wager that you have no fresh acquisitions for me today  i am ashamed sir but i could not fix my mind even to a most frightful description of wolves in mr thomsons winter  that were scarcely a soothing subject but we might find calm in something less agitating and more familiar perhaps you can recall something too firmly imprinted on your memory to be disturbed by these emotions  aurelia bethought herself that she must not disappoint her friend on what might prove their last evening she began very unsteadily                     hence loathed melancholy   however by the time jonsons learned sock was on her mechanical repetition had become animated and she had restored herself to equanimity when the clock struck nine her auditor added his thanks in case we should not meet again thus let me beg of my kind visitor to wear this ring in memory of one to whom she has brought a breath indeed from lallegro itself it will not be too large it was made for a lady  and amid her tearful thanks she felt a light kiss on her fingers revealing to her that the hermit must possess a beard a fact which in the closeshaven hanoverian days conveyed a sense of squalor and neglect almost amounting to horror  in her own room she dropped many a tear over the ring which was of course the cupid intaglio and she spent the night in strange mixed dreams and yearnings divided between her father betty and eugene on the one hand and mr belamour and the children on the other homesick as she sometimes felt dull as bowstead was she should be sadly grieved to leave those to whom she felt herself almost necessary though her choice must needs be for her home  early the next day arrived an old roomy berlin loaded heavily with luggage and so stuffed with men and maids that four stout horses had much ado to bring it up to the door the servants grumbling heartily declared that my lady was only going to lie here for a single night and that sir amyas was not with her  late in the afternoon a couple of outriders appeared to say that the great lady was close at hand and aurelia in her best blue sacque and india muslin cap edged with flanders lace had her three little charges all in white with red shoes red sashes and red ribbons in their caps drawn up in the hall to welcome their mother  up swept the coach with six horses mr dove behindrunners in fact who at times rested themselves by an upright swing on the footboard  the door of the gorgeous machine was thrown open and forth sprang a pretty little boy next descended the friendly form of mrs dove then a smart person who was my ladys own woman and finally something dazzlingly grand and beautiful in feathers light blue and silver  aurelia made her reverence and so did the little triad the great lady bent her head and gave a light kiss to the brow of each child and the boy sprang forward crying you are my sisters you must play with me and do whatever i choose amoret and he began kissing on the spot but fidelia regarding must as a forbidden word looked up at aurelia with an inquiring protest in her eyes but it was not heeded in the doubt whether to follow lady belamour who with a stately greeting to mrs aylward had sailed into the withdrawingroom the question was decided by mrs aylward standing back to make room and motioning her forward so she entered letty preceding her and fay clinging to her  by the hearth stood the magnificent figure holding out a long beautiful beringed hand which aurelia shyly kissed bending as before a queen while her forehead received the same slight salute as had been given to the little girls my cousin delavies own daughter said the lady you have the family likeness  so i have been told madam  your father is well i hope  he was pretty well i thank you ladyship when i heard from my sister ten days ago  i shall see him in a weeks time and shall report well of his little daughter said lady belamour kindly i am under obligations to you my dear you seem to have tamed my little savages  aurelia was amazed for the universal awe of my lady had made her expect a harsh and sever semiramis style of woman whereas she certainly saw a majestic beauty but with none of the terrors that she had anticipated the voice was musical and perfectly modulated the manner more caressing than imperious towards herself and studiously polite to the house keeper while orders were being given as to arrangements aurelia took in the full details of the person of whom she had heard so much it seemed incredible that lady belamour could have been mother to contemporaries of betty for she looked younger than betty herself her symmetry and carriage were admirable and well shown by the light blue habit laced richly and embroidered with silver a small round hat with a cluster of white ostrich feathers was placed among the slightly frizzed and powdered masses of mousecoloured hair surmounting a long ivory neck whose graceful turn the theme of many a sonnet was not concealed by the masculine collar of the habit the exquisite oval contour of the cheek the delicate ear and grecian profile were as perfect in moulding as when she had been sir jovians bride and so were the porcelain blue of the eyes the pencilled arches of eyebrow and the curve of the lips while even her complexion retained its smooth texture and tints of the lily and rose often as aurelia had heard of her beauty its splendour dazzled and astonished her even in this travelling dress  archer who was about a year older than his sisters was more like amoret than the other two with azure eyes golden curls and a plump rosy face full of fun and mischief tired of the confinement of the coach he was rushing round the house with amoret opening the doors and looking into the rooms the other little sisters remained beside aurelia till their mother said pointing to fay that child seems to mean to eat me with her eyes let all the children be with nurse dove mrs aylward miss delavie will do me the pleasure of supping with me at seven present my compliments to mr belamour and let him know that i will be with him at eight oclock on particular business then turning to the two children she asked their names and was answered by each distinctly with the orthodox madam at the end  you are improved little ones she said did cousin aurelia teach you  and mammy rolfe said constant fay  she must teach you next not to stare said lady belamour i intend to take one to be a companion to my boy in the country when i saw them before they were rustic little monsters but they are less unpresentable now call your sister children and as the two left the room she continued which do you recommend cousin  fidelia is the most reasonable madam said aurelia  but not the prettiest i trust she is too like her father with those dark brows and her eyes have a look deep enough to frighten one they will frighten away the men if she do not grow out of it  here the door burst open and without any preliminary bow master archer flew in crying out mamma mamma we must stay here the galleries are so long and it is such a place for whoophide  his sisters were following his bad example and rushing in with equal want of ceremony but though their mother held the boy unchecked on her knee aurelia saw how she could frown you forget yourselves she said  amoret looked ready to cry but at a sign from their young instructress they backed and curtsied and their mother reviewed them letitia was the most like the delavies but also the smallest while amoret was on the largest scale and would pair best with her brother who besides loudly proclaimed his preference for her and she was therefore elected to the honour of being taken home aurelia was requested as a favour to bid the childrens woman have the childs clothes ready repaired to her own room  the little wardrobe could only be prepared by much assistance from aurelia herself and she could attend to nothing else while the children were all devoted to archer and she only heard their voices in the distance tillas she was dressing for her teteatete supperfay came to her crying archer is a naughty boyhe said wicked wordshe called her ugly and had cuffed and pinched her  poor child she was tired out and disappointed and aurelia could only comfort her by hearing her little prayers undressing her and giving her the highlyesteemed treat of sleeping in cousin auras bed while the others were staying up as long as it pleased master archer this actually was the cause of my lady being kept waiting and an apology was needful fidelia was tired out and was crying  a peevish child i am glad i did not choose her  she is usually very good madam said aurelia eagerly  is she your favourite  i try not to make favourites madam  ah there spoke the true manor house tone said her ladyship rather mockingly maybe she will be a wit for she will never be a beauty but the other little one will come on in due time after amoret  your ladyship will find amoret a dear good affectionate child said aurelia only  reserve that for nurse so please you my good girl it is enough for me to see the brats on their good manners now and then you have had other recreationsshall i call them or cares i never supposed when i sent you here to attend on the children that the hermit of bowstead would summon you i assure you it is an extraordinary honour  i so esteem it madam said aurelia blushing  more honour than pleasure eh  a great pleasure madam  say you so and the glittering blue eyes were keenly scanning the modest face i should have thought a young maid like you would have had the dismals at the mere notion of going near his dark chamber i promise you it gives me the megrim migrainedl to look forward to it  i was affrighted at first madam said aurelia but mr belamour is so good and kind to me that i exceedingly enjoy the hours i spend with him  la child you speak with warmth we shall have you enamoured of a voice like the youth they make sonnets aboutwhats his name  narcissus madam said aurelia put out of countenance by the banter  oh you are learned is mr belamour your tutor pray andoh fie i have seen that ring before  he gave it to me yesterday faltered aurelia in case you should intend to take me away and i should not see him again i hope i was not wrong in accepting it madam  wrong little fool assuredly not said my lady laughing it is an ensign of victory why child you have made a conquest worthy oflet me see you or the wits could tell me who it was that stormed the very den of cocytus and bore off the spoil  aurelia liked the tone too little to supply the names yet she felt flattered but she said quietly i am happy to have been the means of cheering him  the grave artlessness of the manner acted as a kind of check and lady belamour said in a different tone seriously child the family are truly obliged for your share in rousing the poor creature from his melancholy my good man made the attempt but all in vain what do you to divert him  in inquires of this kind the supper hour passed and lady belamour was then to keep her appointment with her brotherinlaw she showed so much alarm and dread that aurelia could not but utter assurances and encouragements which again awoke that arch manner partly bantering partly flattering which exercised a sort of pleasant perplexing fascination on the simple girl  after being dismissed aurelia went in search of mrs dove whom she found with molly taking stock of amorets little wardrobe the good woman rose joyfully oh my dear missie i am right thankful to see you looking so purely i dont know how i could have held up my head to miss delavie if i had not seen you  ah you will see my sister and all of them cried aurelia a sudden rush of homesickness bringing tears to her eyes in oblivion alike of her recluse and her pupils oh if i were but going with you but what folly am i talking you must not let them think i am not happy for indeed i am will you kindly come to my room dear nurse and i will give you a packet for them  mrs dove willingly availed herself of the opportunity of explaining how guiltless she had been of the sudden separation at knightsbridge four months back she had been in such haste to ride after and overtake the coach that she had even made dove swear at her for wanting to give the horses no time to rest and she had ridden off on her own particular pillion long before the rest she had been surprised that she never succeeded in catching up the carriage but never suspected the truth till she had dismounted in hanover square and asked whether miss were with my lady nobody knew anything about miss delavie nor expected her and the good womans alarm was great until she had had an interview with her ladyship when she was told not to concern herself about the young lady who was safely bestowed in the country with the miss wayland but that it was here if youll believe me missie i was as innocent as the babe unborn and so was his honour sir amyas indeed my lady gave him to understand that she had put you to boardingschool with his little sisters  oh nurse that is impossible  lawkaday missie theres nothing my lady wouldnt say to put him off the scent bless you tis not for us servants to talk or i could tell you tales but there mums the word as my dove says or he wouldnt ha sat on his box these twenty year  my lady is very kind to me said aurelia with a little assumption of her fathers repressive manner  im right glad to hear it miss aureely a sweet lady she can be when she is in the mood though nothing like so sweet as his honour tis ingrain with him down to the bone as i may sayand i should know having had him from the day he was weaned to see him come up to the nussery and toss about his little brother would do your very heart good and then he sits him down without a bit of pride and will have me tell him all about our journey up to lunnon and the fair and the play and all and the same with dove in the stables he would have the whole story and how we was parted at knightsbridge i never so much as guessing where you wasyou that your sister had given into my care at last one day when i was sitting a darning of stockings in the window at the back where i can see out over to the green fields up his honour comes and says he with his finger to his lips set your heart at rest nurse ive found her then he told me how he went down to see his old uncle mr wayland had been urging him on one side that twas no more than his duty and her ladyship on the other would have it that mr belamour was right down melancholy mad and would go into a raving fit if his nevvy did but go near the place  she did not say that  oh yes she did miss ill take my oath of it for i was in the coach with master wayland on my knee when she was telling a lady how hard it was they could have no use of bowstead because of sir jovians brother being there who had got the black melancholics and could not be removed the lady says how good she was to suffer it and she answers that there was no being harsh with poor sir jovians brother though he had a strange spleen at her and her son and always grew worse when they did but go near the house but that some measures must be taken when her son came of age or was married  but he came at last  he said he wanted to see for himself and thought he could at least find out from the servants whether his uncle was in the state they reported and there he found his three little sisters and that you was their tutoress and they couldnt say enough about you nor the poor gentleman neither i didnt see her nurse says he but theres a bit of her own sweet fingers work and sure enough i knew it for it was a knot of the very ribbon you had in your hair the day i came to talk to your sister about the journey  that was what amy told me she gave him  nothing loth would he be to take it miss though says he dont you let my mother know i have tracked her nurse says he it is plain enough why she gives out that i am not to go near my uncle and if she guessed where i had been she would have some of her fancies now your honour my dear says i youll excuse your old nurse but her sister put her in my charge and though i bless heaven that you are no young rake yet you will be bringing trouble untold on her and hers if you go down there a courting of her unbeknownst no danger of that nurse says he why theres a shedragon down there meaning mrs aylward that was ready to drive me out of my own house when i did but speak of waiting to see her  no i am glad he will not come again yet it makes his uncle happy to see him i will keep out of the way if he does  right too miss a young lady never loses by discretion  oh do not speak inin that way said aurelia blushing at the implication besides he is going home with my lady to dear carminster  no no he remains with his regiment in town unless he rides down later when he can have his leave of absence and my lady is at the bath he will not if he can help it for he is dead set against the young lady they want to marry him to and she is to be there what you have not heard it is my lady arabella sister to that there colonel as is more about our house than i could wish she is not by the same mother as him and my lord aresfield her father married a great heiress for his second wife whose father had made a great fortune by victualling the army in the war time not that this dowager countess as they call her is a bit like the real quality so that it is a marvel how my lady can put up with her only moneybags will make anything go down mores the pity and my lady is pressed you see with her losses at play it was about this match that sir amyas was sent down to battlefield the countesss place in monmouthshire when he came to carminster last summer and his body servant mr grey that has been about him from a child told me all about it this lady belle as they call her is only about fourteen and such a spoilt little vixen that they say nobody has been able to teach her so much as to read for her mother the dowager never would have her crossed in anything and now she has got too headstrong for any of em mr grey said dressing for supper they heard the most horrid screams and thought some one must be killed at least sir amyas was for running out but at the door they met a wench who only said bless you thats nought its only my young lady in her tantrums so in the servants hall grey heard it was all because her mamma wouldnt let her put on two suits of pearls and dimonds both together she lies on her back and rolls and kicks till she gets her own way and by what the servants say the dowager heerself aint much better to her servants her woman had got a black eye she had given her with her fan she has never had no breeding you see and there are uglier stories about her than i like to tell you miss aureely and as to the young lady sir amyas saw her with his own eyes slap the lackeys face for bringing her brown sugar instead of white she is a little dwarfish thing that puts her finger in her mouth and sulks when she is not flying out into a rage but colonel mar is going to have her up to a boardingschool to mend her manners and he and my lady are as much bent on marrying his honour to her as if she was a perfect angel  they never can  well miss they do most things they have a mind to and they mean to do this before my ladys husband comes home  but mr belamour is his nephews guardian  thats what my lady is come down here for either she will get his consent out of him or she will make the poor gentleman out to be non compos and do without him  oh nurse he is the wisest cleverest gentleman i ever saw except my papa  do you say do miss but you are young you see a gentleman to shut himself up in the dark like that must needs be astray in his wits  that is because of his eyes and his wound nobody could talk to him and doubt his reason  well missie i hope you are in the right but what my ladys interest is that she is apt to carry out one way or tother bless me if that be not master archer screaming i thought he was fast off to sleep there never was a child for hating the dark yes yes im coming my dearie lack a daisy if his mamma heard     chapter xvi auguries       venus thy eternal sway     all the race of man obey                       euripides anstice   aurelia sat up late to finish her despatches to the beloved ones at home and pack the little works she had been able to do for each though my ladys embroidery took up most of her sedentary hours mrs dove undertook the care of the guineas worth of presents to the little sisters from sir amyas which the prudent nurse advised her to withhold till after master archer was gone as he would certainly break everything to pieces he was up betimes careering about the garden with all his sisters after him imperiously ordering them about but nevertheless bewitching them all so that amoretta was in ecstasies at her own preferment scarcely realising that it would divide her from the others while letty made sure that she should soon follow and fidelia gravely said i shall always know you are loving me still amy as nurse rolfe does  lady belamour breakfasted in her own room at about ten oclock her woman mrs loveday a small trim active person with the worn and sharpened remains of considerable prettiness of the miniature brunette style was sent to summon miss delavie to her apartment and inspect the embroidery she had been desired to execute for my lady three or four bouquets had been finished and the maid went into such raptures over them as somewhat to disgust their worker who knew that they were not half so well done as they would have been under bettys direction however mrs loveday bore the frame to her ladyships room following aurelia who was there received with the same stately caressing manner as before  good morning child your roses bloom well in the forenoon pity they should be wasted in darkness not but that you are duly appreciated there ah i can deepen them by what our unhappy recluse said of you i shall make glad hearts at carminster by his good opinion and who knows what preferment may come of iteh what is that loveday  it is work your ladyship wished me to execute said aurelia  handsomeyes but is that all i thought the notable mistress betty brought you up after her own sort  i am sorry madam but i could not do it quickly at first without my sisters advice and i have not very much time between my care of the children and preparing repetitions for mr belamour  ha ha i understand there are greater attractions go on child mayhap it may be your own wedding gown you are working at if you finish it in time heavens what great wondering eyes the child has all in good time my dear i must talk to your father  it was so much the custom to talk to young maidens about their marriage that this did not greatly startle aurelia and lady belamour continued there child you have done your duty well by those little plagues of mine and it is mr waylands desire to make you a recompense you may need it in any change of circumstances  so saying she placed in aurelias hand five guineas the largest sum that the girl had ever owned and as visions arose of christmas gifts to be bestowed the thanks were so warm the curtsey so expressively graceful the smile so bright the soft eyes so sparkling that the great lady was touched at the sight of such simplehearted joy and said there there child that will do i could envy one whom a little makes so happy now you will be able to make yourself fine when my son brings home his bride orwho knowsyou may be a bride yourself first  that sounds thought aurelia as if mr belamour had made her relinquish the plan of that cruel marriage for i am sure i have not yet seen the man i am to marry  and with a lighter heart the young tutoress stood between fay and letty on the steps to see the departure her cheeks still feeling amorets last fond kisses and a swelling in her throat bringing tears to her eyes at the thought how soon that carriage would be at carminster yet there were sweet chains in the little hands that held her gown and in the thought of the lonely old man who depended on her for enlivenment  the day was long for amoret was missed and the two children were unusually fretful and quarrelsome without her disputing over the new toys which brother amyass guinea had furnished in demoralising profusion it was strange too see the difference made by the loss of the child who would give up anything rather than meet a look of vexation and would coax the others into immediate good humour there was reaction too after the excitement for which the inexperienced aurelia did not allow at the twentieth bickering as to which doll should ride on the spotted hobbyhorse the face of lettys painted wooden baby received a scar and fays lost a leg whereupon aurelias endurance entirely gave way and she pronounced them both naughty children and sent them to bed before supper  then her heart smote her for unkindness and she sat in the firelight listless and sad though she hardly knew why longing to go up and pet and comfort her charges but withheld by the remembrance of bettys assurances that leniency in a like case would be the ruin of eugene  at last jumbo came to summon her and hastily recalling a cheerful air she entered the room with good evening sir you see i am still here to trouble you  i continue to profit by my gentle friends banishment tell me was my lady in a gracious mood  o sir how beautiful she is and how kind i know now why my father was so devoted to her and no one can ever gainsay her  the enchantress knows how to cast her spells she was then friendly  she gave me five guineas said aurelia exultingly she said mr wayland wished to recompense me  did he so if it came from him i should have expected a more liberal sum  but oh in a tone of infinite surprise and content this is more than i ever thought of indeed i never dreamt of her giving me anything sir may i write to your bookseller mr tonson and order a book of mr james thomsons seasons to give to my sister harriet who is delighted with the extracts i have copied for her  will not that consume a large proportion of the five guineas my generous friend  i have enough left there is a new gown which i never have worn which will serve for the new clothes my lady spoke of to receive her sons bride  she entered on that subject then  only for a moment as she took leave oh sir is it possible that she can know all about this young lady  what have you heard of her  sir they say she is a dreadful little vixen  who say is she known at carminster  no sir said aurelia disconcerted it was from nurse dove that i heard what sir amyass man said when he came back from battlefield i know my sister would chide me for listening to servants  nevertheless i should be glad to hear was the servant old grey then he is to be depended on what did he say  aurelia needed little persuasion to tell all that she had heard from mrs dove and he answered thank you my child it tallies precisely with what the poor boy himself told me  then he has told his mother will she not believe him  it does not suit her to do so and it is easy to say the girl will be altered by going to a good school in fact there are many reasons more powerful with her than the virtue and happiness of her son he added bitterly theres the connection forsooth as if lady aresfield were fit to bring up an honest mans wife and theres the fortune to fill up the void she has made in the delavie estates  can no one hinder it sir cannot you  as a last resource the poor youth came hither to see whether the guardian whose wardship has hitherto been a dead letter were indeed so utterly obdurate and helpless as had been represented  and you have the power  so far as his fathers will and the injunctions of his final letter to me can give it i have full power my consent is necessary to his marriage while still a minor and i have told my lady i will never give it to his wedding a mar  i was sure of it and it is not true that they will be able to do without it  without it have you heard any more you pause i seeshe wishes to declare me of unsound mind is that what you mean  so nurse dove said sir faltered aurelia but it seemed too wicked too monstrous to be possible  i understand he said i thought there was an implied threat in my sweet sisterinlaws soft voice when she spoke of my determined misanthropy well i think we can guard against that expedient after all it is only till my nephew comes of age or till his stepfather returns that we must keep the enchantress at bay then the poor lad will be safe providing always that she and her colonel have not made a rake of him by that time alas what a wretch am i not to be able to do more for him child you have seen him  i danced with him sir but i was too much terrified to look in his face and i saw his cocked hat over the thorn hedge  fancy free muttered mr belamour fair exile for a cocked hat and diamond shoebuckles you would not recognise him again nor his voice  no sir he scarcely spoke and i was attending to my steps  mr belamour laughed and then asked aurelia for the passage in the iliad where venus carries off paris in a cloud he thanked her somewhat absently and then said  dr godfrey said something of coming hither before he goes to his living in dorsetshire may i ask of you the favour of writing and begging him to fix a day not far off mentioning likewise that my sisterinlaw has been here  to this invitation dr godfrey replied that he would deviate from the slow progress of his family coach and ride to bowstead spending two nights there the next week and to aurelias greater amazement she was next requested to write a billet to the mistresses treforth in mr belamours name asking them to bestow their company on him for the second evening of dr godfreys visit  you my kind friend will do the honours he said and we will ask mrs aylward to provide the entertainment  they will be quite propitiated by being asked to meet dr godfrey said aurelia shall you admit them sir  certainly you do not seem to find them very engaging company but they can scarce be worse than i should find in such an asylum as my charming sisterinlaw seems to have in preparation for me  oh i wish i had said nothing about that it is too shocking  forewarned forearmed as the proverb says do you not see my amiable friend that we are providing a body of witnesses to the sanity of the recluse even though he may in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell  the visit took place dr godfrey greeted miss delavie as an old friend and the next day pronounced mr belamour to be so wonderfully invigorated and animated that he thought my ladys malignant plan was really likely to prove the best possible stimulus and cure  then the canon gratified the two old ladies by a morning call dined with aurelia and her pupils who behaved very well and with whom he afterwards played for a whole hour so kindly that they placed him second in esteem to their big and beautiful brother mrs phoebe and mrs delia came dressed in the faded splendours of the louis xiv period just at twilight and were regaled with coffee and pound cake they were a good deal subdued though as aurelia listened to the conversation it was plain enough what mr belamour meant when he said that his cousin delia was something of the coquette  still they asked with evident awe if it were true that their unfortunate cousin really intended to admit them and they evidently became more and more nervous while waiting for jumbos summons dr godfrey gave his arm to mrs phoebe and mrs delia gripped hold of aurelias trembling all over declaring she felt ready to swoon and marvelling how miss delavie could ever have ventured all alone too  after all things had been made much less formidable than at aurelias first introduction the sittingroom was arranged as it was when mr greaves read prayers with a very faint light from a shrouded lamp behind the window curtain to new comers it seemed pitchy darkness but to aurelia and dr godfrey it was a welcome change allowing them at least to perceive the forms of one another and of the furniture from a blacker gulf being the doorway to the inner room came mr belamours courteous voice of greeting to his kinswomen who were led up by their respective guides to take his hand after which he begged them to excuse the darkness since the least light was painful to him still if they would be seated he would remain where he was and enjoy the society he was again beginning to be able to appreciate he was in fact sitting within his own room with eyes covered from even the feeble glimmer in the outer room  it was some minutes before they recovered their selfpossession but dr godfrey and mr belamour began the conversation and they gradually joined in it was chiefly full of reminiscences of the lively days when dr godfrey had been a young cantab visiting his two friends at bowstead and phoebe and delia were the belles of the village aurelia scarcely opened her lips but she was astonished to find how different the two sisters could be from the censorious contemptuous beings they had seemed to her the conversation lasted till suppertime and mr belamour as they took their leave made them promise to come and see him again then they were conducted back to the supperroom mrs phoebe mysteriously asking is he always like this  the experiment had been a great success and aurelia completed it by asking mrs phoebe to take the head of the suppertable     chapter xvii the victim demanded       and if thou sparest now to do this thing     i will destroy thee and thy land alsomorris   well sir have you seen my lady  not a year older than when i saw her last returned major delavie who had just dismounted from his trusty pony at his garden gate and accepted bettys arm and what think you he added pausing that corporal palmer might hear his news she has been at bowstead and brings fresh tidings of our aura the darling is as fair and sprightly as a may morning and beloved by all who come near herbless her  palmer echoed a fervent amen and betty asked is this my ladys report  suspicious betty you will soon be satisfied said the major in high glee did not dove meet me at the front door and mrs dove waylay me in the hall to tell me that the child looked blooming and joyous and in favour with all gentle and simple come her eugene ay and harriet and arden too let us hear what my little maid says for herself for look here and he held aloft aurelias packet at sight of which eugene capered high and all followed into the parlour  mr arden was constantly about the house there was no doubt that he would soon be preferred to a chapter living in buckinghamshire and he had thus been emboldened to speak out his wishes it would have been quite beneath the dignity of a young lady of miss harriets sensibility to have consented and she was in the full swing of her game at coyness and reluctance daily vowing that nothing should induce her to resign her liberty and that she should be frightened out of her life by mr ardens experiments while her father had cordially received the minor canons proposals and already treated him as one of the family simpering had been such a fattening process that harriet was beginning to resume more of her good looks than had ever been brought back by maydew  open the letter betty thanks arden as the minor canon began to pull off his boots only take care of my knee my lady has brought down her little boy and one of aurelias pupils i declare they are a perfect pair of loves what are you fumbling at betty  the seal sir it is a pity to break it said betty producing her scissors from one of her capacious pockets it is an antique is it not mr arden  a very beautiful gem a sleeping cupid he answered  how could the child have obtained it said harriet  i can tell you said the major from old belamour my lady was laughing about it the little puss has revived the embers of gallantry in our poor recluse says she he has actually presented her with a ring nay a ring bearing love himself  somehow the speech even at second hand jarred upon betty but her father was delighted with my ladys description of his favourite and the letters were full of contentment when the two sisters arrayed in their stiffest silks went up to pay their respects to my lady the next afternoon their reception was equally warm my lady was more caressing to her old acquaintance betty than that discreet personage quite liked while she complimented and congratulated harriet on her lover laughing at her bashful disclaimers in such a charmingly teasing fashion as quite to win the damsels heart and convince her that all censure of lady belamour was vile slander the children were sent for and amoret was called on to show how cousin aurelia had taught her to dance sing and recite the tiny minuet performed by her and archer was an exceedingly pretty exhibition as far as it went but the boy had no patience to conclude and jumped off into an extemporary pas seul which was still prettier and as amoret was sole exhibitor of the repetition of hays hare and many friends he became turbulent after the first four lines and put a stop to the whole  then came in a tall large handsome dashinglooking man with the air of a beau sabreur whom lady belamour presented to her cousins as colonel mar my sons commandant you know who has been kind enough to take carminster on his way so as to escort me to the bath i am such a sad coward about highwaymen and we are to meet dear lady aresfield there to talk over a little matter of business  colonel mar made a magnificent bow carelessly not to say impertinently scanned the two ladies and having evidently decided they had neither beauty nor fashion to attract him caught up little amy in his arms and began to play a half teasing half caressing game with the children betty thought it high time to be gone and as she took leave was requested to send up her little brother to play with his cousins this did not prove a success for eugene constituted himself champion to amoret of whom archer was very jealous though she was his devoted and submissive slave master delavies rustic ways were in consequence pronounced to be too rude and rough for the dainty little townbred boy the fine ladies pet  the major dined at the great house but came home so much dismayed and disgusted that he could hardly mention even to betty what he had seen and heard he only groaned out at intervals this is what the service is coming to that fop to be that poor lads commanding officer that rake to be always hovering about my cousin  others spoke out more plainly stories were afloat or orgies ending in the gallant colonel being under the supper table a thing only too common but not in the house of a solitary lady who had only lately quitted the carousers half the dependants on the estate were complaining of the guests swaggering overbearing treatment of themselves or of his insolence to their wives or daughters and betty lived in a dreadful unnamed terror lest he should offer some impertinence to her father which the veterans honour might not brook however there was something in the old soldiers dignity and long service that kept the arrogance of the younger man in check and repressed all bluster towards him  demands for money were as usual made but the settlement of accounts was deferred till the arrival of hargrave the family man of business who came by coach to bath and then rode across to carminster the major dined that day at the great house and came home early with something so strange and startled about his looks that betty feared that her worst misgivings were realised it was a relief to hear him say come hither betty i want a word with you at least it was no duel  what is it dear sir she asked as she shut his study door is it come at last must we quit this place  no i could bear that better but what do you think she asks of me nowto give my little aurelia my beautiful darling to that madman in the dark  oh exclaimed betty in a strange tone of discovery may i inquire what you said  i saidi scarce know what i said i declared it monstrous and not to be thought of for a moment and then she went on in her fashion that would wile a bird off a bush declaring that no doubt the proposal was a shock but if i would turn the matter over i should see it was for the dear childs advantage belamour dotes on her and after being an old mans darling for a few years she may be free in her prime with an honourable name and fortune  i dare say as if one could not see through the entire design my lady would call her sisterinlaw to prevent her being daughterinlaw  that fancy has had no aliment and must long ago have died out  listen to nurse dove on that matter  women love to foster notions of that sort  nay sir you believe as i do that the poor child was conveyed to bowstead in order that the youth might lose sight of her and since he proves refractory to the match intended for him this further device is found for destroying any possible hope on his part  i cannot say what may actuate my lady but if amyas belamour be the man i knew and as the childs own letters paint him he is not like to lend himself to any such arrangement  comes the offer from him or is it only a scheme of my ladys  he never writes more than a signature but hargrave is empowered to make proposals to me very handsome proposals too were not the bare idea intolerable  aurelia is not aware of it i am sure said betty to whom hargrave had brought another packet of cheerful innocent despatches of which as usual the unseen friend in the dark was the hero  certainly not and i hope she never may be i declared the notion was not to be entertained for a moment but urania never in her life would take no for an answer and she talked me nearly out of my senses then bade me go home think it over and discuss it with my excellent and prudent daughter as if all the thinking and talking in the world could make it anything but more intolerable  his prudent daughter understood in the adjective applied to her a hint which the wily lady would not have dared to make direct to the highspirited old soldier namely that the continuance of his livelihood might depend on his consent betty knew likewise enough of the terrible world of the early eighteenth century to be aware that even such wedlock as this was not the worst to which a woman like lady belamour might compel the poor girl who was entirely in her power and out of reach of all protection unlessan idea broke in on herif we could but go to bowstead sir she said then we could judge whether the notion be as repugnant to aurelia as it is to us and whether mr belamour be truly rational and fit to be trusted with her  i tell you betty it is a mere absurdity to think of it i believe the child is fond of and grateful to the poor man but if she supposed she loved him it would be mere playing on her ignorance  then we could take her safely home and bear the consequences together without leaving her alone exposed to any fresh machination of my lady  you are right betty you have all your sainted mothers good sense i will tell my cousin that this is not a matter to be done blindly and that i withhold my reply till i have seen and spoken with her and this most preposterous of suitors  yes it is the only way said betty we can then judge whether it be a cruel sacrifice or whether the child have affection and confidence enough in him to be reasonably happy with him what is his age father  let me see poor sir jovian was much older than urania but he died at forty years old his brother was some three years his junior he cannot be above fortysix or seven that is not the objection but the moody melancholythink of our gay sprightly child  we will see sir  we mistress betty the cost will be severe without you  nay sir i cannot rest without going too you might be taken ill  you cannot trust a couple of old campaigners like palmer and me what did we do without you  got lamed for life said betty saucily no i go on a pillion behind palmer and my grandfathers diamond ring shall pay expenses  sir archibalds ring that he put on two baby fingers of yours when he went off to scotland  better part with that then resign my aurelia in the dark uncertain whether it be for her good     chapter xviii the proposal       love sweetest lies concealed in nightt moore   the major rode up to the great house to announce that he would only give his answer after having conferred with both his daughter and the suitor  with tears in her beautiful blue eyes lady belamour demanded why her dear cousin harry could not trust the urania he had known all her life to decide what was for the happiness of the sweet child whom she loved like her own  she made him actually feel as if it were a cruel and unmerited suspicion but she did not over come him madam he said it would be against my orders as father of a family to give my child away without doing my poor best for her  there in spite of all obstacles suggested and all displeasure manifested he stuck fast until without choosing to wait till a shower of sleet and rain was over vexation and perplexity always overset his health and the chill added to them rendered him so ill the next morning that betty knew there was no chance of his leaving his room for the next month or six weeks and she therefore sent a polite and formal note to the great house explaining that he could not attend to business  this brought upon her the honour of a visit from the great lady herself down came the coachandfour and forth from it came lady belamour in a magnificent hoop the first seen in those parts managing it with a grace that made her an overwhelming spectacle in contrast with betty in her closefitting darkgrey homespun plain white muslin apron cap kerchief and ruggles scrupulously neat and fresh but unadorned the visit was graciously designed for good cousin harry but his daughter was obliged not unwillingly though quite truly to declare him far too suffering with pain and fever  la you there then said the lady that comes of the dear mans heat of temper i would have kept him till the storm was over but he was far too much displeased with his poor cousin to listen to me come cousin betty i know you are in all his counsels you will bring him to hear reason  the whole affair must wait madam till he is able to move  and if this illness be the consequence of one wet ride how can he be in a condition to take the journey  you best know madam whether a father can be expected to bestow his daughter in so strange a manner without direct communication either with her or with the other party  i grant you the idea is at first sight startling but surely he might trust to me and he knows amyas belamour poor man to be the very soul of honour yes and with all his eccentricity to have made no small impression on our fair aurelia depend upon it my dear betty romance carried the day and the damsel is more enamoured of the mysterious voice in the dark than she would be of any lusty swain in the ordinary light of day  all that may be madam but she is scarce yet sixteen and it is our duty to be assured of her inclinations and of the gentlemans condition  you will not trust me who have watched them both said lady belamour with her most engaging manner now look here my dear since we are two women together safe out of the hearing of the men i will be round with you i freely own myself imprudent in sending your sister to bowstead to take charge of my poor little girls but if you had seen the little savages they were you would not wonder that i could not take them home at once nor that i should wish to see them acquire the good manners that i remembered in the children of this house i never dreamt of mr belamour heeding the little nursery he has always been an obstinate melancholic lunatic confined to his chamber by day and wandering like a ghost by night refusing all admission moreover my good aylward had appeared hitherto a paragon of a duenna for discretion only over starched in her precision little did i expect to find my young lady spending all her evenings alone with him and the solitary hermit transformed into a gay and gallant bachelor like the friar of orders gray in the song and since matters have gone to such a length i as a woman who has seen more of the world than you have my dear good betty think it expedient that the friar and his charmer should be made one without loss of time we know her to be innocence itself and him for a very sidney for honour but the world  it is your doing madam exclaimed betty passionately completely overset by the insinuation you bid us trust you and then confess that you have exposed my sweet sister to be vilely slandered oh my aurelia why did i let you out of my sight she cried while hot tears stood in her eyes  i know your warmth my dear said lady belamour with perfect command of temper i tell you i blame myself for not having recollected that a lovely maiden can tame even a savage brute or that even in the sweet rural country walls have ears and trees have tongues not that any harm is done so far nor ever will be above all if your good father do not carry his romantic sentiments so far as to be his ruin a second time credit me betty they will not serve in any world save the imaginary one that crazed don quixote what advantage can the pretty creature gain she is only sixteen quite untouched by true passion she will obtain a name and fortune and become an old mans idol for a few years after which she will probably be at liberty by the time she is of an age to enjoy life  he is but fiveandforty said betty  well if she arouse him to a second spring there will be few women who will not envy her  you may colour it over madam said betty drawing herself up but nothing can conceal the fact that you confess yourself to have exposed my innocent helpless sister to malignant slander and that you assure me that the only course left is to marry the poor child to a wretched melancholic who has never so much as seen her face  you are outspoken miss delavie said lady belamour softly but with a dangerous glitter in her blue eyes i pardon your heat for your fathers sake and because i ascribe it to the exalted fantastic notions in which you have been bred but remember that there are bounds to my forbearance and that an agent in his state of health and with his stubborn ideas only remains on sufferance  my father has made up his mind to sacrifice anything rather than his child cried betty  my dear girl i will hear you no more you are doing him no service said lady belamour kindly you had better be convinced that it is a sacrifice or an unwilling one before you treat me to any more heroics  betty successfully avoided a parting kiss and remained pacing up and down the room to work off her indignation before returning to her father she was quite as angry with herself as with my lady for having lost her temper and so given her enemy an advantage more especially as when her distress became less agitating her natural shrewdness began to guess that the hint about scandal was the pure fruit of lady belamours invention as an expedient for obtaining her consent yet the mere breath of such a possibility of evil speaking was horror to her and she even revolved the question of going herself to bowstead to rescue her sister but even if the journey had been more possible her father was in no condition to be left to harriets care and there was nothing to be done except to wait till he could again attend to the matter calm herself as best she could so as not to alarm him and intercept all dangerous messages  several days had passed and though the major had not left his bed he had asked whether more had been heard from my lady and discussed the subject with his daughter when a letter arrived in due course of post it was written in a large bold hand and the signature across a crease in the paper was in the irregular characters that the major recognised as those of mr belamour   dear and honoured sir    proposals have been made to you on my behalf for the hand of your fair and amiable daughter miss aurelia delavie i am well aware how preposterous and even shocking they may well appear to you yet let me assure you on the faith of a man of honour that if you will entrust her to me wretched recluse though i be and will permit her to bear my name i will answer for her happiness and welfare situated as i am i cannot enter into further explanations but we are old acquaintance though we have not met for many years and therefore i venture to beg of you to believe me when i say that if you will repose confidence in me and exercise patience i can promise your admirable daughter such preferment as she is far from expecting she has been the blessing of my darkened life but i would never have presumed to ask further were it not that i have no other means of protecting her nor of shielding her from evils that may threaten her and that might prove far worse than bearing the name of                     your obedient servant to command                             amyas belamour  bowstead park dec 3rd 1737   enigmatical said betty  it could hardly be otherwise if he had to employ a secretary said her father who can have written for him  his friend dr godfrey most probably said betty it is well spelt as well as indited and has not the air of being drawn up by a lawyer  no it is not hargraves hand it is strange that he says nothing of the settlements  here is a postscript adding should you consent hargrave will give you ample satisfaction as to the property which i can settle on your daughter  of that i have no doubt said the major well betty on reflection if i were only secure that no force was put on the childs will and if i could exchange a few words face to face with amyas belamour i should not be so utterly averse as i was at first sight she is a good child and if she like him and find it not hard to do her duty by him she might be as happy as another and since she is out of our reach it might save her from worse what say you child  that last is the strongest plea with me said betty with set lips  they took another evening for deliberation but there was something in the tone of the letter that wrought on them and it ended in a cautious consent being given on the condition of the father being fully satisfied of his daughters free and voluntary acquiescence  after all he said to betty i shall be able to go up to bowstead for the wedding and if i find that her inclinations have been forced i can take her away at all risks     chapter xix wooing in the dark       you may put out my eyes with a balladmakers pen and hang me   up for the sign of blind cupidmuch ado about nothing   aurelia had been walking in the park with her two remaining charges when a bespattered messenger was seen riding up to the door and letitia dropped her hoop in her curiosity and excitement  lady belamour on obtaining the majors partial acquiescence had felt herself no longer obliged to vegetate at carminster but had started for bath while the roads were still practicable and had at the same time sent off a courier with letters to bowstead kind mrs dove had sent a little packet to each of the children but they found cousin auras sympathy grievously and unwontedly lacking and she at last replied to their repeated calls to here to share their delight that they must run away and display their treasures to molly and jumbo she must read her letters alone  the first she had opened was bettys telling her of her fathers illness which was attributed in great part to the distress and perplexity caused by lady belamours proposal had it not been for this indisposition both father and sister would have come to judge for themselves before entertaining it for a moment but since the journey was impossible he could only desire betty to assure her sister that no constraint should be put on her and that if she felt the least repugnance to the match she need not consider her obliged to submit more followed about the religious duty of full consideration and prayer before deciding on what would fix her destiny for life but all was so confusing to the girl entirely unprepared as she was that after hastily glancing on in search of an explanation which she failed to find she laid it aside and opened the other letter it began imperially     my cousin       no doubt you are already informed of the honour that has been done you by the proposal that mr amyas belamour has made to your father for your hand it is no slight compliment to a young maid like you from one of the most noted wits about town in the last reign and you will no doubt shew the good sense to esteem yourself fortunate beyond all reasonable expectations or deserts of your own as well as to act for the advantage of your family be assured that i shall permit no foolish flightiness nor reluctance to interfere with you true welfare i say this because as you well know your fathers affection is strong and blind and you might easily draw him into a resistance which could but damage both his health and his prospects on receiving the tidings of your marriage i promise to settle on him the manor house with an annuity of three hundred pounds but if he should support you in any foolish refusal i shall be obliged to inform him that i can dispense with his services therefore you will do wisely to abstain from any childish expressions of distaste  on your marriage you will of course have the enjoyment of the pin money with which mr belamour will liberally endow you and be treated in all respects as a married lady my daughters shall be sent to school unless you wish to make them your companions a little longer expecting to hear from you that you are fully sensible to the good fortune and the obligations you are under to me       i remain            yours c                 urania belamour   it was with a gasp of relief that aurelia discovered what was required of her marry mr belamour is that all then why should they all think i should so much dislike it my lady and my papa and sister and all nobody ever was so good to me and maybe i could make him a little happier though it is not what i expected of him to forget his mary oh no i am not afraid i might have been afraid six months ago but now it is a different thing i am not so foolish and my dear papa will have the manor house for ever and eugene will be able to go to a good school and have a pair of colours in good time a fortunate girl yes of course i am then mrs phoebe and mrs delia will not flout me any more even if young sir amyas should come here ah here are the little girls returning keep them here of course i will what toys and books i will get for them  yet when the time for her summons drew nigh a great dread and shyness overcame her lest mr belamour should begin on the subject and she only nerved herself by recollecting that he could have had no one to read to him her fathers letter of reply and that he was scarcely likely to speak without knowing the contents still it was only shyness and embarrassment that made her advance timidly but in one moment a new sensation a strange tremor came over her as instead of merely her fingertips her whole hand was grasped and fervently pressed and in the silence that ensued the throbbing of her heart and the panting of her breath seemed to find an echo however the wellknown voice began my fair visitor is very good in honouring me tonight  was it coming her heart gave such a throb that she could only murmur something inarticulate while there was a hasty repressed movement near her  you have heard from your father said mr belamour  my father is ill sir she faltered  ah yes so i was sorry to understand has he not sent a message to you through your sister  he has sir aurelia continued with difficulty to utter  there was another silence another space of tightened breath and beating heart absolutely audible and again a hushed restless movement heralded mr belamours next words did i no tell you truly that my lady devises most unexpected expedients  then would you not have it so sir asked aurelia in a bewildered voice of perplexity oh as again one of those echoes startled her tell me what it all means  hush listen to me said mr belamour in a voice that added to her undefined alarm by what seemed to her imperious displeasure as uncalled for as it was unusual but the usual fatherly gentleness immediately prevailed my child i should never have entertained the thought for a moment but forbut for lady belamour this sounds like no compliment he added catching himself up and manifesting a certain embarrassment and confusion very unlike his usual calm dignity of demeanour and thus adding to the strange fright that was growing upon aurelia but you must understand that i would noteven in semblancehave dreamt of your being apparently linked to age sorrow and infirmity save thatstrange as it may seemlady belamour has herself put into my hands the best means of protecting you and finally as i trust securing your happiness  you are very good sir she continued to breathe out amid the flutterings of her heart and the reply produced a wonderful outburst of ardour in a low but fervent voice you will you will you sweetest of angels you will be mine  there was something so irresistibly winning in the sound that it drew forth an answer from the maidens very heart oh yes indeed and before she could utter another word she was snatched into a sudden warm vehement embrace from which she was only partly released asnear but still not so near as she would have expectedthis extraordinary suitor seemed to remonstrate with his ardent self saying now now that will do so be it then my child he continued great will be the need of faith patience trust ay and of selfrestraint but let these be practised for a little space and all will be well  she scarcely heard the latter words the sense of something irrevocable and unfathomable was overpowering her the mystery of these sudden alterations of voice now near now far off was intolerable here were hands claiming her fervent eager breathings close upon her and that serious pensive voice going on all that time the darkness grew dreadful to her dizziness came over her she dashed aside the hands started up with a scream and amid the strange noises and flashes of a swoon knew no more till she heard mrs aylwards voice over her found the horrid smell of burnt feathers under her nose and water trickling down her face dim candlelight was round her and she perceived that she was on a low settee in the lobby  there she is coming round you may tell your master jumbo twas nothing but the mince pies  oh no began aurelia but her own voice seemed to come from somewhere else and being inexperienced in fainting she was frightened  that is right you are better now a drop of strong waters  aurelia choked and put them aside but was made to swallow the draught and revived enough to ask how came i here  jumbo must have carried you out maam and laid you here before ever he called any one said mrs aylward dear dear to think of your being taken like that but the tins of those mincepies are over large you must halve one next time  aurelia was sensible enough to the reproof of greediness to begin to protest against the mincepie theory but she recollected that she could not account for her swoon and thereupon became as red as she had been pale thus confirming the housekeepers opinion a sound of footsteps made her start up and cry whats that in nervous fright but mrs aylward declared it was fancy and as she was by this time able to walk she was conducted to her own room there she was examined on her recent diet and was compelled to allow the housekeeper to ascribe her illness to neglect of autumnal bloodletting and medicine and she only stave off the send for the barber and his lancet the next morning by promising to swallow a dose compounded of all that was horrible  she was altogether much shaken she dreamed strange dreams by night was capable of little by day was declared by the children to be cross and was much inclined to plead indisposition as an excuse for not visiting that alarming room in the evening indeed for the greater part of the day she felt as if she must avail herself of the pretext and as if she neither could nor would encounter that strange double creature in the dark but somehow she had been as much fascinated as terrified and in spite of her resolve she found herself mechanically following jumbo shuddering all over and as cold as ice  the dark chambers were warmed by german stoves so that the atmosphere was always equable and it seemed to revive her while a kind warm hand led her as usual to her seat and it was the usual gentle courteous paternal tone that addressed her how chill and trembling you are my poor child you were sadly alarmed last night  aurelia murmured some excuse about being very foolish  it was not you who was foolish was the reply and though her hand was retained it was evidently for the sake of warming it and comforting her not of caressing it in the startling mode of yesterday there was a pause during which her composure began to be restored and some inquiries whether she were quite recovered to which she replied with eager affirmatives feeling indeed quite herself again now that all was in its familiar state around her then this strange suitor spoke again it is a hard and cruel fate that my lady has sought to impose on you  oh do not say so sir i  no he interrupted somewhat hastily do not try to deny it my child i know better than you can what it would amount to believe me i only lend myself to her arrangement because i know no better means of guarding you and preserving you for better days  i know how kind you are sir  and you trust me  indeed i do  that is all i ask i shall never be a husband to you more than in name aurelia nor ask of you more than you give me now namely your sweet presence for a few hours in the evening without seeing me can you bear thus to devote your young life for a time at least  you know sir how glad i always am to be with you said aurelia relieved yet half regretting that strange fervour i will do my very best to please you  ah sweet child he began with a thrill of deep feeling in his voice but checking himself he continued all i ask is patience and trust for a timefor a timeyou promise it  with all my heart said aurelia  i will use my best endeavours to requite that trust my child he said is not the christian watchword faith not sight it must be yours likewise  i hope so she said scarcely understanding  he then interrogated her somewhat closely as to the letters which had prepared her for the proposal and as aurelia was far too simple to conceal anything under crossexamination mr belamour soon found out what her ladyships threats and promises had been  the manor house he said that is the original nucleus of the property which had hitherto gone to the heir male  so my sister told me said aurelia  that letter which dr godfrey read to me spoke of my poor brothers discomfort in holding it it is well if thus tardily she refund it though not as your price my poor child it should have been as matter of justice if not by her husbands dying wish so this is the alternative set before you has it been set before your father likewise  almost certainly she will have threatened to dismiss him if he do not consent it was that which made my sister decide on sending me here or what would become of him and eugene but i should think my lady knew my father better than to seem to offer any kind of price as you call it for me  precisely you have heard from this maternal sister of yours does he then give his consent  they say they will not have my inclinations forced and that they had rather undergo anything than that i should be driven toto  to be as much a sacrifice as iphigenia he concluded the sentence  indeed sir said aurelia quite restored i cannot see why they should imagine me to have such objections or want me to be so cautious and considerate i shall write to my papa that it is not at all repugnant to me for that you are very very good to me and if i can make your time pass ever so little more pleasantly it is a delight to me i am sure i shall like you better than if  stay stay child he said half laughing remember it is as a father that i ask you to love and trust the old recluse  she thought she had been forward crimsoned in the dark and retired into her shell for the rest of the evening she was glad when with his usual tact mr belamour begged for the recitation he knew she could make with the least effort of memory  at the end however she ventured to asksir shall i be permitted ever to see my father and sister  certainly my child in due time i hope you will enjoy full liberty though you may have to wait for it  aurelia durst not ask what was in her mind whether they would not come to the wedding but that one great hope began to outweigh all the strange future she began to say something about being too young ignorant and foolish for him but this was kindly set aside she hardly knew how mr belamour himself suggested the formula in which she might send her consent to lady belamour begging at the same time to retain the company of the little misses wayland to her father she wrote such a letter as might satisfy all doubts as to the absence of all repugnance to the match and though the major had sacrificed all to love and honour himself mariages de convenance were still so much the rule and wives bestowed in all passiveness with unawakened hearts so often proved loving and happy matrons that it would have been held unreasonable to demand more than absence of dislike on the part of the bride  therewith things returned to their usual course and she was beginning to feel as if all had been a dream when one evening about a week later her suitor appeared to have one of those embarrassing fits of youthful ardour her hand was passionately seized caressed toyed with by a warm strong hand and kissed by lips that left a burning impression and that were no longer hairy surely he had been shaving was the time for which he bade her wait his full recovery and the resumption of the youthfulness that seemed to come on him in fits and starts and then to ebb away and leave him the grave courteous old man she had first known and why was it always in a whisper that he spoke forth all those endearments which thrilled her with such strange emotions  when she came into the light she found her fourth finger encircled with an exquisite emerald ring which seemed to bind her to her fate and make her situation tangible another time she was entreated to give a lock of her hair and she of course did so though it was strange that it should confer any pleasure on her suitor in the dark     chapter xx the muffled bridegroom       this old fantastical duke of dark corners                                        measure for measure   there was some coming and going of mr hargrave in the ensuing weeks and it began to be known that miss delavie was to become the wife of the recluse mrs aylward evidently knew it but said nothing molly preferred a petition to be her waiting maid jumbo grinned as if overpowered with inward mirth the old ladies in the pew looked more sour and haughty than ever to discourage the artful minx and the little girls asked all manner of absurd and puzzling questions  my lady was still at bath and aurelia supposed that the marriage would take place on her return and that the major and betty would perhaps accompany her the former was quite in his usual health again and had himself written to give her his blessing as a good dutiful maiden and declare that he hoped to be with her for her wedding and to give himself to his honoured friend  she was the more amazed and startled when one sunday evening in spring mr hargrave came to her as she sat in her own parlour saying madam you will be amazed but under the circumstances the parson and myself being both here mr belamour trusts you will not object to the immediate performance of the ceremony  aurelia took some moments to realise what the ceremony was and then she cried oh but my father meant to have been here  mr belamour thinks it better not to trouble major delavie to come up said mr hargrave and as aurelia stood in great distress and disappointment at this disregard of her wishes he added i think miss delavie cannot fail to understand mr belamours wishes to anticipate my ladys arrival so that he may be as little harassed as possible with display and publicity you may rely both on his honour and my vigilance that all is done securely and legally  oh i know that said aurelia blushing but it is so sudden and i was thinking of my father  your honoured father has given full consent in writing said the steward your doubts and scruples are most natural my dear madam but under the circumstances they must give way for it would be impossible to mr belamour to go through a public wedding  that aurelia well knew though she had expected nothing so sudden or so private but she began to feel that she must allow all to be as he chose and she remembered that she had never pressed on him her longing for her fathers presence having taken it as a matter of course and besides having been far too shy to enter on the subject of her wedding so she rose up as in a dream saying shall i go as i am  i fear a fuller toilet would be lost upon the bridegroom said the lawyer with some commiseration as he looked at the beautiful young creature about to be bound to the heartbroken old hermit you will have to do me the honour of accepting my services in the part of father  he was a man much attached to the family and especially to mr belamour his first patron and was ready to do anything at his bidding or for his pleasure such private weddings were by no uncommon up to the middle of the last century the state law was so easy as to render gretna green unnecessary when the presence of any clergyman anywhere while the parties plighted their troth before witnesses was sufficient to legalise the union nor did any shame or sense of wrong necessarily attach to such marriages indeed they were often the resource of persons too bashful or too refined to endure the display and boisterous merriment by which a public wedding was sure to be attended every one knew of excellent and respectable couples who had not been known to be married till the knot had been tied for several days or weeksso that there was nothing in this to shock the bride and as usual she did as she was told and let mr hargrave lead her by her fingertips towards mr belamours apartments mrs aylward was waiting in the lobby with a fixed impassive countenance intended to imply that though obedient to the summons to serve as a witness it was no concern of hers on the stairs behind her the maids were leaning over the balusters stuffing their aprons into their mouths lest their tittering should betray them  the sittingroom was nearly but not quite dark for a lamp closely shaded cast a dim light on a prayerbook placed on a small table behind which stood poor mr greavesa black spectre whose white bands were just discernible below a face whose nervous disturbed expression was lost in the general gloom he carefully avoided looking at the bride fearing perhaps some appeal on her part such as would make his situation perplexing contempt and poverty had brought his stamp of clergymen very low and rendered them abject he had been taken by surprise and though assured that this was according to my ladys will and with the consent of the maidens father he was in an agony of fright shifting awkwardly from leg to leg and ruffling the leaves of the book as a door opened and the bridegroom appeared followed by jumbo  aurelia looked up with bashful eagerness and saw in the imperfect light a tall figure entirely covered by a long dark dressinggown a grey tight curled lawyers wig on the head and the upper part of the face sheltered from the scanty rays of the lamp by a large green shade  taking his place opposite to her as mr hargrave arranged them he bowed in silence to the clergyman who in a trembling voice began the rite which was to unite amyas belamour to aurelia delavie he intended to shorten the service but his nervous terror and the obscurity of the room made him stumble in finding the essential passages and blunder in dictating the vows thus increasing the confusion and bewilderment of poor little aurelia somehow her one comfort was in the touch of the hand that either clasped hers or held the ring on her fingera strong warm tender trustworthy hand neither as white nor as soft as she would have expected but giving her a comfortable sense both of present support and affection and of identity with that eager one which had sought to fondle and caress her there was a certain tremor about both but hers was from bashful fright his from scarcely suppressed eagerness  the steward had a form of certificate ready for signature when it was presented to the bridegroom he put up his hand for a moment as if to push back the shade but in dread of admitting even a feeble ray of light gave up the attempt took the pen and wrote amyas belamour where the clergyman pointed aurelia could hardly see what she was doing and knew she had written very badly the lawyer and housekeeper followed as witnesses and the bridegroom laying a fee of ten guineas on the desk took his bride by the hand and led her within the door whence he had issued it was instantly closed and at the same moment she was enfolded in a pair of rapturous arms and held to a breast whose throbs wakened response in her own while passionate kisses rained on her face mingled with ecstatic whispers and murmurs of mine mine my own  on a knock at the door she was hastily released and mr hargrave said here are the certificates sirmr belamour put one into her hand saying keep it always about you never part with it and now my child after all the excitement you have gone through you shall be subjected to no more tonight fare you well and blessings attend your dreams  strange that while he was uttering this almost peremptory dismissal she should feel herself in a clinging grasp most unwilling to let her go what did it all mean could she indeed be a wife when here she was alone treading the long dark stair in looks in habits in externals still only the little governess of my ladys children however she had hardly reached her room before there was a knock at the door and the giggling blushing entrance of molly with please maam madam belamour i wishes you joy with all my heart please cant i do nothing for you shall i help you undress or brush your hair  perhaps she expected a largesse in honour of the occasion but aurelia had spent all her money on christmas gifts and had nothing to bestow however she found on the breakfasttable a parcel addressed to madam belamour containing a purse with a startling amount of golden guineas in it she was rather surprised at the title which was one generally conferred on dignified matrons whose husbands were below the rank of knighthood such as the wives of country squires and of the higher clergy the calling her mother madam delavie had been treated as an offence by lady belamour and when the day had gone by with nothing else to mark it from others aurelia finding her recluse in what she mentally called his quiet rational mood ventured after thanking him modestly to inquire whether that was what she was to be called  it is better thus hes said you have every right to the title  she recollected that he was a baronets younger son a distinction in those days and that she had been told that his patent of knighthood had been made out though he had never been able to appear at court to receive the accolade and had never assumed the title so she only said very well sir i merely thought whether my lady would think it presuming  he laughed a little my lady will soon understand it he said her husband will be at home in a few weeks and now my dear madam belamour he add playfully tell me whether there is any wish that i can gratify  you are very kind sir  what does that pause mean my fair friend  i fear it is too much to ask sir but since you inquire what would please me most it would be if you could spare me to go to my sister harriets wedding  my child he said with evident regret i fear that cannot be it will not be prudent to make any move until mr waylands return but after that i can assure you of more liberty meantime let us consider what wedding present you would like to send her  aurelia had felt her request so audacious that she subsided easily and modestly suggested a teaservice she thought of porcelain but mr belamours views were of silver and it ended in the lady giving the cups and saucers and the gentleman the urn and the tea and coffee pots and other plate but it was a drawback to the pleasure of this munificence that the execution of the order had to be entrusted to mr hargrave the daring hope aurelia had entertained of shopping for a day with mrs aylward as an escort and choosing the last fashions to send to her sisters was quashed by the grave reply that it was better not for the present what was the meaning of all this mystery and when was it to end she felt that it would be ungrateful to murmur for mr belamour evidently was full of sorrow whenever he was obliged to disappoint her and much was done for her pleasure a charming little saddlehorse two ridinghabits with a groom and a horse for him were sent down from london for her benefit gifts showered upon her and whenever she found her husband in one of those perplexing accesses of tenderness she was sure to carry away some wonderful present a beautiful jewelled watch an etui case a fan a scentbottle or patchbox with a charming enamel of a butterfly the little girls were always looking for something pretty that she would show them in the morning and thought it must be a fine thing to have a husband who gave such charming things those caressing evenings however always frightened aurelia and sent her away vaguely uneasy often to lie awake full of a vague yearning and alarm and several days of restlessness would pass before she could return to her ordinary enjoyment of her days with the children and her evenings with mr belamour yet when there was any long intermission of those fits of tender affection she missed them sorely and began to fear she had given offence especially as this strangely capricious man seemed sometimes to repel those modest timid advances which at other times would fill him with illsuppressed transport then came longings to see and satisfy herself as to what was indeed the aspect of him whom she was learning to love  no wonder there was something unsettled and distressed about her overthrowing much of that gentle duteous ness which she had brought from home she wrote but briefly and scantily to her sister not feeling as if she could give full confidence she drifted away from some of the good habits enjoined on her feeling that as a married woman she was less under authority she was less thorough in her religious ways less scrupulous in attending to the childrens lessons and the general fret of her uncertainties told upon her temper with them they loved her heartily still and she returned their affection but she was not so uniformly patient and goodhumoured indeed since amorets departure some element of harmony was missing and it could not now be said that a whine a quarrel or a cry was a rare event even the giving up my ladys wearisome piece of embroidery had scarcely a happy effect for aurelia missed the bracing of the taskwork and the attention it required and the unoccupied time was spent in idle fretting a little selfconsequence too began to set in longing for further recognition of the dignities of madam belamour  the marriage had been notified to lady belamour and to major delavie and letters had been received from each my lady travelled to london early in april in company with lady aresfield and to the relief of the inmates of bowstead made no deviation thither no one else was officially told that the wedding had taken place but all the village knew it and mrs phoebe and mrs delia so resented it that they abandoned the state pew to madam belamour and the children made their curtsies more perpendicularly than ever and when formally invited to supper sent a pointed and ceremonious refusal so that aurelia felt hurt and angered     chapter xxi the sisters meeting       by all hope thou hast to see again     our aged father and to soothe his pain     i charge thee tell me hast thou seen the thing     thou callst thine husbandmorris   after numerous delays mr arden had at length been presented to the living of rundell canonicorum and in one of the last days of april harriet delavie had become his wife after a fortnight of festivities amongst their old carminster friends the happy couple were to ride pillionwise to take possession of tier new home passing through london and there spending time enough with some relations of the bridegroom to show harriet the wonders of the city  thence mrs arden sent an urgent invitation from her hospitable hostess to mrs belamour to come and spend some days in gracechurch street and share with her sister the pleasures of the first sight of london  i assure you wrote harriet that though they be woolstaplers it is all in the wholesale line and they are very genteel and wellbred persons who have everything handsome about them indeed it is upon the cards that the alderman may ere many years be passed be my lord mayor but yet he and his good wife have a proper appreciation of family and know how to esteem me as one of the delavies they would hold themselves infinitely honoured by your visit and if you were here we might even be invited to lady belamours and get tickets for ranelagh i called at my ladys door but she was not within nor has she returned my visit though i went in the aldermans own coach but if you were with me she would have no colour for neglect you being now her sisterinlaw though it makes me laugh to think of it but as we poor married ladies are compelled to obey our lords and masters and as mr belamour may chance to be too high in his notions to permit you to be a guest in this house as i told our good cousin arden was very like we intend to lie a night at brentford and remain there for a day trusting that your husband will not be so cruel as to prevent a meeting either by your coming to see us or our coming to see you in your present abode which i long to do it is a year since we parted and i cannot tell you how i long to clasp my beloved sister in my arms  harriet could not long more for such a meeting than did aurelia and there was it must be owned a little relief that it was harriet and not the severer judge betty who thus awaited her she could hardly brook the delay until the evening and even wondered whether it were not a wifes privilege to anticipate the hour but she did not venture and only hovered about impatient for jumbos summons she came in with a rapid movement that led mr belamour to say ha my fair visitor i perceive that you have some tidings to bring today  everything was rapidly poured out and she anxiously awaited the decision she had little hope of being allowed to go to gracechurch street and did not press for it but she could not refrain from showing her earnest desire for the sight of her sister so that it was plain that it would have been a cruel disappointment to her if she had been prevented from meeting the newlymarried couple she detected a certain sound of annoyance or perplexity in the tones that replied and her accents became almost plaintively imploring as she concluded pray pray sir do not deny me  no my child i could not be cruel enough for a refusal he answered i was but considering how most safely the thing may be contrived i know it would be your wish and that it would seem more befitting that you should act as hostess for your sister but i fear that must be for another time this is not my house and there are other reasons for which it would be wiser for you to receive no one here  it will be quite enough for me if i may only go to brentford to meet my dear dear harriet  then be it so my child present my compliments to mrs arden and entreat her to excuse the seeming inhospitality of the invalid  aurelia was overflowing with joy at the anticipated meeting wrote a delighted letter to make the appointment and skipped about the dark stairs and passages more like the butterfly she was than like madam belamour while fay and letty found her a more delightful playfellow than ever recovering all the animation she had lost during the last weeks her only drawback to the pleasure was that each intervening evening convinced her more strongly that mr belamour was uneasy and dissatisfied about the meeting which he could not prohibit on the previous night he asked many questions about her sister in especial whether she were of an inquisitive disposition  that rather depends on how much she has to say about herself returned aurelia after some reflection she likes to hear about other peoples affairs but she had much rather talk of her own  this made mr belamour laugh considering he said how recently she has undergone the greatest event of a womans life let us hope that her imagination and her tongue may be fully occupied by it during the few hours that you are to pass together it seems hard to put any restraint on your ingenuous confidence my sweet friend but i trust to your discretion to say as little as you can contrive of your strange position here and of the infirmities and caprices of him whose name you have deigned to bear  sir do you think i could  it is not for my own sake but for yours that i would recommend caution he continued the situation is unusual and such disclosures might impel persons to interfere for what they thought your interest but you have promised me your implicit trust and you will i hope prove it you can understand how painful would be such wellmeaning interference though you cannot understand how fatally mischievous it would be  i had better say i can tell her nothing said aurelia startled  nay that would excite still greater suspicion reply briefly and carefully making no mysteries to excite curiosity and avert the conversation from yourself as much as possible  man of the world and brilliant talker as he had been he had no notion of the difficulty of the task he had imposed on the simple openhearted girl accustomed to share all her thoughts with her sister and she was too gay and joyous to take full note of all his cautions only replying sincerely that she hoped that she should say nothing amiss and that she would do her best to be heedful of his wishes  in spite of all such cautions she was too happy to take in the notion of anxiety she rose early in the morning caring for the first time to array herself in the insignia of her new rank knowing that the bridlepath lay through parks woodlands and heaths so that there was no fear of dust she put on a dainty habit of white cloth trimmed and faced with blue velvet and a lowcrowned hat with a white feather on her pretty grey horse the young madam belamour was a fair and gracious sight as she rode into the yard of the red lion at brentford harriet was at the window watching for her and mr arden received her as she sprang off her steed then led her up to the parlour where breakfast was spread awaiting her  aurelia what a sweet figure you make cried harriet as the sisters unwound their arms after the first ecstasy of embracing one another again where did you get that exquisite habit  it came down from london with another a dark blue said aurelia i suppose mr belamour ordered them for they came with my horse it is the first time i have worn it  ah fine things are of little account when there is no one to see them said mrs arden shaking her head in commiseration  she was attired in a grey ridingdress with a little silver lace about it and looked wonderfully plump and well full of importance and complacency and with such a return of comeliness that aurelia would hardly have recognised the lean haggard fretful harriet of the previous year her sentiment and romance her soft melancholy and little affectations had departed and she was already the notable prosperous wife of a beneficed clergyman of whose abilities she was very proud though she patronised with goodhumoured contempt his dreamy unpractical unworldly ways  the questions poured forth from aurelias hearthunger about brother sister and home were answered kindly and fully over the breakfasttable but as if harriet had turned that page in her life and expected aurelia to have done the same every now and then exclaiming la you have not forgotten that what a memory you have child  she wanted much more to talk of the parsonage and glebe of rundell canonicorum and of how many servants and cows she should keep and showed herself almost annoyed when aurelia brought her back to carminster by asking whether eugene had finished his comenius and if the speckled hen had hatched many chickens whether palmer had had his rheumatic attack this spring or if the majors letter to vienna had produced any tidings of nannerls relation harriet seemed only to be able to reply by an effort of memory and was far more desirous of expatiating on the luxuries at alderman ardens and the deference with which she had been treated in contrast to the indignity of lady belamours neglect  it was disappointing to find that her father had heard nothing from my lady about the settlement of the manor house  was the promise in writing asked mr arden who had been silent all this time  certainly in a letter to me  i recommend you to keep it carefully until mr waylands return said mr arden he will see justice done to you  poor mr wayland when he does return i pity him but it is his own fault for leaving his lady to herself have you ever seen the gallant colonel sister  never  ah most like he is not much at bowstead but do not folk talk there  my dear said mr arden you would do well to imitate your honoured fathers discretion on certain points  bless me mr arden how you startled me i thought you were in a brown study she winked at aurelia as if to intimate that she meant to continue the subject in his absence and went on i assure you i had to be on the alert all the way to take care he looked at the signposts or we might have been at york by this time and in london what do you think was all my gentleman cared to go and see why he must needs go to some correspondents of his who are fellows of the royal society i took it for granted they must be friends of his majesty or of the prince of wales at the least and would have had him wait for his new gown and cassock but la it was only a set of old doctors and philosophers and he wished to know what musty discoveries they had been making that was one thing he desired in london and the other was to hear that crazy parson wesley preach a sermon hours long  i was well rewarded in both instances said mr arden gravely  aurelia did not take advantage of the opportunity of shining in the eyes of her new brotherinlaw by showing her acquaintance with the discussions on electricity which she had studied for mr belamours benefit nor did she speak of dr godfreys views of wesley and whitfield had she so ventured her sister would have pitied her and mr arden himself been somewhat shocked at her being admitted to knowledge unbecoming to a pretty young lady intellect in ladies would have been a startling idea and though very fond of his wife he never thought of her as a companion but only as the mistress of his house and guardian of his welfare  the dinner was ordered at one and at three aurelia would ride home while mr and mrs arden went on about twelve miles to the house of a great grazier brother to the aldermans wife where they had been invited to make their next stage and spend the next day sunday when harriet reckoned on picking up information about cattle if she were not actually presented with a cow or a calf they went out and walked a little about the town where presently they met mrs hunter aurelia met her puzzled stare with a curtsey and she shouted in her hearty tone miss delaviei mean mrs belamour who would have thought of seeing you here  i am here to meet my sistermrs arden let melet me present you said aurelia in obedience to an imperious sign from her sister going through the form for the first time while harriet volubly declared her happiness in making mrs hunters acquaintance and explained how they were on their way to take possession of mr ardens rectory of rundell canonicorum the words rolling out of her mouth with magnificent emphasis i congratulate you maam said mrs hunter cordially and you too my dear she added turning to aurelia i would have been out long ago to call on youa sort of relation as you are now as i may saybut it was kept all so mum one never knew the time to drink your health and my cousins treforth wouldnt so much as give me a hint but la says i why should you talk about artfulness im right glad poor mr amyas should find a sprightly young lady to cure him of his mopishness never mind them my dear if they do look sour on you ill come over one of these days and talk to them now i must have you come in to take your dinner with us the doctor will be right pleased to find you ill take no excuse i thank heaven im always ready whoever may drop in theres spring chicken and sparrowgrass  however on hearing their dinner was ordered at the inn the good lady was satisfied that to dine with her was impossible but she insisted on their coming in to partake of wine and cake in her best parlour  this however was a little more than mr arden could endure he made an excuse about seeing to the horse and escaped while mrs hunter led the two sisters to her closely shutup parlour wainscoted and hung with two staring simpering portraits of herself and her husband clean as soap could make it but smelling like a long closed box she went to a cupboard in the wall and brought out a silver salver a rich cake glasses and wine and pouring out the wine touched the glass with her lips as she wished health and happiness to the two brides before her  we shall soon have another wedding in the family if report speaks true she added they saybut you should be the best informed madam belamour  we hear nothing of the matter maam said aurelia  thats odd since mr belamour is young sir amyass guardian and they cannot well pass him over now he has begun life again as it were laughed mrs hunter tis said that my lady is resolved the wedding shall be within six weeks  there are two words to that question said harriet oracularly i know from good authority that young sir amyas is determined against the match  but is it true maam cried mrs hunter eagerly that my lady and the countess of aresfield met at bath and that my lady is to have 3000 pounds down to pay off her debts before her husband comes home the day her son is married to lady arabella  every word of it is true maam said harriet importantly  well now that folk should sell their own flesh and blood  how have you heard it sister harriet asked aurelia  from a sure hand my love no other than mrs dove she is wife to my ladys coachman explained mrs arden to her hostess and nurse to the two children it is her pleasure to keep with her  dear good nurse dove cried aurelia did she come to see you  yes that did she so i have it from the fountainhead as i may say that the poor young gentlemans hand and heart are to be made over without his will that so his mother may not have such a schedule of debts wherewith to face her husband on his return  her jewels have been all paste long ago i know very well said mrs hunter not to be outdone though would you believe it doctor hunter is like all the men and will believe nothing against her but this beats all the rest why i have it from my maid who is sister to one of the servants at the boardingschool in queen square whither they have sent the lady belle that she is a regular little shrew she flew at one of the young ladies like a wild cat because she did not yield place to her at once and scratched her cheeks till the blood ran down and tore out whole handfuls of her hair she was like one possessed and they had to call the lackey before they could get her safe tied down in bed where they kept her on bread and water trying to get her to make her apology but not a word could be got out of her till they had to yield the point lest she should fall sick  aurelia mentally applauded her own discretion in not capping this with mrs doves former tale and only observing that the marriage could not take place before the young baronet was of age without the consent of his personal guardian mr belamour  you will excuse me my dear in speaking of your husband but he has so long been incapable of acting that they say his consent can be dispensed with  aye poor cousin amyas belamour said mrs hunter he was the only man who ever durst resist my ladys will before and you see to what she has brought him  her son is resisting her now said harriet and our good dove says it makes her blood boil to see the way the poor young gentleman is treated he who was the darling for whom nothing was good enough a while ago has now scarce a place in his mothers own house she is cold and stately with him and colonel mar the lady belles brother being his commanding officer there is no end to the vexations and annoyances they give him both at home and in his quarters mrs dove says his own man grey tells her it is a wonder how he stands out against it all and a truly wellbred young gentleman he is he came to pay me his call in gracechurch street only yesterday knowing our kindred and most unfortunate was it that i was stepped out to the office to speak as to our boxes being duly sent by the buckingham wain but he left his ticket and a message with the servant tell my cousin mrs arden he said that i much regret not having seen her and i should have done myself the honour of calling sooner to inquire for her good father if i had known she was in town  well i have never seen the young gentleman since he was a mere child said mrs hunter his mother has bred him to neglect his own home and relations but i am sorry for him  they say continued harriet significantly that they are sure there is some cause for his holding out so stifflyi verily believe my lady suspected  o hush harriet cried aurelia colouring painfully  well it is all over now so you need not be offended said harriet laughing besides if my lady had any such notion when she brought about your marriage she must be disappointed for the young spark is as resolute as ever  and no wonder if he knows what the lady is like said aurelia  ah he has admitted as much to the king  to the king cried both auditors  oh yes you know my lady is very thick with my lady suffolk and she persuaded the king to speak to him at the levee comment says his majesty in french are you a young rebel sir that refuse the good things your mother provides you not a whit was my young gentleman moved he bowed and answered that he was acting by the desire of his guardian excuse me sister but the king answereda raving melancholic that will not serve your turn sir come to your senses fulfil your mothers bond and well put you on the dukes staff where you may see more of service than of home or belike get into gay quarters where you may follow any other fantaisie if that is making you commit such betises at that sir amyas who is but an innocent youth flamed up in his cheeks till they were as red as his coat and said his honour was engaged on which his majesty swore at him for an idiot and turned his back every word of this mrs dove heard colonel mar tell my ladyand then they fell to rating the poor youth and trying to force out who this secret flame may be but his is of the same stuff as his mother adamantine and impervious and now the colonel keeps him on hard duty continually and they watch him day and night to find out what places he haunts but bless me mrs hunter is the church clock striking we must be gone or my good man will be wondering where we are  mrs hunter would fain have kept them and the last words and compliments were of long duration while aurelia looked on in some surprise at the transformation of all harriets languishing affected airs into the bustling selfimportance of mrs arden she was however much occupied with all she had heard and was marvelling how her sister began again as soon as they were in the street again you are very discreet aurelia as it becomes a young married lady but have you no notion who this innamorata of the baronet may be  no indeed how should i  i thought he might have confided in your husband since he makes so sure of his support  he has only once come to visit mr belamour and that was many months ago  it is strange mused harriet mrs dove says she would have taken her bible oath that it was you and my lady believed as much or she would not have been in such haste to have you wedded nay ill never believe but he made his confidences to betty when he came to the manor house the sunday after you were gone though not a word could i get from her  it must have been all a mistake said aurelia not without a little twinge at the thought of what might have been i wish you would not talk of it  well he could have been but a fickle adorertis the way of men my dear for he must have found some new flame while his mother and the colonel were both at the bath they have proof positive of his riding out of town at sundown but whither he goes is unknown for he takes not so much as a groom with him and he is always in time for morning parade  poor young man it is hard to be so beset with spies and watchers said aurelia  most true said harriet but i am monstrous glad you are safe married like me child so that no one can accuse us such romantic affairs are well enough to furnish a course of letters to the tatler or the gentlewomens magazine but i am thankful for a comfortable life with my good man  therewith they reached their inn where harriet having satisfied herself that the said good man was safe within and profiting by the unwonted calm to write his inaugural sermon took aurelia to her bedroom to prepare for dinner and to indulge in further confidences  so aurelia i can report to my father that you are looking well and as cheerful as can be expected  nay i have always told you i am happy as the day is long  what when you have never so much as seen your husband  only at our wedding and then he was forced to veil his face from the light  nor has he ever seen you  not unless he then saw me  if he were not then charmed enough to repeat the view you are the most cruelly wasted and unworthily matched  hush sister broke out aurelia in eager indignation  what is a lovely young creature almost equal to what i was before my cruel malady to waste her bloom on a wretched old melancholic who will not so much as look at her  harriet i cannot hear thisyou know not of what you are talking what is my poor skindeep beautyif beauty it becompared with the stores of goodness and wisdom i find in him  la child what heat is this one would really think you loved him  of course i do i love and honour him more than any one i ever metexcept my dear father  come aura you are talking by rote out of the marriage service you may be open with me you know it will go no further and i do long to know whether you can be truly content at heart said harriet with real affection  dear sister said aurelia touched believe me that indeed i am mr belamour is kindness itself he is all he ever promised to be to me and sometimes more  yet if he loved you he could never let you live moped up there are you never frighted at the dark chamber i should die of it  the dark does not fright me said aurelia  you have a courage i have not come now were you never frighted to talk with a voice in the dark  scarcely ever said aurelia  scarcelywhen was that  you will laugh harriet but it is when he is mostmost tender and full of warmth then i hardly know him for the same  what if he be not always tender to my poor dear child he must be a wretch indeed  o no no harriet how shall i ever make you understand cried aurelia never for a moment is he other than kind and gentle it is generally like a father only more courtly and deferential but sometimes something seems to come over him and he isoh i cannot tell youwhat i should think a lover would be faltered aurelia colouring crimson and hiding her face on her sisters shoulder as old habits of confidence and need of counsel and sympathy were obliterating all the warnings of last night  you silly little chit why dont you encourage these advances you ought to be charmed not frightened  they would chi should like it if it were not so like two men in one the one holding the other back  harriet laughed at this fancy and aurelia was impelled to defend it indeed harriet it is really so there will be whispersoh such whispersshe sunk her voice and hid her face againclose to my ear andendearmentswhile the grave voice sounds at the other end of the room and then i long for light i swooned for fright the first time but i am much more used to it now  this is serious said harriet with unwonted gravity do you really think that there is another person in the room  i do not feel as if it could be otherwise and yet it is quite impossible  i would not bear it said her sister you ought not to bear it how do you know that it is not some vile stratagem it might even be the blackamoor  no no harriet i know better than that it is quite impossible besides i am sure of thisthat the hands that wedded me are the same hands that caress me she added with another blushing effort strong but delicate hands rather hard inside as with the bridle i noticed it because once i thought his hands soft with doing nothing and being shut up  that convinces me the more then there is some strange imposition practised upon you said harriet anxiously  oh no said aurelia inconsistently mr belamour is quite incapable of doing anything wrong by me i cannot let you have such shocking notions he told me i must be patient and trust him though i should meet with much that was strange and inexplicable  this is trusting him much too far they are playing on your inexperience i am sure if you were not a mere child you would see what a shocking situation this is  i wish i had not told you said aurelia tears rushing into her eyes i ought not he bade me be cautious how i talked and you have made me quite forget  did he so then it is evident that he fears disclosure something must be done why not write to our father  i could not he would call it a silly fancy  and it might embroil him with my lady added harriet we must devise another mode  you will notmust not tell mr arden exclaimed aurelia peremptorily  never fear he heeds nothing more sublunary than the course of the planets but i have it his device will serve the purpose do you remember eugene confounding him with friar bacon because he was said to light a candle without flint or steel it was true when he was a bachelor he always lit his own candle and fire and he always carries the means i was frighted the first time he showed me but now i can do it as well as he see she said opening a case a drop of this spirit upon this prepared cotton and as a bright flame sprang up and made aurelia start she laughed and applied a taper to it there one such flash would be quite enough to prove to you whether there be any deception practised on you  i could never do it light is agony to mr belamour and what would he think  he would take it for lightning which i suppose he cannot keep out  one flash did come through everything last summer but i was not looking towards him  you will be wiser this time here i can give you this little box for mr arden compounded a fresh store in town  i dare not sister he has ever bidden me trust without sight and you cannot guess how good he is to me and how noble and generous i cannot insult him by a doubt  then he should not act as no true woman can endure  and it would hurt him  tut tut child if the lightning did not harm him how can this flash i tell you no man has a right to trifle with you in this manner and it is your duty to yourself and all of us to find out the truth some young rake may have bribed the black and be personating him and some day you may find yourself carried off you know not where  harriet if you only knew either mr belamour or jumbo you would know that you are saying things most shocking  convince me then look here aurelia if you cannot write to me and explain this doublefaced or doublevoiced husband of yours i vow to you that i shall speak to mr arden and write to my father  oh do not do not sister remember it is of no use unless this temper of affection be on him and i have not heard it this fortnight no nor more  promise me then that you will make the experiment see here is a little chainstitch pouchpoor peggy duckworths gift to mewith two pockets let me fasten it under your dress and then you will always have it about you  if the bottle broke as i rode home  impossible it is a scentbottle of strong glass  here mr arden knocked at the door regretting to interrupt their confidences but dinner awaited them and as immediately after mrs hunter brought her husband in his best wig to call on madame belamour and her relations the sisters had no more time together till the horses were at the door and they went to their room together to put on their hats  a whole mass of refusals and declarations of perfect confidence were on aurelias tongue but harriet cut them all short by saying remember you are bound for your own honour and ours to clear up this mystery  then they rode off their several ways madame belamour towards bowstead mr and mrs arden on their sturdy roadster towards lea farm     chapter xxii a fatal spark       and so it chanced which in those dark       and fireless halls was quite amazing     did we not know how small a spark       can set the torch of love ablazing                                        t moore   aurelia rode home in perplexity much afraid of the combustibles at her girdle and hating the task her sister had forced on her she felt as if her heedless avowals had been high treason to her husband and yet harriet was her elder and those assurances that as a true woman she was bound to clear up the mystery made her cheeks burn with shame and her heart thrill with the determination to vindicate her husband while the longing to know the face of one who so loved her was freshly awakened  she was strongly inclined to tell him all indeed she knew herself well enough to be aware that half a dozen searching questions would draw out the whole confession of her own communication and harriets unworthy suspicions and humiliating as this would be she longed for the opportunity here however she was checked in her meditations by a stumble of her horse which proved to have lost a shoe it was necessary to leave the short cut and make for the nearest forge and when the mischief was repaired to ride home by the high road  she thus came home much later than had been expected jumbo molly and the little girls were all watching for her and greeted her eagerly the supper was already on the table for her and she had only just given fay and letty the cakes and comfits she had bought at brentford for them when jumbo brought the message that his master hoped that madam if not too much fatigued would come to him as soon as her supper was finished  accordingly she came without waiting to change her dress having only taken off her hat and arranged her hair  she felt guilty and dreaded the being questioned yet longed to make her avowal and have all explained the usual greetings passed and then mr belamour said i heard your horse hoofs come in late you were detained  she explained about the shoe and a few sentences were passing about her sister when she detected a movement as if a step were stealing towards her together with a hesitation in the remark mr belamour was making about mrs hunters good nature  quite irrelevantly came in the whispering voice where is my dearest life  sir sir she cried driven at last to bay what is this are you one or two  one with you my sweetest life your ownyour husband  therewith there was a kind of groan further off and as aurelia felt a hand on her dress her fight and distress at the duality were complete while in the dark the hands were still groping for her she eluded them and succeeded in carrying out harriets manoeuvre so far that a quick bright flame leapt forth lighting up the whole room and revealing twoyes two but it did not die away in her haste and in the darkness she had poured the whole contents of the bottle on the phosphoric cotton and dropped both without knowing it on a chintz curtain a fresh evening breeze was blowing in from the window open behind the shutters and in one second the curtain was a flaming waving sheet some one sprang up to tear it down leaping on a table in the window the table overbalanced the heavy iron curtainrod came out suddenly and there was a fall the flaming mass covering the fallen the glare shone on a strange white face and head as well as on jumbos black one and with a trampling and crushing the fire died down quenched as suddenly as it began and all was obscurity again  nephew dear boy speak exclaimed mr belamour and as there was no answer open the shutters jumbo for heavens sake let us see  oh what have i done cried poor aurelia in horror and misery dropping by him on the ground while the opened shutters admitted the twilight of a may evening with a full moon disclosing a strange scene a youth in a livery riding coat lay senseless on the ground partly covered by the black fragments of the curtain the iron rod clenched in one hand the other arm doubled under him a face absolutely white with long snowy beard and hair hung over him and an equally white pair of hands tried to lift the head jumbo had in a second sprung down removed the fallen table and come to his masters help struck head with this he said as he tried to unclasp the fingers from the bar and pointed to a grazed blow close to the temple  we must lay him on my bed said mr belamour then seeing the girls horrorstricken countenance ah child would that you had been patient but it was overtasking you call aylward i beg of you tell her he is here badly hurt what you do not know him as her bewildered eyes and halfopened lips implied the question she could not utter you do not know him sir amyasmy nephewyour true husband  oh and i have killed him she cried with clasped hands  hush child no with gods mercy only call the woman and bring a light  she rushed away and appeared a pale terrified figure with the smell of fire on her hair and white dress in the room where mrs aylward was reading her evening chapter she could scarcely utter her message as she stood under the gaze of blank amazement but mrs aylward understood enough to make her start up without another word and hurry away candle in hand  aurelia took up the other and followed trembling when she reached the outer room the rush of air almost blew out her light and pausing afraid to pass on she perceived that mr belamour and jumbo were carrying the insensible form between them into the inner apartment while a moan or two filled her heart with pangs of selfreproach  she hung about in terrible anxiety but not daring to come forward while the others were engaged about the sufferer for what seemed a very long time before she heard mrs aylward say his arm is broke sir we must send for dr hunter the maids are all in their beds but i will go and wake one and send her to the stables to call the groom  i had best go said mr belamour you are of more use than i he sleeps at the stables you say then seeing the waiting watching form of aurelia he said come in my poor child perhaps your voice may rouse him every one including himself seemed to have forgotten mr belamours horror of the light for candles were flaring on all the tables as he led the you girl in saying speak to him  at the deathlike face in its golden hair aurelias voice choked in her throat and it was in an unnatural hoarse tone that she tried to say sirsir amyas  i trust he will soon be better said mr belamour marking her dismay and grief with his wonted kindness but his arm needs the surgeon and i must be going let lady belamour sit here mrs aylward i trust you with the knowledge it was my nephew in disguise who wedded her unknown to her she is entirely blameless let jumbo fetch her a cordial there my child take this chair so that his eyes may fall on you when he opens them bathe his head if you will i shall return quickly after having sped the groom on his journey  gloomy and doubtful were the looks cast on aurelia by the housekeeper but all unseen by the wondering bewildered remorseful eyes fixed on the white face on the pillow heedless of its perfect symmetry of feature and knowing only that this was he who had thrilled her heart with his tender tones who had loved her so dearly and dared so much for her sake but whom her impatience and distrust had so cruelly injured had she seen him strong well and ardent as she had so lately heard him her womanhood would have recoiled indignantly at the deception which had stolen her vows but the spectacle of the young senseless face and prostrate form filled her with compassion tenderness and remorse for having yielded to her sisters persuasions with intense anxiety she watched and assisted in the fomentations longing for mr belamours return but time passed on and still he came not no words passed only a few faint sighs and one of the hands closed tight on aurelias     chapter xxiii wrath and desolation       straight down she ran  and fatally did vow    to wreake her on the mayden messenger     whom she had caused be kept as prisonere                                           spenser   hark there was the trampling of horses and thundering of wheels at the door could the doctor be come already and in such a fashion  jumbo hurried to admit him and mrs aylward moved to arrange matters but the clasp that was on aurelias hand would not let her go  presently there came not dr hunters tread but a crisp rustling sound and the tap of high heels and in the doorway stood tall erect and terrible lady belamour with a blaze of wrath in her blue eyes and concentrated rage in her whole form while in accents low but coming from between her teeth she demanded miserable boy what means this  oh madam take care he is sadly hurt cried aurelia with a gesture as if to screen him  i ask what this means repeated lady belamour advancing and seeming to fill the room with her majestic figure in full brocaded dress with feathers waving in her hair  his honour cannot answer you my lady said mrs aylward he has had a bad fall and mr belamour is gone to send for the doctor  this is the housekeeping in my absence said lady belamour showing less solicitude as to her sons condition than indignation at the discovery and her eyes and her diamonds glittering fearfully  my lady said mrs aylward with stern respectfulness i knew nothing of all this till this lady called me an hour ago telling me sir amyas was hurt i found him as you see please your ladyship i must go back to him  speak then you little viper said lady belamour turning on aurelia who had risen but was held fast by the hand upon hers by what arts have you well nigh slain my son come here and tell me  none madam gasped aurelia trembling so that she grasped her chairback with her free hand for support i never saw him till tonight  lies will not serve you false girl come here this instant i know that you have been shamelessly receiving my son here night after night  i never knew  missie madam never knew chimed in jumbo all in the dark she thought it old masr  lady belamour looked contemptuously incredulous but the negros advocacy gave a kind of courage to aurelia and availing herself of a slight relaxation of the fingers she withdrew her hand and coming forward said indeed madam i know nothing i was entirely deceived only hearing two voices in the dark alarmed me so that i listened to my sister and struck a light to discover the truth then all caught fire and blazed up and  then you are an incendiary as well as a traitor said her ladyship with cold triumphant malignity this is work for the constable here loveday to her own woman who was waiting in the outer room take this person away and lock her into her own room till morning when we can give her up to justice  oh my lady cried aurelia crouching at her feet and clinging to her dress do not be so cruel oh let me go home to my father  madam cried a voice from the bed let alone my wife come aurelia oh  then starting up in bed had wrenched his broken arm and he fell back senseless again just as aurelia would have flown back to him but his mother stood between spurning her away  another defender if she could so be called spoke for her it is true please your ladyship said mrs aylward that mr belamour called her the wife of this poor young gentleman  jumbo too exclaimed no one knew but jumbo his honour marry pretty missie in masrs wig and crimson dressinggown  a new stratagem ironically observed the incensed lady but your game is played out miss for madam i cannot call you such a marriage cannot stand for a moment and if a lawyer like amyas belamour pretended it could either his wits were altogether astray or he grossly deceived you or as i believe he trafficked with you to entrap this unhappy youth whose person and house you have between you almost destroyed remove her loveday and lock her up till we can send for a magistrate to take depositions in the morning go quietly girl i will not have my son disturbed with your outcries  poor aurelias voice died in her throat oh why did not mr belamour come to her rescue ah he had bidden her trust and be patient she had transgressed and he had abandoned her there was no sign of life or consciousness in the pallid face on the bed and with a bleeding heart she let the waitingmaid lead her through the outer apartment still redolent of the burning reached her own chamber heard the key turn in the lock and fell across her bed in a sort of annihilation  the threat was unspeakably frightful those were days of capital punishment for half the offences in the calendar and of what was to her scarcely less dreadful of promiscuous imprisonment fetters and gaol fever poor aurelias ignorance could hardly enhance these horrors and when her perceptions began to clear themselves her first thought was of flight from a fate equally dreadful to the guilty or not guilty  springing from the bed she tried the other door of her room which was level with the wainscoting and not readily observed by a person unfamiliar with the house it yielded to her hand and she knew there was a whole suite of empty rooms thus communicating with one another it was one of those summer nights that are never absolutely dark and there was a full moon so that she had light enough to throw off her conspicuous white habit all scorched and singed as it was and to put on her dark blue cloth one with her camlet cloak and hood she made up a small bundle of clothes took her purse which was well filled with guineas and silver and moved softly to the door hide and seek had taught her all the modes of eluding observation and with her walking shoes in her hand and her feet slippered she noiselessly crept through one empty room after another and descended the stair into her own lobby where she knew how to open the sash door  one moment the thought that mr belamour would protect her made her pause but the white phantom she had seen seemed more unreal than the voice she was accustomed to and both alike had vanished and abandoned her to her fate nay she had been cheated from the first everything had given way with her my lady might be coming to send her to prison hark some one was coming she darted out down the steps along the path like a wild bird from a cage     chapter xxiv the wanderer       widowed wife and wedded maid     betrothed betrayer and betrayedscott   aurelias first halt was in a mossgrown summerhouse at the end of the garden where she ventured to sit down to put on her stout leather shoes the childrens toys a ball and a set of ninepins lay on the floor how many ages ago was it that she had made that sarcastic reply to lettyperhaps her last  a nightingale close overhead burst into a peal of song repeating his one favourite note which seemed to her to cry out although my heart is broke broke broke broke the tears rushed into her eyes but at a noise as of opening doors or windows at the house terror mastered her again and she hurried on to hide herself from the dawning light which was beginning to increase as she crossed the park on turf dank with maydew and plunged deep into the thick woods beyond causing many a twittering cry of wondering birds  day had fully come and slanting golden beams were shining through the tender green foliage and illuminating the boles of the trees ere she was forced by failing strength again to pause and sit on a faggot while gathering breath and considering where she should go home was her first thought who could shield her but her father and sister how she longed for their comfort and guardianship but how reach them she had money but could do little for her england never less resembled those days of brian boromhe when the maiden with the gems rich and rare wandered unscathed form sea to sea in ireland post chaises though coming into use had not dawned on the simple country girls imagination she knew there was a weekly coach from london to bath passing through brentford and that place was also a great startingplace for stage waggons of which one went through carminster but her bewildered brain could not recall on what day it started and there was an additional shock of despair when she remembered that it was sunday morning the chill of the morning dew was on her limbs she was exhausted by her fatigues of the night a drowsy recollection of the children in the wood came over her and she sank into a dreamy state that soon became actual sleep she was wakened by a strong bright sunbeam on her eyes and found that this was what had warmed her limbs in her sleep a sound as of singing was also in her ears and of calling cows to be milked she did not in the least know where she was for she had wandered into parts of the wood quite strange to her but she thought she must be a great way from home and quite beyond recognition so she followed the voice and soon came out on a tiny meadow glade where a stout girl was milking a great sheeted cow  she knew now that she was faint with hunger and thirst and must take food before she could go much farther so taking out a groat her smallest coin she accosted the girl and offered it for a draught of milk to her dismay the girl exclaimed lawk it be young madam sarvice maam  i have lost myself in the wood said aurelia i should be much obliged for a little milk  well to be sure think of that and have ee been out all night ye looks whisht said the girl readily filling a wooden cup she had brought with her for in those days good new milk was a luxury far more easily accessible than in ours she added a piece of barley bread her own intended breakfast and was full of respectful wonder pity and curiosity proposing that young madam should come and rest in mothers cottage in the wood and offering to guide her home as soon as the cows were milked and the pigs fed aurelia had some difficulty in shaking her off finding also that she had gone round and round in the labyrinthine paths and was much nearer the village of bowstead than she had intended  indeed she was obliged to deceive the kindly girl by walking off in the direction she pointed out intending to strike afterwards into another path though where to go she had little idea so long as it was out of reach of my lady and her prison  oh if harriet were only at brentford or if it were possible to reach the lea farm where she was could she ask her way thither or could she find some shelter near or in brentford till the coach or the waggon started this was the most definite idea her brain refreshed somewhat by the food could form but in the meantime she was again getting bewildered in the field paths it was a part she did not know lying between the backs of the cottages and their gardens and the woods belonging to the great house and the long sloping meadows spangled with cowslips were much alike the cowslips seemed to strike her with a pang as she recollected her merry day among them last spring and how little she then thought of being a homeless wanderer at last scarce knowing where she was she sat down on the step of a stile leading to a little farmyard leant her head on the top bar and wept bitterly  again she startled by hearing a voice saying sister what is that in the field and starting up she saw mrs delia in high pattens and her sunday silk tucked up over her quilted petticoat with a basket of corn in her hand surrounded by her poultry while mrs phoebe was bending over a coop she had stumbled unawares on their back premises and with a wild hope founded on their wellknown enmity to lady belamour she sprang over the stile mrs delia retreated in haste but mrs phoebe came to the front  oh mrs phoebe she cried i ask your pardon  mrs belamour upon my word to what are we indebted for this visit  oh of your kindness listen to me madam said aurelia my lady is come and there is some dreadful mistake and she is very angry with me and if you would only take me in and hide me till the waggon goes and i can get home  so my lady has found you out you artful hussy returned mrs phoebe i have long guessed at your tricks i knew it was no blackamoor that was stealing into the great house  i do not know what you mean  oh it is of no use to try your feigned artlessness on us i wonder at your assurance after playing false with uncle and nephew both at once  if you would but hear me  i have heard enough of you already i wonder you dare show your face at a respectable house away with you if you would not have me send the constable after you  the threat renewed aurelias terror and again she fled but this time she fell into a path better known to her that leading to sedhurst and ultimately to brentford  the recollection of dame wheatfields genial good nature inspired her with another hope and she made her way towards the farm the church bells were ringing and she saw the farmer and his children going towards the church but not the mistress and she might therefore hope to find her at home and alone as she approached a great dog began a formidable barking and his voice brought out the good woman in person down bouncer a wont hurtee my lass what dye lack that you baint at church  may i speak to you mrs wheatfield  my stars if it baint young missmadam i mean nothing aint wrong with the child  o no she is quite well but  what ye be late for church come in and sit ye down a bit

she added after a moments consideration what will your master say hell be asking how it comes that a lady like you with a coach and horses of her own should be coming after a horse here you aint been and got into trouble with my lady my dear  oh dame indeed i have pray help me  it was no wonder that mrs wheatfield failed to gather more than that young madam had almost burnt the house and had fallen under grievous displeasure so as even to fear the constable  bless your poor heart think of that now but im afeard we cant do nothing for you my master would be nigh about killing me if i harboured you and got him into trouble with the gentry  if you could only hide me in some loft or barn till i could meet the coach for bath then i should be almost at home  i dare not the children are routing about everywhere on a sunday afternoon and if so be as theres a warrant out after you aurelia shuddered my man would be mad with me he aint never forgot how his grandfather was hanged up there in that very walnut for changing clothes with a young gentleman in the wars long ago  then i must go oh what will become of me  stay a bit it goes to my heart to turn you from the door and you so white and faint and they wont be out of church yet a while youve ate nothing all this time what was you thinking of doing my dear  i dont know if i could only find out the right lea farm and get a man and horse to take me therebut my sister goes on monday and i might not find her and nobody knows where it is and nobody will take me in or hide my till the coach goes oh what will become of me  it is bitter hard said the dame i wish to my heart i could take you in but you see theres the master ill tell you what theres my cousin patty woodman she might take you in for a night or two but youd never find your way to her cot it lies out beyond the spinneys i must show you the way look you here nobody cant touch you in a church they haint got no power there and if you would slip into that there empty place as opens with the little door as the ringers goes in by afore morning prayers is over ill make an excuse to come to evening prayer alone or only with little davy as is lying asleep there if patty is there ill speak and you can go home with her if not i must een walk with you out to the spinney hern is a poor place but hers a good sort of body and wont let you come to no harm and her goes into brentford with berries and strawberries to meet the coaches so may be shell know the day  oh thank you thank you dear mrs wheatfield if i can only get safe home  come dont be in haste youll take a bit of bread and cheese and just a draught of ale to hearten you up a bit  aurelia was too sick at heart for food and feared to delay lest she should meet the congregation but mrs wheatfield forced on her a little basket with some provisions and she gladly accepted another draught of milk  no one came out by the little door she was told all she had to do would be to keep out of sight when the ringers came in before the afternoon service she knew the way and was soon close to mary sedhursts grave ah why was he not constant to her she thought and oh why has he deserted me in my need  the little door easily yielded and she found herselfafter passing the staircaseturret that led by a gallery to the belfry in the centre of the churchin an exceedingly dilapidated transept once no doubt it had been beautiful before the coloured glass of the floriated window had been knocked out and its place supplied with bricks the broken effigy of a crusading sedhurst devoid of arms feet and nose was stowed away in the eastern sepulchre in company with funeral apparatus torn books and motheaten cushions but this would not have shocked her even in calmer moments she only cared to find a corner where she was entirely sheltered between a green stained pier and the high wall and curtain of a gigantic pew where no doubt sweet mary sedhurst had once worshipped the lusty voices of the village choir in some exalted gallery beyond her view were shouting out a familiar tune and with some of bettys mild superstition about the singing psalms she heard                     since i have placed my trust in god                      a refuge always nigh                    why should i like timrous bird                      to distant mountains fly                    behold the wicked bend their bow                      and ready fix their dart                    lurking in ambush to destroy                      the man of upright heart                    when once the firm assurance fails                      which public faith imparts                   tis time for innocence to flee                      from such deceitful arts                    the lord hath both a temple here                      and righteous throne above                    whence he surveys the sons of men                      and how their counsels move   poor timorous bird whom even the firm assurance of wedded faith had failed what was left to her but to flee from the darts levelled against her yet that last verse brought a sense of protection ah did she deserve it a prayerless night and prayerless morning had been hers and no wonder since she had never gone to bed nor risen with the ordinary forms but it was with a pang that she recollected that the habit of calling out in her heart for guidance and help had been slipping from her for a long time past and she had never asked for heavenly aid when her judgment was perplexed by harriet no nor for protection in her flight  she resolved to say her morning prayers with full attention so soon as the church was empty and meantime to follow the service with all her powers though her pulses were still throbbing and her head aching  in the far distance she heard the commandments and near to her the unseen clerk responding and then followed a gospel of love and comfort she could not catch every word but there was a sense of promised peace and comfort which began to soothe the fluttering heart for the first time enjoying a respite from the immediate gripe of deadly terror  the sermon chimed in with these feelings not that she could have any account of it nor preserved any connected memory but it was full of the words faith love sacrifice so that they were borne in on her ear and thought heavenly love surrounding as with an atmosphere those who had only faith to taste and see how gracious the lord is believing that which cannot be seen and therefore having it revealed to their inmost sense and thus living the only real life  this was the chief thought that penetrated to her mind as she crouched on the straw hassock behind the pew and shared unseen in the blessing of peace no one saw her as the hobnailed shoes trooped out of church and soon she was entirely alone kneeling still in her hidingplace and whispering halfaloud the omitted morning prayer whose heartfelt signification had she felt been neglected for a long long time  since when ah ever since those strange mysterious voices and caresses had come to charm and terrify her and when her very perplexity should have warned her to cling closer to the aid of her heavenly father vague yearnings uplifted feelings discontents and little tempers had usurped the place of higher feelings and blinded her eyes and through it all her heart began to ache and long for tidings of him on whose pale features she had gazed so long and who had ventured and suffered so much for her nay who had started into a moments life for her protection all the tumult of resentment at the deception practised on her fell on the uncle rather than the nephew and in spite of this long year of tender kindness and consideration from the recluse there was a certain consideration from the recluse there was a certain leaping of heart at finding herself bound not to him but to the youth whose endearments returned with a flood of tender remembrance and she had fled just as he had claimed her as his wife had fled just as he had claimed her as his wife unheeding whether he died of the injury she had caused him all that justified her alarm was forgotten her heartstrings had wound themselves round him and began to pull her back  then she thought of the danger of directing lady belamours wrath on her father and leading to his expulsion and destitution she had been sent from home and bestowed in marriage to prevent his ruin and should she now ensure it her return to him or even her disappearance would no doubt lead to high words from him and then he would be cast out to beggary in his old age no she could only save him by yielding herself up exonerating him from all knowledge of her strange marriage far more of the catastrophe and let my lady do her worst she had as she knew not been going on well lately but she had confessed her faults and recovered her confidence that her heavenly father would guard her as long as she resolutely did her duty and her duty as daughter and a wife if indeed she was one was surely to return where her heart was drawing her it might be very terrible but still it was going nearer to him and it would save her father  the door was still open she wrote a few words of gratitude and explanation to dame wheatfield on a piece of a torn book wrapped a couple of guineas in it and laid it in the basket then kneeling again to implore protection and safety and if it might be forgiveness and reconciliation she set forth love is strong as death said mary sedhursts tomb she knew better what that meant than when her childish eyes first fell upon it a sense of divine love was wrapping her round with a feeling of support and trust while the human love drew her onwards to confront all deadly possibilities in the hope of rejoining her husband or at least of averting misfortune from her father     chapter xxv vanished       where there is no place       for the glowworm to lie     where there is no space       for receipt of a fly     where the midge dares not venture       lest herself fast she lay     if love come he will enter       and find out the wayold song   major delavie and his eldest daughter were sitting down to supper in the twilight when a trampling of horses was heard in the lane a carriage was seen at the gate and up the pathway came a slender youthful figure in a scarlet coat with an arm in a sling  it isyes it is exclaimed betty sir amyas himself  in spite of his lameness the major had opened the door before palmer could reach it but his greeting and inquiry were cut short by the young mans breathless question is she here  who  my wifemy love your daughter sweet aurelia ah it was my one hope  come in come in sir entreated betty seeing how fearfully pale he grew what has befallen you and where is my sister  would that i knew i trusted to have found her here but now sir you will come with me and find her  i do not understand you sir said the major severely nor how you are concerned in the matter my daughter is the wife of your uncle mr belamour and if as i fear you bear the marks of a duel in consequence of any levity towards her i shall not find it easy to forgive  on my word and honour it is no such thing said the youth raising a face full of frank innocence your daughter is my wife my most dear and precious wife with full consent and knowledge of my uncle i was married to her in his clothes in the darkened room our names being the same  was this your promise betty exclaimed  miss delavie to the best of my ability i have kept my promise your sister has never seen me nor to her knowledge spoken with me  these are riddles young man said the major sternly if all be not well with my innocent child i shall know how to demand an account  sir said the youth i swear to you that she is the same innocent maiden as when she left you oh he added with a gesture of earnest entreaty blame me as you will only trace her  sit down and let us hear said betty kindly pushing a chair towards him and pouring out a glass of wine he sank into the first but waved aside the second becoming however so pale that the major sprang to hold the wine to his lips saying drink boy i say  not unless you forgive me he replied in a hoarse exhausted voice  forgive of course i forgive if you have done no wrong by my child i see i see tis not wilfully you have been hurt in her defence  not exactly he said i have much to tell but the words came slowly and there was a dazed weariness about his eye that made betty say in spite of her anxietyyou cannot till you have eaten and rested if only one word to say where she is  oh that i could my hope was to find her here and he was choked by a great strangling sob which his youthful manhood sought to restrain  betty perceived that he was far from being recovered from the injury he had suffered and did her best to restrain her own and her fathers anxiety till she had persuaded him to swallow some of the excellent coffee which nannerl always made at sight of a guest to her fathers questions meantime he had answered that he had broken his arm ten days ago but he could not wait he had posted down as soon as he could move  you ought to sleep before you tell us farther said the major speaking from a strong sense of the duties of a host but he was relieved when the youth answered you are very good sir but i could not sleep till you know all  speak then said the major i cannot look at your honest young countenance and think you guilty of more than disobedient folly but i fear it may have cost my poor child very dear is it your mother that you dread  i would be thankful even to know her in my mothers keeping he said  is there no mistake said the major my daughter mrs arden saw her at brentford safe and blooming  oh that was beforebefore said sir amyas the day before she fled from my mother at bowstead and has been seen no more  he put his hand over his face and bowed it on the table in such overpowering grief as checked the exclamations of horror and dismay and the wrathful demands that were rising to the lips of his auditors and they only looked at one another in speechless sorrow presently he recovered enough to say have patience with me and i will try to explain all my cousin miss delavie knows that i loved her sweet sister from the moment i saw her and that i hurried to london in the hope of meeting her at my mothers house on the contrary my mother finding it vain to deny all knowledge of her led me to believe that she was boarded at a young ladies school with my little sisters i lived on the vain hope of the holidays and meantime every effort was made to drive me into a marriage which my very soul abhorred the contract being absolutely made by the two ladies the mothers without my participation nay against my protest i was to be cajoled or else persecuted into itsold in fact that my mothers debts might be paid before her husbands return i knew my uncle belamour was my sole true personal guardian though he had never acted further than by affixing his signature when needed i ought to have gone long before to see him but as i now understand obstacles had been purposely placed in my way while my neglectful reluctance was encouraged it was in the forlorn hope of finding in him a resource that took me to bowstead at last and then it was that i learnt how far my mother could carry deception there i found my sisters and learnt that my own sweetest life had been placed there likewise she was that afternoon visiting some old ladies but my uncle represented that my meeting her could only cause her trouble and lead to her being removed i was forced then to yield having an engagement in london that it would have been fatal to break but i came again at dark and having sworn me to silence he was forced to let me take advantage of the darkness of his chamber to listen to her enchanting voice he promised to help me as far as he had the power in resisting the hateful aresfield engagement and he obtained the assistance of an old friend in making himself acquainted with the terms of his guardianship and likewise of a letter my father had left for him he has given me leave to show a part of it to you sir he added you will see that my father expressed a strong opinion that you were wronged in the matter of the estates and declared that he had hoped to make some compensation by a contract between one of your daughters and my brother who died he charged my uncle if possible to endeavour to bring about such a match between one of your children and myself thus you see i was acting in the strictest obedience you shall see the letter at once if i may bid my fellow gray bring my pocketbook from my valise  i doubt not of your words my young friend your father was a gentleman of a high and scrupulous honour but why all this hideandseek worki hate holes and corners  you will see how we were driven sir my mother came in her turn to see my uncle and obtain his sanction to her cherished plan and when he absolutely refused on account of lady aresfields notorious character if for no other she made him understand that nothing would be easier than to get him declared a lunatic and thus to dispense with his consent then finding how the sweet society of your dear daughter had restored him to new life and spirit she devised the notable expedient of removing what she suspected to be the chief cause of my contumacy by marrying the poor child to him he scouted the idea as a preposterous and cruel sacrifice but it presently appeared that colonel mar was ready to find her a debauched old lieutenant who would gladly marrywhat do i sayit profanes the wordbut accept the young lady for a couple of hundred pounds then did i implore my uncle to seem to yield and permit me to personate him at the ceremony our names being the same and all being done in private and in the dark the whole was quite possible and it seemed the only means of saving her from a terrible fate  he mightor you might have remembered that she had a father said the major  true but you were at a distance and my mothers displeasure against you was to be deprecated  i had rather she had been offended fifty times than have had such practices with my poor little girl said major delavie no wonder the proposals struck me as strange and ambiguous whose writing was it  mine at his dictation said the youth he was unwilling but my importunity was backed by my mothers threats conveyed through hargrave that unless aurelia became his wife she should be disposed of otherwise and that his sanity might be inquired into hargrave who is much attached to my uncle and is in great awe of my lady was thoroughly frightened and implored him to secure himself and the young lady by consenting thinking too that anything that would rouse him would be beneficial  it is strange mused the major a clearheaded punctilious man like your uncle to lend himself to a false marriage his ten years of melancholy must have changed him greatly  less than you suppose sir but you will remember that my mother is esteemed as a terrible power by all concerned with her even when she seemed to love me tenderly i was made to know what it was to cross her will and alas she always carries her point  it did seem a mode of protection said betty more kindly  and added the youth my uncle impressed on me from the first that he only consented on condition the i treated this wedlock as betrothal alone never met my sweet love save in his dark room and never revealed myself to her he said it was a mere expedient for guarding her until i shall come of age or mr wayland comes home when i shall woo her openly and if needful repeat the ceremony with her full knowledge meanwhile i wrote the whole to my stepfather and am amazed that he has never written nor come home  that is the only rational thing i have heard said the major thoughdid your uncle expect your young blood to keep the terms  indeed sir i was frightened enough the first evening that i ventured on any advances for they startled her enough to make her swoon away i carried her from her room and my uncle dragged me back before the colour came back to that lovely face so that the women might come to her that was the only time i ever saw her save through the chinks of the shutters judge of the distraction i lived in  betty looked shocked but her father chuckled a little though he maintained his tone of censure and may i inquire how often these distracting interviews took place  cruelly seldom for one to whom they were life itself mar is as you know colonel of my corps and my liberty has been restrained as much as possible i believe i have been oftener on guard and on courtmartial than any officer of my standing in the service but about once in a fortnight i could contrive to ride down to a little wayside inn where i kept a fresh horse also a livery coat and hat i tied up my horse in a barn on the borders of the park and put on a black vizard so as to pass for my uncles negro in the dark i could get admittance to my uncles rooms unknown to any servant save faithful jumbowho has been the sole depository of our secret however since my mothers return from bath where the compact with lady aresfield was fully determined the persecution has been fiercer i may have aroused suspicion by failing to act my part when she triumphantly announced my uncles marriage to me or else by my unabated resistance to the little termagant who is to be forced on me at any rate i have been so intolerably watched whenever i was not on duty that my hours of bliss became rarer than ever well sir my uncle charges me with indiscretion and says my ardour aroused unreasonable suspicions he was constantly anxious and would baulk me in my happiest and most tantalising moments by making some excuse for breaking up the evening and then would drive me frantic by asking whether he was to keep up my character for consistency in my absence however ten days since the twelfth of may after three weeks unendurable detention in town on one pretext or another i escaped and made my way to bowstead at last my uncle told me that he had been obliged unwillingly to consent to our precious charge going to meet her sister at brentford and that she was but newly come home presently she entered but scarcely had i accosted her before a blaze broke out close to us the flame caught the dry old curtains they flamed up like tinder and as i leaped up on a table to tear them down it gave way with me i got a blow on the head and knew no more it seems that my uncle as soon as the fire was out finding that my arm was broken set out to send the groom for the doctorhe being used to range the park at night the stupid fellow coming home half tipsy from the village saw his white hair and beard in the moonlight took him for a ghost and ran off headlong thereupon my uncle with new energy in the time of need saddled the horse changed his dressinggown with the grooms coat and rode off to brentford then finding that dr hunter was not within he actually went on to london where dr sandys who had attended him ever since his would forced him to go to bed and to remain there till his own return thus my darling had no one to protect her when an hour or so after the accident my mother suddenly appeared spies had been set on me by mar and so soon as they had brought intelligence of my movements she had hurried off from ranelagh in full dress just as she was to track and surprise me my uncle having gone by the bridle path had not met her and i was only beginning to return to my senses i have a dim recollection of hearing my mother threatening and accusing aurelia and striving to interfere but i was as one bound down and all after that is blank to me when my understanding again became clear i could only learn that my mother had locked her into her own room whence she had escaped andwith a groannothing has been heard of her since again he dropped his head on his hand as one in utter dejection  fled what has been done to trace her cried the major  nothing could be done till my mother was gone and my uncle returned the delirium was on me and whatever i tried to say turned to raving all the worse if i saw or heard my mother till dr sandys forbade her coming near me she was invited to the queens sunday card party moreover so she fortunately quitted bowstead just before mr belamours return  poor gentleman he could do nothing said betty  indeed i should have thought so but it seems that he only needed a shock to rouse him his state had become hypochondriacal and this strong emotion has caused him to exert himself and when he came into the daylight he found he could bear it i could scarce believe my eyes when on awakening from a sleep i found him by my bedside promising me that if i would only remain still he would use every endeavour to recover the dear one he went first to brentford thinking she might have joined her sister there but mr and mrs arden had left it at the same time as she did then he travelled on to their rectory at rundell canonicorum thinking she might have followed them but they had only just arrived and had heard nothing of her and he next sought her with his friend the canon of windsor but all in vain meantime my mother had visited me and denied all knowledge of her only carrying away my little sisters i believe because she found them on either side of my bed telling me tales of their dear cousin auras kindness when my uncle returned to bowstead i could bear inaction no longer and profited by my sick leave to travel down hither trusting that she might have found her way to her home and longing to confess all and implore your pardon sirand alas your aid in seeking her  with the large tears in his eyes the youth rose from his chair as he spoke and knelt on one knee before the major who exclaimed extremely affectedby all that is sacred you have it my dear boy it is a wretched affair but you meant to act honourably throughout and you have suffered heavily may god bless you both and give us back my dear child my lady must have been very hard with her to make her thus fly all alone  you do not know i suppose any cause for so timid a creature preferring flight to a little restraint  it seems said sir amyas sadly that something the dear girl said gave colour to the charge of having caused the fire and that my mother in her first passion threatened her with the constable  my poor aurelia that might well scare her cried betty but how could it be  they say she spoke of using something her sister had given her to discover what the mystery was that alarmed her  ah that gunpowder trick of mr ardensi always hated it exclaimed betty  gunpowder indeed growled the old soldier well if ever theres mischief among the children harriet is always at the bottom of it i hope mr belamour made her confess if she had a hand in it  i believe he did said sir amyas  just like her to set the match to the train and then run away said the major  still sir said betty her womanhood roused to defence though i am angered and grieved enough that harriet should have left aurelia to face the consequences of the act she instigated i must confess that even by sir amyass own showing if he will allow me to say so my sisters were justified in wishing to understand the truth  that is what my uncle tells me said the baronet he declares that if i had attended to his stipulations restrained my fervour or kept my distance there would have been neither suspicion nor alarm as if i had not restrained myself  ay i dare say said the major a little amused  well sir what could a man do with most bewitching creature in the world his own wife too on the next chair to him  there was a simplicity about the striplingfor he was hardly morewhich forced them to forgive him besides they were touched by his paleness and fatigue his own mana respectable elderly servant whom the major recollected waiting on sir joviancame to beg that his honour would sit up no longer as he had been travelling since six in the morning and was quite worn out indeed so it proved for when the major and betty not only promised to come with him on the search the next day but bade him a kind affectionate goodnight the poor lad all unused to kindness fairly burst into tears which all his dawning manhood could not restrain     chapter xxvi the traces       oh if i were an eagle to soar into the sky     id gaze around with piercing eye when i my love might spy   the secondbest coach which resided at bowstead the same which had carried aurelia off from knightsbridge had brought sir amyas belamour to carminsteran effeminate proceeding of which he was rather ashamed though clearly he could not have ridden and he had hoped to have brought his bride back in it  there was plenty of room in it to take back the major betty and even eugene since he could not well have been left without his sister or palmer who was indispensable to the major he was so enchanted at riding in a coach and going perhaps to see london that he did not trouble himself much about sister aurelia being lost and was in such high spirits as to be best disposed of outside between palmer and gray where he could at his ease contemplate the horses generally four in number though at some stages only two could be procured and then at an extra steep hill a farmers horse from the hayfield would be hitched on in front luckily there was no lack of money mr belamour and hargrave had taken care that sir amyas should be amply supplied and thus the journey was as rapid as posting could be in those days of insufficient inns worse roads and necessary precautions against highwaymen  the road was not the same as that which the young baronet had come down by as it was thought better to take the chance of meeting a different stage waggon sir amyas and his servant having of course examined the one they had overtaken in coming down at every possible resting place on the route was inquiry made but all in vain no one had seen such a young gentlewoman as was described or if some answer inspired hope for a moment it was dashed again at once the young gentlewoman once turned out to be the squires fat lady and another time was actually pursued into a troop of strolling players attiring themselves in a barn whence she came with cheeks freshly rouged with blood taken from a cats tail  the young baronet had meanwhile become very dear to the major and his daughter he had inherited his mothers indescribable attractiveness and he was so frank so affectionate so unspoilt so grateful for the little attentions demanded by his maimed condition so considerate of the major and so regardless of himself and above all so passionately devoted to his dearest life as he called aurelia that it was impossible not to take him into their hearts and let him be as he entreated a son and a brother  the travellers decided on first repairing to bowstead thinking it probable that the truant might have returned thither or that mr belamour might have found her in some one of the cottages around hopes began to rise and major delavie scolded sir amyas in quite a paternal manner whenever he began to despond though the parts were reversed whenever the young peoples expectations began to soar beyond his own spirits at the moment  is yonder hargrave no it is almost like my father exclaimed sir amyas in amazement as the coach lumbered slowly up the approach and a very remarkable figure was before them the long white beard was gone the hair was brushed back tied up and the ends disposed of in a square black silk bag hanging down behind and the dark grey coat with collar and deep cuffs of black velvet was such as would be the ordinary wear of an elderly man of good position but the face a fine aquiline one as to feature was of perfectly absolute whiteness scarcely relieved by the thin pale lips or the eyes which naturally of a lightgrey had become almost as colourless as the rest of the face and betty felt a shock as if she had seen a marble statue clothed and animated bowing and speaking  the anxious inquiry and the mournful negative had been mutually exchanged before the carriage door was opened and all were standing together in the avenue  i have however found a clue or what may so prove said mr belamour when the greetings had passed i have discovered how our fugitive passed the early part of the sunday and he related how he had elicited from the mistresses treforth that they had seen her and driven her away with contumely  sir amyas and the major were not sparing of interjections and the former hoped that his uncle had told them what they deserved  thereby only incurring the more compassion said mr belamour dryly and going on to say that he had extended his inquires to sedhurst and had heard of her visit to dame wheatfield also that the good woman going to seek her at the church had found only the basket with the guineas in the paper she had regarded this merely as a wrapper and being unable to read had never noticed the writing but she had fortunately preserved it and mr belamour thus learnt aurelias intention of throwing herself on lady belamours mercy  my mother utterly denied all knowledge of her when i cried out in anguish when she came to see me said sir amyas  so she does to hargrave whom she sent off to interrogate mrs arden said mr belamour  have you any reason to think the child could have reached my lady inquired betty seeing that none of the gentlemen regarded my ladys denials as making any difference to their belief though not one of them chose to say so  merely negative evidence said mr belamour i find that no one in the house actually beheld the departure of my lady on that sunday afternoon the little girls had been found troublesome and sent out into the park with molly and my nephew was giving full employment to jumbo and mrs aylward in my room the groom who was at the horses heads once averred that he saw two women get into the carriage besides her ladyship but he is such a sodden confused fellow and so contradicts himself that i can make nothing of him  he would surely know his young mistress said sir amyas  perhaps not in the camlet hood which dame wheatfield says she wore  was good old dove acting as coachman said betty we should learn something from him  it was not her own coach said mr belamour all the servants were strangers the liveries sanguine and the panels painted with helmets and trophies  mars said sir amyas low and bitterly  i guessed as much said his uncle it was probably chosen on purpose if the child has friends in your own household  then i must demand her said the major she cannot be denied to her father  at any rate we must go to town tomorrow said mr belamour we have done all we can here  let us send for horses and go on at once cried sir amyas  not so fast nephew i see by her face that miss delavie does not approve though our side of the town is safer than hounslow  i was not thinking of highwaymen sir but we set forth at five this morning and sir amyas always becomes flushed and feverish if he is over fatigued nor is my father so strong as he was  ah ha young sir in adopting betty for a sister you find you have adopted a quartermastergeneral eh said the major but she is quite right we should not get to town before ten or eleven at night and what good would that do no no let us sup and have a good nights rest and we will drive into town long enough before fine ladies are astir in the morning whatever may be the fashionable hour nowadays  yes nephew you must content yourself with acting host to your father and sisterinlaw in your own house said his uncle  it seems to me more like yours sir rejoined the youth but at the hall door with all his native grace he turned and gave his welcome kissing betty on the cheek with the grave ceremony of the host and lamenting poor fellow that he stood alone without his bride to receive them  is that jumbo asked betty i must thank him for all his kind service to my dear sister  faithful jumbo fairly wept wheninfinite condescension for those daysmajor delavie shook hands with him and thanked him  if pretty missie madam were but safe and well jumbo would wish no more he sobbed out  poor jumbo said mr belamour he has never been the same man since pretty missie madam has been lost i hear his violin mourning for her till it is enough to break ones heart  however eugene created a diversion by curious inquiries whether jumbo would indeed play the fiddle of which he had heard from archer and amoret and he ran off most eagerly after the negro to be introduced to the various curiosities of the place  mrs aylward attended miss delavie to her room and showed herself much softened as a good conscientious woman she felt that she had acted a selfish part towards the lonely maiden and bettys confident belief that she had been a kind friend was a keen reproach  indeed madam she said i would lief you could truly call me such but when young miss came here first i took her for one of that flighty sort that it is wise not to meddle with more than needful i have kept my place here these thirty years by never making or meddling and knowing nothing about what dont concern me and is out of my province now i wish i had let the poor young lady be more friendly with me for maybe i could have been of use to her in her need  you had no suspicion  no maam though i find there were those who suspected some one came up here disguised as jumbo but i was never one to lend an ear to gossip and by that time i trusted the dear young lady altogether and knew she would never knowingly do aught that was unbecoming her station or her religion  i am glad the dear child won your good opinion said betty  indeed maam that you may say returned mrs aylward whom anxiety had made confidential for i own i was prejudiced against her from the first as if youll excuse me maam all we bowstead people are apt to be set against whatever comes from my ladys side however one must have been made of the nether millstone not to feel the difference she made in the house she was the very life of it with her pretty ways singing and playing with the children and rousing up the poor gentleman too that had lived just like a mere heathen in a dungeon and wouldnt so much as hear a godly word in his despair and now he has a minister once a fortnight to read prayers and is quite another manall through that blessed young lady who has brought him back to light and life and as bettys tears flowed at this testimony to her sister the housekeeper added never you fear maam she is one of gods innocents and his hand will be over her  meantime having dismissed the young lover to take if he could a much needed nights rest the major was listening to mr belamours confession i was the most to blame in as much as an old fool is worse than a young one and i would that the penalty fell on me alone  if she be in my cousins hands i cannot believe that she will permit any harm to befall her said the good major still clinging to his faith in uraniathe child he had taught to ride and with whom he had danced her first minuet  what i dread most is her being forced into some low marriage said mr belamour the poor childs faith in the ceremony that passed must have been overthrown and who can tell what she may be induced to accept  it was that threat which moved you said the major  yes hargrave assured me that my lady had actually offered her to him with a bribe of a farm on easy terms and when she found that he had other intentions there seemed to be some brokendown sycophant of mars upon the cards but of course i was preferable both because my fair sisterinlaw has some lingering respect for the honour of her own blood and because the bar between aurelia and my nephew would be perpetual i knew likewise that it was my brothers earnest desire that a match should take place between your children and his  he did me too much honour the lad showed me the extract from his letter  i could not give him the whole it was fit for no eyes but mine who had so long neglected it and barely understood that it existed my poor brothers eyes were fully opened to his wifes character and even while he loved her to distraction and yielded to her fascinating mastery against his better judgment he left me the charge of trying in some degree to repair the injustice he believed you to be suffering and of counteracting evil influences on her son  that seems at least to have been done  by no efforts of mine but because the boy was happily permitted to remain with the worthy tutor his father had chosen for him and because wayland is an excellent man wise and prudent in all things save in being bewitched by a fair face would that he were returned when i first consented to act this fools part i trusted that he would have been at home soon enough to prevent more than the nominal engagement and when my ladys threats rendered it needful to secure the poor child by giving her my name i still expected him before my young gentleman should utterly betray himself by his warmth  he tells me that he has written  true on that i insisted and i am the more uneasy for there has been ample time for a reply it is only too likely from what my nephew tells me of his venturesome explorations that he may have fallen into the hands of the moorish corsairs hargrave says it is rumoured but my lady will not be checked in her career of pleasure and if she is fearful of his return she may precipitate matters with the poor girl  come come sir i cannot have you give way to despondency you did your best and if it did not succeed it was owing to my foolish daughter arden why if she was not satisfied about her sister could she not have come here and demanded an explanation that would have been the straightforward way  would that she had or would that i had sooner discovered my own entire recovery which i owe in very truth to the sweet being who has brought new life alike of body and mind to me and who must think i have requited her so cruelly     chapter xxvii cythereas bower       there citherea goddesse was and quene     honourid highly for her majeste     and eke her sonne the mighty god i weene     cupid the blinde that for his dignite     a m lovers worshipp on ther kne     there was i bid on pain of dethe to pere     by mercury the winged messengrechaucer   by twelve oclock on the ensuing day mr belamour with eugene and jumbo was set down at a hotel near whitehall to secure apartments while the major went on to demand his daughter from lady belamour taking with him betty whom he allowed to be a much better match for my lady than he could be very little faith in his cousin urania remained to him in the abstract yet even now he could not be sure that she would not talk him over and hoodwink him in any actual encounter sir amyas likewise accompanied him both to gratify his own anxiety and to secure admission the young man still looked pale and worn with restless anxiety but he had in spite of remonstrances that morning discarded his sling saying that he should return to his quarters let his colonel do his worst then he had still more liberty than if compelled to return to his mothers house  lady belamour had on her second marriage forsaken her own old hereditary mansion in the strand where sir jovian had died and which she said gave her the vapours mr wayland whose wealth far exceeded her own had purchased one of the new houses in hanover square the fashionable quarter and very much admired but the major regretted the gloomy dignity of the separate enclosure and walled court of delavie house whereas the new one in modern fashion had only an area and steps between the front and the pavement  the hall door stood wide open with a stately porter within and lackeys planted about at intervals grey descended from the box and after some inquiry brought word that her ladyship was at breakfast then at a sign from his master opened the carriage door sir amyas taking betty by the tips of her fingers led her forward receiving by the way greetings and inquiries from the servants whose countenances showed him to be a welcome arrival  is it a reception day maine he asked of a kind of majordomo whom he met on the top of the broad stairs  no your honour  is company with her ladyship  no not company sir with a certain hesitation which damped bettys satisfaction in the first assurance  what did she see as maine opened the door it was a very spacious bedroom the bed in an alcove hung with rosecoloured satin embroidered with myrtles and white roses looped up with lace and muslin like draperies hung round the window fluted silk lined the room and beautiful japanned and inlaid cabinets and etageres adorned the walls bearing all varieties and devices of new and old porcelain from chins sevres dresden or worcester tokens of mr waylands travels there was a toilette table before one window covered with lacquer ware silver and ivory boxes and other apparatus and an exquisite venetian mirror with the borders of frosted silver work  not far off but sideways to it sat lady belamour in a loose sacque of some rich striped silk in crimson and blue stripes shot with gold threads slippers embroidered with gold showed off her dainty feet and a french hairdresser stood behind her chair putting the finishing touches to the imposing fabric of powder flower and feather upon her head a little handmirror framed in carved ivory inlaid with coral and a fan lay on a tiny spindlelegged table close in front of her together with a buffcoloured cup of chocolate at a somewhat larger table mrs loveday her woman was dispensing the chocolate whilst a little negro boy in a fantastic oriental costume waited to carry the cups about  on a sofa near at hand in an easy attitude reclined colonel mar holding out to lady belamour a snuffbox of tortoiseshell and gold and a lady sat near on one of the tall blackandgold chairs drinking chocolate while all were giving their opinions on the laces feathers ribbons and trinkets which another frenchman was displaying from a basketbox placed on the floor trying to keep aloof a little maltese liondog which had been roused from its cushion and had come to inspect his wares a little further off archer in a blue velvet coat white satin waistcoat and breeches and silk stockings and amoret whitefrocked bluesashed and bareheaded an innovation of fashion were admiring the nodding mandarins grinning nondescript monsters and green lions of extraordinary form which an emissary from a curiosityshop was unpacking near the door in an attitude weary yet obsequious stood paper in hand a dejected figure in shabby plumcolourie a poor authorwaiting in hopes that his sonnet in praise of cythereas triumphant charms would win his the guinea he so sorely needed as               to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame               and heap the shrine of luxury and pride             with incense kindled at the muses flame   the scene was completed by a blue and yellow macaw at one window chained to his perch and a green monkey tethered in like manner at the other  of course elizabeth delavie did not perceive all these details at once her first sensation was the shock to the decorum of a modest english lady at intruding into a bedroom but her foreign recollections coming to her aid she accepted the fashion with one momentary feminine review of her own appearance and relief that she had changed her travelling gear for her sunday silks and made her father put on his full uniform all this passed while sir amyas was leading her into the room steering her carefully out of the monkeys reach then he went a step or two forward and bent before his mother almost touching the ground with one knee as he kissed her hand and rising acknowledged the lady with a circular sweep of his hat and his colonel with a military salute all rapidly but with perfect ease and gracefulness ah my truant my runaway invalid said lady belamour you are come to surrender  i am come he said gravely holding out his stronger hand to his little brother and sister who sprang to him to bring my fatherand sisterinlaw major and miss delavie  ah my good cousin my excellent mrs betty excuse me that my tyrant friseur prevents my rising to welcome you it is so good and friendly in you to come in this informal way to cheer me under this terrible anxiety let me present you to my kind friend the countess of aresfield who has been so good as to come in today to sustain my spirits colonel mar you know already pray be seated amyasarcherchairs let syphax give you a cup of chocolate  madam said the major disregarding all this and standing as if on parade can i see you alone my business is urgent  no evil news i trust i have undergone such frightful shocks of late my constitution is well nigh ruined  it is i that have to ask news of you madam  she saw that if she trifled with him something would break out that she would not wish to have said publicly my time is so little my own she said i am under command to be at the palace by two oclock but in a few minutes i shall be able to dismiss my tormentor and then till my woman comes to dress me i shall be at your service sit down i entreat and take some chocolate i know mrs betty is an excellent housekeeper and i want her opinion my dear lady aresfield suffer me to introduce my estimable cousin mrs betty delavie  the countess looking in her feathers and powder like a beetroot in white sauce favoured betty with a broad stare vulgarity was very vulgar in those days especially when it had purchased rank and thought manners might be dispensed with betty sat down and amoret climbed on her lap while a diversion was made by archers imperious entreaty that his mamma would purchase a mandarin who not only nodded but waved his hands and protruded his tongue  then ensued what seemed to the sickening suspense of the two delavies a senseless babel of tongues on all sides but it ended in the friseur putting up his implements the tradesfolk leaving the selected goods unpaid for and the poor poet bowing himself within reach of the monkey who made a clutch at his ms chattered over it and tore it into fragments there was a peal of mirthloudest from lady aresfieldbut sir amyas sprang forward with gentlemanly regrets apologies and excuses finally opening the door and following the poor man out of the room to administer the guinea from his own pocket while colonel mar exclaimed here archer boy run after him with this the poor devil has won it by producing a smile from those divine lipssuch as his jungle might never have done  fie fie mar said the lady shaking her fan at him the child will repeat it to him  the better sport if he do said colonel mar carelessly he may term himself a very orpheus charming the beasts so that they snatch his poems from him  then as sir amyas returned lady belamour entreated her dear countess to allow him to conduct her to the withdrawing room and there endeavour to entertain her the colonel could not but follow and the major and betty found themselves at length alone with her ladyship  i trust you have come to relieve my mind as to our poor runaway she began  would to heaven i could said the major  good heavens then she has never reached you  certainly not  nor her sister oh surely she is with her sister  no madam her sisters knows nothing of her cousin you have children of your own i entreat of you to tell me what you have done with her  how should i have done anything with her i who have been feeding all this time on the assurance that she had returned to you  how could a child like her do so  we know she had money said lady belamour  and we know said betty fixing her eyes on the lady that though she escaped on the first alarm as far as sedhurst and was there seen she had decided on returning to bowstead and giving herself up to you ladyship  indeed at what time was that exclaimed my lady  some time in the afternoon of sunday  ah then i must have left bowstead i was pledged to her majestys cardtable and royal commands cannot be disregarded so i had to go away in grievous anxiety for my poor boy she meant to return to bowstead did she ah does not an idea strike you that old amyas belamour may know more than he confesses he has been playing a double game throughout  he is as anxious to find the dear girl as we are madam  so he may seem to you and to my poor infatuated boy but you see those crazed persons are full of strange devices and secrets as indeed we have already experienced i see what you would say he may appear sane and plausible enough to a stranger but to those who have known him ever since his misfortunes the truth is but too plain he was harmless enough as long as he was content to remain secluded in his dark chamber but now that i hear he has broken loose heaven knows what mischief he may do my dear cousin delavie you are the prop left to me in these troubles with my poor good man in the hands of those cruel pirates who may be making him work in chains for all i know and the tears came into her beautiful eyes  they will not do that said major delavie eager to reassure her i have heard enough of their tricks to know that they keep such game as he most carefully till they can get a ransom  your are sure of that  perfectly i met an italian fellow at vienna who told me how it was all managed by the genoese bankers  ah i was just thinking that you would be the only person who could be of useyou who know foreign languages and all their ways if you could go abroad and arrange it for me  if my daughter were restored began the major  i see what you would say and i am convinced that the first step towards the discovery would be to put mr belamour under restraint and separate his black from him then one or other of them would speak and we might know how she has been played upon  what does your ladyship suppose then asked the major  this is what i imagine the poor silly maid repents herself and comes back in search of me would that she had found me her best friend but instead of that she falls in with old belamour and he having by this time perceived the danger of the perilous masquerade in which he had involved my unlucky boy a minor has mewed her up somewhere till the cry should be over  that would be the part of a villain but scarcely of a madman said betty dryly  my dear cousin betty there are lunatics endowed with a marvellous shrewdness to commit senseless villanies and to put on a specious seeming depend upon it my unfortunate brotherinlaws wanderings at night were not solely spent in communings with the trees and brooks who knows what might be discovered if he were under proper restraint and it is to you the only relation i have that i must turn for assistance in my most unhappy circumstances she added wit a glance so full of sweet helplessness that no man could withstand it i am so glad you are here you will be acting for me as well as for yourself in endeavouring to find your poor lovely child and the first thing i would have done would be to separate belamour and his black put them under restraint and interrogate them separately you could easily get an order from a magistrate but ah here comes my woman no more now you will come to me this evening and we can talk further on this matter i shall have some company and it will not be a regular rout only a few cardtables and a little dancing for the young people  your ladyship must excuse me said betty i have no dress to appear in even if i had spirits for the company  ah my dear cousin how do you think it is with my spirits yet i think it my duty not to allow myself to be moped but to exert myself for the interest of my son while as to dress my woman can direct you to the milliner who would equip you in the last mode what still obstinate nay then harry i can take no excuse from you and i may have been able to collect some intelligence from the servants  nothing remained but to take leave and walk home the major observing  well what think you of that betty  think siri think it is not for my lady to talk of villains  she is in absolute error respecting belamour but then she has not seen him since his recovery women are prone to those fancies and in her unprotected state poor thing no wonder she takes alarms  i should have thought her rather overprotected  now betty you need not take a leaf out of mrs duckworths book and begin to be censorious you saw how relieved she was to have me her own blood relation to turn to instead of that empty braggart of a fellow besides a man does not bring his stepmother when theres anything amiss  there was something in this argument and betty held her peace knowing that to censure my lady only incited her father to defend her  for her own part her consternation was great and she walked on in silence only speaking again to acquiesce in her fathers observation that they must say nothing to mr belamour of my ladys plans for his seclusion  they found mr belamour in the square parlour of the royal york having sent eugene out for a walk with jumbo the boys return in the most eager state of excitement at the shops the horses sedans and other wonders did something together with dinner to wile away the weary time till about three hours after the major and his daughter had returned they were joined by the young baronet who came running up the stairs with a good deal more impetuosity than he would have permitted himself at home  at last i have escaped he said i fear you have waited long for me  i have been hoping you had discovered some indications said the major  alas no i should imagine my lady as ignorant as we are save for one thing  and that was  the pains that were taken to prevent my speaking with any of the servants i was forced to attend on that harridan lady aresfield till my mother sent for me and then she made mar absolutely watch me off the premises then i had to go and report myself at headquarters and see the surgeon so that there may be no colour of irregularity for the colonel to take advantage of  right right said the major do not let him get a handle against you though i should not call you fit for duty yet even for holidaywork like yours  you still suspect that your mother knows where our aurelia is said betty when i think of her demeanour i can hardly believe it but did you hear nothing of your little sisters  i did not ask in truth i was confounded by a proposal that was made to me if i will immediately marry my mothers darling lady belle i may have leave of absence from her and my regiment both at once and go to meet mr wayland if i like or at any rate make the grand tour while they try to break in my charming bride for me of course i said that being a married man nothing should induce me to break the law nor to put any lady in such a position and equally of course i was shown a lawyers opinion that the transaction was invalid  as i always believed said his uncle the ceremony must be repeated when we find her though even if you were willing the other parties are very illadvised to press for a marriage without judgment first being delivered how far the present is binding so she wants to send you off on your travels does she  she wishes me to go and arrange for her husbands ransom said the major i would be ready enough were my child only found but i believe government would take it up he being on his majestys service  it is a mere device for disposing of youyes and of my nephew too said mr belamour as for me we know already her kind plans for putting me out of reach of interference i see she communicated them to you did she ask your cooperation major ah certainly an ingenious plan for disuniting us i am the more convinced that she is well aware of where the poor child is and that she wishes to be speedy in her measures  there is no need to describe the halffrantic vehemence of the young lover nor the way in which the father and sister tried to moderate his transports though no less wretched themselves     chapter xxviii the rout       great troups of people travelled thitherward     both day and night of each degree and placespenser   much against their will major delavie and his soidisant soninlaw set forth for lady belamours entertainment thinking no opportunity of collecting intelligence was to be despised while she probably wished to obviate all reports of a misunderstanding as well as to keep them under her own eye  the reception rooms were less adorned than the ladys private apartment there were pictures on the walls and long ranks of chairs ranged round and cardtables were set out in order the ladies sat in rows and the gentlemen stood in knots and talked all in full dress resplendent figures in brilliant velvet gold lace and embroidery with swords by their sides cocked hats edged with gold or silver lace under their arms and gemmed shoe buckles the order of creation was not yet reversed the male creature was quite as gorgeous in colour and ornament as the female who sat in her brocade powder and patches fan in hand to receive the homage of his snuffbox  sir amyas went the round giving and returning greetings which were bestowed on him with an ardour sufficient to prove that he was a general favourite his mother exquisitely dressed in a rich rosecoloured velvet train over a creamy satin petticoat both exquisitely embroidered sailed up with a cordial greeting to her good cousin and wanted to set him down to loo or ombre but the veteran knew too well what the play in her house was and saw moreover lady aresfield sitting like a harpy before the green baize field of her spoils while he was refusing sir amyas returned to him saying sir here is a gentleman whom i think you must have known in flanders and the major found himself shaking hands with an old comrade save for his heavy heart he would been extremely happy in the ensuing conversation  in the meantime lady belamour turning towards a stout clumsy short girl her intensely red cheeks and huge black eyes staring out of her powder while the extreme costliness of her crimson satin dress and profusion of her rubies were ridiculous on the unformed person of a creature scarcely fifteen if she had been any one else she would have been a hideous spectacle in the eyes of the exquisitely tasteful lady belamour who detecting the expression in her sons eye whispered behind her fan we will soon set all that right then aloud my son cannot recover from his surprise he did not imagine that we could steal you for an evening from queens square to procure him this delight then as sir amyas bowed the yellow room is cleared for dancing lady belle will favour you amyas  you must excuse me madam he said i have not yet the free use of my arm and could not acquit myself properly in a minuet  i hate minuets returned lady belle the very notion gives me the spleen  ah pretty heretic said my lady making a playful gesture with her fan at the peonycoloured cheek i meant this wounded knight to have converted you but he must amuse you otherwise what my lord i thought you knew i never meant to dance again cannot you open the dance without me i who have no spirits  the rest was lost as she sailed away on the arm of a gentleman in a turquoisecoloured coat and waistcoat embroidered with gillyflowers leaving the lady arabella on the hands of her son who neither as host nor gentleman could escape until the young lady had found some other companion he stiffly and wearily addressed to her the inquiry how she liked london  i should like it monstrously if i were not moped up in school she answered so you have come back how did you hurt your arm she said in the most provincial of dialects  in the fire madam  what in snatching your innamorata from the flames  not precisely he said  come now tell me did she set the room afire demanded the young lady oh you need not think to deceive me my brother mars coachman told my mammas woman all about it and how she was locked up and ran away but they have her fast enough now after all her tricks  who have for pitys sake tell me lady belle  loving to tease she exclaimed there now what a work to make about a whitefaced little rustic  your ladyship has not seen her  have i not though i dont admire your taste  is she in queens square  do not you wish me to tell you where you can find your old faded doll with a waist just like a wasp and an old blue sacquenot a bit of powder in her hair  lady belle if you would have me for ever beholden to you  the cap fits she cried clapping her hands not a word to say for her i would not have such a beau for the world  when i have found her it will be time to defend her beauty if your ladyship would only tell me where she is you know not what gratitude i should feel  i dare say but thats my secret my mamma and yours would be ready to kill me with rage if they knew i had let out even so much  they would forgive you come lady belle think of her brave old father and give some clue to finding her where is she  ah where you will never get at her  is she at queens square  what would you do if you thought she was get a constable and come and search oh what a rage madam would be in goodness me what sport and she fell back in a violent giggling fit but the two matrons were so delighted to see the young people talking to one another that there was no attempt to repress her sir amyas made another attempt to elicit whether aurelia were really at the school in queens square but lady arabella still refused to answer directly then he tried the expedient of declaring that she was only trying to tease him and had not really seen the lady he pretended not to believe her but when she insisted hair just the colour of lady belamours his incredulity vanished but on his next entreaty she put on a sly look imitated from the evil world in which she lived and declared she should not encourage naughty doings the youth who though four years older was by far the more simple and innocent of the two replied with great gravity it is the lady belamour my own wife that i am seeking  thats just the nonsense she talks  for heavens sake what did she say  but belle was tired of her game and threw herself boisterously on a young lady who had the sweetest enamel necklace in the world and whose ornaments she began to handle and admire in true spoiltchild fashion  sir amyas then betook himself to the major who saw at once by his eye and step that something was gained they took leave together lady belamour making a hurried lamentation that she had seen so little of her dear cousin but accepting her sons excuse that he must return to his quarters and they walked away together escorted by palmer and grey as well as by two linkboys summer night though it was  sir amyas repaired first to the hotel where mr belamour and betty were still sitting for even the fashionable world kept comparatively early hours and it was not yet eleven oclock the parlor where they sat was nearly dark one candle out and the other shaded so as to produce the dimness which mr belamour still preferred and they were sitting on either side of the open window betty listening to her companions reminiscences of the evenings enlivened by poor aurelia and of the many traits of her goodness sweet temper and intelligence which he had stored up in his mind he had he said already learned through her to know miss delavie and he declared that the voices of the sisters were so much alike that he could have believed himself at bowstead with the gentle visitor who had brought him new life  the tidings of lady arabellas secret were eagerly listened to and the token of the mousecoloured hair was accepted sir amyas comparing to every ones satisfaction a certain lock that he bore on a chain next his heart and a little knot surrounded with diamonds in a ring which he had been still wearing from force of habit though he declared he should never endure to do so again  it was evident that lady belle had really seen aurelia and where could that have been save at the famous boardingschool in queens square where the daughters of the great were trained in the accomplishments of the day the major with rising hopes declared that he had always maintained that his cousin meant no ill by his daughter and though it had been cruel not to say worse in her to deny all knowledge of the fugitive yet women would have their strange ways  that is very hard on us women sir said betty  ah my dear poor urania never had such a mother as you and she has lived in the great world besides and thats a bad school you will not take our aurelia much into it my dear boy he added turning wistfully to sir amyas  i would not let a breath blow on her that could touch the bloom of her charming frank innocence cried the lad but think you she can be in health lady belle spoke of her being pale  look at my young lady herself said the major which made them all laugh they were full of hope the major and his daughter would go themselves the next day and a fathers claim could not be refused even though not enforced according to lady arabellas desire  their coachfor so sir amyas insisted on their goingwas at the door at the earliest possible moment that a school for young ladies could be supposed to be astir long before mr belamour was up for he retained his old habits so much that it was only on great occasions the he rose before noon and while eugene under the care of jumbo and grey was going off in great felicity to see the morning parade in st jamess park  one of the expedients of wellborn huguenot refugees had been tuition and madame delmar had made here boardingschool so popular and fashionable that a second generation still maintained its fame and damsels of the highest rank were sent there to learn french to play the spinnet to embroider to dance and to get into a carriage with grace it was only countrified misses bred by oldfashioned scholars who attempted to go any farther such as that lusus naturae miss elizabeth carter who knew seven languages or the bishop of oxfords niece catherine talbot who even painted natural flowers and wrote meditations the education aurelia delavie had received over her homer and racine would be smiled at as quite superfluous  there was no difficulty about admission the coach with its belamour trappings was a warrant of admittance the father and daughter were shown into a parlour with a print of marshal schomberg over the mantelpiece and wonderful performances in tapestry work and embroidery on every available chair as well as framed upon the wainscoted walls  a little lady more french than english moving like a perfectly wound up piece of mechanism all but her bright little eyes appeared at their request to see madame it had been agreed beforehand that the major should betray neither doubt nor difficulty but simply say that he had come up from the country and wished to see his daughter  madame in perfectly good english excused herself but begged to hear the name again  there must be some error no young lady of the name of delavie was there  they looked at one another then betty asked has not a young lady been placed here by lady belamour  no madam lady belamour once requested me to receive her twin daughters but they were mere infants i receive none under twelve year old  my good lady cried the major if you are denying my daughter to me pray consider what you are doing i am her own father and whatever lady belamour may tell you i can enforce my claim  i am not in the habit of having my word doubted sir and the little lady drew herself up like a true gascon baroness as she was  madam forgive me i am in terrible perplexity and distress my poor child who was under lady belamours charge has been lost to us these three weeks or more and we have been told that she has been seen here  thus said betty seeing that the lady still needed to be appeased we thought lady belamour might have deceived you as well as others  may i ask who said the young lady had been seen here asked the mistress coldly  it was lady arabella mar said betty and justly speaking i believe she did not say it was here that my poor sister was seen but that she had seen her and we drew the conclusion that it was here  my lady arabella mar is too often taken out by my lady countess said madame delmar  could i see her perhaps she would tell me where she saw my dear sister said betty  she went to a rout last evening and has not returned was the reply indeed my lady her mother spoke as if she might never come back her marriage being on the tapis indeed sir indeed madam i should most gladly assist you she said as a gesture of bitter grief and disappointment passed between father and daughter both of whom were evidently persons of condition if it will be any satisfaction to the lady to see all my pupils i will conduct her through my establishment  betty caught at this though there was no doubt that the mistress was speaking in good faith she was led to a large empty room where a dozen young ladies were drawn up awaiting the dancing mastergirls from fourteen to seventeen the elder ones in mob caps those with more pretensions to fashion with loose hair their twelve curtsies were made their twentyfour eyes peeped more or less through their lashes at the visitor but no such soft brown eyes as aurelias were among them  madame said betty may i be permitted to ask the ladies a question she spoke it low and in french and her excellent accent won madames heart at once only madame trusted to mademoiselles discretion not to put mysteries into their minds or they would be all tete montee  so as discretely as the occasion would permit betty asked whether any one had seen or heard lady belle speak of having seen any onea young lady  halfadozen tongues broke out we thought it all lady belles whimsical secrets and as many stories were beginning but madames awful little hand waved silence as she said speak then miss staunton  i know none of lady belles secrets maamask miss howard  miss howard looked sulky and a little eager blackeyed thing cried she said it was an odious girl whom lady belamour keeps shut up in a great dungeon of an old house and is going to send beyond seas because she married two men at once in disguise  fie miss crawford you know nothing about it  you told me so yourself miss howard  i never said anything so foolish  hush young ladies said madame miss howard if you know anything i request you to speak  it would be a great kindness said betty might i ask the favour of seeing miss howard in private  madame consented and miss howard followed betty out of hearing muttering that belle would fly at her for betraying her  i do not like asking you to betray your friends confidence said betty  oh as to that im not her friend and i believe she has talked to a halfadozen more  i am this poor young ladys sister said betty we are afraid she has fallen into unkind hands and i should be very thankful if you could help me to find her where do you think lady belle saw her  i thought it was in some old house in hertfordshire said miss howard more readily but i am not sure for it was last sunday which she spent with her mamma she came back and made it a great secret that she had seen the girl that had taken in sir amyas belamour who was contracted to herself to marry him and his uncle both at once in disguise and then had set the house afire belle had got some one to let her see the girl and then she went on about her being not pretty  what did she say about sending her beyond seas  oh that miss crawford made up she told me that they were going to find a husband for her such as a low creature like that deserved and she protests she is to be married to sir amyas very soon and come back here while he makes the grand tour i hope she wont she will have more spiteful ways than ever  this was all that betty could extract she saw miss crawford alone but her tiding melted into the vaguest secondhand hearsay the inquiry had only produced a fresh anxiety     chapter xxix a black blondel       and to the castle gate approached in quiet wise     whereat soft knocking entrance he desired                                           spenser   nephew is delavie house inhabited inquired mr belamour as the baffled seekers sat together that evening  no sir replied sir amyas my lady will only lease it to persons of quality on such high terms that she cannot obtain them for a house in so antiquated a neighbourhood oh you do not think it possible that my dearest life can be in captivity so near us an old house on my soul so it must be i will go thither instantly  and be taken for a mohock no no sit down rash youth and tell me who keeps the house  one madge an old woman as sour as vinegar who snarled at me like a toothless cur when i once went there to find an old fowlingpiece of my fathers  then you ar the last person who should show yourself there since there are sure to be strict charges against admitting you and you would only put the garrison on the alert you had better let the reconnoitring party consist of jumbo and myself  the ensuing day was sunday something was said of st pauls then in bloom of youth and the wonder of england but betty declared that she could not run about to see fine churches till her mind was at ease about her poor sister might she only go to the nearest and quietest church so she with her father and eugene repaired to st clement danes where their landlord possessed a solid oak pew and they heard a sermon on the wickedness and presumption of inoculating for the smallpox  it was not a genteel neighbourhood and the congregation was therefore large for the substantial tradesfolk who had poured into the strand since it had been rebuilt were far more religiously disposed than the fashionable world retaining either the puritan zeal or the high church fervour which were alike discouraged in the godless court the major and his son and daughter were solitary units in the midst of the groups of portly citizens with soberly handsome wives and gay sons and daughters who were exchanging greetings and on their return to their hotel the major betook himself to a pipe in the bar and eugene was allowed to go for a walk in the park with palmer while betty sat in her own room with her bible striving to strengthen her assurance that the innocent would never be forsaken indeed mr belamour had much strengthened her grounds of hope and comfort by his testimony to poor aurelias perfect guilelessness and simplicity throughout the affair yet the echo of that girls chatter about lady belles rival being sent beyond the sea would return upon her ominously although it might be mere exaggeration and misapprehension like so much besides  a great clock chiming one warned her to repair to the sittingroom where she met eugene full of the unedifying spectacle of a fight between two street lads there had been a regular ring and the boy had been so much excited that palmer had had much ado to bring him away betty had scarcely hushed his eager communications and repaired his toilette for dinner before sir amyas came in having hurried away as soon as possible after attending his men to and from church  sister he said for so he insisted on calling betty i really think my uncles surmise may be right i went home past delavie house last night just to look at it and there wasthere really was a light in one of the windows on the first floor which always used to be as black as erebus i had much ado to keep myself from thundering at the gate i would have done so before now but for my uncles warning where can he be  the major and mr belamour here came in together and the same torrent was beginning to be poured forth when the latter cut it short with they are about to lay the cloth restrain yourself my dear boy or and as at that moment the waiter entered he went on with the utmost readinessor as it seems the queen of hungary will never make good her claims pray sir turning to major delavie have you ever seen these young archduchesses whose pretensions seem likely to convulse the continent to its centre  the major with an effort to gather his attention replied that he could not remember but betty with greater presence of mind described how she had admired the two sisters of austria as little girls walking on the prater indeed she and mr belamour contrived to keep up the ball till the major was roused into giving an opinion of prussian discipline and to tell stories of leopold of dessau eugene and marlborough with sufficient zest to drive the young baronet almost frantic especially as jumbo behind his masters chair was on the broad grin all the time and almost dancing in his shoes once he contrived to give an absolute wink with one of his big black eyes not however undetected for mr belamour in a grave tone of reprimand ordered him off to fetch an ivory toothpickcase  not till the cloth had been remove and dishes of early strawberries and of biscuits accompanied by bottles of port and claret placed on the table and the servants had withdrawn did mr belamour observe i have penetrated the outworks  there was an outburst of inquiry and explanation but he was not to be prevented from telling the story in his own way i know the house well for my brother lived there the first years of his marriage before you came on the stage young sir perhaps you do not know how to open the door from without  oh sir tell me the trick  mr belamour held up a small passkey there was a certain tone of banter about him which almost drove his nephew wild but greatly reassured miss delavie  whywhy keep me in torments instead of taking me with you cried the youth  because i wished my expedition to be no failure i could not tell whether my key which i found with my watch and seals would still serve me ah you look on fire but remember the outworks are not the citadel  for heavens sake sir torture me not thus  i knew that to make my summons at the out gate would lead to a summary denial by the sour porteress so i experimented on the lock of the little door into the lane and admitted myself and jumbo into the court but the great halldoor stood before me jealously closed and the lower windows were shut with shutters so that all i could do was to cause jumbo to awake the echoes with a lusty peal on the knocker which he repeated at intervals until there hobbled forth to open it a crone as wrinkled and crabbed as one of macbeths witches i demanded whether my lady belamour lived there she croaked forth a negative sound and had nearly shut the door in my face but i kept her in parley by protesting that i had often visited my lady there and offering a crownpiece if she would direct me to her  a crown a kingdom if she would bring us to the right one cried sir amyas  of course she directed me to hanover square and then evidently supposing there was something amiss with the great gates she insisted on coming to let me out and securing them after me  the youth gave a great groan saying excuse me sir but what are we the better of that  endure a little while impatient swain and you shall hear i fancy she recognised the belamour livery on jumbo for she hobbled by my side maundering apologies about its being against orders to admit gentle or simple beast or body into the court and that a poor woman could not lose her place and the roof over her head but mark me while this was passing jumbo who had kept nearer the house whistling the nightingale just above his breath heard his name called and presently saw two little faces at an upstairs window  my little sisters cried sir amyas  even so and he believes he heard one of them call out cousin cousin aura come and see jumbo but as the window was high up i scarce dare credit his ears rather than his imagination and we were instantly hustled away by the old woman whose evident alarm is a further presumption that the captive is there since faith and hope scarce have reached the years of being princesses immured in towers  it must be so said betty it would explain lady belles having had access to her and now  is it impossible to effect an entrance from the court and carry her away asked sir amyas  entirely so said his uncle the only door into the court is fit to stand a siege and all the lower windows are barred and fastened with shutters the servants entrance is at the back towards the river but no doubt it is also guarded and my key will not serve for it  i could get some sprightly fellow of ours to come disguised as mohocks and break in proceeded the youth eagerly once in the court trust me for forcing my way to her  and getting lodged in newgate for your pains or tried by courtmartial said the major no when right is on our side do not let us make it wrong hush sir amyas it is i who must here act whether you are her husband i do not know i know that i am her father and tomorrow morning as soon as a magistrate can be spoken with i shall go and demand a search warrant for the body of my daughter aurelia delavie  the body good heavens sir cried betty  not without the sweet soul my dear miss delavie said mr belamour your excellent father has arrived at the only right and safe decision and provided no farther alarm is given i think he may succeed it is scarcely probable that my lady is in constant communication with her stern porteress and my person was evidently unknown for her own sake as well as that of the small fee i dropped into her hand she is unlikely to report my reconnoissance  sir amyas was frantic to go with his fatherinlaw but both the elder men justly thought that his ambiguous claims would but complicate the matter the landlord was consulted as to the acting magistrates of the time and gave two or three addresses  another night of prayer suspense and hope for bettys sick heart then immediately after breakfast the major set forth attended by palmer long before mr belamour had left his room or the young baronet could escape from his military duties being outside the city the strand was under the jurisdiction of justices of the peace for middlesex and they had so much more than they could do properly that some of them did it as little as possible the first magistrate would not see him because it was too early to attend to business the second never heard matters at his private house and referred him to the office in bow street in fact he would have been wiser to have gone thither at first but he had hoped to have saved time he had to wait sitting on a greasy chair when he could no longer stand till case after case was gone through and when he finally had a hearing and applied for a warrant to search for his daughter in delavie house there was much surprise and reluctance to put such an insult on a lady of quality in favour at court on his giving his reasons on oath for believing the young lady to be there the grounds of his belief seemed to shrink away so that the three magistrates held consultation whether the warrant could be granted finally after eying him all over and asking him where he had served one of them who had the air of having been in the army told him that in consideration of his being a gentleman of high respectability who had served his country they granted what he asked being assured that he would not make the accusation lightly the reforms made by fielding had not yet begun everybody had too much work and the poor major had still some time to wait before an officertipstaff as he was calledcould accompany him so that it was past noon when off in the bowstead carriage again they went along the strand to a highwalled court belonging to one of the old houses of the nobility most of which had perished in the fire of london there was a doubledoored gateway and after much thundering in vain at which the tipstaff a rednosed old soldier waxed very irate the old woman came out in curtseying crying frightened humility declaring that they would find no one therethey might look if they would  so they drove over the paved road crossing the pitched pebbles the door was unbarred but no aurelia sprang into her fathers arms only a little terrier came barking out into the dismal paved hall into every room they looked the old woman asseverating denials that it was of no use they might see for themselves that no one had been there for years past full of emptiness indeed with faded grimy family portraits on the walls motheaten carpets and cushions highbacked chairs with wormholes and yet somehow there was one room that did look as if it had recently been sat in two little stools were drawn up close to a chair the terrier poked and smelt about uneasily as though in search of some one and dragged out from under a couch a childs ball which he began to worry on the carpet too were some fragments of bright fresh embroidery silk which the practiced eye of the constable noticed this here was not left ten or a dozen years ago said he and extracting the ball from the fangs of the dog no and this ball aint ten year old neither come mother whatsname its no good deceiving an officer of the law whose is this here ball  its the little misses theyve a bin here with their maid but their nurse have been and fetched em away this morning and a good riddance too  who was the maidon your oath  one deborah davis a deaf woman and pretty nigh a dumb one she be gone too  nor could the old woman tell where she was to be found my ladys woman sent her in she said and she was glad enough to be rid of her  come now my good woman speak out and it will be better for you said the major i know my daughter was here yesterday  and what do i know of where she be gone she went off in a sedanchair this morning before seven oclock and if you was to put me to the rack i couldnt say no more  as to which way or with whom she had gone the old woman was apparently really ignorant  the poor major had to return home baffled and despairing still taking the tipstaff with him in case on consultation with mr belamour it should be deemed expedient to storm hanover square itself and examine lady belamour and her servants upon oath  behold the parlour was empty even betty and eugene were absent the major hastened to knock at mr belamours door there was no answer and when he knocked louder it was still in vain he tried the door and found it locked then he retreated to the sittingroom rang and made inquiries of the waiter who answered the bell  mr belamour had received a note at about ten oclock and had gone out with him in great disorder said the waiter  at the same moment there was a knock at the door and a billet was brought in from lady belamour the major tore it open and read     my dear cousin        i grieve for you but my suspicions were correct  we have all been completely hoodwinked by that old villain my brotherinlaw i can give him no other name for his partial aberration of mind has only sharpened his natural cunning would you believe it he had obtained access to delavie house and had there hidden the unfortunate object of your search while he pretended to be assisting you and this morning he carried her off in a sedan i have sent the good doves to bowstead in case he should have the assurance to return to his old quarters but i suspect that they are on the way to dover you had better consult with hargrave on the means of confirming the strange marriage ceremony that has passed between them since that affords the best security for your daughters maintenance and reputation believe me i share in your distress indeed i have so frightful a megrim that i can scarcely tell what i write and i dare not admit you today                   i remain             your loving and muchgrieved cousin                               urania belamour   poor major his horror perplexity and despair were indescribable he had one only hopethat sir amyas and betty might be on the track     chapter xxx the first task       after all these there marcht a most faire dame     led of two gryslie villains th one despight     the other cleped crueltie by name                                       spenser   the traces of occupation had not deceived major delavie aurelia had been recently in delavie house and we must go back some way in our narrative to her arrival there  she had on her return from sedhurst on that sunday reached bowstead and entered by the lobby door just as lady belamour was coming down the stairs only attended by her woman and ready to get into the carriage which waited at the hall door  sinking on her knees before her with clasped hands aurelia exclaimed o madam i ought not to have come away here i am do what you will with me but spare my father he knew nothing of it only for pitys sake do not put me among the poor wicked creatures in gaol  get into that carriage immediately and you shall know by decision said lady belamour with icy frigidness but not the same fierceness as before and aurelia submissively obeyed silenced by an imperious gesture when she would have asked how is it with him whom she durst not name  lady belamour waited a minute or two while sending loveday on a last message to the sick room then entered the large deep carriage signing to her captive to take a corner where she could hardly be seen if any one looked through the window loveday followed the door was shut by a strange servant as it was in fact lady aresfields carriage borrowed both for the sake of speed and of secrecy towards her own household  a few words passed by which aurelia gathered something reassuring as to the state of the patient and then lady belamour turned on her demanding so young miss you tried to escape me where have you been  only as far as sedhurst church madam i would have gone home but i feared to bring trouble on my father and i came back to implore you to forgive  there was no softening of the terrible beautiful face before her and she durst put no objective case to her verb however the answer was somewhat less dreadful than she had anticipated  i have been shamefully duped said lady belamour but it is well that it is no worse nor shall i visit our offences on your father if you show your penitence by absolute submission the absurd ceremony you went through was a mere mockery and the old fool belamour showed himself crazed for consenting to such an improper frolic on the part of my son whether your innocence be feigned or not however i cannot permit you to go out of my custody until the foolish youth or yourself be properly bestowed in marriage elsewhere meantime you will remain where i place you and exactly fulfil my commands remember that any attempt to communicate with any person outside the house will be followed by your fathers immediate dismissal  may i not let him know that i am safe  certainly not i will see to your father  it was a period when great ladies did not scruple to scold at the top of their voices and sometimes proceed to blows but lady belamour never raised her low silvery tones and thus increased the awfulness of her wrath and the impressiveness of her determination face to face with her there were few who did not cower under her displeasure and poor aurelia resolute to endure for her fathers sake could only promise implicit obedience  she only guessed when the entered london by the louder rumbling and for one moment the coach paused as a horse was reined up near it and with plumed hat in hand the rider bent forward to the window exclaiming successful by all that is lovely captured by jove  you shall hear all another time said lady belamour let us go on now  they did so but the horseman continued to flash across the windows and when the coach after considerable delay had entered the walled court rumbled over the pavement and stopped before a closed door he was still there when after much thundering the door was opened aurelia had a moments glimpse of a splendid figure in gold and scarlet handing out lady belamour who stood talking with him on the steps of the house for some moments then shrugging his shoulders he remounted and cantered off after which my lady signed to aurelia to alight and followed her into the hall  madge said lady belamour to the witchlike old woman who had admitted her this young lady is to remain here you will open a bedroom and sittingroom for her at the back of the house let her be properly cared for and go out in the court behind but on no account approach the front gates let no one know she is here  madge muttered some demands about supplies and payments and lady belamour waved her to settle them with mrs loveday turning meantime to the prisoner and saying there child you are to remain here on your good behaviour do your best to merit my good will so that i may overlook what is past recollect the least attempt to escape or to hold intercourse with the young or the old fool and it shall be the worse with them and with your father  therewith she departed followed by loveday leaving aurelia standing in the middle of the hall the old hag gazing on her with a malignant leer ho ho so thats the way he has begun that work early has he whats your name my lass oh you need give yourself airs i cry you mercy and she made a derisive curtsey  poor aurelia pride had less to do with her silence than absolute uncertainty what to call herself the wedding ring was on her finger and she would not deny her marriage by calling herself delavie but belamour might be dangerous and the prefix was likewise a difficulty so faltered you may call me madam aurelia  madam really thats a queer name but it will serve while you are here  pray let me go to my room entreated the poor prisoner who felt as ineffable disgust at her jailor and was becoming sensible to extreme fatigue  your room hey dye think i keep rooms and beds as though this were an inn singlehanded as i am you must wait unless you be too fine to lend a hand  anything will do said aurelia if i may only rest i would help but i am so much tired that i can hardly stand  my lady has given it to you well mistress really or mistress falsely which ever you may be mumbled madge perhaps in soliloquy fumbling at the lock of a room which at last she opened it smelt very close and fusty and most of the furniture was heaped together under a cloth in the midst dimly visible by the light of a heartshaped aperture in the shutters unclosing one of the leaves the old woman admitted enough daylight to guide aurelia to a couch against the wall saying you can wait there till i see to your bed and youll be wanting supper too she added in a tone of infinite disgust  o never mind supper if i can only go to bed sighed aurelia sinking on the couch as the old woman hobbled off lassitude and exhaustion had brought her to a state like annihilationunable to think or guess hope or fear with shoes hurting her footsore feet a stiff dress cramping her too much for sleep and her weary aching eyes gathering a few impressions in a passive way on the walls hung dimly seen portraits strangely familiar to her the man in a green dressing gown with floating hair had a face she knew so had the lady in the yellow ruff and was that not the old crest the delavie butterfly with the motto ma vie et ma mie carved on the mantelpiece thus she knew that she must be in delavie house and felt somewhat less desolate as she recognised several portraits as duplicates of those at the great house at carminster and thought they looked at her in pity with their eyes like her fathers the youngest son in the great family group was as she knew an amyas and he put her in mind of her own oh was he her own when she could not tell whether those great soft darkgrey eyes that looked so kindly on her had descended to the young baronet she hoped not for harriet and she had often agreed that they presaged the fate of that gallant youth who had been killed by sir bevil grenvilles side he must have looked just as sir amyas did lying senseless after the hurt she had caused  no more definite nor useful thought passed through the brain of the overwearied maiden as she rest on the couch how long she knew not but it was growing dark by the time madge returned with a guttering candle a cracked plate and wedge of greasylooking pie a piece of dry bread a pewter cup of small beer and an impaired repulsive steel knife with a rounded end and fork with broken prong the fact of this being steel was not distressing to one who had never seen a silver fork but the condition of both made her shudder and added to the sick sense of exhaustion that destroyed her appetite she took a little of the bread and being parched with thirst drank some of the beer before madge came back again oh ho youre nice i see my fine dame really  thank you indeed i cant eat i am so much tired said aurelia apologetically  youll have to put up with what serves your betters i can tell you was all the reply she received well be ye coming to your bed  so up the creaking stairs she was guided to a room very unlike that fresh white bower at bowstead large eerie ghostlylooking bare save for a dark oak chest and a bed of the same material the posts apparently absolute trees squared and richly carved and supporting a solid wooden canopy with an immense boss as big as a cabbage and carved something like one depending from the centre as if to endanger the head of the unwary who should start up in bed no means of ablution were provided and aurelia felt so grimed and dusty that she ventured to beg for an ewer and basin but her amiable hostess snarled out that she had enough to do without humouring fiddlefaddle whimsies and that she might wash at the pump if nothing else would serve her  aurelia wished she had known this before going up stairs and worn out as she was the sense implanted by her mother that it was wicked to go to sleep dirty actually made her drag herself down to a grim little scullery where she was permitted to borrow a wooden bowl since she was too nice forsooth to wash down stairs she carried it up with a considerable trouble more than half full and a bit of yellow soap and clean towel were likewise vouchsafed to her the washperhaps because of the infinite trouble it cost herdid her great goodit gave her energy to recollect her prayers and bring good angels about her if this had been her first plunge from home when jumbos violin had so scared her such a place as this would have almost killed her but the peace that had come to her in sedhurst church lingered still round her and as she climbed up into the lofty bed the verse sang in her ears love is strong as death whether love divine or human she did not ask herself but with the sense of soothing upon her she sleptand slept as a seventeenyearsold frame will sleep after having been thirtysix hours awake and afoot  when she awoke it was with the sense of some one being in the room o gemini she heard and starting up only just avoiding the knob she saw mrs lovedays wellpreserved brunette face gazing at her  your servant maam she said youll excuse me if i speak with you here for i must be back by the time my ladys bell rings  is it very late said aurelia taking from under her pillow her watch which had stopped long ago  nigh upon ten oclock said loveday i must not stay but it is my ladys wish that you should have all that is comformable and youll let me know how madge behaves herself  is there any news from bowstead was all aurelia could at first demand  not yet but bless you my dear young lady you had best put all that matter out of your head for ever and a day i know what these young gentlemen are they are not to be hearkened to one moment not the best of them let them be ever so much in earnest at the time their parents and guardians have the mastery of them sooner or later and the farther it has gone the worse it is i saw you lying asleep here looking so innocent that it went to my heart and i heard you mutter in your sleep love is strong as death but thats only a bit of some playbook and dont you trust to it for i never saw love that was stronger than a spiders web  oh hush mrs loveday it is in the bible  you dont say so maam the woman said awestruck  i would show it you only all my things are away god is love you know said aurelia sitting up with clasped hands and he gives it so it must be strong  well all the love ive ever seen was more the devils said loveday truly enough and youll find it so if you mean to trust to these fine young beaux and what they say  aurelia shook her head a little as she sat up in bed with her clasped hands and there was a look on her face that mrs loveday did not understand as she went on with her advice  so my dear young lady you see all that is left for you is to frame your mind to keep close here and conform to my ladys will till all is blown over one way or another  i know that said aurelia  dont you do anything to anger her added the waitingwoman for theres no one who can stand against her and ill speak up for you when i can for i know how to come round my lady if any one does tell me what you want and ill get it for you but dont try to get out and dont send madge for she is not to be trusted with money if i were you id not let her see that watch and id lock my door at night youre too innocent whatever my lady may say heres half a pound of tea and sugar which you had best keep to yourself and ive seen to there being things decent down stairs tell me my dear is there anything you want your clothes did you say oh yes you shall have themyes and your books heres some warm water as a growling was heard at the door i must not wait till you are dressed but theres a box of shells down in your room that mr wayland sent home for my lady to line a grotto with and she wants them all sorted out tell her she must make herself of use if she wants to be forgiven says my lady for she is in a mighty hurry for them now she has heard of the duchess of portlands grotto though she has let them lie here unpacked for this half year and more so if they are all done by night maybe may lady will be pleased to let you have a bit more liberty  mrs loveday departed having certainly cheered the captive and aurelia rose wearylimbed and sadhearted with a patient trust in her soul that love divine would not fail her and that earthly love would do its best  she found matters improved in the downstairs room the furniture was in order a clean cloth on the table a white roll butter and above all clean bright implements showing mrs lovedays influence she ate and drank like a hungry girl washed up for herself rather than let madge touch anything she could help and looked from the window into a dull court of dreary blightedlooking turf divided by flagged walks radiating from a statue in the middle representing a triton blowing a conchno doubt intended to spout water for there was a stone trough round him but he had long forgotten his functions and held a sparrows nest with streaming straws in his hand this must be the prisonyard where alone she might walk since it lay at the back of the house and with a sense of depression she turned to the task that awaited her  a very large foreignlooking case had been partly opened and when she looked in she was appalled at the task to be accomplished in one day it was crammed with shells of every size and description from the large helmetconch and tritons trumpet down to the tiny pink cowry and ricevolute all stuffed together without arrangement or packing forming a mass in which the unbroken shells reposed in a kind of sand of debris ground together out of the victims and when she took up a tolerablysized univalve quantities of little ones came tumbling out of its inner folds she took up a handful and presently picked out one perfect valve like a rose petal three fairy cups of limpets four ribbed cowries and a thing like a green pea of course she knew no names but a kind of interest was awakened by the beauty and variety before her a pile of papers had been provided and the housewife a pocketsize container for small articles as threaddl which betty made her always carry in her pocket furnished wherewithal to make up a number of bags for the lesser sorts and she went to work her troubles somewhat beguiled by the novel beauties of each delicate creature she disinterred but remembering with a pang how if she could have described them to mr belamour he would have discoursed upon the order of nature  london noises were not the continuous roar of vehicles of the present day but there was sound enough to remind the country girl where she was and the street cries old clothes sprats oh sweep were heard over the wall sometimes with tumultuous voices that seemed to enhance her loneliness as she sat on the floor hour after hour sifting out the entire shells and feeling a languid pleasure in joining the two halves of a bivalve especially those lovely sunset shells that have rosy rays diverging from their crimson hinge over their polished surface white or just tinted with the hues of a daffodil sky she never clasped a pair together without a little halfuttered ejaculation oh bring me and my dear young love thus together again and when she found a couple making a perfect heart and holding together through all she kissed it tenderly in the hope that thus it might be with her and with him whose hand and whose voice returned on her calling her his dearest life  she durst only quit the shells to eat the dinner which madge served at one oclocka tolerable meal of slices of cold beef from a cooksshop but seasoned with sour looks and a murmur at ladies fancies the weariness and languor of the former days exertions made her for the present disinclined to explore the house even had she had time and when twilight came there could have been little but fragments at the bottom of the case though she could see no more to sort them  and what were these noises around her making her start rats yes here they were venturing out from all the corners they knew there had been food in the room this was why madge had those to gaunt weirdlooking cats in her kitchen aurelia went and sat on the step into the court to be out of their way but madge hunted her in that the door might be shut and barred and when she returned trembling to the sitting room she heard such a scampering and a scrambling that she durst not enter and betook herself to her chamber and to bed  alas that was no refuge she had been too much tired to hear anything the night before but tonight there was scratching nibbling careering fighting squeaking recoil and rally charge and rout as the grey hanover rat fought his successful battle with his black english cousin all over the floors and stairsnay once or twice came rushing up and over the bedfrightening its occupant almost out of her senses as she cowered under the bedclothes not at all sure that they would not proceed to eating her happily daylight came early aurelia at its first ray darted across the room starting in horror when she touched a soft thing with her bare foot opened the shutter and threw open the casement light drove the enemy back to their holes and she had a few hours sleep but when mrs loveday came to the room when she was nearly dressed she exclaimed why miss you look paler than you did yesterday  the rats said aurelia under her breath  ah the rats of course they are bad enough in an old desolate place like this but youve done the shells right beautiful that i will say and you may leave this house this very day if you will only give your consent to what my lady asks you shall be sent down this very day to carminster if so be youll give up that ring of yours and sign a paper giving up all claim to be married to his honour see here it is all ready in my ladys letter  i cannot said aurelia with her hands behind her  you can read my ladys letter said loveday that can do you no harm  aurelia felt she must do that at least     child        i will overlook your transgression on the one condition that you sign this paper and send it with your socalled wedding ring back to me immediately otherwise you must take the consequences and remain where you are till after my sons marriage                                                urania belamour   the paper was a formal renunciation of all rights or claims from the fictitious marriage by which she had been deceived and an absolute pledge never to renew any contract with sir amyas belamour knight baronet who had grossly played on her  no i cannot said aurelia pushing it from her  indeed miss i would not persuade you to it if it were not for your own good but you may be sure it is no use holding out against her ladyship if you sign it now and give it up honourable she will send mr dove home with you and there youll be as if nothing had been amiss no one knowing nothing about it but if you persist it will not make the marriage a bit more true and you will only be kept moped up in this dismal place till his honour is married and theres no saying what worse my lady may do to you  another night of rats came up before aurelias imagination in contrast with the tender welcome at home but the white face and the tones that had exclaimed madam what are you doing to my wife arose and forbade her she would not fail him so she said firmly once more no mrs loveday i cannot i do not know what lawyers may say but i feel myself bound to sir amyas and i will not break my vowgod helping me she added under breath  you must write it to her ladyship then she will never take such a message through me here is paper and pen that i brought in hopes that you would be wise and submit for your honoured fathers sake  my father cannot be persecuted for what he has nothing to do with said aurelia with the gentle dignity that had grown on her since her troubles and taking the pen she wrote her simple refusal signing it aurelia belamour  as you please maam said mrs loveday but i have my ladys orders to bring this paper every day till you sign it and it would be better for you if you would do it at once  aurelia only shook her head and asked if mrs loveday had seen that she had finished sorting the shells yes and as she was now dressed they went down together to the sittingroom the shutters were still closed madge would not put a hand to the room except on the compulsion and aurelias enemies had left evidence of their work not only was the odour of the room like that of a barn but the paper bags had in some cases been bitten through and the shells scattered about and of the loaf and butter which aurelia had left on a high shelf in the cupboard nothing remained but a few fragments  loveday was very much shocked all the more when aurelia quietly said she should not mind it so much if the rats would only stay down stairs and not run over her in bed  yet you will not sign the paper  i cannot again said aurelia  my stars i never could abear rats why they fly at ones throat sometimes  i hope god will take care of me said aurelia in a trembling voice he did last night  loveday began a formal leavetaking curtsey but presently turned back there now she said i cannot do it i couldnt sleep a wink for thinking of you among the rats look here i shall send a porter to bring away those shells if youll make up their bags again that the nasty vermin have eaten and theres a little terrier dog about the place that no one will miss he shall bring it down and depend upon it the rats wont venture near it  oh thank you mrs loveday how good you are  ah dont then if you could say that my dear  mrs loveday hurried away and after breakfasting aurelia repaired the ravages of the rats and made a last sorting of the residuum of shell dust discovering numerous minute beauties which awoke in her the happy thought of the creators individual love  she had not yet finished before madges voice was heard in querulous anger and a heavy tread came along with her a big man who could have carried ten times the weight of the box of shells came in with a little white dog with black ears under his arm  there said the amiable guardian of the house that smart madam says that its her ladyships pleasure you should have that little beast to keep down the rats as if my cats was not enough but mind you madam really if so be he meddles with my cats it will be the worse for him  the porter took up the box and departed and aurelia was left with her new companion sniffing all round the room much excited by the neighbourhood of his natural enemies however he obeyed her call and let her make friends and read the name on the brass plate upon his collar when she read sir a belamour bart she took the little dog in her arms and kissed its white head  being fairly rested and having no task to accomplish she felt the day much longer though less solitary in the companionship of the dog to whom she whispered many fond compliments and vain questions as to his name with him at her heels and madge and her cats safely shut into the kitchen she took courage to wander about the dull court and then to explore the mansion and try to get a view from the higher windows in case they were not shuttered up like the lower ones the emptiness of bowstead was nothing to this and she smiled to herself at having thought herself a prisoner there  most of the rooms were completely dismantled or had only ghastly rags of torn leather or tapestry hanging to their walls the upper windows however were merely obscured by dust and cobwebs her own bedroom windows only showed the tall front of an opposite house but climbing to the higher storey she could see at the back over the garden wall the broad sheet of the thames covered with boats and wherries and the banks provided with steps and stairs at the opening of every street on the opposite side where she beheld a confused mass of trees churches and houses nearer the view to the westward was closed in by a stately edifice which she did not know to be somerset house and from another window on the east side of the house she saw over numerous tiled roofs a gateway which she guessed to be temple bar and a crowded thoroughfare where the people looked like ants toiling towards the great dome that rose in the misty distance was this the way she was to see london  coming down with a lagging step she met madges face peering up humph there you be my fine miss no gaping after sweethearts from the window or it will be the worse for you  the terrier growled as having already adopted his young ladys defence and aurelia dreading a perilous explosion of his zeal in her cause hurried him into her parlour     chapter xxxi the second task                          hope no more     since thou art furnished with hidden lore     to scape thy due reward if any day     without some task accomplished passed away                                                moore   the little dogs presence was a comfort but his night of combat and scuffling was not a restful one and the poor prisoners sickness of heart and nervous terrors grew upon her every hour with misgivings lest she should be clinging to a shadow and sacrificing her return to bettys arms for a phantom there were moments when her anguish of vague terror and utter loneliness impelled her to long to sign her renunciation that moment and when she thought of recurring hours and weeks of such days and such nights her spirit quailed within her and loveday might have found her less calmly steadfast had she come in the morning  she did not come and this in itself was a disappointment for at least she brought a human voice and a pitying countenance which temptress though she might be had helped to bear aurelia through the first days oh could she but find anything to do she had dusted her two rooms as well as she could consistently with care for the dress she could not change she blamed herself extremely for having forgotten her bible and prayerbook when hastily making up her bundle of necessaries and though there was little chance that madge should possess either or be able to read she nerved herself to ask bible what should ye want of a bible unless to play the hypocrite i haint got none was the reply  so aurelia could only walk up and down the court trying to repeat the psalms and afterwards the poetry she had learnt for mr belamours benefit sometimes deriving comfort from the promises but oftener wondering whether he had indeed deserted her in anger at her distrustful curiosity she tried to scrape the mossgrown triton she crept up stairs to the window that looked towards the city and cleared off some of the dimness and she got a needle and thread and tried to darn the holes in the curtains and cushions but the rotten stuff crumbled under her fingers and would not hold the stitches at last she found in a dusty corner a boardless book with neither beginning nor end being defoes plague of london she read and read with a horrid fascination believing every word of it wondering whether this house could have been infected and at length feeling for the plague spot  a great churchclock enabled her to count the hours oh how many there were of them how many more would there be this was only her second day and deliverance could not come for weeks were her young husbandif husband he wereever so faithful how should she find patience in this dreariness interspersed with fits of alarm lest he should be dangerously ill and suffering she fell on her knees and prayed for him and for herself  here it was getting dark again and madge would hunt her in presently and shut the shutters hark what was that a bell echoing over the house madge came after her where are you my fine mistress go you into the parlour i say and she turned the key upon the prisoner whose heart beat like a bird fluttering in a cage suddenly her door was opened and in darted fidelia and lettice who flung themselves upon her with ecstatic shrieks of cousin aura dear cousin aura loveday was behind directing the bringing in of trunks from a hackney coach all she said was my ladys daughters are to be with you for the night madam i must not say more for her ladyship is waiting for me  she was gone while the three were still in the glad tangle of an embrace beginning again and again with all sorts of little exclamations from the children into which aurelia broke with the inquiry for their brother he is much better said fay he is to get up tomorrow and then he will come and find you  have you seen him  oh yes and he says it is sister aura and not cousin aura  my dear dear little sisters and she hugged them again  i was sitting upon his bed said letty and we were all talking about you when my lady mamma came are mothers kinder than lady mammas  was she angry asked aurelia  oh she frightened me said fay she said we were pert forward misses and we must hold our tongues for we should be whipped if we ever said you name cousinsister aura again and she would not let us go to wish brother amyas goodbye this morning  aurelias heart could not but leap with joy that her tyrant should have failed in carrying to bowstead the renunciation of the marriage whether lady belamour meant it or not she had made resistance much easier by the company of faith and hope if only for a single night she gathered from their prattle that their mother having found that their talk with their brother was all of the one object of his thoughts had carried them off summarily and had been since driving about london in search of a school at which to leave them but they were too young for queens square and there was no room at another house at which lady belamour had applied she would not take them home being of course afraid of their tongues and in her perplexity had been reduced to letting them share aurelias captivity at least for the night  what joy it was they said it was an ugly dark house but aurelias presence was perfect content to them and theirs was to her comparative felicity assuring her as they did through their childish talk of sir amyass unbroken love and of mr belamours endeavours to find her what mattered it that madge was more offended than ever and refused to make the slightest exertion for the wayland brats at that time of night without warning they had enough for supper and if aurelia had not their company was worth much more to her than a full meal the terriers rushes after rats were only diversion now and when all three nestled together in the big bed the fun was more delightful than ever between those soft caressing creatures aurelia heard no rats and could well bear some kicks at night and being drummed awake at some strange hour in the morning  mrs loveday arrive soon after the little party had gone down stairs she said the children were to remain until her ladyship had decided where to send them and she confirmed their report that his honour was recovering quickly as soon as he was sufficiently well to leave bowstead he was to be brought to london and married to lady arabella before going abroad to make the grand tour and as a true wellwisher mrs loveday begged miss delavie not to hold out when it was of no use for her ladyship declared that her contumacy would be the worse for her aurelias garrison was however too well reinforced for any vague alarms to shake even her out works and she only smiled her refusal as in truth mrs loveday must have expected for it appeared that she had secured a maid to attend on the prisoners an extremely deaf woman who only spoke in the broken imperfect mode of those who have never heard their own voice deficiencies that made it possible that madge would keep the peace with her  lady belamour had also found another piece of work for aurelia a dark cupboard was opened revealing shelves piled with bundle of old letters and papers there was a family tradition that one of the ladies of the delavie family had been an attendant of mary of scotland for a short time and had received from her a recipe for preserving the complexion and texture of the skin devised by the french court perfumer nobody had ever seen this precious prescription but it was presumed to be in the archives of the family and her ladyship sent word that if miss delavie wished to deserve her favour she would put her french to some account and discover it  a severe undertaking it was piles of yellow letters files of dusty accounts multitudes of receipts more than one old will had to be conned it was possible to be certain they were not the nostrum in the utter solitude even this occupation would have been valuable but with the little girls about her and her own and their property she had alternative employments enough to make it an effort to apply herself to this  why should she she asked herself more than once but then came the recollection that if she showed herself willing to obey and gratify my lady it might gain her good will and if sir amyas should indeed hold out till mr wayland came homeher heart beat wildly at the vision of hope  she worked principally at the letters after the children had gone to bed taking a packet up stairs with her and sitting in the bedroom deciphering them as best she might by the light of the candles that loveday had brought her  every morning loveday appeared with supplies and messages from her ladyship that it was time miss submitted but she was not at all substantially unkind and showed increasing interest in her captive though always impressing on her that her obstinacy was all in vain my lady was angered enough at his honour having got up from his sick bed and gone off to carminster and if miss did not wish to bring her father into trouble she must yield no this gladdened rather than startled aurelia though her heart sank within her when she was warned that mr wayland had been taken by the corsairs so that my lady would have the ball at her own foot now the term of waiting seemed indefinitely prolonged  the confinement to the dingy house and courtyard was trying to all three who had been used to run about in the green park and breezy fields but aurelia did her best to keep her little companions happy and busy and the sense of the insecurity of her tenure of their company aided her the more to meet with good temper and sweetness the various rubs incidental to their captivity in this close warm house in the hottest of summer weather the pang she had felt at her own fretfulness when she thought she had lost them made her guard the more against giving way to impatience if they were troublesome or hard to please indeed she was much more gentle and equable now in the strength of her resolution than she had been when uplifted by her position yet doubtful of its mysteries  sundays were the most trying time the lack of occupation in the small space was wearisome and aurelias heart often echoed the old strains of tate and brady                     i sigh wheneer my musing thoughts                      those happy days present                    when i with troops of pious friends                      thy temple did frequent  she and her charges climbed up to the window above which happily had a broken pane tried to identify the chimes of the church bells by the notable nursery rhyme                     oranges and lemons                    say the bells of st clements c  watched the churchgoers as far as they could see them and then came down to such reading of the service and other sunday occupations as aurelia could devise on the sunday of her durance it was such a broiling day that unable to bear the heat of her parlour she established herself and her charges in a nook of the court close under the window but shaded by the wall which was covered with an immense bush of overhanging ivy and by the elm tree in the court here she made fay and letty say their catechism and the psalm she had been teaching them in the week and then rewarded them with a bible story that of daniel in the den of lions once or twice the terrier whose name she had learnt was bob had pricked his ears and the children had thought there was a noise but the sparrows in the ivy might be accountable for a great deal and the little ones were to much wrapped in her tale to be attentive to anything else  then it came true said letty his god whom he trusted did deliver him out of the den of lions  god always does deliver people when they trust him said fay with gleaming eyes  yes one way or the other said aurelia  how do you think he will deliver us asked letty for i am sure this is a den though there are no lions  i do not know how said aurelia but i know he will bear us through it as long as we trust him and do nothing wrong and she looked up at the bright sky with hope and strength in her face  hark whats that cried letty and bob leapt up and barked as a great sob became plainly audible and within the room appeared mrs loveday her face all over tears which she was fast wiping away as she rose up from crouching with her head against the windowsill  i beg your pardon maam said she her voice still broken when she rejoined them but i would not interrupt you so i waited within and oh it was so like my poor old mother at home it quite overcame me i did not think there was anything so near the angels left on earth  nay loveday said fay apprehending the words in a different sense the angels are just as near us as ever they were to daniel only we cannot see them are they not cousin aura  indeed they are and we may be as sure that they will shut the lions mouths said aurelia  ah may they sighed loveday who had by this time mastered her agitation and remembered that she must discharge herself of her messages and return hastily to my ladys toilette  i have found the recipe said aurelia here it is and she put into lovedays hand a yellow letter bearing the title in scribbled writing poure embellire et blanchire la pel de part de maistre raoul parfumeur de la royne catherine     chapter xxxii lions       the helmet of darkness pallas donned     to hide her presence from the sight of man                                            derbys homer   the next morning loveday returned with orders from lady belamour that miss delavie should translate the french recipe and make a fair copy of it it was not an easy task for the ms was difficult and the french old whereas aurelia lived on the modern side of the acadamie her french was that of fenelon and racine  however she went to work as best she could in her cool corner guessing at many of the words by lights derived from comenius and had just made out that the chief ingredients were pounded pearls and rubies mixed with white of eggs laid by pullets under a year old during the waxing of the april moon when she heard voices chattering in the hall and a girlish figure appeared in a light cloak and calash whom loveday seemed to be guiding and yet keeping as much repressed as she could  gracious heavens were the first words to be distinguished what a frightful old place enough to make one die of the dismals i wont live here when im married i promise sir amyas bless me is this the wench  your ladyship promised to be careful entreated loveday while aurelia rose with a graceful gesture of acknowledgment which however remained unnoticed the lady apparently considering herself unseen  who are these little girls asked she in a giggling whisper little waylands then it is true she cried with a peal of shrill laughter there are three of them only lady belamour shuts them up like kittensi wonder she did not oh what sport wont i tease her now that i know her secret  your ladyship intreated loveday in distress in an audible aside you will undo me then coming forward she said you did not expect me at this hour madam but if your french copy be finished my lady would like to have it at once  i have written it out once as well as i could said aurelia but i have not translated it i will find the copy  she rose and found the stranger full before her in the doorway gazing at her with an enormous pair of sloeblack eyes under heavy inky brows set in a hard redcomplexioned face she burst into a loud hoydenish laugh as loveday tried to stammer something about a friend of her own  never mind the murders out good mrs abigail she cried it is me i was determined to see the wench that has made such a fool of young belamour i vow i cant guess what he means by it why you are a poor pale tallowcandle without a bit of colour in your face look at me shall you ever have such a complexion as mine with ever so much rouge  i think not said aurelia with one look at the peony face  do you know who i am miss i am the lady bella mar the countess of aresfield is my mamma i shall have battlefield when she dies and twenty thousand pounds on my wedding day the earl of aresfield and colonel mar are my brothers and a wretched little country girl like you is not to come between me and what my mamma has fixed for me so you must give it up at once for you see he belongs to me  not yet madam said aurelia  what do you say do you pretend that your masquerade was worth a button  that is not my part to decide said aurelia i am bound by it and have no power to break it  you mean the lawyers bless you they will never give it to you against me youd best give it up at once and if you want a husband my mamma has one ready for you  i thank her ladyship said aurelia with simple dignity but i will not give her the trouble  she glanced at her wedding ring and so did lady belle who screamed youve the impudence to wear that give it to me  i cannot repeated aurelia  you cannot you insolent vulgar low  hush hush my lady entreated loveday come away i beg of your ladyship  not till i have made that impudent hussy give me that ring cried belle stamping violently whats that you say  that your ladyship asks what is impossible said aurelia firmly  take that then insolent minx cried the girl flying forward and violently slapping aurelias soft cheeks and making a snatch at her hair  loveday screamed letty cried but fidelia and bob both rushed forward to aurelias defence one with her little fists clenched beating lady belle back the other tearing at her skirts with his teeth at that moment a mans step was heard and a tall powerful officer was among them uttering a fierce imprecation you little vixen at your tricks again he said taking belle by the waist while she kicked and screamed in vain she was like an angry cat in his arms be quiet belle he said backing into the sittingroom let loveday compose your dress recover your senses and i shall take you home i wish it was to the whipping you deserve  he thrust her in waved aside lovedays excuses about her ladyship not being denied and stood with his back to the door as she bounced shrieking against it from within  i fear this little devil has hurt you madam he said  not at all i thank you sire said aurelia though one side of her face still tingled  she made at you like a little gamecock he said i am glad i was in time i followed when i found she had slipped away from lady belamours knowing that her curiosity is only equalled by her spite by jove it is well that her nails did not touch that angel face  aurelia could only curtsey and thank him hoping within herself that lady belle would soon recover and wondering how he had let himself in there was something in his manner of examining her with his eyes that made her supremely uncomfortable he uttered fashionable expletives of admiration under his breath and she turned aside in displeasure bending down to fidelia he went on you must be devilishly moped in this dungeon of a place cannot we contrive something better  thank you sir i have no complaint to make permit me to see whether the lady arabella is better  i advise you not those orbs are too soft and sparkling to be exposed to her talons pon my honour i pity young belamour but there is no help for it and such charms ought not to be wasted in solitude on his account these young lads are as fickle as the weathercock and have halfadozen fancies in as many weeks come now make me your friend and we will hit on some device for delivering the enchanted princess from her durance vile  thank you sir i promised lady belamour to make no attempt to escape  at that moment out burst lady belle shouting with laughter ho ho have i caught you brother gallanting away with miss what will my lady say pretty doings  she had no time for more her brother fiercely laid hold of her and bore her away with a peremptory violence that she could not resist and only turning at the hall door to make one magnificent bow  loveday was obliged to follow and the children were left clinging to aurelia and declaring that the dreadful young lady was as bad as the lions while aurelia glowing with shame and resentment at what she felt as insults had a misgiving that her protector had been the worse lion of the two  she had no explanation of the invasion till the next morning when loveday appeared full of excuses and apologies from the fact of lady aresfields carriage having been used on aurelias arrival her imprisonment was known and lady belle spending a holiday at lady belamours had besieged loveday with entreaties to take her to see her rival as the waitingwoman said for fear of the young ladys violent temper but more probably in consideration of her bribes she had yielded hoping that lady belle would be satisfied with a view from the window herself unseen however from that moment all had been taken out of the hands of loveday and she verily believed the colonel had made following his sister an excuse for catching a sight of miss delavie for he had been monstrously smitten even with the glimpse he had had of her in the carriage and now as his sister had cut short what he had to say he had written her a billet and loveday held out a perfumed letter  aurelias eyes flashed and she drew herself up you forget loveday i promised to receive no letters  bless me maam they that are treated as my lady treats you are not bound to be so particular as that  o fie loveday said aurelia earnestly you have been so kind that i thought you would be faithful this is not being faithful to your lady nor to me  it is only from my wish to serve you maam said loveday in her fawning voice how can i bear to see a beautiful young lady like you that ought to be the star of all the court mewed up here for the sake of a young giddy pate like his honour when theres one of the first gentlemen in the land ready to be at your feet  for shame for shame exclaimed aurelia crimson already you know i am married  and you will not take the letter nor see what the poor gentleman means may be he wants to reconcile you with my lady and he has power with her  aurelia took the letter and strong paper though it was tore it across and across till it was all in fragments no bigger than daisy flowers there she said you may tell him what i have done to his letter  loveday stared for a minute then exclaimed you are in the right my dear lady oh i am a wretcha wretch and she went away sobbing  aurelia hoped the matter was ended it had given her a terrible feeling of insecurity but she found to her relief that madge was really more trustworthy than loveday she overheard from the court a conversation at the back door in which madge was strenuously refusing admission to some one who was both threatening and bribing her all in vain but she was only beginning to breathe freely when loveday brought not another letter but what was less easy to stop a personal message from that poor gentleman  loveday after what you said yesterday how can you be sowicked said aurelia  indeed miss tis only as your true wellwisher  aurelia turned away to leave the room  yes it is maam on my bended knees i will swear it cried loveday throwing herself on them and catching her dress it is because i know my lady has worse in store for you  nothing can be worse than wrongdoing said aurelia  ah you dont know now listen one moment i would notindeed i would notif i did not know that he meant true and honourableas he does indeed he does he is madder after you then ever he was for my lady for he says you have all her beauty and freshness and simplicity besides he is raving and you should never leave me indeed you should not miss if you slipped out after me in debs mufflerand wed go to the fleet i have got a cousin there poor fellowhe is always in trouble but he is a real true parson notwithstanding and id never leave your side till the knot was tied fast then you would laugh at my lady and be one of the first ladies in the land for my lord aresfield is half a fool and cant live long and when you are a countess you will remember your poor loveday  let me go you have said too much to a married woman said aurelia and as the maid began the old demonstrations of the invalidity of the marriage and the folly of adhering to it when nobody knew where his honour was gone she said resolutely i shall write to lady belamour to send me a more trustworthy messenger  on this loveday fairly fell on the floor grovelling in her wild entreaty that my lady might hear nothing of this declaring that it was not so much for the sake of the consequences to herself as to the young lady for there was no guessing what my lady might not be capable of if she guessed at colonel mars admiration of her prisoner aurelia frightened at her violence finally promised not to appeal to her ladyship as long as loveday abstained from transmitting his messages but on the least attempt on her part to refer to him a complaint should certainly be made to my lady  very well madam said loveday wiping her eyes i only hope it will not be the worse for you in the end and that you will not wish you had listened to poor lovedays advice  i can never wish to have done what i know to be a great sin said aurelia gravely  ah you little know said loveday shaking her head sadly and ominously  something brought to aurelias lips what she had been teaching the children last sunday and she answered  my god in whom i have trusted is able to deliver me out of the mouth of lions and he will deliver me out of thy hand  oh if ever there were one whom he should deliver broke out loveday and again she went away weeping bitterly  aurelia could not guess what the danger the woman threatened could be so many had been mentioned as possible a forcible marriage incarceration in some lonely country place a vague threat of being taken beyond seas to the plantationall these had been mentioned but she was far more afraid of colonel mar forcing his way in and carrying her off and this kept her constantly in a state of nervous watchfulness always listening by day and hardly able to sleep by night  once she had a terrible alarm on a sunday letty came rushing to her declaring that jumbo dear jumbo and a gentleman were in the front court was it really jumbo come and see no she durst not and fay almost instantly declared that madge had shut them out the children both insisted that jumbo it was but aurelia would not believe that it could be anything but an attempt of her enemies she interrogated madge who had grown into a certain liking for one so submissive and inoffensive madge shook her head could not guess how such folks had got into the court was sure they were after no good and declared that my lady should hear of all the strange doings and the letters that had been left with her oh no she knew better than to give them but my lady should see them     chapter xxxiii the cosmetic       but one more task i charge thee with today     for unto proserpine then take thy way     and give this golden casket to her hands                                                morris   late on that sunday afternoon a muffled and masked figure came through the house into the court behind and after the first shock aurelia was relieved to see that it was too tall and moved too gracefully to belong to loveday  why child what a colour you have said lady belamour taking off her mask you need no aids to nature at your happy age that is right children as they curtsied and kissed her hand go into the house i wish to speak with your cousin  lady belamours unfailing selfcommand gave her such dignity that she seemed truly a grand and majestic dame dispensing justice and the gentle shrinking aurelia like a culprit on trial before her  you have been here a month aurelia delavie have you come to your senses and are you ready to sign this paper  no madam i cannot  silly fly you are as bent as ever on remaining in the web in which a madman and a foolish boy have involved you  i cannot help it madam  oh i thought and her voice became harshly clear though so low that you might have other schemes and be spreading your toils at higher game  certainly not madam  your colour shows that you understand in spite of all your pretences  i have never used any pretences my lady said aurelia looking up in her face with clear innocent eyes  you have had no visitors none  none madam except once when the lady arabella mar forced her way in out of curiosity i believe and her brother followed to take her away  her brother you saw him each word came out edged like a knife from between her nearly closed lips  yes madam  how often  that once  that has not hindered a traffic in letters  not on my side madam i tore to fragments unread the only one that i received he had no right to send it  certainly not you judge discreetly miss delavie in fact you are too transcendent a paragon to be retained here then biting her lip as if the bitter phrase had escaped unawares she smiled blandly and said my good girl you have merited to be returned to your friends you may pack your mails and those of the children  aurelia shuddered with gladness but lady belamour checked her thanks by continuing one service you must first do for me my perfumer is at a loss to understand your translation of the recipe for queen marys wash i wish you to read and explain it to her  certainly madam  she lives near greenwich park continued lady belamour and as i would not have the secret get abroad i shall send a wherry to take you to the place early tomorrow morning can you be ready by eight oclock  aurelia readily promised her heart bounding at the notion of a voyage down the river after her long imprisonment and at the promise of liberty she thought her husband must still be true to her since my lady would have been the first to inform her of his defection and as long as she had her ring and her certificate she could feel little doubt that her father would be able to establish her claims and oh to be with him and betty once more  she was ready in good time and had spent her leisure in packing when loveday appeared she was greeted with a petition that the two little girls might accompany her but this was refused at once and the waitingmaid added in her caressing consoling tone that mrs dove was coming with their little brother and sister to take them a drive into the country they skipped about with glee following aurelia to the door of the court and promising her posies of honeysuckles and roses and she left her dear love with them for amoret and nurse dove  at the door was a sedan chair in which aurelia was carried to some broad stone stairs beside which lay a smartlypainted trimlooking boat with four stout oarsmen she was handed into the stern loveday sitting opposite to her the woman was unusually silent and could hardly be roused to reply to aurelias eager questions as she passed the gardens of lincolns inn saw st pauls rise above her shot beneath the arch of london bridge and beheld the massive walls of the tower with its lowbrowed arches opening above their steps whenever a scarlet uniform came in view how the girls eyes strained after it thinking of one impossible improbable chance of a recognition once or twice she thought of a far more terrible chance and wondered whether lady belamour knew how little confidence could be placed in loveday but she was sure that their expedition was my ladys own device and the fresh air and motion with all the new scenes were so delightful to her that she could not dwell on any alarms  on on redriffe as the watermen named rotherhithe was on one bank the marshes of the isle of dogs were gay with white cottongrass and red rattle on the other then came the wharves and building yards of deptford and beyond them rose the trees of greenwich park while the river below exhibited a forest of masts the boat stopped at a landingplace to a little garden with a sanded path between herbs and flowers this is mistress darkes said loveday and as a little dwarfish lad came to the gate she said we would speak with your mistress  on your own part  from the great lady in hanover square  the lad came down to assist in their landing and took them up the path to a little cupboard of a room scented with a compound of every imaginable perfume bottles of every sort of essence pomade and cosmetic were ranged on shelves or within glass doors interspersed with masks boxes for patches bunches of false hair powder puffs curlingirons and rare feathers an alembic a device used in distillationdl was in the fireplace and pen and ink in a strangelyshaped standish were on the table altogether there was something uncanny about the look and air of the room which made aurelia tremble especially as she perceived that loveday was both frightened and distressed  the mistress of the establishment speedily appeared she had been a splendid jewish beauty and still in middle age had great owllike eyes and a complexion that did her credit to her arts but there was something indescribably repulsive in her fawning deferential curtsey as she said in a flattering tone with a slightly foreign accent the pretty lady is come as our noble dame promised to explain to the poor cora darke the great queens secret ah how good it is to have learning what would not my clients give for such a skin as hers and i have many more and greater than you would think come to poor coras cottage there was a countess here but yesterday to ask how to blanch the complexion of miladi her daughter who is about to wed a young baronet beautiful as love bah i might as well try to whiten a clove gillyflower yet what has not nature done for this lovely miss  shall i read you the paper said aurelia longing to end this part of the affair  be seated fair and gracious lady  aurelia tried to wave aside a chair but mrs darke on the plea of looking over the words as she read got her down upon a low couch putting her own stout person and hooked face in unpleasant proximity while she asked questions and aurelia mentioned her own conjectures on the obsolete french of the recipe while she perceived to her alarm that the woman understood the technical terms much better than she did and that her ignorance could have been only an excuse  at last it was finished and she rose saying it was time to return to the boat  nay madam that cannot be yet said loveday the watermen are gone to rest and dine and we must wait for the tide to shoot the bridge  then pray let us go out and walk in greenwich park exclaimed aurelia longing to escape from this den  the sweet young lady will take something in the meantime said mrs darke  i thank you i have breakfasted said aurelia  my lady intended us to eat here said loveday in an undertone to her young lady as their hostess bustled out she will make it good to mrs darke  i had rather go to the inni have moneyor sit in the park she added as loveday looked as if going to the inn were an improper proposal could we not buy a loaf and eat in the park i should like it so much better  one cup of coffee said mrs darke entering the excellent mocha that i get from the turkey captains  she set down on a small table a wonderful cup of eastern porcelain and some little sugared cakes and aurelia not to be utterly ungracious tasted one and began on the coffee which was so hot that it had to be taken slowly as she sipped a soothing drowsiness came over her which at first was accounted for by the warm room after her row on the river but it gained upon her and instead of setting out for her walk she fell sound asleep in the corner of the couch  it has worked it is well said mrs darke lifting the girls feet on the couch and producing a large pair of scissors  loveday could not repress a little shriek  hush as the woman untied the black silk hood drew it gently off and then undid the ribbon that confined the victims abundant tresses bah it will be grown by the time she arrives and if not so long as present what will they know of it it will be the more agreeable surprise here put yonder cloth under her head while i hold it up  i cannot sobbed loveday this is too much i never would have entered my ladys service if i had known i was to be set to such as this  come come grace loveday i know too much of you for you to come the presician over me  such a sweet innocent so tenderhearted and civil too  bless you woman you dont know whats good for her she will be a very queen over the black slaves on the indies captain karen will tell you how the wenches thank him for having brought em out they could never do any good here you know poor lasses but out there where white women are scarce they are ready to worship the very ground they tread upon  i tell you she aint one of that sort she is a young lady of birth a cousin of my ladys own as innocent as a babe and there are two gentlemen if not three a dying for her  i lay you anything not one of em is worth old mr van draagen who turns his thousands every month send me out a lady lass says he one that will do me credit with the governors lady why she will have an estate as big as from here to dover and slaves to wait on her so as she need never stoop to pick up her glove he has been married twice before and his last used to send orders for the best brocades in london he stuck at no expense the queen has not finer gowns  but to think of the poor childs waking up out at sea  oh mrs karen will let her know she may think herself well off i never let em go unless theres a married woman aboard to take charge of them and thats why i kept your lady waiting till the red cloud was ready to sail you may tell her ladyship she could not have a better berth and shell want for nothing i know what is due to the real quality and ive put aboard all the toilette and linen and dresses as was bespoke for the last mrs van draagen and theres a civil spoken wench aboard what will wait on her for a consideration  nay but mistress said loveday whispering i know those that would give more than you will ever get from my lady if they found her safe here  of course there are or she would not be here now said mrs darke with a horrid grin but that wont do my lass a lady thats afraid of exposure will pay you if she pawns her last diamond but a gentlemanwhy he gets sick of his fancy and snaps his fingers at them that helped him then looking keenly at loveday youve not been playing me false eh  o no no hastily exclaimed loveday cowering at the malignant look  if so be you have grace loveday two can play at that game said mrs darke composedly there i have left her enough to turn back what hair it is feel the weight of it theres not another head of the mousecolour to match your ladys in the kingdom she added smoothing out the severed tresses with the satisfaction of a connoisseur no wonder madame could not let this be wasted on the plantations when you and i and m le griseur know her own hair is getting thinner than she would wish a certain colonel to guess there the pretty dear what a baby she looks i will tie her on a cowl lest she should take cold on the river see these rings did you lady give no charge about them  i had forgot said the waitingwoman confused she charged me to bring them back old family jewels she said that must not be carried off to foreign parts but i cannot cannot do it to rob that pretty creature in her sleep  never fear shell soon have a store much finer than these you fool i tell you she will not wake these six or eight hours afraid there ill do it ho a ruby a lovetoken i wager and whats this a carved cupid i could turn a pretty penny by that when your lady finds it convenient and her luck at play goes against her eh is this a weddingring best take that off mr van draagen might not understand it you see here they are have you a patchbox handy for them in your pocket why what ails the woman you may thank your stars theres some one here with her wits about her none of your whimpering i say her comes captain karen  two seafaring men here came up the garden path the foremost small and dapper with a ready address and astute countenance all right mother darkness is our consignment ready aye aye and the freight  this lady has it said mrs darke pointing to loveday i have been telling her she need have no fears for her young kinswoman in your hands captain  he swore a round oath to that effect and looking at the sleeping maiden again swore that she was the choicest piece of goods ever confided to him and that he knew better than let such an article arrive damaged mr van draagen ought to come down handsomely for such an extra fine sample but in the meantime he accepted the rouleau of guineas that loveday handed to him the proceeds as she told mrs darke of my ladys winnings last night at loo  all was ready poor aurelia was swathed from head to foot in a large mantle like the chrysalis whose name she bore the two sailors took her up between them carried her to their boat and laid her along in the stern then they pushed off and rowed down the river loveday looked up and looked down then sank on the steps convulsed with grief sobbing bitterly she said he could deliver her from the mouth of lions and he has not she murmured under her breath in utter misery and hopelessness     chapter xxxiv down the river      the lioness ye may move her     to give oer her prey     but yell neer stop a lover     he will find out the way   elizabeth delavie and her little brother were standing in the bay window of their hotel gazing eagerly along the street in hopes of seeing the major return when sir amyas was seen riding hastily up on his charger in full accoutrements with a soldier following in another moment he had dashed up stairs and saying sister read that put into bettys hand a slip of paper on which was written in pencil  if sir a b would not have his true love kidnapped to the plantations he had best keep watch on the river gate of mistress darkes garden at greenwich no time to lose  who brought you this demanded betty as well as she could speak for horror  my mothers little negro boy syphax he says mrs loveday her waitingwoman gave it to him privately on the stairs as she was about to get into a sedan telling him i would give him a crown if he gave it me as i came off parade  noon is there time  barely but there shall be time there is no time to seek your father  no but i must come with you  the water is the quickest way there are stairs near ill send my fellow to secure a boat  i will be ready instantly while you tell your uncle it might be better if he came  sir amyas flew to his uncles door but found him gone out and in too great haste to inquire further came down again to find betty in cloak and hood he gave her his arm and eugene trotting after them they hurried to the nearest stairs remembering in dire confirmation what betty had heard from the schoolgirl both had heard reports that young women were sometimes thus deported to become wives to the planters in the southern colonies or the west indies but that such a destiny should be intended for their own aurelia and by lady belamour was scarcely credible doubts rushed over betty but she remembered what the schoolgirl had said of the captive being sent beyond seas and at any rate she must risk the expedition being futile when such issues hung upon it and if they failed to meet her father she felt that her presence might prevail when the undefined rights of so mere a lad as her companion might be disregarded  his soldier servant had secured a boat and they rapidly descended to the river sir amyas silent between suspense dismay and shame for his mother and betty trying to keep eugene quiet by hurried answers to his eager questions about all he saw they had to get out at london bridge and take a fresh boat on the other side a much larger one with two oarsmen and a grizzled old coxswain with a pleasant honest countenance who presently relieved betty of all necessity of attending to or answering eugenes chatter  do you know where this garden is said she leaning across to sir amyas who had engaged the boat to go to greenwich  he started as if it were a new and sudden thought and turning to the steersman demanded whether he knew mrs darkes garden  the old man gave a kind of grunt and eyed the trio interrogatively the young officer with his fresh innocent boyish face and brilliant undisguised uniform the handsome child the lady neither young gay nor beautiful but unmistakeably a decorous gentlewoman  do you know mrs darkes repeated sir amyas  aye do i mayhap i know more about the place than you do  there was that about his face that moved betty and the young man to look at one another and the former said she has had to do withevil doings  you may say that maam  then they cried in one breath you will help us and in a very few words betty explained their fears for her young sister and asked whether he thought the warning possible  ive heard tell of such things said the old man between his teeth and mother darkness is one to do em help you to bring back the poor young lass that we will if we have to break down the door with our fists and who is this young spark her brother or her sweetheart  her husband said sir amyas her husband from whom she has been cruelly spirited away aid me to bring her back my good fellow and nothing would be too much to reward you  aye aye captain jem greens not the man to see an english girl handed over to they slavedriving outlandish chaps but i say i wish youd got a cloak or summat to put over that scarlet and gold of yourn its a regular flag to put the old witch on her guard  on that summers day however no cloak was at hand they went down the river very rapidly for the tide was running out and at length jem green pointed out the neat little garden on the step sat a woman apparently weeping bitterly could it be the object of their search no but as they came nearer and she was roused so as to catch sight of the scarlet coat she beckoned and gesticulated with all her might and as they approached sir amyas recognised her as his mothers maid  you will be in time yet she cried breathlessly oh take me in or you wont know the ship  so eager and terrified was she that but for the old steersmans peremptory steadiness her own life and theirs would have been in much peril but she was safely seated at last gasping out the red cloud captain karen theyve been gone these ten minutes  aye aye gruffly responded green and the oars moved rapidly while loveday with another sob cried oh sir i thought you would never come  you sent the warning  yes sir i knew nothing till the morning when my lady called me up i lie in her room you know she had given orders and i was to take the sweet lady and go down the river with her to mrs darke the perfuming woman my lady has dealings with about here hair and complexion there i was to stay with her tilltill this same seacaptain was to come and carry her off where she would give no more trouble oh sir it was too muchand my lady knew it for she had tied my hands so that i had but a moment to scribble down that scrip and bid syphax take it to you the dear lady she said her god could deliver her out of the mouth of the lion and i could not believe it i thought it too late  how can we thank you began betty but she was choked by intense anxiety and jem green broke in with an inquiry where the ship was bound for loveday only had a general impression of the west indies and believed that the poor ladys destined spouse was a tobacconist and as the boat was soon among a forest of shipping where it could not proceed so fast green had to inquire of neighbouring mariners where the red cloud was lying  the red cloud karen weighs anchor for carolina at flood tide tonight shipper just going aboard they were told  their speed had been so rapid that they were in time to see the boat alongside and preparations being made to draw up some one or something on board oh that is she cried loveday in great agitation theyve drugged her no harm done she dont know it but it is she  sir amyas with a voice of thunder called out halt villain at the same moment as green shouted avast there mate and their boat came dashing up alongside  yield me up that lady instantly fellow cried sir amyas with his sword half drawn  and who are you i should like to know returned karen coolly swaggering at an honest man taking his freight and passengers aboard  ill soon show you  hush sir said green who had caught sight of pistols and cutlasses let me speak a moment look you here skipper this young gentleman and lady have right on their side this is her sister and he is her husband they are people of condition as you see  alls one to me on the broad seas  that may be said green but you see you cant weigh anchor these three hours or more and whats to hinder the young captain here from swearing against you before a magistrate and getting your vessel searched eh  ive no objection to hear reason if im spoke to reasonable said karen sulkily but ill not be bullied like a highwayman when ive my consignment regularly made out and the freight down in hand square  you may keep your accursed passagemoney and welcome cried sir amyas so youll only give me my wife  show him the certificate whispered betty  sir amyas had it ready and he read it loud enough for all on the thames to hear karen gave a sneering little laugh whats that to me my passenger here has her berth taken in the name of ann davis  like enough said loveday but you remember me captain and i swear that this poor young lady is what his honour sir amyas say he is a generous young gentleman and will make it up to you if you are at any loss in the matter  a hundred times over exclaimed amyas hotly  hardly that said karen van draagen might have been good for a round hundred if hed been pleased with the commission  ill give you and order began sir amyas  what have you got about you sir interrupted karen i fancy hard cash better than your orders  the youth pulled out his purse there was only a guinea or two and some silver one does not go out to parade with much money about one he said with a trembling endeavour for a smile but if you would send up to my quarters in whitehall barracks  never mind sir said karen graciously i see you are in earnest and ill put up with the loss rather than stand in the light of a couple of true lovers here jack lend a hand and well hoist the young woman over shes quiet enough thanks to mother darkness  the sudden change in tone might perhaps be owing to the skippers attention having been called by a sign from one of his men to a boat coming up from woolwich rowed by men of the royal navy who were certain to take part with an officer but sir amyas and betty were only intent on receiving the inanimate form wrapped up in its mantle what a meeting it was for betty and yet what joy to have her at all they laid her with her head in her sisters lap and sir amyas hung over her clasping one of the limp gloved hands while eugene called aura aura and would have impetuously kissed her awake but loveday caught hold of him do not do not for pitys sake little master she said the potion will do her no harm if you let her sleep it off but she may not know you if you waken her before the time  wretch what have you given her cried sir amyas  it was not me sir it was mrs darke in a cup of coffee she vowed it would do no hurt if only she was let to sleep six or eight hours and see what a misery it has saved her from  that is true said betty indeed i believe this is a healthy sleep see how gently she breathes how soft and natural her colour is how cool and fresh her cheek is i cannot believe there is serious harm done  how soon can we reach a physician asked sir amyas still anxiously of the coxswain  i cant rightly say sir replied he but never you fear they wouldnt do aught to damage such as she  patience must perforce be exercised as now against the tide and the stream the wherry worked its way back once there was a little stir sir amyas instantly hovered over aurelia and clasped her hand with a cry of my dearest life the long dark eyelashes slowly rose the eyes looked up for one moment from his face to her sisters and then to her brothers but the lids sank as if weighed down and with a murmur oh dont wake me she turned her face around on bettys lap and slept again  poor darling she thinks it a dream said betty eugene do not sir i entreat brother yes i will call you so if you will only let her alone see how happy and peaceful her dear face is do not rouse her into terror and bewilderment  if i only were sure she was safe he sighed hanging over with an intensity of affection and anxiety that brought a dew even to the old steersmans eyes and he kindly engrossed eugene by telling about the places they passed and setting him to watch the smart crew of the boat from the royal arsenal at woolwich which was gaining on them  meanwhile the others interrogated loveday who told them of the pretext on which lady belamour had sent her captive down to mrs darkes no one save herself had in my ladys household she said an idea of where the young lady was lady belamour having employed only hired porters except on that night when lady aresfields carriage brought her this had led to the captivity being know to lady belle and her brother and loveday had no doubt that it was the discovery of their being aware of it as well as jumbos appearance in the court that had made her mistress finally decide on this frightful mode of ridding herself of the poor girl the maid was as adroit a dissembler as her mistress and she held her peace as to her own part in forwarding colonel mars suit whether her lady guessed it or not but she owned with floods of tears how the sight of the young ladys meek and dutiful submission her quiet trust and her sweet simple teaching of the children had wakened into life again a conscience long dead to all good and made it impossible to her to carry out this last wicked commission without an attempt to save the creature whom she had learnt to reverence as a saint most likely her scruples had been suspected by her mistress for there had been an endeavour to put it out of her power to give any warning to the victim yet after all the waitingmaid had been too adroit for the lady or as she fully owned aurelias firm trust had not been baulked and deliverance from the lions had come     chapter xxxv the return       and now the glorious artist ere he yet     had reached the lemnian isle limping returned     with aching heart he sought his home                                       odysseycowper   how were they to get the slumbering maiden home that was the next question loveday advised carrying her direct to her old prison where she would wake without alarm but sir amyas shuddered at the notion and betty said she could not take her again into a house of lady belamours  the watermen who were enthusiastic in the cause which they understood as that of one young sweetheart rescued by the other declared that they would carry the sweet lady between them on the cushions of their boat laid on stretchers and as they knew of a landplace near the royal york with no need of crossing any great thoroughfare betty thought this the best chance of taking her sister home without a shock  the boat from woolwich had shot london bridge immediately after them and stopped at the stairs nearest that where they landed and just as sir amyas with an exclamation of annoyance at his unserviceable arm had resigned aurelia to be lifted on to her temporary litter a hand was laid on his shoulder a voice said amyas what means this and he found himself face to face with a small keenvisaged pale man with thick grizzled brows overhanging searching dark grey eyes shaded by a great spanish hat  sir oh sir is it you he cried breathlessly now all will be well  i am very glad you think so amyas was the grave answer for all this has a strange appearance  it is my dearest wife sir my wife whom i have just recovered afteroh say sir if you think all is well with her and it is only a harmless sleeping potion sisterbettythis is my good father mr wayland he is as good as a physician let him see my sweetest life  mr wayland bent over the slumbering figure still in the bottom of the boat heard what could be told of the draught by loveday whom he recognized as his wifes attendant and feeling aurelias pulse said i should not think there was need for fear to the outward eye she is a model of sleeping innocence well you may say so and she is indeed broke from the baronet and the waitingmaid at the same instant but mr wayland heeded them little as he impatiently asked where and how is your mother amyas  in health sir at home i suppose said sir amyas but oh sir hear me before you see her  i must if you walk with me said mr wayland turning for a moment to bid his servant reward and dismiss the boats crew and see to the transport of his luggage and in the meantime aurelia was lifted by her bearers  sir amyas again uttered a rejoicing we feared you were in the hands of the pirates sir  so i was but the governor of gibraltar obtained my release and was good enough to send me home direct in a vessel on the kings service said mr wayland taking the arm his stepson offered to assist his lameness now for your explanation amyas only let me hear first that my babes are well  yes sir all well you had my letter  telling of that strange disguised wedding i had the very day i was captured  by the time they had come to the place where their ways parted mr wayland had heard enough to be so perplexed and distressed that he knew not that he had been drawn out of the way to hanover square till at the entrance of the royal york they found betty asseverating to the landlady that she was bringing no case of small pox into the house and showing as a passport of admittance two little dents on the white wrist and temple  at that instant the sound brought major delavie hurrying from his sittingroom at his best speed there was a look of horror on his face as he saw his daughters senseless condition but betty sprang to his side to prevent his wakening her and aurelia was safely carried up stairs and laid upon her sisters bed still sleeping while betty and loveday unloosed her clothes her bearers were sent for refreshment to the bar and the gentlemen stood looking on one another in the sittingroom mr wayland utterly shocked incredulous of the little he did understand and yet unable to go home until he should hear more and the major hardly less horrified in the midst of his relief but wheres belamour he cried your uncle i mean  where said sir amyas they said he was gone out  so they told me and see here  major delavie produced lady belamours note  a blind cried sir amyas turning away under a strange stroke of pain and sham oh mother mother and he dashed out of the room  poor mr wayland sat down as one who could stand no longer of what do they suspect her he said hoarsely  sir said the good major i grieve sincerely for and with you opposition to this match with my poor child seems to have transported my poor cousin to strange and frantic lengths but you may trust me to shield and guard her from exposure as far as may be  her husband only answered by a groan and wrung major delavies hand but their words were interrupted by sir amyass return he had been to his uncles chamber and had found on the table a note addressed to the major within was a inclosure directed to a belamour esq    if you have found the way to the poor captive for pitys sake    come to her rescue  be in the court with your faithful black    by ten oclock and you may yet save on who loves and looks to    you  on the outer sheet was written    i distrust this handwriting and suspect a ruse  in case i do    not return send for hargrave sandys godfrey as witnesses to    my sanity and storm the fair ones fortress in person   a b  it is not my aurelias writing said the major bravest of friends what has he not dared on her account  this is too much cried mr wayland striving in horror against his convictions i cannot hear my beloved wife loaded with monstrous suspicions in her absence  i am sorry to say this is no new threat ever since poor belamour has crossed her path said the major  what have you done sir asked sir amyas  i fear i have but wasted time said the major i have been to hanover square and getting no admittance there i came back in the hope you might be on the track with bettyas thank god you were the first thing to be done now is to find what she has done with belamour he added rising up  that must fall to my share said mr wayland pale and resolute come with me amyas your young limbs will easily return before the effect of the narcotic has passed and i need fuller explanation  stillness than came on the delavie party the major went up stairs and sat by aurelias bed gazing with eyes dazzled with tears at the child he had so longed to see and whom he found again in this strange trance a doctor came and quite confirmed mr waylands opinion that the drug would not prove deleterious provided the sleep was not disturbed and betty continued her watch after hearing what her father knew of mr belamour she was greatly struck with the selfdevotion that had gone with open eyes into so dreadful a snare as a madhouse of those days rather than miss the least chance of saving aurelia  if we go by perils dared the uncle is the true knighterrant said she to her father i wonder which our child truly loves the best  betty said her father scandalised  ay i know sir amyas is a charming boy but what a boy he is and she has barely spoken with him or seen him whereas mr belamour has been kind to her for a whole twelvemonth i know what i should do if i were in her place i would declare that i intended to be married to the uncle and would keep it  he would think it base to put the question  he would but indeed dear sir i think it would be but right and due to the dear child herself that she should have here free choice and not be bound for ever by a deception yes i know the poor boys despair would be dreadful but it would be better for them both than such a mistake  hush i hear him knocking at the door you cruel woman  the bedroom opened into the parlour the party had hired so that both could come out and meet sir amyas with the door ajar without relaxing their watch upon the sleeper the poor young man looked pale shocked and sorrowful well said he after having read in their looks that there was no change he knows the worst then on a further token of interrogation it may have been my fault i took him unannounced through the whole suite of rooms and in the closet at the end with all the doors open she was having an altercation with mar he was insisting on knowing what she had done withhe signed towards the other room she upbraiding him with faithlessness they were deaf to an approach till mr wayland in a loud voice ordered me back saying it was no scene for a son  i trust it will not end in a challenge asked the major gravely  no my fathers infirmity renders him no fighting man and ii may not challenge my superior officer  but your uncle said betty much fearing that such a scene might have led to his being forgotten  i should have told you we had not made many steps from hence before we met poor jumbo wandering like a dog that had lost his master mr belamour had taken the precaution of giving jumbo the passkey and not taking him into that house some day i will pull every brick of it down so he watched till by and by he saw a coach come out with all the windows closed and as his master had bidden him in such a case he kept along on the pavement near and never lost sight of it till he had tracked it right across the city to a house with ironbarred windows inside a high wall there it went in and he could not follow but he asked the people what place it was and though they jeered at him he made out that it was as we feared nay do not be alarmed sister he will soon be with us my poor father shut me out and i know not what passed with my mother but just as i could wait no longer to return to my dearest he came out and told me that he had found out that my uncle was in a house at moorfields and he is gone himself to liberate him he is himself a justice of the peace and he will call for dr sandys by the way that there may be no difficulty he is gone in the coachandfour with jumbo on the box so that matters will soon be righted  and a heroic champion set free said betty moving to return to her sister when the others would not be denied having another look at the sweet slumberer on whose face there was now a smile as if her dreams were marvellously lovely or as betty thought as if she knew their voices even in her sleep  sir amyas had not seen his mother again he only knew that mr wayland had come out with a face as of one stricken to the heart a sad contrast to that which had greeted him an hour before and while the carriage was coming round had simply said i did wrong to leave her  it would not bear being talked over and both son and kinsman took refuge in silence two hours more of this long day had passed and then a coach stopped at the door sir amyas hurried down in his eager anxiety and came back with his uncle holding him by the hand like a child in his gladness and betty came out to meet them in the outer room with a face of grateful welcome and outstretched hands  sir sir you have done more than all of us  yet you and your young champion here were the victors said mr belamour  ah we dared and suffered nothing like you  i hope you did not suffer much said the major looking at the calm face and neatlytied white hair which seemed to have suffered no disarrangement  no said mr belamour smiling my little friend eugene ay and my nephew himself are hoping to hear i was released from fetters and a heap of straw but i took care to give them no opportunity i merely told them they were under a mistake and had better take care i gave them a reference or two but i saw plainly that was of no use though they promised to send and then i did exactly as they bade me so as to deprive them of all excuse for meddling with me letting them know that i could pay for decent treatment so long as i was in their hands  did you receive it  i was told in a mild manner adapted to my intelligence that if i behaved well i might eat at the masters table and have a room with only one inmate of the former i have not an engaging experience either as to the fare the hostess or the company of the latter happily i know little as i only know that my comrade was to be a harmless gibbering idiot of good birth poor fellow however the sounds i heard and the court i looked into convinced me that my privileges were worth paying for  he spoke very quietly but he shuddered involuntarily and betty unable to restrain her tears retreated to her sisters side     chapter xxxvi waking       so love was still the lord of allscott   the summer sun was sinking and a red glow was on the wall above aurelias head when she moved again upon the shutting of the door while supper was being taken by the gentlemen in the outer room  presently her lips moved and she said sister not in surprise but as if she thought herself at home and as betty gently answered yes my darling child the same voice added i have had such a dream i thought i was a chrysalis and that i could not break my shell nor spread my wings  you can now my sweet said betty venturing to kiss her  recollection came sister betty is it you indeed and she threw her arms round bettys neck clinging tight to her in delicious silence till she raised her head and said no this is not home oh is it all true  true that i have you again my dear dearest sweetest child said betty oh thank god for it  thank god repeated aurelia now i have you nothing will be dreadful but where am i i thought once i was in a boat with you and eugene and some one else was it a dream i cant remember anything since that terrible old woman made me drink the coffee you have not come there have you  no dear child it was no dream that you were in a boat we had been searching everywhere for you and we were bringing you back sound sound asleep said betty in her tenderness speaking as it to a little child  i knew you would said aurelia i knew god would save me love is strong as death you know she added dreamily i think i felt it all round me in that sleep  that was what you murmured once or twice in your sleep said betty  and now oh it is so sweet to lie here and know it is you and wasnt he there too  sir amyas yes my dear he came for you he and my father and the others are in the other room waiting for you to wake  i hear their voices cried aurelia with a start sitting up oh thats my papas voice oh how good it is to hear it  i will call him as soon as i have set you a little in order are you sure you are well my dearest no headache  quite quite well why sister i have not been ill and if i had i should skip to see you and hear their voices only i wish they would speak louder thats eugene oh they are hushing him let me make haste and she moved with an alacrity that was most reassuring but i cant understand is it morning or evening  evening my dear they are at supper are not you hungry  oh yes i believe i am but as she was about to wash her hands my rings my weddingring look in my glove  no they are not there my dear they must have robbed you and oh aurelia what have you done to your hair  my hair it was all there this morning sister it was that woman i remember now i was not quite sound asleep but i had no power to move or cry out and the woman was snipping and loveday crying  vile creature burst out betty  my hair will grow said aurelia but i had so guarded my weddingringand what will he sir amyas think  their voices were at this moment heard and in another second aurelia was held against her fathers breast as in broken words he sobbed out thanks for her restoration and implored her pardon for having trusted her out of his care  oh sir do not speak so dear papa i have tried hard to do you no harm and to behave well please sir give me your blessing  god bless you indeed my child he has blessed you in guarding you as your innocence deserved though i did not ah others are impatient the poor old father comes second now  after a few minutes spent in repairing the disorder of her dress and her hands in those of her father and little brother she was led to the outer room where in the twilight there was a rapturous rush an embrace a fondling of the hand in the manner more familiar to her than the figure from before whom it proceeded she only said in her gentle plaintive tone oh sir it was not my fault they took away your rings  nay said a voice new to her here are your rings lady belamour i must trust to your christian charity to pardon her who caused you to be stripped of them  the name of lady belamour made her start as that of her enemy but a truly familiar tone said you need not fear my kind friend this is mr wayland who to our great joy has returned and has come to restore your jewels  indeed i am very glad yours is not lost said aurelia not a little bewildered  mr wayland said a few words of explanation that his wifes agent at greenwich had brought them back to her  pray let me have them entreated sir amyas i must put them on again  stay said major delavie i can have such things done only under true colours and in the full light of day the child is scarcely awake yet and does not know one from the other why neither of you so much as know the colour of the eyes of the other can you tell me sir  heavenly exclaimed the youth in an ecstatic tone of selfdefence which set the major laughing and saying my silly maid knows as little which gentleman put on the ring  i do sir said aurelia indignantly i know his voice and hand quite well and in the impulse she quitted her fathers arm and put both hands into those of her young adorer saying pray sir pardon me i never thought to hurt you so cruelly  there was a cry of my own my dearest life and she was clasped as she had been immediately after her strange wedding  however the sound of a servants step made them separate instantly and betty begged that the supper might not be removed since it was many hours since her sister had tasted food  sir amyas and betty hovered about her giving her whatever she could need in the partial light while the others stood apart exchanging such explanations as they could mr wayland said he must report himself to government on the morrow but intended afterwards to take his wife to bowstead whither she had sent all her children with mrs dove there was a great tenderness in his tone as he spoke of her and when he took leave mr belamour shrugged his shoulders saying she will come round him again  it is true enough that he ought not to have left her to herself said the major  you making excuses for her after the diabolical plot of today said mr belamour i could forgive her all but that letter to you  my lady loves her will quoted the major it amounts to insanity in some women i believe  so i might say does mens infatuation towards women like her muttered mr belamour  by this time aurelia had finished her meal and betty was anxious to carry her off without any more excitement for she was still drowsy and confused she bade her father good night asking his blessing as of old but when mr belamour kissed her hand and repeated the good night she said sir i ought to have trusted you i am so sorry  it is all well now my child he said soothingly understanding bettys wish sleep and we will talk it over  so the happy sisters once more slept in each others arms till in the early summer morning betty heard the whole story from aurelia now fully herself though she slumbered again after all was poured into her sisters bosom  betty had sympathised step by step and felt even more strongly than harriet that the situation had been intolerable for womanhood and that only aurelias childishness could have endured it so long only the eldest sister held that it would have been right and honourable to have spoken before flashing out the flame but when with many tears of contrition aurelia owned that she had long thought so and longed to confess it what could the motherly sister do but kiss the tears away and rejoice that the penance was over which had been borne with such constancy and selfdevotion  then betty rose quietly and after giving thanks on her knees that the gentle spirit had passed through all unscathed untainted with even the perception of evil she applied herself to the adaptation of one of her morning caps to her poor shorn lambs head nor did aurelia wake again till her father came to the door to make sure that all was well with his recovered treasure and to say that loveday would recover for her the box of clothes which old madge had hidden  loveday had gone back to her mistress who either had not discovered her betrayal or as things had turned out could not resent it  so fresh and blooming aurelia came out into the sittingroom whence her father held out his arms to her he would have her all to himself for a little while since even eugene was gone to his daily delight the seeing the changing of the guard  and now my child tell me he said when he had heard a little of her feelings through these adventures what would you have me do remember such a wedding as yours goes for nothing and you are still free to choose either or neither of your swains  oh papa in a remonstrating tone  you were willing to wed your old hermit  i was content then he was very kind to me  content then eh suppose you were told he was your real husband  sir he is not cried aurelia frightened  if he were  i would try to do my duty she said in a choked voice  silly child dont cry and how if after these fools tricks it turns out that the other young spark is bound to that redfaced little spitfire and cannot have you  papa dont she cried you know he is my husband in my heart and always will be and if he cannot come back to me take me home and i will try to be a good daughter to you and she hid her face on his shoulder  poor child it is a shame to tease her said her father raising up her face i only wanted to know which of them you would wish to put on the ring again i see you need not be afraid you shall have the ruby one but as for the little gold one wait for that till it is put on in church my dear ah and theres the flutter of his wings or rather the rattle of his spurs now then young people you shall not be hindered from a full view of each others lineaments it is the first time you ever had a real sight of each other neither of you being in a swoon is it not i trust you do not repent upon further acquaintance aurelia got as far as the shoebuckles once i believe  she will get no farther this time sir if you annihilate her with your pleasantry said betty fully convinced by this time  ah young love has made himself more dazzling than ever continued the major too delighted to be stopped the fullest dress uniform i declare m le capitaine is bent on doing honour to the occasion  would that it were on for no other reason sir said sir amyas but the king and queen have taken it into their heads to go off to kew and here am i under orders to command the escort i verily believe it is all spite on the colonels part for russell would have exchanged the turn with me but he sent down special orders for me i have but half an hour to spend here and when i shall be able to get back again heaven only knows  however he and aurelia were permitted to improve that half hour to the utmost in their own way while the major and betty were reading a long and characteristic letter from mrs arden inquiring certainly for her sisters fate but showing far more solicitude in proving that she harriet arden had acted a wise prudent and sisterly part and that it was most unreasonable and cruel to treat her as accountable for her sisters disappearance it was really making her quite ill and mr arden was like a manso disagreeable about it  betty was very glad this epistle had not come till it was possible to laugh at it she would have sat down to reply to it at once had not a billet been brought in from the widow of one of her fathers old brother officers who had heard of his being in town and begged him to bring his daughter to see her excusing herself for not waiting on miss delavie as she was very feeble and infirm  it was a request that could not be refused but aurelia was not equipped for such a visit and shrank timidly from showing herself so when mr belamour came down it was agreed that she should remain at home under his protection in which she could be very happy though his person was as strange to her as his voice was familiar indeed she felt as if a burden was on her mind till she could tell him of her shame at having failed in the trust and silence that he had enjoined on her  my child he said we have carried it too far it was more than we ought to have required of you and i knew it i had made up my mind and told my nephew that the first time you really asked i should tell the whole truth and trust to your discretion while of course he wished for nothing more  as my sister said it was my fault  nay i think you had good cause to stand on your defence and i cannot have you grieve over it you have shown an unshaken steadiness under trial since such as ought indeed to be compensation  i deserved it all said aurelia and i do hope that i am a little wiser and less foolish for it all a little more of a woman she added blushing  a soul trained by love and suffering as in the old legend said mr belamour thoughtfully  thoroughly pleasant was here teteatete with him especially when she artlessly asked him whether her dear sister were not all she had told him and he fervently answered that indeed she was a perfect lesson to all socalled beauties of what true loveliness of a countenance can be  oh i am so glad cried aurelia i never saw a facea womans i meanthat i like as well as my dear sisters  she was sorry when they were interrupted by a call from mr wayland who had reported himself at the secretary of war but could do no more that day and had come to inquire for her he and mr belamour drew apart into a window and conversed in a low voice and then they came to her and mr wayland desired to know from where she found the recipe for the cosmetic which had nearly cost her so dearly  it was in a shelf in the wainscoting in a sort of little study at that house said aurelia  among other papers  quantities of other papers  of what kind  letters and bills and wills and parchments oh so dusty some were on paper tumbling to pieces and some on tiny slips of parchment  and you read them all  i had to read them to see what they were as well as i could make out and sorted them and tied them up in bundles  can you tell me whether they were delavie wills  i should think they were i know that the oldest of all were latin and i could make nothing out in them but something about manoriem and carminster and what looked like the names of some of the fields at home  do you think you could show me those slips  i do not suppose any one has touched them  then my dear young lady you would confer a great favour on me if you would allow mr belamour and myself to escort you to delavie and show us these papers i fear it may be alarming and distressing  oh no sir i know no harm can happen to me where mr belamour is she said smiling  it may be very important he said and she went to put on her hood  surely said mr wayland the titledeeds cannot have been left there  no the titledeeds to the main body of the property are at hargraves i have seen them at the time of my brothers marriage but still this may be what was wanting  yet the sending this child to search is presumption that no such document existed  of course no one supposed it did said mr wayland on the defence again  aurelia was quickly ready in her little hood and kerchief and trim highheeled shoes she was greatly surprised to find how near she had been to her friends during these last few days of her captivity and when madge obeyed the summons to the door the old woman absolutely smiled to see her safe and the little terrier danced about her in such transports that she begged to take him back with her  she opened the door of the little empty book room where nothing stood except the old bureau that she said had been full of letters but all the oldest things had been within a door opening in the wainscot which she should never have found had not bob pushed it open in his search for rats and then she found a tin case full of papers and parchments much older she thought than the letters she had tied them up together and easily produced them  mr wayland handed them to mr belamour whose legal eye was better accustomed to crabbed old documents a conversation that had begun on the way about fay and letty was resumed and interested both their father and aurelia so much that they forgot to be impatient until mr belamour looked up from his examination saying this is what was wanting here is a grant in the 12th year of henry iii to guglielmus ab vita and the heirs male of his body to the manor lying without the city of carminster and here are three wills of successive lords of delavie expressly mentioning heirs male now the deeds that i have seen do not go beyond 1539 when henry delavie had a grant of the grange and lands belonging to carminster abbeythe place in fact where the great house stands and there is in that no exclusion of female heirs but the manor house can certainly be proved to be entailed in the male line alone according to what was i believe the tradition of the family  there is no large amount of property involved i fear said mr wayland  there is an old house much out of repair and a few farms worth may be 200 pounds a year a loss that will not be material to you sir i hope  do you mean said aurelia not daring to ask farther  i mean my dear young lady said mr wayland that your researches have brought to light the means of doing tardy justice to your good father  his right to the manor house is here established explained mr belamour it will not be a matter of favour of my ladys but as my brother supposed he ought to have been put in possession on the old lords death  and eugene will be a gentleman of estate cried aurelia joyously nor will any one be able to drive out my dear father oh how happy i am  both she and mr belamour spared mr wayland the knowledge of my ladys many broken promises and indeed she was anxious to get back to the royal york lest her father and sister should have returned and think her again vanished  they all met at the door and much amazed were the major and betty to encounter her with her two squires mr wayland took the major to show him the parchments betty had her explanation from her sister and mr belamour  you actually ventured back to that dreadful house she said looking at them gratefully  you see what protectors i had said aurelia with a happy smile  yes said betty i have been longing to sayonly i cannot for she was almost choked by a great sob how very much we owe to you sir i could say it better if i did not feel it so much and she held out her hand  you cannot owe to me a tithe of what i owe to your sister said mr belamour and through her to you madam much as nature had done for her never would she have been to the miserable recluse the life and lightbringing creature she was save for the sister she taught me to know and love even before i saw her  a wonderful revelation here burst on aurelia the at least halfmarried woman and she fled precipitately smiling to herself in ecstasy behind her great fan  betty never dreaming of the drift of the words so utterly out of the reach of love did she suppose herself replied composedly our aurelia is a dear good girl and i am thankful that through all her trials she has so proved herself i am glad she has been a comfort to you sir she  and will not you complete the cure and render the benefit lasting said mr belamour who had never let go the hand she had given him in gratitude and now gave it a pressure that conveyed for the first time his meaning  oh she cried trying to take it away your kindness and gratitude are leading you too far sir a hideous old fright like me instead of a lovely young thing like her it is an absurdity  stay miss delavie remember that your aurelias roses and lilies were utterly wasted on me i never thought whether she was beautiful save when others raved about her i never saw her till yesterday but the voice the goodness the amiability in fact all that i did truly esteem and prize in her i had already found matured and mellowed together with that beauty of countenance which is independent of mere skindeep complexion and feature you know my history and how far i am from being able to offer you a fresh untouched young heart such as my nephew brings to the fair aurelia but the devotion of my life will be yours if you will accept it  sir i cannot listen to you you are very good but i can never leave my father oh let me go away     chapter xxxvii making the best of it       at last the queen said girl i bid thee rise     for now thou hast found favour in mine eyes     and i repent me of the misery     that in this place thou hast endured me     altho because of it the joy indeed     shall now be mine that pleasure is thy meed                                               morris   those were evil times and the court examples were most corrupting so that a splendid and imperious woman like urania lady belamour had found little aid from public opinion when left to herself by the absence of her second husband selfish unscrupulous and pleasureloving she was by nature but during sir jovian belamours lifetime she had been kept within bounds then came a brief widowhood when debt and difficulty hurried her into accepting mr wayland a thoughtful scientific man whose wealth had accumulated without much volition of his own to an extent that made her covet his alliance enthralled by her charm of manner he had not awakened to the perception of what she really was during the few years that had elapsed before he was sent abroad and she refused to accompany him  then it was that wealth larger than she had before commanded and a court appointment involved her in more dangerous habits her debts both of extravagance and of the gaming table were enormous trenching hard on the delavie property and making severe inroads on mr waylands means but the belamour estates being safely tied up she had only been able to borrow on her dower she had sinned with a high hand after the fashion of the time and then in terror at the approaching return of her husband had endeavoured to conceal the ravages of her extravagance by her bargain for her sons hand  the youth bred up at a distance and then the companion of his stepfather had on his return found his home painfully altered in his two years absence and had been galled and grieved by the state of things so that even apart from the clearing of his prospects the relief was great the quarrel with colonel mar that mr wayland had interrupted was not made up there was no opportunity for mr wayland at once removed his family to bowstead there to remain while he transacted his business in london  moreover mr belamour and mr wayland agreed in selling the young baronets commission the major allowed that it was impossible that he should remain under the command of his present colonel but regretted that he should not continue in the service declaring it the best school for a young man and that he did not want to see his soninlaw a muddlebrained sporting country squire he would have had sir amyas exchange into the line and see a little service before settling down but maria theresa had not as yet set europe in a blaze and in the absence of a promising war sir amyas did more incline to his uncles representations of duties to tenants and to his county and was even ready to prepare himself for them when he should be of sufficient age to undertake them however in the midst of the debates a new scheme was made mr belamour had been called upon and welcomed by his old friends who being men of rank and influence had risen in life while he was immured at bowstead one of these had just received a diplomatic appointment at vienna and in spite of insular ignorance of foreign manners was at a loss for a capable suite mr belamour suggested major delavie as from his long service in austria likely to be very useful the envoy caught at the idea and the thought of once more seeing his old comrades enchanted the major whose only regret was that his hero prince eugene had been dead three years but to visit his grave would be something appointments ran in families so that nothing could be easier than to obtain one for the young baronet and though mr belamour did not depend on his own health enough to accept anything he was quite willing to join the party and to spend a little time abroad while his nephew was growing somewhat older making an essay of his talents and at any rate putting off the commencement of stagnation thus matters settled themselves the only disappointed member of the family being mrs arden who thought it very hard that she could not stir any one up to request an appointment of her husband as chaplainnot even himself  mr wayland was at once called upon to go out to america to superintend the defences of the canadian frontier and he resolved on taking his family out obtaining land and settling there permanently he would pay all my ladys debts but she should never again appear in london society and cruel exile as it must seem to her he trusted that his affection and tenderness would in time reconcile her to the new way of life knowing as she did that he had forgiven much that had made him look like a crushed and sorrowful man in the midst of all the successes and the honours he received from his country  she remained quietly at bowstead and none of them saw her except her son and the major to the latter of whom her husband brought a message that she would esteem it a favour if he would come and visit her there the day before he returned to carminster very much affected the good major complied with her request went down with mr wayland and spent a night at bowstead  he found that she had accepted her fate with the good grace of a woman whose first instinct was not to make herself disagreeable she was rather pale and not made up in any way but exquisitely though more simply dressed and more beautiful than ever her cousin thought as he always did whenever he came into her presence she was one of those people whose beauty is always a fresh surprise and she was far more selfpossessed than he was  so cousin harry where am i to begin my congratulations i did you and unwitting service when i sent your daughter to search among those musty old parchments i knew my father believed in the existence of some such document but i thought all those hoards in delavie house were devoid of all legal importance and had been sifted again and again besides i always meant to settle that old house upon you  i have always heard so cousin he answered  but it was such a mere trifle she added that it never seemed worth while to set the lawyers to work about that alone so i waited for other work to be in hand  there is a homely scottish proverb my lady which declares that the scrapings of the muckle pot are worth the wee pot fu a mere trifle to you is affluence to us  i am sincerely rejoiced at it harry no doubt she thought she was you will keep up the old name while my scrupulous lord and master gives up my poor patrimony to the extortionate creditors for years to come it is well that the young lovers have other prospects so harry you see after all i kept my word and your daughter is provided for she continued with an arch smile pretty creature i find my son bears me more malice than she does for the robbery that was perpetrated on her it was too tempting harry nature will repair her loss but at out time of life we must beg borrow or steal  that was the least matter said the major gravely  this is the reason why i wished to see you said my lady laying her white hand on his i wanted to explain  cousin cousin had not you better leave it alone said major delavie you know you can always talk a poor man out of his senses at the moment  yet listen harry and understand my troubles here i was pledged absolutely pledged to give my son to lady aresfields daughter i do not know whether she may not yet sue me for breach of contract though wayland has repaid her the loans she advanced me and on the other hand in spite of all my precautions mar had obtained a sight of your poor daughter and i knew him well enough to be aware that to put her entirely and secretly out of his reach was the only chance preserving her from his pursuit i had excellent accounts of the worthy man to whom i meant her to be consigned and i knew that when she wrote to you as a west indian queen you would be able to forgive your poor cousin i see what you would say but sending her to you was impossible since i had to secure her both from amyas and from mar it would only have involved you in perplexities innumerable and might have led even to bloodshed i may not have acted wisely but weak women in difficulties know not which path to choose  there is always the straight one said he  ah you strong men can easily says so but for us poor muchtried women however she said suddenly changing her tone love has checkmated us and i rejoice your daughter will support the credit of the name i am glad the new lady belamour will not be that little termagant milkmaid belle whom circumstances compelled me to inflict upon my poor boy the title will be your daughters alone i have promised my husband that in the new world i will sink into plain mrs wayland then with a burst of genuine feeling she exclaimed he is a good man harry  he is indeed urania i believe you will yet be happier than you have ever been  what among barbarians who never saw a lootable and get the modes three months too late and you are laughing at me but see i am a poor frivolous being not sufficient to myself like your daughters they say aurelia was as sprightly as a spring butterfly all the time she was shut up at bowstead with no company save the children and old belamour  they are lovely children madam aurelia dotes on them and you will soon find them all you need  their father is never weary of telling me so he is never so happy as when they hang about him and tell him of cousin aura or sister aura as they love to call her  it was charming to see them dance round her when he brought them to spend the day with her mr wayland brought his good kinswoman who will take charge of them on the voyage and aurelia was a little consoled at the parting by seeing how tender and kind she is with them  aye if i do not hate that woman it will be well for she is as much a duenna for me as governess for the children heighho what do not our follies bring on us we poor creatures should never be left to the great world  the pretty air of repentance was almost irresistible well as the major knew it for the mood of the moment assumed as what would best satisfy him  i rejoice she went on in spite of my lovely daughterinlaws discretion she will be well surrounded with guardians has the excellent betty consented  at last madam my persuasions were vain till she found that mr belamour would gladly come with us to austria and that she should be enabled to watch over both her young sister and me  there again i give myself credit harry would the sacred flame ever have awakened in yonder misanthrope had i not sent your daughter to restore him to life she spoke playfully but the major could not help thinking she had persuaded herself that all his present felicity was owing to her benevolence and that she would persuade him of it too if she went on much longer looking at him so sweetly he would not tax her with the wicked note she had written to account for mr belamours disappearance and which she had forgotten he felt that he could not impel one whom he could not but still regard with tenderness to utter any more untruths and excuses  by the by she added does your daughter take my waitingmaid after all i would have forgiven her for she is an admirable hairdresser but wayland says he cannot have so ingenious person in his house though after all i do not see that she is a bit worse than others of her condition and she herself insists on trying to become aurelias attendant vowing that the sight of her is as good as any methodist sermon  precisely madam we were all averse to taking her with us but aurelia said she owed her much gratitude and she declared so earnestly that the sight of my dear child brought back all the virtuous and pious thoughts she had forgotten that even bettys heart was touched and she is to go with us on trial  oh she is as honest as regards money and jewels as ever i knew a waitingmaid but for the rest lady belamour shrugged her shoulders however one is as good as another and at least she will never let her lady go a fright see here harry these are the delavie jewels i shall never need them more carry them to your daughters  nay your own daughters urania  never mind the little wretches their father will provide for them and they will marry american settlers in the forests what should they do with court jewels it is his desire see here this suit of pearls is what i wore at my wedding with amyass father i should like aurelia to be married in them farewell harry you did better for yourself than if you had taken me yet maybe i might been a better woman she stopped short as she looked at his honest face and eyes full of tears  no urania he said mans love could not have done for you what only another love can do may you yet find that and true life   the sisters were not married at the same time neither mr belamour nor his elizabeth could endure to make part of the public pageant that it was thought well should mark the real wedding at bowstead so their banns were put up at st clement danes and one quiet morning they slipped out with no witnesses but the major aurelia and eugene and were wedded there in the most unobtrusive manner  as to the great marriage a month later at bowstead there was a certain bookseller named richardson who by favour of hargrave got a view of it and who is thought there to have obtained some ideas for the culminating wedding of his great novel  a little later the following letter was written from the excellent mrs montagu to her correspondent mrs elizabeth carter there was yesterday presented preparatory to leaving england for vienna the young lady belamour incomparably the greatest beauty who has this year appeared at court every one is running after her but she appears perfectly unconscious of the furore she has excited and is said to have been bred up in all simplicity in the country and to be as good as she is fair her young husband sir amyas belamour is a youth of much promise and they seem absolutely devoted with eyes only for each other they are said to have gone through a series of adventures as curious as they are romantic and indeed when they made their appearance there was a general whisper begun by young mr horace walpole of                           cupid and psyche
