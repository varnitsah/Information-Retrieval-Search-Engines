20163966	the sacred fount  by  henry james  new york  charles scribners sons  1901  copyright 1901 by  charles scribners sons  trow directory printing and bookbinding company new york     the sacred fount     i   it was an occasion i feltthe prospect of a large partyto look out at the station for others possible friends and even possible enemies who might be going such premonitions it was true bred fears when they failed to breed hopes though it was to be added that there were sometimes in the case rather happy ambiguities one was glowered at in the compartment by people who on the morrow after breakfast were to prove charming one was spoken to first by people whose sociability was subsequently to show as bleak and one built with confidence on others who were never to reappear at allwho were only going to birmingham as soon as i saw gilbert long some way up the platform however i knew him as an element it was not so much that the wish was father to the thought as that i remembered having already more than once met him at newmarch he was a friend of the househe wouldnt be going to birmingham i so little expected him at the same time to recognise me that i stopped short of the carriage near which he stoodi looked for a seat that wouldnt make us neighbours  i had met him at newmarch onlya place of a charm so special as to create rather a bond among its guests but he had always in the interval so failed to know me that i could only hold him as stupid unless i held him as impertinent he was stupid in fact and in that character had no business at newmarch but he had also no doubt his system which he applied without discernment i wondered while i saw my things put into my corner what newmarch could see in himfor it always had to see something before it made a sign his good looks which were striking perhaps paid his wayhis six feet and more of stature his lowgrowing tightcurling hair his big bare blooming face he was a fine piece of human furniturehe made a small party seem more numerous this at least was the impression of him that had revived before i stepped out again to the platform and it armed me only at first with surprise when i saw him come down to me as if for a greeting if he had decided at last to treat me as an acquaintance made it was none the less a case for letting him come all the way that accordingly was what he did and with so clear a conscience i hasten to add that at the end of a minute we were talking together quite as with the tradition of prompt intimacy he was goodlooking enough i now again saw but not such a model of it as i had seemed to remember on the other hand his manners had distinctly gained in ease he referred to our previous encounters and common contactshe was glad i was going he peeped into my compartment and thought it better than his own he called a porter the next minute to shift his things and while his attention was so taken i made out some of the rest of the contingent who were finding or had already found places  this lasted till long came back with his porter as well as with a lady unknown to me and to whom he had apparently mentioned that our carriage would pleasantly accommodate her the porter carried in fact her dressingbag which he put upon a seat and the bestowal of which left the lady presently free to turn to me with a reproach i dont think it very nice of you not to speak to me i stared then caught at her identity through her voice after which i reflected that she might easily have thought me the same sort of ass as i had thought long for she was simply it appeared grace brissenden we had the three of us the carriage to ourselves and we journeyed together for more than an hour during which in my corner i had my companions opposite we began at first by talking a little and then as the traina fast oneran straight and proportionately bellowed we gave up the effort to compete with its music meantime however we had exchanged with each other a fact or two to turn over in silence brissenden was coming laternot indeed that that was such a fact but his wife was informedshe knew about the numerous others she had mentioned while we waited people and things that obert ra was somewhere in the train that her husband was to bring on lady john and that mrs froome and lord lutley were in the wondrous new fashionand their servants too like a single householdstarting travelling arriving together it came back to me as i sat there that when she mentioned lady john as in charge of brissenden the other member of our trio had expressed interest and surpriseexpressed it so as to have made her reply with a smile didnt you really know this passage had taken place on the platform while availing ourselves of our last minute we hung about our door  why in the world should i know  to which with good nature she had simply returned oh its only that i thought you always did and they both had looked at me a little oddly as if appealing from each other what in the world does she mean long might have seemed to ask while mrs brissenden conveyed with light profundity you know why he should as well as i dont you in point of fact i didnt in the least and what afterwards struck me much more as the beginning of my anecdote was a word dropped by long after someone had come up to speak to her i had then given him his cue by alluding to my original failure to place her what in the world in the year or two had happened to her she had changed so extraordinarily for the better how could a woman who had been plain so long become pretty so late  it was just what he had been wondering i didnt place her at first myself she had to speak to me but i hadnt seen her since her marriage which waswasnt itfour or five years ago shes amazing for her age  what then is her age  ohtwo or threeandforty  shes prodigious for that but can it be so great  isnt it easy to count he asked dont you remember when poor briss married her how immensely she was older what was it they called ita case of childstealing everyone made jokes briss isnt yet thirty no i bethought myself he wouldnt be but i hadnt remembered the difference as so great what i had mainly remembered was that she had been rather ugly at present she was rather handsome long however as to this didnt agree im bound to say i dont quite call it beauty  oh i only speak of it as relative she looks so welland somehow so fine why else shouldnt we have recognised her  why indeed but it isnt a thing with which beauty has to do he had made the matter out with an acuteness for which i shouldnt have given him credit what has happened to her is simply thatwell that nothing has  nothing has happened but my dear man she has been married thats supposed to be something  yes but she has been married so little and so stupidly it must be desperately dull to be married to poor briss his comparative youth doesnt after all make more of him hes nothing but what he is her clock has simply stopped she looks no olderthats all  ah and a jolly good thing too when you start where she did but i take your discrimination i added as just the only thing is that if a woman doesnt grow older she may be said to grow younger and if she grows younger she may be supposed to grow prettier thats allexcept of course that it strikes me as charming also for brissenden himself he had the face i seem to recall of a baby so that if his wife did flaunt her fifty years  oh long broke in it wouldnt have mattered to him if she had thats the awfulness dont you see of the married state people have to get used to each others charms as well as to their faults he wouldnt have noticed its only you and i who do and the charm of it is for us  what a lucky thing then i laughed that with brissenden so out of it and relegated to the timetables obscure hereafter it should be you and i who enjoy her i had been struck in what he said with more things than i could take up and i think i must have looked at him while he talked with a slight return of my first mystification he talked as i had never heard himless and less like the heavy adonis who had so often cut me and while he did so i was proportionately more conscious of the change in him he noticed in fact after a little the vague confusion of my gaze and asked mewith complete good naturewhy i stared at him so hard i sufficiently disembroiled myself to reply that i could only be fascinated by the way he made his points to which hewith the same sociabilitymade answer that he on the contrary more than suspected me clever and critical as i was of amusement at his artless prattle he stuck none the less to his idea that what we had been discussing was lost on brissenden ah then i hope i said that at least lady john isnt  oh lady john and he turned away as if there were either too much or too little to say about her  i found myself engaged again with mrs briss while he was occupied with a newspaperboyand engaged oddly in very much the free view of him that he and i had just taken of herself she put it to me frankly that she had never seen a man so improved a confidence that i met with alacrity as it showed me that under the same impression i had not been astray she had only it seemed on seeing him made him out with a great effort i took in this confession but i repaid it he hinted to me that he had not known you more easily  more easily than you did oh nobody does that and to be quite honest ive got used to it and dont mind people talk of our changing every seven years but they make me feel as if i changed every seven minutes what will you have at any rate and how can i help it its the grind of life the wear and tear of time and misfortune and you know im ninetythree  how young you must feel i answered to care to talk of your age i envy you for nothing would induce me to let you know mine you look you see just twentyfive  it evidently too what i said gave her pleasurea pleasure that she caught and held well you cant say i dress it  no you dress i make out ninetythree if you would only dress twentyfive youd look fifteen  fifteen in a schoolroom charade she laughed at this happily enough your compliment to my taste is odd i know at all events she went on whats the difference in mr long  be so good then for my relief as to name it  well a very clever woman has for some time past  takenthis beginning was of course enougha particular interest in him do you mean lady john i inquired and as she evidently did i rather demurred do you call lady john a very clever woman  surely thats why i kindly arranged that as she was to take i happened to learn the next train guy should come with her  you arranged it i wondered shes not so clever as you then  because you feel that she wouldnt or couldnt no doubt she wouldnt have made the same point of itfor more than one reason poor guy hasnt pretensionshas nothing but his youth and his beauty but thats precisely why im sorry for him and try whenever i can to give him a lift lady johns company is you see a lift  you mean it has so unmistakably been one to long  yesit has positively given him a mind and a tongue thats what has come over him  then i said its a most extraordinary casesuch as one really has never met  oh but she objected it happens  ah so very seldom yesive positively never met it are you very sure i insisted that lady john is the influence  i dont mean to say of course she replied that he looks fluttered if you mention her that he doesnt in fact look as blank as a pickpocket but that proves nothingor rather as theyre known to be always together and she from morning till night as pointed as a hatpin it proves just what one sees one simply takes it in  i turned the picture round theyre scarcely together when shes together with brissenden  ah thats only once in a way its a thing that from time to time such peopledont you knowmake a particular point of they cultivate to cover their game the appearance of other little friendships it puts outsiders off the scent and the real thing meanwhile goes on besides you yourself acknowledge the effect if she hasnt made him clever what has she made him she has given him steadily more and more intellect  well you may be right i laughed though you speak as if it were codliver oil does she administer it as a daily dose by the spoonful or only as a drop at a time does he take it in his food is he supposed to know the difficulty for me is simply that if ive seen the handsome grow ugly and the ugly handsome the fat grow thin and the thin fat the short grow long and the long short if ive even likewise seen the clever as ive too fondly at least supposed them grow stupid so have i not seenno not once in all my daysthe stupid grow clever  it was a question none the less on which she could perfectly stand up all i can say is then that youll have the next day or two an interesting new experience  it will be interesting i declared while i thoughtand all the more if i make out for myself that lady john is the agent  youll make it out if you talk to herthat is i mean if you make her talk youll see how she can  she keeps her wit then i asked in spite of all she pumps into others  oh she has enough for two  im immensely struck with yours i replied as well as with your generosity ive seldom seen a woman take so handsome a view of another  its because i like to be kind she said with the best faith in the world to which i could only return as we entered the train that it was a kindness lady john would doubtless appreciate long rejoined us and we ran as i have said our course which as i have also noted seemed short to me in the light of such a blaze of suggestion to each of my companionsand the fact stuck out of themsomething unprecedented had happened     ii   the day was as fine and the scene as fair at newmarch as the party was numerous and various and my memory associates with the rest of the long afternoon many renewals of acquaintance and much sitting and strolling for snatches of talk in the long shade of great trees and through the straight walks of old gardens a couple of hours thus passed and fresh accessions enriched the picture there were persons i was curious ofof lady john for instance of whom i promised myself an early view but we were apt to be carried away in currents that reflected new images and sufficiently beguiled impatience i recover all the same a full sequence of impressions each of which i afterwards saw had been appointed to help all the others if my anecdote as i have mentioned had begun at paddington at a particular moment it gathered substance step by step and without missing a link the links in fact should i count them all would make too long a chain they formed nevertheless the happiest little chapter of accidents though a series of which i can scarce give more than the general effect  one of the first accidents was that before dinner i met ford obert wandering a little apart with mrs server and that as they were known to me as agreeable acquaintances i should have faced them with confidence had i not immediately drawn from their sequestered air the fear of interrupting them mrs server was always lovely and obert always expert the latter straightway pulled up however making me as welcome as if their converse had dropped she was extraordinarily pretty markedly responsive conspicuously charming but he gave me a look that really seemed to say donttheres a good fellowleave me any longer alone with her i had met her at newmarch beforeit was indeed only so that i had met herand i knew how she was valued there i also knew that an aversion to pretty womennumbers of whom he had preserved for a grateful posteritywas his sign neither as man nor as artist the effect of all of which was to make me ask myself what she could have been doing to him making love possiblyyet from that he would scarce have appealed she wouldnt on the other hand have given him her company only to be inhuman i joined them at all events learning from mrs server that she had come by a train previous to my own and we made a slow trio till at a turn of the prospect we came upon another group it consisted of mrs froome and lord lutley and of gilbert long and lady johnmingled and confounded as might be said not assorted according to tradition long and mrs froome came first i recollect together and his lordship turned away from lady john on seeing me rather directly approach her she had become for me on the spot as interesting as while we travelled i had found my two friends in the train as the source of the flow of intellect that had transmuted our young man she had every claim to an earnest attention and i should soon have been ready to pronounce that she rewarded it as richly as usual she was indeed as mrs briss had said as pointed as a hatpin and i bore in mind that ladys injunction to look in her for the answer to our riddle  the riddle i may mention sounded afresh to my ear in gilbert longs gay voice it hovered therebefore me beside behind me as we all pausedin his light restless step a nervous animation that seemed to multiply his presence he became really for the moment under this impression the thing i was most conscious of i heard him i felt him even while i exchanged greetings with the sorceress by whose wand he had been touched to be touched myself was doubtless not quite what i wanted yet i wanted distinctly a glimpse so that with the smart welcome lady john gave me i might certainly have felt that i was on the way to get it the note of longs predominance deepened during these minutes in a manner i cant describe and i continued to feel that though we pretended to talk it was to him only we listened he had us all in hand he controlled for the moment all our attention and our relations he was in short as a consequence of our attitude in possession of the scene to a tune he couldnt have dreamed of a year or two beforeinasmuch as at that period he could have figured at no such eminence without making a fool of himself and the great thing was that if his eminence was now so perfectly graced he yet knew less than any of us what was the matter with him he was unconscious of how he had come outwhich was exactly what sharpened my wonder lady john on her side was thoroughly conscious and i had a fancy that she looked at me to measure how far i was i cared naturally not in the least what she guessed her interest for me was all in the operation of her influence i am afraid i watched to catch it in the actwatched her with a curiosity of which she might well have become aware  what an intimacy what an intensity of relation i said to myself so successful a process implied it was of course familiar enough that when people were so deeply in love they rubbed off on each otherthat a great pressure of soul to soul usually left on either side a sufficient show of telltale traces but for long to have been so stamped as i found him how the pliant wax must have been prepared and the seal of passion applied what an affection the woman working such a change in him must have managed to create as a preface to her influence with what a sense of her charm she must have paved the way for it strangely enough howeverit was even rather irritatingthere was nothing more than usual in lady john to assist my view of the height at which the pair so evoked must move these thingsthe way other people could feel about each other the power not ones self in the given instance that made for passionwere of course at best the mystery of mysteries still there were cases in which fancy sounding the depths or the shallows could at least drop the lead lady john perceptibly was no such case imagination in her presence was but the weak wing of the insect that bumps against the glass she was pretty prompt hard and in a way that was special to her a mistress at once of culture and of slang she was like a hatwith one of mrs brisss hatpinsaskew on the bust of virgil her ornamental informationas strong as a coat of furniturepolishalmost knocked you down what i felt in her now more than ever was that having a reputation for point to keep up she was always under arms with absences and anxieties like those of a celebrity at a public dinner she thought too much of her speechof how soon it would have to come it was none the less wonderful however that as grace brissenden had said she should still find herself with intellect to sparehave lavished herself by precept and example on long and yet have remained for each other interlocutor as fresh as the clown bounding into the ring she cracked for my benefit as many jokes and turned as many somersaults as might have been expected after which i thought it fair to let her off we all faced again to the house for dressing and dinner were in sight  i found myself once more as we moved with mrs server and i remember rejoicing that sympathetic as she showed herself she didnt think it necessary to be like lady john always ready she was delightfully handsomehandsomer than ever slim fair fine with charming pale eyes and splendid auburn hair i said to myself that i hadnt done her justice she hadnt organised her forces was a little helpless and vague but there was ease for the weary in her happy nature and her peculiar grace these last were articles on which five minutes later before the house where we still had a margin i was moved to challenge ford obert  what was the matter just nowwhen though you were so fortunately occupied you yet seemed to call me to the rescue  oh he laughed i was only occupied in being frightened  but at what  well at a sort of sense that she wanted to make love to me  i reflected mrs server does mrs server make love  it seemed to me my friend replied that she began on it to you as soon as she got hold of you werent you aware  i debated afresh i didnt know that i had been not to the point of terror shes so gentle and so appealing even if she took one in hand with violence moreover i added i dont see why terrorgiven so charming a personshould be the result its flattering  ah youre brave said obert  i didnt know you were ever timid how can you be in your profession doesnt it come back to me for that matter thatonly the other yearyou painted her  yes i faced her to that extent but shes different now  i scarcely made it out in what way different shes as charming as ever  as if even for his own satisfaction my friend seemed to think a little well her affections were not then i imagine at her disposal i judge that thats what it must have been they were fixedwith intensity and it made the difference with me her imagination had for the time rested its wing at present its ready for flightit seeks a fresh perch its trying take care  oh i dont flatter myself i laughed that ive only to hold out my hand at any rate i went on i shant call for help  he seemed to think again i dont know youll see  if i do i shall see a great deal more than i now suspect he wanted to get off to dress but i still held him isnt she wonderfully lovely  oh he simply exclaimed  isnt she as lovely as she seems  but he had already broken away what has that to do with it  what has anything then  shes too beastly unhappy  but isnt that just ones advantage  no its uncanny and he escaped  the question had at all events brought us indoors and so far up our staircase as to where it branched towards oberts room i followed it to my corridor with which other occasions had made me acquainted and i reached the door on which i expected to find my card of designation this door however was open so as to show me in momentary possession of the room a gentleman unknown to me who in unguided quest of his quarters appeared to have arrived from the other end of the passage he had just seen as the property of another my unpacked things with which he immediately connected me he moreover to my surprise on my entering sounded my name in response to which i could only at first remain blank it was in fact not till i had begun to help him place himself that correcting my blankness i knew him for guy brissenden he had been put by himself for some reason in the bachelor wing and exploring at hazard had mistaken the signs by the time we found his servant and his lodging i had reflected on the oddity of my having been as stupid about the husband as i had been about the wife he had escaped my notice since our arrival but i had as a much older man met himthe hero of his odd unionat some earlier time like his wife none the less he had now struck me as a stranger and it was not till in his room i stood a little face to face with him that i made out the wonderful reason  the wonderful reason was that i was not a much older man guy brissenden at any rate was not a much younger it was he who was oldit was he who was olderit was he who was oldest that was so disconcertingly what he had become it was in short what he would have been had he been as old as he looked he looked almost anythinghe looked quite sixty i made it out again at dinner where from a distance but opposite i had him in sight nothing could have been stranger than the way that fatigued fixed settled he seemed to have piled up the years they were there without having had time to arrive it was as if he had discovered some miraculous short cut to the common doom he had grown old in fine as people you see after an interval sometimes strike you as having grown richtoo quickly for the honest or at least for the straight way he had cheated or inherited or speculated it took me but a minute then to add him to my little gallerythe small collection i mean represented by his wife and by gilbert long as well as in some degree doubtless also by lady john the museum of those who put to me with such intensity the question of what had happened to them his wife on the same side was not out of my range and now largely exposed lighted jewelled and enjoying moreover visibly the sense of these thingshis wife upon my honour as i soon remarked to the lady next me his wife it was too prodigious looked about twenty  yesisnt it funny said the lady next me  it was so funny that it set me thinking afresh and that with the interest of it which became a positive excitement i had to keep myself in hand in order not too publicly to explain not to break out right and left with my reflections i dont know whyit was a sense instinctive and unreasoned but i felt from the first that if i was on the scent of something ultimate i had better waste neither my wonder nor my wisdom i was on the scentthat i was sure of and yet even after i was sure i should still have been at a loss to put my enigma itself into words i was just conscious vaguely of being on the track of a law a law that would fit that would strike me as governing the delicate phenomenadelicate though so markedthat my imagination found itself playing with a part of the amusement they yielded came i daresay from my exaggerating themgrouping them into a larger mystery and thereby a larger law than the facts as observed yet warranted but that is the common fault of minds for which the vision of life is an obsession the obsession pays if one will but to pay it has to borrow after dinner but while the men were still in the room i had some talk again with long of whom i inquired if he had been so placed as to see poor briss  he appeared to wonder and poor briss with our shifting of seats was now at a distance i think sobut i didnt particularly notice whats the matter with poor briss  thats exactly what i thought you might be able to tell me but if nothing in him strikes you  he met my eyes a momentthen glanced about where is he  behind you only dont turn round to look for he knows but i dropped having caught something directed toward me in brissendens face my interlocutor remained blank simply asking me after an instant what it was he knew on this i said what i meant he knows weve noticed  long wondered again ah but i havent he spoke with some sharpness  he knows i continued noting the sharpness too whats the matter with him  then what the devil is it  i waited a little having for the moment an idea on my hands do you see him often  long disengaged the ash from his cigarette no why should i  distinctly he was uneasythough as yet perhaps but vaguelyat what i might be coming to that was precisely my idea and if i pitied him a little for my pressure my idea was yet what most possessed me do you mean theres nothing in him that strikes you  on this unmistakably he looked at me hard strikes mein that boy nothing in him that i know of ever struck me in my life hes not an object of the smallest interest to me  i felt that if i insisted i should really stir up the old long the stolid coxcomb capable of rudeness with whose redemption reabsorption supersessionone scarcely knew what to call iti had been so happily impressed oh of course if you havent noticed you havent and the matter i was going to speak of will have no point you wont know what i mean with which i paused long enough to let his curiosity operate if his denial had been sincere but it hadnt his curiosity never operated he only exclaimed more indulgently that he didnt know what i was talking about and i recognised after a little that if i had made him without intention uncomfortable this was exactly a proof of his being what mrs briss at the station had called cleverer and what i had so much remarked while in the garden before dinner he held our small company nobody nothing could in the time of his inanity have made him turn a hair it was the mark of his aggrandisement but i spared himso far as was consistent with my wish for absolute certainty changed the subject spoke of other things took pains to sound disconnectedly and only after reference to several of the other ladies the name over which we had just felt friction mrs brissendens quite fabulous  he appeared to have strayed in our interval far fabulous  why for the figure that by candlelight and in clothofsilver and diamonds she is still able to make  oh dear yes he showed as relieved to be able to see what i meant she has grown so very much less plain  but that wasnt at all what i meant ah i said you put it the other way at paddingtonwhich was much more the right one  he had quite forgotten how then did i put it  as he had done before i got rid of my ash she hasnt grown very much less plain she has only grown very much less old  ah well he laughed but as if his interest had quickly dropped youth iscomparatively speakingbeauty  oh not always look at poor briss himself  well if you like better beauty is youth  not always either i returned certainly only when it is beauty to see how little it may be either look i repeated at poor briss  i thought you told me just now not to he rose at last in his impatience  well at present you can  i also got up the other men at the same moment moved and the subject of our reference stood in view this indeed was but briefly for as if to examine a picture behind him the personage in question suddenly turned his back long however had had time to take him in and then to decide ive looked what then  you dont see anything  nothing  not what everyone else must  no confound you  i already felt that to be so tortuous he must have had a reason and the search for his reason was what from this moment drew me on i had in fact half guessed it as we stood there but this only made me the more explanatory it isnt really however that brissenden has grown less lovelyits only that he has grown less young  to which my friend as we quitted the room replied simply oh  the effect i have mentioned was none the less too absurd the poor youths back before us still as if consciously presented confessed to the burden of time how old i continued did we make out this afternoon that he would be  that who would  why poor briss  he fairly pulled up in our march have you got him on the brain  dont i seem to remember my dear man that it was you yourself who knew hes thirty at the most he cant possibly be more and there he is as fine as swaddled as royal a mummy to the eye as one would wish to see dont pretend but its all right i laughed as i took myself up i must talk to lady john  i did talk to her but i must come to it what is most to the point just here is an observation or two that in the smokingroom before going to bed i exchanged with ford obert i forbore as i have hinted to show all i saw but it was lawfully open to me to judge of what other people did and i had had before dinner my little proof that on occasion obert could see as much as most yet i said nothing more to him for the present about mrs server the brissendens were new to him and his experience of every sort of facial accident of human sign made him just the touchstone i wanted nothing naturally was easier than to turn him on the question of the fair and the foul type and character weal and woe among our fellowvisitors so that my mention of the air of disparity in the couple i have just named came in its order and produced its effect this effect was that of my seeingwhich was all i requiredthat if the disparity was marked for him this expert observer could yet read it quite the wrong way why had so fine a young creature married a man three times her age he was of course astounded when i told him the young creature was much nearer three times brissendens and this led to some interesting talk between us as to the consequences in general of such association on such terms the particular case before us i easily granted sinned by overemphasis but it was a fair though a gross illustration of what almost always occurred when twenty and forty when thirty and sixty mated or mingled lived together in intimacy intimacy of course had to be postulated then either the high number or the low always got the upper hand and it was usually the high that succeeded it seemed in other words more possible to go back than to keep still to grow young than to remain so if brissenden had been of his wifes age and his wife of brissendens it would thus be he who must have redescended the hill it would be she who would have been pushed over the brow there was really a touching truth in it the stuff ofwhat did people call such thingsan apologue or a parable one of the pair i said has to pay for the other what ensues is a miracle and miracles are expensive whats a greater one than to have your youth twice over its a second wind another gowhich isnt the sort of thing life mostly treats us to mrs briss had to get her new blood her extra allowance of time and bloom somewhere and from whom could she so conveniently extract them as from guy himself she has by an extraordinary feat of legerdemain extracted them and he on his side to supply her has had to tap the sacred fount but the sacred fount is like the greedy mans description of the turkey as an awkward dinner dish it may be sometimes too much for a single share but its not enough to go round  obert was at all events sufficiently struck with my view to throw out a question on it so that paying to his last drop mr briss as you call him can only die of the business  oh not yet i hope but before heryes long  he was much amused how you polish them off  i only talk i returned as you paint not a bit worse but one must indeed wonder i conceded how the poor wretches feel  you mean whether brissenden likes it  i made up my mind on the spot if he loves her he must that is if he loves her passionately sublimely i saw it all its in fact just because he does so love her that the miracle for her is wrought  well my friend reflected for taking a miracle coolly  she hasnt her equal yes she does take it she just quietly but just selfishly profits by it  and doesnt see then how her victim loses  no she cant the perception if she had it would be painful and terriblemight even be fatal to the process so she hasnt it she passes round it it takes all her flood of life to meet her own chance she has only a wonderful sense of success and wellbeing the other consciousness  is all for the other party  the author of the sacrifice  then how beautifully poor briss my companion said must have it  i had already assured myself he had gone to bed and my fancy followed him oh he has it so that though he goes in his passion about with her he dares scarcely show his face and i made a final induction the agents of the sacrifice are uncomfortable i gather when they suspect or fear that you see  my friend was charmed with my ingenuity how youve worked it out  well i feel as if i were on the way to something  he looked surprised something still more  something still more i had an impulse to tell him i scarce knew what but i kept it under i seem to snuff up  quoi donc  the sense of a discovery to be made  and of what  ill tell you tomorrow goodnight     iii   i did on the morrow several things but the first was not to redeem that vow it was to address myself straight to grace brissenden i must let you know that in spite of your guarantee it doesnt go at alloh but not at all ive tried lady john as you enjoined and i cant but feel that she leaves us very much where we were then as my listener seemed not quite to remember where we had been i came to her help you said yesterday at paddington to explain the change in gilbert longdont you recallthat that woman plying him with her genius and giving him of her best is clever enough for two shes not clever enough then it strikes me for threeor at any rate for four i confess i dont see it does she really dazzle you  my friend had caught up oh youve a standard of wit  no ive only a sense of realitya sense not at all satisfied by the theory of such an influence as lady johns  she wondered such a one as whose else then  ah thats for us still to find out of course this cant be easy for as the appearance is inevitably a kind of betrayal its in somebodys interest to conceal it  this mrs brissenden grasped oh you mean in the ladys  in the ladys most but also in longs own if hes really tender of the ladywhich is precisely what our theory posits  my companion once roused was all there i see you call the appearance a kind of betrayal because it points to the relation behind it  precisely  and the relationto do that sort of thingmust be necessarily so awfully intimate  intimissima  and kept therefore in the background exactly in that proportion  exactly in that proportion  very well then said mrs brissenden doesnt mr longs tenderness of lady john quite fall in with what i mentioned to you  i remembered what she had mentioned to me his making her come down with poor briss  nothing less  and is that all you go upon  that and lots more  i thought a minutebut i had been abundantly thinking i know what you mean by lots is brissenden in it  dear nopoor briss he wouldnt like that i saw the manoeuvre but guy didnt and you must have noticed how he stuck to her all last evening  how gilbert long stuck to lady john oh yes i noticed they were like lord lutley and mrs froome but is that what one can call being tender of her  my companion weighed it he must speak to her sometimes im glad you admit at any rate she continued that it does take what you so prettily call some womans secretly giving him of her best to account for him  oh that i admit with all my heartor at least with all my head only lady john has none of the signs  of being the beneficent woman what then are theythe signsto be so plain i was not yet quite ready to say however on which she added it proves nothing you know that you dont like her  no it would prove more if she didnt like me whichfatuous fool as you may find mei verily believe she does if she hated me it would be you see for my ruthless analysis of her secret she has no secret she would like awfully to haveand she would like almost as much to be believed to have last evening after dinner she could feel perhaps for a while that she was believed but it wont do theres nothing in it you asked me just now i pursued what the signs of such a secret would naturally be well bethink yourself a moment of what the secret itself must naturally be  oh she looked as if she knew all about that awfully charmingmustnt itto act upon a person through an affection so deeply  yesit can certainly be no vulgar flirtation i felt a little like a teacher encouraging an apt pupil but i could only go on with the lesson whoever she is she gives all she has she keeps nothing backnothing for herself  i seebecause he takes everything he just cleans her out she looked at mepleased at last really to understandwith the best conscience in the world who is the lady then  but i could answer as yet only by a question how can she possibly be a woman who gives absolutely nothing whatever who scrapes and saves and hoards who keeps every crumb for herself the whole shows thereto minister to lady johns vanity and advertise the businessbehind her smart shopwindow you can see it as much as you like and even amuse yourself with pricing it but she never parts with an article if poor long depended on her  well what she was really interested  why hed be the same poor long as ever he would go as he used to gonaked and unashamed no i wound up he dealsturned out as we now see himat another establishment  ill grant it said mrs brissenden if youll only name me the place  ah i could still but laugh and resume he doesnt screen lady johnshe doesnt screen herselfwith your husband or with anybody its she whos herself the screen and pleased as she is at being so clever and at being thought so she doesnt even know it she doesnt so much as suspect it shes an unmitigated fool about it of course mr longs clever because hes in love with me and sits at my feet and dont you see how clever i am dont you hear what good things i saywait a little im going to say another in about three minutes and how if youll only give him time too he comes out with them after me they dont perhaps sound so good but you see where he has got them im so brilliant in fine that the men who admire me have only to imitate me which you observe they strikingly do something like that is all her philosophy  my friend turned it over you do sound like her you know yet how if a womans stupid  can she have made a man clever she cant she cant at least have begun it what we shall know the real person by in the case that you and i are studying is that the man himself will have made her what she has become she will have done just what lady john has not doneshe will have put up the shutters and closed the shop she will have parted for her friend with her wit  so that she may be regarded as reduced to idiocy  wellso i can only see it  and that if we look therefore for the right idiot  we shall find the right womanour friends mystic egeria yes we shall be at least approaching the truth we shall burn as they say in hideandseek i of course kept to the point that the idiot would have to be the right one any idiot wouldnt be to the purpose if it was enough that a woman was a fool the search might become hopeless even in a house that would have passed but ill for a fools paradise we were on one of the shaded terraces to which here and there a tall window stood open the picture without was all morning and august and within all clear dimness and rich gleams we stopped once or twice raking the gloom for lights and it was at some such moment that mrs brissenden asked me if i then regarded gilbert long as now exalted to the position of the most brilliant of our companions the cleverest man of the partyit pulled me up a little hardly that perhapsfor dont you see the proofs im myself giving you but say he isi consideredthe cleverest but one the next moment i had seen what she meant in that case the thing were looking for ought logically to be the person of the opposite sex giving us the maximum sense of depletion for his benefit the biggest fool you suggest must consistently be the right one yes again it would so seem but thats not really you see the short cut it sounds the biggest fool is what we want but the question is to discover who is the biggest  im glad then i feel so safe mrs brissenden laughed  oh youre not the biggest i handsomely conceded besides as i say there must be the other evidencethe evidence of relations  we had gone on with this a few steps but my companion again checked me while her nod toward a window gave my attention a lead wont that as it happens then do we could just see from where we stood a corner of one of the rooms it was occupied by a seated couple a lady whose face was in sight and a gentleman whose identity was attested by his back a back somehow replete for us at the moment with a guilty significance there was the evidence of relations that we had suddenly caught long in the act of presenting his receptacle at the sacred fount seemed announced by the tone in which mrs brissenden named the other partymme de dreuil we looked at each other i was aware with some elation but our triumph was brief the comtesse de dreuil we quickly feltan american married to a frenchmanwasnt at all the thing she was almost as much all there as lady john she was only another screen and we perceived for that matter the next minute that lady john was also present another step had placed us within range of her the picture revealed in the rich dusk of the room was a group of three from that moment unanimously we gave up lady john and as we continued our stroll my friend brought out her despair then he has nothing but screens the need for so many does suggest a fire and in spite of discouragement she sounded interrogatively one after the other the names of those ladies the perfection of whose presence of mind might when considered pass as questionable we soon however felt our process to be practically a trifle invidious not one of the persons named could at any rateto do them all justiceaffect us as an intellectual ruin it was natural therefore for mrs brissenden to conclude with scepticism she may existand exist as you require her but what after all proves that shes here she maynt have come down with him does it necessarily follow that they always go about together  i was ready to declare that it necessarily followed i had my idea and i didnt see why i shouldnt bring it out its my belief that he no more goes away without her than you go away without poor briss  she surveyed me in splendid serenity but what have we in common  with the parties to an abandoned flirtation well youve in common your mutual attachment and the fact that youre thoroughly happy together  ah she goodhumouredly answered we dont flirt  well at all events you dont separate he doesnt really suffer you out of his sight and to circulate in the society you adorn you dont leave him at home  why shouldnt i she asked looking at me i thought just a trifle harder  it isnt a question of why you shouldntits a question of whether you do you dontdo you thats all  she thought it over as if for the first time it seems to me i often leave him when i dont want him  oh when you dont want himyes but when dont you want him you want him when you want to be right and you want to be right when you mix in a scene like this i mean i continued for my private amusement when you want to be happy happiness you know is to a lady in the full tide of social success even more becoming than a new french frock you have the advantage for your beauty of being admirably married you bloom in your husbands presence i dont say he need always be at your elbow i simply say that youre most completely yourself when hes not far off if there were nothing else there would be the help given you by your quiet confidence in his lawful passion  im bound to say mrs brissenden replied that such help is consistent with his not having spoken to me since we parted yesterday to come down here by different trains we havent so much as met since our arrival my finding him so indispensable is consistent with my not having so much as looked at him indispensable please for what  for your not being without him  what then do i do with him  i hesitatedthere were so many ways of putting it but i gave them all up ah i think it will be only he who can tell you my point is that youve the instinctplaying in you on either side with all the ease of experienceof what you are to each other all i mean is that its the instinct that long and his good friend must have they too perhaps havent spoken to each other but where he comes she does and where she comes he does thats why i know shes among us  its wonderful what you know mrs brissenden again laughed how can you think of them as enjoying the facilities of people in our situation  of people married and therefore logically in presence i dont i was able to reply speak of their facilities as the same and i recognise every limit to their freedom but i maintain none the less that so far as they can go they do go its a relation and they work the relation the relation exquisite surely of knowing they help each other to shine why are they not therefore like you and brissenden what i make out is that when they do shine one will findthough only after a hunt i admit as you seethey must both have been involved feeling their need and consummately expert they will have managed have arranged  she took it in with her present odd mixture of the receptive and the derisive arranged what  oh ask her  i would if i could find her after which for a moment my interlocutress again considered but i thought it was just your contention that she doesnt shine if its lady johns perfect repair that puts that sort of thing out of the question your image it seems to me breaks down  it did a little i saw but i gave it a tilt up not at all its a case of shining as brissenden shines i wondered if i might go furtherthen risked it by sacrifice  i perceived at once that i neednt fear her conscience was too goodshe was only amused sacrifice for mercys sake of what  wellfor mercys sakeof his time  his time she stared hasnt he all the time he wants  my dear lady i smiled he hasnt all the time you want  but she evidently had not a glimmering of what i meant dont i make things of an ease dont i make life of a charm for him  im afraid i laughed out thats perhaps exactly it its what gilbert long does for his victimmakes things makes life of an ease and a charm  she stopped yet again really wondering at me now then its the woman simply whos happiest  because brissendens the man who is precisely  on which for a minute without her going on we looked at each other do you really mean that if you only knew me as i am it would come to you in the same way to hunt for my confederate i mean if he werent made obvious you know by his being my husband  i turned this over if you were only in flirtationas you reminded me just now that youre not surely i declared i should arrive at him perfectly after all eliminations on the principle of looking for the greatest happiness  of the smallest number well he may be a small number she indulgently sighed but hes wholly content look at him now there she added the next moment and judge we had resumed our walk and turned the corner of the house a movement that brought us into view of a couple just round the angle of the terrace a couple who like ourselves must have paused in a sociable stroll the lady with her back to us leaned a little on the balustrade and looked at the gardens the gentleman close to her with the same support offered us the face of guy brissenden as recognisable at a distance as the numbered card of a turnthe black figure upon whiteat a musichall on seeing us he said a word to his companion who quickly jerked round then his wife exclaimed to meonly with more sharpnessas she had exclaimed at mme de dreuil by all thats lovelymay server i took it on the spot for a kind of eureka but without catching my friends idea i was only aware at first that this idea left me as unconvinced as when the other possibilities had passed before us wasnt it simply the result of this ladys being the only one we had happened not to eliminate she had not even occurred to us she was pretty enough perhaps for any magic but she hadnt the other signs i didnt believe somehowcertainly not on such short noticeeither in her happiness or in her flatness there was a vague suggestion of a sort in our having found her there with brissenden there would have been a pertinence to our curiosity or at least to mine in this juxtaposition of the two persons who paid as i had amused myself with calling it so heroically yet i had only to have it marked for me to see them that is side by side in order to feel how littleat any rate superficiallythe graceful natural charming woman ranged herself with the superannuated youth  she had said a word to him at sight of us in answer to his own and in a minute or two they had met us this had given me time for more than one reflection it had also given mrs brissenden time to insist to me on her identification which i could see she would be much less quick to drop than in the former cases we have her she murmured we have her its she it was by her insistence in fact that my thought was quickened it even felt a kind of chillan odd revulsionat the touch of her eagerness singular perhaps that only thenyet quite certainly thenthe curiosity to which i had so freely surrendered myself began to strike me as wanting in taste it was reflected in mrs brissenden quite by my fault and i cant say just what cause for shame after so much talk of our search and our scent i found in our awakened and confirmed keenness why in the world hadnt i found it before my scruple in short was a thing of the instant it was in a positive flash that the amusing question was stamped for me as none of my business one of the reflections i have just mentioned was that i had not had a happy hand in making it so completely mrs brissendens another was however that nothing fortunately that had happened between us really signified for what had so suddenly overtaken me was the consciousness of this anomaly that i was at the same time as disgusted as if i had exposed mrs server and absolutely convinced that i had yet not exposed her  while after the others had greeted us and we stood in vague talk i caught afresh the effect of their juxtaposition i grasped with a private joy that was quite extravagantas so beyond the needed markat the reassurance it offered this reassurance sprang straight from a special source brissendens secret was so aware of itself as to be always on the defensive shy and suspicious it was as much on the defensive at present as i had felt it to beso far as i was concernedthe night before what was there accordingly in mrs serverfrank and fragrant in the morning airto correspond to any such consciousness nothing whatevernot a symptom whatever secrets she might have had she had not that one she was not in the same box the sacred fount in her was not threatened with exhaustion we all soon reentered the house together but mrs brissenden during the few minutes that followed managed to possess herself of the subject of her denunciation she put me off with guy and i couldnt help feeling it as a sign of her concentration she warmed to the question just as i had thrown it over and i asked myself rather ruefully what on earth i had been thinking of i hadnt in the least had it in mind to compromise an individual but an individual would be compromised if i didnt now take care     iv   i have said that i did many things on this wonderful day but perhaps the simplest way to describe the rest of them is as a sustained attempt to avert that disaster i succeeded by vigilance in preventing my late companion from carrying mrs server off i had no wish to see her studiedby anyone but myself at leastin the light of my theory i felt by this time that i understood my theory but i was not obliged to believe that mrs brissenden did i am afraid i must frankly confess that i called deception to my aid to separate the two ladies i gave the more initiated a look in which i invited her to read volumes this look or rather the look she returned comes back to me as the first note of a tolerably tight tense little drama a little drama of which our remaining hours at newmarch were the all too ample stage she understood me as i meant that she had better leave me to get at the truthowing me some obligation as she did for so much of it as i had already communicated this step was of course a tacit pledge that she should have the rest from me later on i knew of some pictures in one of the rooms that had not been lighted the previous evening and i made these my pretext for the effect i desired i asked mrs server if she wouldnt come and see them with me admitting at the same time that i could scarce expect her to forgive me for my share in the invasion of the quiet corner in which poor briss had evidently managed so to interest her  oh yes she replied as we went our way he had managed to interest me isnt he curiously interesting but i hadnt she continued on my being too struck with her question for an immediate answeri hadnt managed to interest him of course you know why she laughed no one interests him but lady john and he could think of nothing while i kept him there but of how soon he could return to her  these remarksof which i give rather the sense than the form for they were a little scattered and troubled and i helped them out and pieced them togetherthese remarks had for me i was to find unexpected suggestions not all of which was i prepared on the spot to take up and is lady john interested in our friend  not i suppose given her situation so much as he would perhaps desire you dont know what her situation is she went on while i doubtless appeared to be sunk in innocence isnt it rather marked that theres only one person shes interested in  one person i was thoroughly at sea  but we had reached with it the great pictured saloon with which i had proposed to assist her to renew acquaintance and in which two visitors had anticipated us why here he is she exclaimed as we paused for admiration in the doorway the high frescoed ceiling arched over a floor so highly polished that it seemed to reflect the faded pastels set in rococo borders in the walls and constituting the distinction of the place our companions examining together one of the portraits and turning their backs were at the opposite end and one of them was gilbert long  i immediately named the other do you mean ford obert  she gave me with a laugh one of her beautiful looks yes  it was answer enough for the moment and the manner of it showed me to what legend she was committed i asked myself while the two men faced about to meet us why she was committed to it and i further considered that if grace brissenden against every appearance was right there would now be something for me to see which of the twothe agent or the object of the sacrificewould take most precautions i kept my companion purposely for a little while on our side of the room leaving the others interested in their observations to take their time to join us it gave me occasion to wonder if the question mightnt be cleared up on the spot there was no question i had compunctiously made up my mind for mrs server but now i should see the proof of that conclusion the proof of it would be between her and her imputed lover the absence of anything that was not perfectly natural mrs server with her eyes raised to the painted dome with response charmed almost to solemnity in her exquisite face struck me at this moment i had to concede as more than ever a person to have a lover imputed the place save for its pictures of later date a triumph of the florid decoration of two centuries ago evidently met her special taste and a kind of profane piety had dropped on her drizzling down in the cold light in silver in crystal in faint mixed delicacies of colour almost as on a pilgrim at a shrine i dont know what it was in hersave that is the positive pitch of delicacy in her beautythat made her so impressed and presented indescribably touching she was like an awestruck child she might have been herselfall greuze tints all pale pinks and blues and pearly whites and candid eyesan old dead pastel under glass  she was not too reduced to this state however not to take soon enough her own precautionif a precaution it was to be deemed i was acutely conscious that the naturalness to which i have just alluded would be for either party the only precaution worth speaking of we moved slowly round the room pausing here and there for curiosity during which time the two men remained where we had found them she had begun at last to watch them and had proposed that we should see in what they were so absorbed but i checked her in the movement raising my hand in a friendly admonition to wait we waited then face to face looking at each other as if to catch a strain of music this was what i had intended for it had just come to me that one of the voices was in the air and that it had imposed close attention the distinguished painter listened whileto all appearancegilbert long did in the presence of the picture the explaining ford obert moved after a little but not so as to interruptonly so as to show me his face in a recall of what had passed between us the night before in the smokingroom i turned my eyes from mrs servers i allowed myself to commune a little across the shining space with those of our fellowauditor the occasion had thus for a minute the oddest little air of an aesthetic lecture prompted by accidental but immense suggestions and delivered by gilbert long  i couldnt at the distance with my companion quite follow it but obert was clearly patient enough to betray that he was struck his impression was at any rate doubtless his share of surprise at longs gift of talk this was what his eyes indeed most seemed to throw over to mewhat an unexpected demon of a critic it was extraordinarily interestingi dont mean the special drift of longs eloquence which i couldnt as i say catch but the phenomenon of his of all people dealing in that article it put before me the question of whether in these strange relations that i believed i had thus got my glimpse of the action of the person sacrificed mightnt be quite out of proportion to the resources of that person it was as if these elements might really multiply in the transfer made of them as if the borrower practically found himselfor herselfin possession of a greater sum than the known property of the creditor the surrender in this way added by pure beauty to the thing surrendered we all know the french adage about that plus belle fille du monde who can give but what she has yet if mrs server for instance had been the heroine of this particular connection the communication of her intelligence to her friend would quite have falsified it she would have given much more than she had  when long had finished his demonstration and his charged voice had dropped we crossed to claim acquaintance with the work that had inspired him the place had not been completely new to mrs server any more than to myself and the impression now made on her was but the intenser vibration of a chord already stirred nevertheless i was struck with her saying as a result of more remembrance than i had attributed to her oh yesthe man with the mask in his hand on our joining the others i expressed regret at our having turned up too late for the ideas that on a theme so promising they would have been sure to produce and obert quite agreeing that we had lost a treat said frankly in reference to long but addressing himself more especially to mrs server hes perfectly amazing you knowhes perfectly amazing  i observed that as a consequence of this long looked neither at mrs server nor at obert he looked only at me and with quite a penetrable shade of shyness then again a strange thing happened a stranger thing even than my quick sense the previous afternoon at the station that he was a changed man it was as if he were still more changedhad altered as much since the evening before as during the so much longer interval of which i had originally to take account he had altered almost like grace brissendenhe looked fairly distinguished i said to myself that without his stature and certain signs in his dress i should probably not have placed him engrossed an instant with this view and with not losing touch of the uneasiness that i conceived i had fastened on him i became aware only after she had spoken that mrs server had gaily and gracefully asked of obert why in the world so clever a man should not have been clever obert i accordingly took upon myself to remark had evidently laboured under some extraordinary delusion he must literally have doubted if long was clever  fancy mrs server explained with a charming smile at long who still looking pleasantly competent and not too fatuous amiably returned it  theyre natural theyre natural i privately reflected that is hes natural to her but hes not so to me and as if seeing depths in this and to try it i appealed to him do my dear man let us have it again its the picture of all pictures that most needs an interpreter dont we want i asked of mrs server to know what it means the figure represented is a young man in blacka quaint tight black dress fashioned in years long past with a pale lean livid face and a stare from eyes without eyebrows like that of some whitened oldworld clown in his hand he holds an object that strikes the spectator at first simply as some obscure some ambiguous work of art but that on a second view becomes a representation of a human face modelled and coloured in wax in enamelled metal in some substance not human the object thus appears a complete mask such as might have been fantastically fitted and worn  yes what in the world does it mean mrs server replied one could call itthough that doesnt get one much furtherthe mask of death  why so i demanded while we all again looked at the picture isnt it much rather the mask of life its the mans own face thats death the other one blooming and beautiful  ah but with an awful grimace mrs server broke in  the other one blooming and beautiful i repeated is life and hes going to put it on unless indeed he has just taken it off  hes dreadful hes awfulthats what i mean said mrs server but what does mr long think  the artificial face on the other hand i went on as long now said nothing is extremely studied and when you carefully look at it charmingly pretty i dont see the grimace  i dont see anything else mrs server goodhumouredly insisted and what does mr obert think  he kept his eyes on her a moment before replying he thinks it looks like a lovely lady  that grinning mask what lovely lady  it does i declared to him really seeing what he meantit does look remarkably like mrs server  she laughed but forgivingly im immensely obliged you deserve she continued to me that i should say the gentlemans own face is the image of a certain other gentlemans  it isnt the image of yours obert said to me fitting the cap but its a funny thing that it should really recall to one some face among us here on this occasioni mean some face in our partythat i cant think of we had our eyes again on the ominous figure weve seen him yesterdayweve seen him already this morning obert oddly enough still couldnt catch it who the deuce is it  i know i returned after a momentour friends reference having again in a flash become illuminating but nothing would induce me to tell  if i were the flattered individual long observed speaking for the first time ive an idea that youd give me the benefit of the compliment therefore its probably not me  oh its not you in the least mrs server blandly took upon herself to observe this face is so bad  and mine is so good our companion laughed thank you for saving me  i watched them look at each other for there had been as yet between them no complete exchange yes they were natural i couldnt have made it out that they were not but there was something all the same that i wanted to know and i put it immediately to long why do you bring against me such an accusation  he met the questionsingularly enoughas if his readiness had suddenly deserted him i dont knowand he turned off to another picture  it left the three of us all the more confronted with the conundrum launched by obert and mrs servers curiosity remained do name she said to me the flattered individual  no its a responsibility i leave to obert  but he was clearly still at fault he was like a man desiring but unable to sneeze i see the fellowyet i dont never mind he turned away too hell come to me  the resemblance said long on this at a distance from us and not turning the resemblance which i shouldnt think would puzzle anyone is simply to poor briss  oh of courseand obert gave a jump round  ahi do see it mrs server conceded with her head on one side but as if speaking rather for harmony  i didnt believe she saw it but that only made her the more natural which was also the air she had on going to join long in his new contemplation after i had admitted that it was of brissenden i myself had thought obert and i remained together in the presence of the man with the mask and the others being out of earshot he reminded me that i had promised him the night before in the smokingroom to give him today the knowledge i had then withheld if i had announced that i was on the track of a discovery pray had i made it yet and what was it at any rate that i proposed to discover i felt now in truth more uncomfortable than i had expected in being kept to my obligation and i beat about the bush a little till instead of meeting it i was able to put the natural question what wonderful things was long just saying to you  oh characteristic ones enoughwhimsical fanciful funny the things he says you know  it was indeed a fresh view they strike you as characteristic  of the man himself and his type of mind surely dont you he talks to talk but hes really amusing  i was watching our companions indeed he isextraordinarily amusing it was highly interesting to me to hear at last of longs type of mind see how amusing he is at the present moment to mrs server  obert took this in she was convulsed in the extravagance always so pretty as to be pardonable with laughter and she even looked over at us as if to intimate with her shining lingering eyes that we wouldnt be surprised at her transports if we suspected what her entertainer whom she had never known for such a humourist was saying instead of going to find out all the same we remained another minute together it was for me now i could see that obert had his best attention whats the matter with them  it startled me almost as much as if he had asked me what was the matter with myselffor that something was under this head i was by this time unable to ignore not twenty minutes had elapsed since our meeting with mrs server on the terrace had determined grace brissendens elation but it was a fact that my nervousness had taken an extraordinary stride i had perhaps not till this instant been fully aware of itit was really brought out by the way obert looked at me as if he fancied he had heard me shake mrs server might be natural and gilbert long might be but i should not preserve that calm unless i pulled myself well together i made the effort facing my sharp interlocutor and i think it was at this point that i fully measured my dismay i had grownthat was what was the matter with meprecipitately preposterously anxious instead of dropping the discomfort produced in me by mrs brissenden had deepened to agitation and this in spite of the fact that in the brief interval nothing worse nothing but what was right had happened had i myself suddenly fallen so much in love with mrs server that the care for her reputation had become with me an obsession it was of no use saying i simply pitied her what did i pity her for if she wasnt in danger she was in danger that rushed over me at presentrushed over me while i tried to look easy and delayed to answer my friend she was in dangerif only because she had caught and held the searchlight of oberts attention i took up his inquiry the matter with them i dont know anything but that theyre young and handsome and happychildren as who should say of the world children of leisure and pleasure and privilege  oberts eyes went back to them do you remember what i said to you about her yesterday afternoon she darts from flower to flower but she clings for the time to each youve been feeling i judge the force of my remark  oh she didnt at all dart i replied just now at me i darted much rather at her  long didnt then obert said still with his eyes on them  i had to wait a moment do you mean he struck you as avoiding her  he in turn considered he struck me as having noticed with what intensity ever since we came down she has kept alighting she inaugurated it the instant she arrived with me and every man of us has had his turn i dare say its only fair certainly that long should have  hes lucky to get it the brute shes as charming as she can possibly be  thats it precisely and its what no woman ought to beas charming as she possibly canmore than once or twice in her life this lady is so every blessed minute and to every blessed male its as if she were too awfully afraid one wouldnt take it in if she but knew how one does however my friend continued youll recollect that we differed about her yesterdayand what does it signify one should of course bear lightly on anything so light but i stick to it that shes different  i pondered different from whom  different from herselfas she was when i painted her theres something the matter with her  ah then its for me to ask you what i dont myself you see perceive it  he made for a little no answer and we were both indeed by this time taken up with the withdrawal of the two other members of our group they moved away together across the shining floor pausing looking up at the painted vault saying the inevitable thingsbringing off their retreat in short in the best order it struck me somehow as a retreat and yet i insisted to myself once more on its being perfectly natural at the high door which stood open they stopped a moment and looked back at uslooked frankly sociably as if in consciousness of our sympathetic attention mrs server waved as in temporary farewell a free explanatory hand at me she seemed to explain that she was now trying somebody else obert moreover added his explanation thats the way she collars us  oh long doesnt mind i said but whats the way she strikes you as different  from what she was when she sat to me well a part of it is that she cant keep still she was as still then as if she had been paid for it now shes all over the place but he came back to something else i like your talking my dear man of what you dont perceive ive yet to find out what that remarkable quantity is what you do perceive has at all events given me so much to think about that it doubtless ought to serve me for the present i feel i ought to let you know that youve made me also perceive the brissendens i of course remembered what i had said to him but it was just this that now touched my uneasiness and i only echoed the name a little blankly with the instinct of gaining time you put me on them wonderfully obert continued though of course ive kept your idea to myself all the same it sheds a great light  i could again but feebly repeat it a great light  as to what may go on even between others still its a jolly ideaa torch in the darkness and do you know what ive done with it ive held it up i dont mind telling you to just the question of the change since this interests you in mrs server if youve got your mystery ill be hanged if i wont have mine if youve got your brissendens i shall see what i can do with her youve given me an analogy and i declare i find it dazzling i dont see the end of what may be done with it if brissendens paying for his wife for her amazing second bloom whos paying for mrs server isnt thatwhat do the newspapers call itthe missing word isnt it perhaps in fact just what you told me last night you were on the track of but dont add now he went on more and more amused with his divination dont add now that the mans obviously gilbert longfor i wont be put off with anything of the sort she collared him much too markedly the real man must be one she doesnt markedly collar  but i thought that what you a moment ago made out was that she so markedly collars all of us this was my immediate reply to oberts blaze of ingenuity but i none the less saw more things in it than i could reply to i saw at any rate and saw with relief that if he should look on the principle suggested to him by the case of the brissendens there would be no danger at all of his finding it if accordingly i was nervous for mrs server all i had to do was to keep him on this false scent since it was not she who was paid for but she who possibly paid his fancy might harmlessly divert him till the party should disperse at the same time in the midst of these reflections the question of the change in her which he was in so much better a position than i to measure couldnt help having for me its portent and the sense of that was no doubt in my next words what makes you think that what you speak of was what i had in my head  well the way simply that the shoe fits shes absolutely not the same person i painted its exactly like mrs brissendens having been for you yesterday not the same person you had last seen bearing her name  very good i returned though i didnt in the least mean to set you digging so hard however dig on your side by all means while i dig on mine all i ask of you is complete discretion  ah naturally  we ought to remember i pursued even at the risk of showing as too sententious that success in such an inquiry may perhaps be more embarrassing than failure to nose about for a relation that a lady has her reasons for keeping secret  is made not only quite inoffensive i holdhe immediately took me upbut positively honourable by being confined to psychologic evidence  i wondered a little honourable to whom  why to the investigator resting on the kind of signs that the game takes account of when fairly playedresting on psychologic signs alone its a high application of intelligence whats ignoble is the detective and the keyhole  i see i after a moment admitted i did have last night my scruples but you warm me up yet i confess also i still added that if i do muster the courage of my curiosity its a little because i feel even yet as i think you also must altogether destitute of a material clue if i had a material clue i should feel ashamed the fact would be deterrent i start for my part at any rate quite in the darkor in a darkness lighted at best by what you have called the torch of my analogy the analogy too i wound up may very well be only half a help it was easy to find poor briss because poor briss is here and its always easy moreover to find a husband but say mrs servers poor brissor his equivalent whoever it may beisnt here  we had begun to walk away with this but my companion pulled up at the door of the room im sure he is she tells me hes near  tells you i challenged it but i uncomfortably reflected that it was just what i had myself told mrs brissenden  she wouldnt be as she is if he werent her being as she is is the sign of it he wasnt presentthat is he wasnt present in her life at allwhen i painted her and the difference were impressed with is exactly the proof that he is now  my difficulty in profiting by the relief he had so unconsciously afforded me resided of course in my not feeling free to show for quite as impressed as he was i hadnt really made out at all what he was impressed with and i should only have spoiled everything by inviting him to be definite this was a little of a worry for i should have liked to know but on the other hand i felt my track at present effectually covered well then grant hes one of us there are more than a dozen of usa dozen even with you and me and brissenden counted out the hitch is that were nowhere without a primary lead as to brissenden there was the lead  you mean as afforded by his wifes bloated state which was a signal  precisely for the search for something or other that would help to explain it given his wifes bloated state his own shrunken one was what was to have been predicated i knew definitely in other words what to look for  whereas we dont know here  mrs servers state unfortunately i replied is not bloated  he laughed at my unfortunately though recognising that i spoke merely from the point of view of lucidity and presently remarked that he had his own idea he didnt say what it was and i didnt ask intimating thereby that i held it to be in this manner we were playing the game but i indulgently questioned it in the light of its not yet having assisted him he answered that the minutes we had just passed were what had made the difference it had sprung from the strong effect produced on him after she came in with me its but now i really see her she did and said nothing special nothing striking or extraordinary but that didnt matterit never does one saw how she is shes nothing but that  nothing but what  shes all in it he insisted or its all in her it comes to the same thing  of course its all in her i said as impatiently as i could though his attestationfor i wholly trusted his perceptionleft me so much in his debt thats what we start with isnt it it leaves us as far as ever from what we must arrive at  but he was too interested in his idea to heed my question he was wrapped in the psychologic glow i have her  ah but its a question of having him  he looked at me on this as if i had brought him back to a mere detail and after an instant the light went out of his face so it is i leave it to you i dont care his drop had the usual suddenness of the drops of the artistic temperament look for the last man he nevertheless but with more detachment added i daresay it would be he  the last in what sense the last  well the last sort of creature who could be believed of her  oh i rejoined as we went on the great bar to that is that such a sort of creature as the last wont be here  he hesitated so much the better i give him at any rate wherever he is up to you  thank you i returned for the beauty of the present you do see then that our psychologic glow doesnt after all prevent the thing  from being none of ones business yes poor little woman he seemed somehow satisfied he threw it all up it isnt any of ones business is it  why thats what i was telling you i impatiently exclaimed that i feel     v   the first thing that happened to me after parting with him was to find myself again engaged with mrs brissenden still full of the quick conviction with which i had left her it is shequite unmistakably you know i dont see how i can have been so stupid as not to make it out i havent your cleverness of course till my nose is rubbed into a thing but when it is she celebrated her humility in a laugh that was proud the two are off together  off where  i dont know where but i saw them a few minutes ago most distinctly slope theyve gone for a quiet unwatched hour poor dears out into the park or the gardens when one knows it its all there but whats that vulgar songyouve got to know it first it strikes me if you dont mind my telling you so that the way you get hold of things is positively uncanny i mean as regards what first marked her for you  but my dear lady i protested nothing at all first marked her for me she isnt marked for me first or last it was only you who so jumped at her  my interlocutress stared and i had at this moment i remember an almost intolerable sense of her fatuity and cruelty they were all unconscious but they were at that stage none the less irritating her fine bosom heaved her blue eyes expanded with her successful her simplified egotism i couldnt in short i found bear her being so keen about mrs server while she was so stupid about poor briss she seemed to recall to me nobly the fact that she hadnt a lover no she was only eating poor briss up inch by inch but she hadnt a lover i dont i insisted see in mrs server any of the right signs  she looked almost indignant even after your telling me that you see in lady john only the wrong ones  ah but there are other women here than mrs server and lady john  certainly but didnt we a moment ago think of them all and dismiss them if lady johns out of the question how can mrs server possibly not be in it we want a fool  ah do we i interruptingly wailed  why exactly by your own theory in which youve so much interested me it was you who struck off the idea  that we want a fool i felt myself turning gloomy enough do we really want anyone at all  she gave me in momentary silence a strange smile ah you want to take it back now youre sorry you spoke my dear man you may be but that didnt hinder the fact in short that i had kindled near me a fine if modest and timid intelligence there did remain the truth of our friends striking development to which i had called her attention regretting my rashness didnt make the prodigy less youll lead me to believe if you back out that theres suddenly someone you want to protect weak man she exclaimed with an assurance from which i confess i was to take alarm something has happened to you since we separated weak man she repeated with dreadful gaiety youve been squared  i literally blushed for her squared  does it inconveniently happen that you find youre in love with her yourself  well i replied on quick reflection do if you like call it that for you see what a motive it gives me for being in such a matter as this wonderful one that you and i happened to find ourselves for a moment making so free with absolutely sure about her i am absolutely sure there she wont do and for your postulate that shes at the present moment in some sequestered spot in longs company suffer me without delay to correct it it wont hold water if youll go into the library through which i have just passed youll find her there in the company of the comte de dreuil  mrs briss stared again already she was at any rate with mr long and she told me on my meeting them that they had just come from the pastels  exactly they met thereshe and i having gone together and they retired together under my eyes they must have parted clearly the moment after  she took it all in turned it all over then what does that prove but that theyre afraid to be seen  ah theyre not afraid since both you and i saw them  oh only just long enough for them to publish themselves as not avoiding each other all the same you know she said they do  do avoid each other how is your belief in that i asked consistent with your belief that they parade together in the park  they ignore each other in public they foregather in private  ah but they dontsince as i tell you shes even while we talk the centre of the mystic circle of the twaddle of m de dreuil chained to a stake if you can be besides i wound up its not only that shes not the right foolits simply that shes not a fool at all we want the woman who has been rendered most inane but this lady hasnt been rendered so in any degree shes the reverse of inane shes in full possession  in full possession of what  why of herself  like lady john  i had unfortunately to discriminate here no not like lady john  like whom then  like anyone like me like you like brissenden dont i satisfy you i asked in a moment  she only looked at me a little handsome and hard if you wished to satisfy me so easily you shouldnt have made such a point of working me up i daresay i after all however she added notice more things than you  as for instance  well may server last evening i was not quite conscious at the time that i did but when one has had the tip one looks back and sees things in a new light  it was doubtless because my friend irritated me more and more that i met this with a sharpness possibly excessive shes perfectly natural what i saw was a test and so is he  but she gave me no heed if there hadnt been so many people i should have noticed of myself after dinner that there was something the matter with her i should have seen what it was she was all over the place  she expressed it as the poor ladys other critic had done but this didnt shut my mouth ah then in spite of the people you did notice what do you mean by all over the place  she couldnt keep still she was different from the woman one had last seen she used to be so calmas if she were always sitting for her portrait wasnt she in fact always being painted in a pink frock and one row of pearls always staring out at you in exhibitions as if she were saying here they are again last night she was on the rush  the rush oh  yes positivelyfrom one man to another she was on the pounce she talked to ten in succession making up to them in the most extraordinary way and leaving them still more crazily shes as nervous as a cat put it to any man here and see if he doesnt tell you  i should think it quite unpleasant to put it to any man here i returned and i should have been sure you would have thought it the same i spoke to you in the deepest confidence  mrs brissendens look at me was for a moment of the least accommodating then it changed to an intelligent smile how you are protecting her but dont cry out she added before youre hurt since your confidence has distinguished methough i dont quite see whyyou may be sure i havent breathed so i all the more resent your making me a scene on the extraordinary ground that ive observed as well as yourself perhaps what you dont like is that my observation may be turned on you i confess it is  it was difficult to bear being put in the wrong by her but i made an effort that i believe was not unsuccessful to recover my good humour its not in the least to your observation that i object its to the extravagant inferences you draw from it of course however i admit i always want to protect the innocent what does she gain on your theory by her rushing and pouncing had she pounced on brissenden when we met him with her are you so very sure he hadnt pounced on her they had at all events to me quite the air of people settled she was not it was clear at that moment meditating a change it was we if you remember who had absolutely to pull them apart  is it your idea to make out mrs brissenden inquired in answer to this that she has suddenly had the happy thought of a passion for my husband  a new possibility as she spoke came to me with a whirr of wings and i half expressed it she may have a sympathy  my interlocutress gazed at space you mean she may be sorry for him on what ground  i had gone too far indeed but i got off as i could you neglect him so but what is she at any rate i went on nervousas nervous as you describe herabout  about her danger the contingency of its being fixed upon theman intimacy so thoroughgoing that they can scarcely afford to let it be seen even as a mere acquaintance think of the circumstancesher personal ones i mean and admit that it wouldnt do it would be too bad a case theres everything to make it so they must live on pins and needles anything proved would go tremendously hard for her  in spite of which youre surprised that i protect her  it was a question however that my companion could meet from people in general no from me in particular yes  in justice to mrs brissenden i thought a moment well then let us be fair all round that you dont as you say breathe is a discretion i appreciate all the more that a little inquiry tactfully pursued would enable you to judge whether any independent suspicion does attach a little loose collateral evidence might be picked up and your scorning to handle it is no more than i should after all have expected of you  thank you for after all my companion tossed her head i know for myself what i scorn to handle quite apart from that theres another matter you must have noticed yourself that when people are so much liked  theres a kind of general amiable consensus of blindness yesone can think of cases popularity shelters and hallowshas the effect of making a goodnatured world agree not to see  my friend seemed pleased that i so sufficiently understood this evidently has been a case then in which it has not only agreed not to see but agreed not even to look it has agreed in fact to look straight the other way they say theres no smoke without fire but it appears there may be fire without smoke im satisfied at all events that one wouldnt in connection with these two find the least little puff isnt that just what makes the magnificence of their successthe success that reduces us to playing over them with mere moonshine she thought of it seemed fairly to envy it ive never seen such luck  a rare case of the beauty of impunity as impunity i laughed such a case puts a price on passions otherwise to be deprecated im glad indeed you admit were reduced we are reduced but what i meant to say just now was that if youll continue to join in the genial conspiracy while i do the sameeach of us making an exception only for the otherill pledge myself absolutely to the straight course if before we separate ive seen reason to change my mind ill loyally let you know  what good will that do me she asked if you dont change your mind you wont change it if you shut your eyes to her  ah i feel i cant do that now i am interested the proof of that is i pursued that i appeal to you for another impression of your own i still dont see the logic of her general importunity  the logic is simply that she has a terror of appearing to encourage anyone in particular  why then isnt it in her own interest for the sake of the screen just to do that the appearance of someone in particular would be exactly the opposite of the appearance of long your own admission is that thats his line with lady john  mrs brissenden took her view oh she doesnt want to do anything so like the real thing and as for what he does they dont feel in the same way hes not nervous  then why does he go in for a screen  i meanshe readily modified itthat hes not so nervous as may he hasnt the same reasons for panic a man never has besides theres not so much in mr long to show  what by my notion has taken place why not if it was precisely by the change in him that my notion was inspired any change in her i know comparatively little about  we hovered so near the case of mr and mrs brissenden that it positively excited me and all the more for her sustained unconsciousness oh the mans not aware of his own change he doesnt see it as we do its all to his advantage  but we see it to his advantage how should that prevent  we see it to the advantage of his mind and his talk but not to that of  well what i pressed as she pulled up  she was thinking how to name such mysteries his delicacy his consideration his thought for her he would think for her if he werent selfish but he is selfishtoo much so to spare her to be generous to realise its only after all she sagely went on feeding me again as i winced to feel with profundity of my own sort its only an excessive case a case that in him happens to show as what the doctors call fine of what goes on whenever two persons are so much mixed up one of them always gets more out of it than the other one of themyou know the sayinggives the lips the other gives the cheek  its the deepest of all truths yet the cheek profits too i more prudently argued  it profits most it takes and keeps and uses all the lips give the cheek accordingly she continued to point out is mr longs the lips are what we began by looking for weve found them theyre drainedtheyre dry the lips mr long finds his improvement natural and beautiful he revels in it he takes it for granted hes sublime  it kept me for a minute staring at her sodo you knoware you  she received this wholly as a tribute to her acuteness and was therefore proportionately gracious thats only because its catching youve made me sublime you found me dense youve affected me quite as mrs server has affected mr long i dont pretend i show it she added quite as much as he does  because that would entail my showing it as much as by your contention she does well i confess i declared i do feel remarkably like that pair of lips i feel drainedi feel dry her answer to this with another toss of her head was extravagant enough to mean forgivenesswas that i was impertinent and her action in support of her charge was to move away from me taking her course again to the terrace easily accessible from the room in which we had been talking she passed out of the window that opened to the ground and i watched her while in the brighter light she put up her pink parasol she walked a few paces as if to look about her for a change of company and by this time had reached a flight of steps that descended to a lower level on observing that here in the act to go down she suddenly paused i knew she had been checked by something seen below and that this was what made her turn the next moment to give me a look i took it as an invitation to rejoin her and i perceived when i had done so what had led her to appeal to me we commanded from the point in question one of the shady slopes of the park and in particular a spreading beech the trunk of which had been inclosed with a rustic circular bench a convenience that appeared to have offered for the moment a sense of leafy luxury to a lady in pale blue she leaned back her figure presented in profile and her head a little averted as if for talk with some one on the other side of her someone so placed as to be lost to our view  there triumphed mrs brissenden againfor the lady was unmistakably mrs server amusement was inevitablethe fact showed her as so correctly described by the words to which i had twice had to listen she seemed really all over the place i thought you said my companion remarked that you had left her tucked away somewhere with m de dreuil  well i returned after consideration that is obviously m de dreuil  are you so sure i dont make out the person my friend continuedi only see shes not alone i understood you moreover that you had lately left them in the house  they were in the house but there was nothing to keep them from coming out theyve had plenty of time while weve talked they must have passed down by some of the other steps perhaps also i added its another man  but by this time she was satisfied its he  gilbert long i thought you just said i observed that you can make nobody out  we watched together but the distance was considerable and the second figure continued to be screened it must be he mrs brissenden resumed with impatience since it was with him i so distinctly saw her  let me once more hold you to the fact i answered that she had to my knowledge succumbed to m de dreuil afterwards the moments have fled you see in our fascinating discussion and various things on your theory of her pounce have come and gone dont i moreover make out a brown shoe in a white gaiter protruding from the other side of her dress it must be lord lutley  mrs brissenden looked and mused a brown shoe in a white gaiter at this moment mrs server moved and the nextas if it were time for another pounceshe had got up we could however still distinguish but a shoulder and an outstretched leg of her gentleman who on her movement appeared as in protest to have affirmed by an emphatic shift of his seat his preference for their remaining as they were this carried him further round the tree we thus lost him but she stood there while we waited evidently exhorting him after a minute of which she came away as in confidence that he would follow during this process with a face more visible she had looked as charming as a pretty woman almost always does in rising eloquent before the apathetic male she hadnt yet noticed us but something in her attitude and manner particularly spoke to me there were implications in it to which i couldnt be blind and i felt how my neighbour also would have caught them and been confirmed in her certitude in fact i felt the breath of her confirmation in another elated therein a look at her now incontestably while not yet aware of us mrs server confessed with every turn of her head to a part in a relation it stuck out of her her part in a relation it hung before us her part in a relation it was large to us beyond the breadth of the glade and since off her guard she so let us have it with whom in the world could the relationso much of one as thatbe but with gilbert long the question was not settled till she had come on some distance then the producer of our tension emerging and coming after her offered himself to our united to our confounded anxiety once more as poor briss  that we should have been confounded was doubtless but a proof of the impressionthe singular assurance of intimacy borne toward us on the soft summer airthat we had however delusively received i should myself have been as ready as my neighbour to say whoever he is theyre in deepand on grounds moreover quite as recklessly as fantastically constructive as hers there was nothing to explain our impression but the fact of our already having seen them figure together and of this we needed breathingtime to give them the natural benefit it was not indeed as an absolute benefit for either that grace brissendens tone marked our recognition dear guy againbut she had recovered herself enough to laugh i should have thought he had had more than his turn she had recovered herself in fact much more than i for somehow from this instant convinced as she had been and turning everything to her conviction i found myself dealing in thought with still larger material it was odd what a difference was made for me by the renewed sight of dear guy i didnt of course analyse this sense at the time that was still to come our friends meanwhile had noticed us and something clearly passed between themit almost produced for an instant a visible arrest in their advanceon the question of their having perhaps been for some time exposed  they came on however and i waved them from afar a greeting to which mrs server alone replied distances were great at newmarch and landscapegardening on the grand scale it would take them still some minutes to reach our place of vantage or to arrive within sound of speech there was accordingly nothing marked in our turning away and strolling back to the house we had been so intent that we confessed by this movement to a quick impulse to disown it yet it was remarkable that before we went in mrs brissenden should have struck me afresh as having got all she wanted her recovery from our surprise was already so complete that her high lucidity now alone reigned you dont require i suppose anything more than that  well i dont quite see im bound to say just where even that comes in it incommoded me singularly little at the point to which i had jumped that this statement was the exact reverse of the truth where it came in was what i happened to be in the very act of seeingseeing to the exclusion of almost everything else it was sufficient that i might perhaps feel myself to have done at last with mrs brissenden i desired at all events quite as if this benefit were assured me to leave her the honours of the last word  she was finely enough prepared to take them why this invention of using my husband she fairly gasped at having to explain  of using him  trailing him across the scent as she does all of you one after the other excuse my comparing you to so many red herrings you each have your turn only his seems repeated poor dear till hes quite worn out with it  i kept for a little this image in my eye i can see of course that his whole situation must be something of a strain for him for ive not forgotten what you told me yesterday of his service with lady john to have to work in such a way for two of them at onceit couldnt help i admitted being a tax on a fellow besides when one came to think of it the same man couldnt be two red herrings to show as mrs servers would directly impair his power to show as lady johns it would seem in short a matter for his patronesses to have out together  mrs brissenden betrayed on this some annoyance at my levity oh the cases are not the same for with lady john it amuses him he thinks he knows  knows what  what she wants him for he doesnt knowshe kept it wonderfully clearthat she really doesnt want him for anything for anything except of coursethis came as a droll second thoughthimself  and he doesnt know eitheri tried to remain at her levelthat mrs server does  no she assented he doesnt know what its her idea to do with him  he doesnt know in fine i cheerfully pursued the truth about anything and of course by your agreement with me hes not to learn it  she recognised her agreement with me yet looked as if she had reserved a certain measure of freedom then she handsomely gave up even that i certainly dont want him to become conscious  its his unconsciousness i declared that saves him  yes even from himself  we must accordingly feed it in the house with intention we parted company but there was something that before this i felt it due to my claim of consistency to bring out it wasnt at all events gilbert long behind the tree  my triumph however beneath the sponge she was prepared to pass again over much of our experience was shortlived of course it wasnt we shouldnt have been treated to the scene if it had been what could she possibly have put poor briss there for but just to show it wasnt     vi   i saw other things many things after this but i had already so much matter for reflection that i saw them almost in spite of myself the difficulty with me was in the momentum already acquired by the actas well as doubtless by the general habitof observation i remember indeed that on separating from mrs brissenden i took a lively resolve to get rid of my ridiculous obsession it was absurd to have consented to such immersion intellectually speaking in the affairs of other people one had always affairs of ones own and i was positively neglecting mine such for a while was my foremost reflection after which in their order or out of it came an inevitable train of others one of the first of these was that frankly my affairs were by this time pretty well used to my neglect there were connections enough in which it had never failed a whole cluster of such connections effectually displacing the centre of interest now surrounded me and i wasthough always but intellectuallydrawn into their circle i did my best for the rest of the day to turn my back on them but with the prompt result of feeling that i meddled with them almost more in thinking them over in isolation than in hovering personally about them reflection was the real intensity reflection as to poor mrs server in particular was an indiscreet opening of doors she became vivid in the light of the so limited vision of her that i already possessedtry positively as i would not further to extend it it was something not to ask another question to keep constantly away both from mrs brissenden and from ford obert whom i had rashly invited to a degree of participation it was something to talk as hard as possible with other persons and on other subjects to mingle in groups much more superficial than they supposed themselves to give ear to broader jokes to discuss more tangible mysteries  the day as it developed was large and hot an unstinted splendour of summer excursions exercise organised amusement were things admirably spared us life became a mere arrested ramble or stimulated lounge and we profited to the full by the noble freedom of newmarch that overarching ease which in nothing was so marked as in the tolerance of talk the air of the place itself in such conditions left ones powers with a sense of play if one wanted something to play at one simply played at being there i did this myself with the aid in especial of two or three solitary strolls unaccompanied dips of half an hour apiece into outlying parts of the house and the grounds i must add that while i resorted to such measures not to see i only fixed what i had seen what i did see the more in my mind one of these things had been the way that at luncheon gilbert long watching the chance given him by the loose order in which we moved to it slipped to the visible defeat of somebody else into the chair of conspicuity beside clever lady john a second was that mrs server then occupied a place as remote as possible from this couple but not from guy brissenden who had found means to seat himself next her while my notice was engaged by the others what i was at the same time supremely struck with could doubtless only be mrs servers bright ubiquity as it had at last come to seem to me and that of the companions she had recruited for the occasion attended constantly by a different gentleman she was in the range of my vision wherever i turnedshe kept repeating her picture in settings separated by such intervals that i wondered at the celerity with which she proceeded from spot to spot she was never discernibly out of breath though the associate of her ecstasy at the given moment might have been taken as being and i kept getting afresh the impression which the day before had so promptly followed my arrival the odd impression as of something the matter with each party that i had gathered in the grounds from the sight of her advance upon me with obert i had by this time of course made outand it was absurd to shut my eyes to itwhat that particular something at least was it was that obert had quickly perceived something to be the matter with her and that she on her side had become aware of his discovery  i wondered hereupon if the discovery were inevitable for each gentleman in succession and if this were their reason for changing so often did everyone leave her like obert with an uneasy impression of her and were these impressions now passed about with private hilarity or profundity though without having reached me save from the source i have named i affected myself as constantly catching her eye as if she wished to call my attention to the fact of who was with her and who was not i had kept my distance since our episode with the pastels and yet nothing could more come home to me than that i had really not since then been absent from her we met without talk but not thanks to these pointed looks without contact i daresay that for that matter my cogitationsfor i must have bristled with themwould have made me as stiff a puzzle to interpretative minds as i had suffered other phenomena to become to my own i daresay i wandered with a telltale restlessness of which the practical detachment might well have mystified those who hadnt suspicions whenever i caught mrs servers eye it was really to wonder how many suspicions she had i came upon her in great dim chambers and i came upon her before sweeps of view i came upon her once more with the comte de dreuil with lord lutley with ford obert with almost every other man in the house and with several of these as if there had not been enough for so many turns two or three times over only at no moment whatever the favouring frame did i come upon her with gilbert long it was of course an anomaly that as an easy accident i was not again myself set in the favouring frame that i consistently escaped being might indeed have been the meaning most marked in our mute recognitions  discretion then i finally felt played an odd part when it simply left one more attached morally to ones prey what was most evident to me by five oclock in the afternoon was that i was too preoccupied not to find it the best wisdom to accept my mood it was all very well to run away there would be no effectual running away but to have my things quickly packed and catch if possible a train for town on the spot i had to be on it and it began to dawn before me that there was something quite other i possibly might do with mrs server than endeavour ineffectually to forget her what was none of ones business might change its name should importunity take the form of utility in resisted observation that was vivid thought in inevitable thought that was vivid observation through a succession in short of phases in which i shall not pretend to distinguish one of these elements from the other i found myself cherishing the fruit of the seed dropped equally by ford obert and by mrs briss what was the matter with meso much as that i had ended by asking myself and the answer had come as an unmistakable return of the anxiety produced in me by my first seeing that i had fairly let grace brissenden loose my original protest against the flash of inspiration in which she had fixed responsibility on mrs server had been in fact i now saw but the scared presentiment of something in store for myself this scare to express it sharply had verily not left me from that moment and if i had been already then anxious it was because i had felt myself foredoomed to be sure the poor lady herself would be why i should have minded this should have been anxious at her anxiety and scared at her scare was a question troubling me too little on the spot for me to suffer it to trouble me as a painter of my state in this place it is sufficient that when so much of the afternoon had waned as to bring signs of the service of tea in the open air i knew how far i was gone in pity for her for i had at last had to take in what my two interlocutors had given me their impression coinciding and as one might say disinterested couldnt after a little fail in some degree to impose itself it had its value mrs server was nervous  it little mattered to me now that mrs briss had put it to methat i had even whimsically put it to myselfthat i was perhaps in love with her that was as good a name as another for an interest springing up in an hour and was moreover a decent working hypothesis the sentiment had not indeed asserted itself at first sight though it might have taken its place remarkably well among the phenomena of what is known as second the real fact was none the less that i was quite too sorry for her to be anything except sorry this odd feeling was something that i may as well say i shall not even now attempt to account forpartly it is true because my recital of the rest of what i was to see in no small measure does so it was a force that i at this stage simply found i had already succumbed to if it was not the result of what i had granted to myself was the matter with her then it was rather the very cause of my making that concession it was a different thing from my first prompt impulse to shield her i had already shielded herfought for her so far as i could or as the case immediately required my own sense of how i was affected had practically cleared up in short in the presence of this deeper vision of her my divinations and inductions had finally brought home to me that in the whole huge brilliant crowded place i was the only person save one who was in anything that could be called a relation to her the other persons relation was concealed and mine so far as she herself was concerned was unexpressedso that i suppose what most at the juncture in question stirred within me was the wonder of how i might successfully express it i felt that so long as i didnt express it i should be haunted with the idea of something infinitely touching and tragic in her lonelinesspossibly in her torment in her terror if she was nervous to the tune i had come to recognise it could only be because she had grounds and what might her grounds more naturally be than that arranged and arrayed disguised and decorated pursuing in vain through our careless company her search for the right shade of apparent security she felt herself none the less all the while the restless victim of fear and failure  once my imagination had seen her in this light the touches it could add to the picture might be trusted to be telling further observation was to convince me of their truth but while i waited for it with my apprehension that it would come in spite of me i easily multiplied and lavished them i made out above all what she would most be trying to hide it was not so to speak the guarded primary factit could only be wretched woman that produced that disastrous treacherous consequence of the fact which her faculties would exhibit and most of all the snapped cord of her faculty of talk guy brissenden had at the worst his compromised face and figure to show and to shroudif he were really that is as much aware of them as one had suspected she had her whole compromised machinery of thought and speech and if these signs were not like his external that made her case but the harder for she had to create with intelligence rapidly ebbing with wit half gone the illusion of an unimpaired estate she was like some unhappy lady robbed of her best jewelsobliged so to dispose and distribute the minor trinkets that had escaped as still to give the impression of a rich écrin was not that embarrassment if one analysed a little at the bottom of her having been all day in the vulgar phrase and as the three of us had too cruelly noted all over the place was indeed for that matter this observation confined to us or had it at last been irrepressibly determined on the part of the company at large this was a question i hasten to add that i would not now for the world have put to the test i felt i should have known how to escape had any rumour of wonder at mrs servers ways been finally conveyed to me i might from this moment have as much as i liked my own sense of it but i was definitely conscious of a sort of loyalty to her that would have rendered me blank before others though not indeed thatoh at last quite the contraryit would have forbidden me to watch and watch i positively dreaded the accident of my being asked by one of the men if i knew how everyone was talking about her if everyone was talking about her i wanted positively not to know but nobody was probablythey scarcely could be as yet without suggestive collateral evidence there would be nobody in the house so conscientiously infernal as mrs brissenden obert and i  newmarch had always in our time carried itself as the great asylum of the finer wit more or less expressly giving out that as invoking hospitality or other countenance none of the stupid none even of the votaries of the grossly obvious need apply but i could luckily at present reflect that its measurements in this direction had not always been my own and that moreover whatever precision they possessed human blandness even in such happy halls had not been quite abolished there was a sound law in virtue of which one could alwaysalike in privileged and unprivileged circlesrest more on peoples density than on their penetrability wasnt it their density too that would be practically nearest their good nature whatever her successive partners of a moment might have noticed they wouldnt have discovered in her reason for dropping them quickly a principle of fear that they might notice her failure articulately to keep up my own actual vision which had developed with such affluence was that in a given case she could keep up but for a few minutes and was therefore obliged to bring the contact to an end before exposure i had consistently mastered her predicament she had at once to cultivate contacts so that people shouldnt guess her real concentration and to make them a literal touch and go so that they shouldnt suspect the enfeeblement of her mind it was obviously still worth everything to her that she was so charming i had theorised with mrs brissenden on her supposititious inanity but the explanation of such cynicism in either of us could only be a sensibility to the truth that attractions so great might float her even a long time after intelligence pure and simple should have collapsed  was not my present uneasiness none the less a private curiosity to ascertain just how much or how little of that element she had saved from the wreck she dodged doubled managed broke off clutching occasions yet doubtless risking dumbnesses vaguenesses and other betrayals depending on attitudes motions expressions a material personality in fine in which a plain woman would have found nothing but failure and peace therefore might rule the scene on every hypothesis but that of her getting to put it crudely worse how i remember saying to myself that if she didnt get better she surely must get worsebeing aware that i referred on the one side to her occult surrender and on the other to its awful penalty it became present to me that she possibly might recover if anything should happen that would pull her up turn her into some other channel if however that consideration didnt detain me longer the fact may stand as a sign of how little i believed in any check gilbert long might die but not the intensity he had inspired the analogy with the situation of the brissendens here i further considered broke down i at any rate rather positively welcomed the view that the sacrificed party to that union might really find the arrest of his decline if not the renewal of his youth in the loss of his wife would this lady indeed as an effect of his death begin to wrinkle and shrivel it would sound brutal to say that this was what i should have preferred to hold were it not that i in fact felt forced to recognise the slightness of such a chance she would have loved his youth and have made it her own in death as in life and he would have quitted the world in truth only the more effectually to leave it to her mrs servers quandarywhich was now all i cared forwas exactly in her own certitude of every absence of issue but i need give little more evidence of how it had set me thinking  as much as anything else perhaps it was the fear of what one of the men might say to me that made me for an hour or two at this crisis continuously shy nobody doubtless would have said anything worse than that she was more of a flirt than ever that they had all compared notes and would accordingly be interested in some hint of another possibly a deeper experience it would have been almost as embarrassing to have to tell them how little experience i had had in fact as to have had to tell them how much i had had in fancyall the more that i had as yet only my thin idea of the line of feeling in her that had led her so to spare me tea on the terraces represented meanwhile among us so much neglect of everything else that my meditations remained for some time as unobserved as i could desire i was not moreover heeding much where they carried me and became aware of what i owed them only on at last finding myself anticipated as the occupant of an arbour into which i had strolled then i saw i had reached a remote part of the great gardens and that for some of my friends also secluded thought had inducements though it was not i hasten to add that either of the pair i here encountered appeared to be striking out in any very original direction lady john and guy brissenden in the arbour were thinking secludedly together they were together that is because they were scarce a foot apart and they were thinking i inferred because they were doing nothing else silence by every symptom had definitely settled on them and whatever it was i interrupted had no resemblance to talk nothingin the general air of evidencehad more struck me than that what lady johns famous intellect seemed to draw most from brissendens presence was the liberty to rest yet it shook off this languor as soon as she saw me it threw itself straight into the field it went i could see through all the motions required of it by her ladyships fallacious philosophy i could mark these emotions and what determined them as behind clear glass  i found on my side a rare intellectual joy the oddest secret exultation in feeling her begin instantly to play the part i had attributed to her in the irreducible drama she broke out in a manner that could only have had for its purpose to represent to me that mere weak amiability had committed her to such a predicament it was to humour her friends husband that she had strayed so far for she was somehow sorry for him andgood creature as we all knew herhad on principle a kind little way of her own with silly infatuations his was silly but it was unmistakable and she had for some time been finding it in short a case for a special tact that he bored her to death i might have gathered by the way they sat there and she could trust me to believecouldnt shethat she was only musing as to how she might most humanely get rid of him she would lead him safely back to the fold if i would give her time she seemed to ask it all oddly of me to take me remarkably into her confidence to refer me for a specimen of his behaviour to his signal abandonment of his wife the day before his having waited over to come down for the train in which poor she was to travel it was at all events i felt one of the consequences of having caught on to so much that i by this time found myself catching on to everything i read into lady johns wonderful mannerwhich quite clamoured moreover for an interpretationall that was implied in the lesson i had extracted from other portions of the business it was distinctly poor she who gave me the lead and it was not less definite that she put it to me that i should render her a service either by remaining with them or by inventing something that would lure her persecutor away she desired him even at the cost of her being left alone distracted from his pursuit  poor he in his quarter i hasten to add contributed to my picking out this embroidery nothing more helpful than a sustained detachment he said as little as possible seemed heedless of what was otherwise said and only gave me on his own account a look or two of dim suggestiveness yet it was these looks that most told with me and what they for their part conveyed was a plea that directly contradicted lady johns i understood him that it was he who was bored he who had been pursued he for whom perversity had become a dreadful menace he in fine who pleaded for my intervention he was so willing to trust me to relieve him of his companion that i think he would simply have bolted without deferring to me if i had not taken my precautions against it i had as it happened another momentary use for him than this i wished on the one hand not to lose him and on the other not to lose lady john though i had quickly enough guessed this brilliant womans real preference of which it in fact soon became my lively wish to see the proof the union of these two was too artificial for me not already to have connected with it the service it might render in her ladyships view to that undetected cultivation on her part of a sentiment for gilbert long which through his feigned response to it fitted so completely to the other pieces in my collection to see all this was at the time i remember to be as inhumanly amused as if one had found one could create something i had created nothing but a clue or two to the larger comprehension i still needed yet i positively found myself overtaken by a mild artistic glow what had occurred was that for my full demonstration i needed long and that by the same stroke i became sure i should certainly get him by temporising a little  lady john was in love with him and had kicked up to save her credit the dust of a fictive relation with another manthe relation one of mere artifice and the man one in her encouragement of whom nobody would believe yet she was also discoverably divided between her prudence and her vanity for if it was difficult to make poor briss figure at all vividly as an insistent satellite the thankless tact she had to employ gave her exactly she argued the right to be refreshingly fanned with an occasional flap of the flag under which she had as she ridiculously fancied truly conquered if she was where i found her because her escort had dragged her there she had made the best of it through the hope of assistance from another quarter she had held out on the possibility that mr longwhom one could without absurdity sit in an arbour withmight have had some happy divination of her plight he had had such divinations beforethanks to a condition in him that made sensibility abnormaland the least a wretched woman could do when betrayed by the excess of natures bounty was to play admirer against admirer and be talked about on her own terms she would just this once have admitted it i was to gather to be an occasion for pleading guiltyoh so harmlesslyto a consciousness of the gentleman mutely named between us well the proof i just alluded to was that i had not sat with my friends five minutes before gilbert long turned up  i saw in a moment how neatly my being there with them played his game i became in this fashion a witness for him that he could almost as little leave lady john alone aswell as other people could it may perfectly have been the pleasure of this reflection that again made him free and gayproduced in him in any case a different shade of manner from that with which before luncheon as the consequence perhaps of a vague flair for my possible penetration i had suspected him of edging away from me not since my encounter with him at paddington the afternoon before had i had so to recognise him as the transfigured talker to see lady john with him was to have little enough doubt of her recognitions just as this spectacle also dotted each i in my conviction of his veniali can only call it thatduplicity i made up my mind on the spot that it had been no part of his plan to practise on her and that the worst he could have been accused of was a goodnatured acceptance more apparent than real for his own purposes of her theorywhich she from time to time let peep outthat they would have liked each other better if they hadnt been each alas so good he profited by the happy accident of having pleased a person so much in evidence and indeed it was tolerably clear to me that neither party was duped lady john didnt want a lover this would have been as people say a larger order than given the other complications of her existence she could meet but she wanted in a high degree the appearance of carrying on a passion that imposed alike fearless realisations and conscious renouncements and this circumstance fully fell in with the convenience and the special situation of her friend her vanity rejoiced so far as she dared to let it nibble and the mysteries she practised the dissimulations she elaborated the general danger of detection in which she flattered herself that she publicly walked were after all so much grist to the mill of that appetite  by just so much however as it could never come up between them that there was another woman in gilberts history by just so much would it on the other hand have been an articulate axiom that as many of the poor brisses of the world as she might care to accommodate would be welcome to figure in her own this personage under that deeper induction i suddenly became aware that i also greatly pitiedpitied almost as much as i pitied mrs server and my pity had doubtless something to do with the fact that after i had proposed to him that we should adjourn together and we had on his prompt even though slightly dry response placed the invidious arbour at a certain distance i passed my hand into his arm there were things i wanted of him and the first was that he should let me show him i could be kind to him i had made of the circumstance of tea at the house a pretext for our leaving the others each of whom i felt as rather showily calling my attention to their good old ground for not wishing to rejoin the crowd as to what brissenden wished i had made up my mind i had made up my mind as to the subject of his thoughts while they wandered during his detention from lady john and if the next of my wishes was to enter into his desire i had decided on giving it effect by the time we reached the shortest of the vistas at the end of which the house reared a brave front     vii   i stayed him there while i put it to him that he would probably in fact prefer to go back  youre not going then yourself  no i dont particularly want tea and i may as well now confess to you that im taking a lonely unsociable walk i dont enjoy such occasions as these i said unless i from time to time get off by myself somewhere long enough to tell myself how much i do enjoy them thats what i was cultivating solitude for when i happened just now to come upon you when i found you there with lady john there was nothing for me but to make the best of it but im glad of this chance to assure you that every appearance to the contrary notwithstanding i wasnt prowling about in search of you  well my companion frankly replied im glad you turned up i wasnt especially amusing myself  oh i think i know how little  he fixed me a moment with his pathetic old face and i knew more than ever that i was sorry for him i was quite extraordinarily sorry and i wondered whether i mightnt without offence or indiscretion really let him see it it was to this end i had held him and wanted a little to keep him and i was reassured as i felt him though i had now released him linger instead of leaving me i had made him uneasy last night and a new reason or two for my doing so had possibly even since then come up yet these things also would depend on the way he might take them the look with which he at present faced me seemed to hint that he would take them as i hoped and there was no curtness but on the contrary the dawn of a dim sense that i might possibly aid him in the tone with which he came halfway you know  ah i laughed i know everything  he didnt laugh i hadnt seen him laugh at newmarch once he was continuously portentously grave and i at present remembered how the effect of this had told for me at luncheon contrasted as it was with that of mrs servers desperate exquisite levity you know i decidedly have too much of that dreadful old woman  there was a sound in the question that would have made me to my own sense start though i as quickly hoped i had not done so to brissendens i couldnt have persuaded myself however that i had escaped showing him the flush of my effort to show nothing i had taken his disgusted allusion as to mrs brissenden and the action of that was upsetting but nothing fortunately was psychologically more interesting than to grasp the next moment the truth of his reference it was only the fact of his himself looking so much older than lady john that had blinded me for an instant to the propriety of his not thinking of her as young she wasnt young as he had a right to call people and i felt a glowalso i feared too visibleas soon as i had seen whom he meant his meaning lady john did me somehow so much good that i believed it would have done me still more to hear him call her a harridan or a jezebel it was none of my business how little was anything when it came to that my businessyet indefinably unutterably i felt assuaged for him and comforted i verily believe it hung in the balance a minute or two that in my impulse to draw him out so that i might give him my sympathy i was prepared to risk overturning the edifice of my precautions i luckily as it happened did nothing of the sort i contrived to breathe consolingly on his secret without betraying an intention there was almost no one in the place save two or three of the very youngest women whom he wouldnt have had a right to call old lady john was a hag then mrs server herself was more than on the turn gilbert long was fat and forty and i cast about for some light in which i could show that ià plus forte raisonwas a pantaloon of course you cant quite see the fun of it and it really isnt fair to you you struck me as much more in your element i ventured to add when this morning more than once i chanced to observe you led captive by mrs server  oh thats a different affair he answered with an accent that promised a growth of confidence  mrs servers an old woman i continued but she cant seem to a fellow like you as old as lady john she has at any rate more charm though perhaps not i added quite so much talk  on this he said an extraordinary thing which all but made me start again oh she hasnt any talk  i took as quickly as possible refuge in a surprised demurrer not any  none to speak of  i let all my wonder come but wasnt she chattering to you at luncheon it forced him to meet my eyes at greater length and i could already see that my experimentfor insidiously and pardonably such i wished to make itwas on the way to succeed i had been right then and i knew where i stood he couldnt have been drawn on his wife and he couldnt have been drawn in the least directly on himself but as he could thus easily be on lady john so likewise he could on other women or on the particular one at least who mattered to me i felt i really knew what i was about for to draw him on mrs server was in truth to draw him indirectly on himself it was indeed perhaps because i had by this time in a measure expressed in terms however general the interest with which he inspired me that i now found myself free to shift the ground of my indiscretion i only wanted him to know that on the question of mrs server i was prepared to go as far with him as he should care to move how it came to me now that he was the absolutely safe person in the house to talk of her with i was too far away from you to hear i had gone on and i could only judge of her flow of conversation from the animated expression of her face it was extraordinarily animated but that i admit i added strikes one always as a sort of parti pris with her shes never not extraordinarily animated  she has no flow of conversation whatever said guy brissenden  i considered really  he seemed to look at me quite without uneasiness now why havent you seen for yourself  how the case stands with her on that head do you mean havent i talked with her well scarcely for its a fact that every man in the house but i strikes me as having been deluged with that privilege if indeed i laughed her absence of topics suffers it to be either a privilege or a deluge she affects me in any case as determined to have nothing to do with me she walks all the rest of you about she gives you each your turn me only she skips she systematically ignores im half consoled for it however i wound up by seeing what short innings any individual of you has you personally strike me as having had the longest  brissenden appeared to wonder where i was coming out yet not as if he feared it there was even a particular place if i could but guess it where he would have liked me to come oh shes extremely charming but of course shes strikingly odd  oddreally  why in the sense i mean that i thought you suggested youve noticed  that of extravagant vivacity oh ive had to notice it at a distance without knowing what it represents  he just hesitated you havent any idea at all what it represents  how should i have i smiled when she never comes near me ive thought that as i tell you marked what does her avoidance of me represent has she happened with you to throw any light on it  i think said brissenden after another moment that shes rather afraid of you  i could only be surprised the most harmless man in the house  are you really he askedand there was a touch of the comic in hearing him put it with his inveterate gravity  if you take me for anything else i replied i doubt if youll find anyone to back you  my companion on this looked away for a little turned about fixed his eyes on the house seemed as with a drop of interest on the point of leaving me but instead of leaving me he brought out the next moment i dont want anyone to back me i dont care i didnt mean just now he continued that mrs server has said to me anything against you or that she fears you because she dislikes you she only told me she thought you disliked her  it gave me a kind of shock a creature so beautiful and soso  so what he asked as i found myself checked by my desire to come to her aid  well so brilliantly happy  i had all his attention again is that what she is  then dont you with your opportunities know i was conscious of rather an inspiration a part of which was to be jocose what are you trying i laughed to get out of me  it struck me luckily that though he remained as proof against gaiety as ever he was thanks to his preoccupation not disagreeably affected by my tone of course if youve no idea i can get nothing  no idea of what  then it was that i at last got it straight well of whats the matter with her  is there anything particular if there is i went on theres something that ive got out of you  how so if you dont know what it is  do you mean if you yourself dont but without detaining him on this of what in especial do the signs i asked consist  well of everyones thinking sothat theres something or other  this again struck me but it struck me too much oh everyones a fool  he saw in his queer wan way how it had done so then you have your own idea  i daresay my smile at him while i waited showed a discomfort do you mean people are talking about her  but he waited himself havent they shown you  no no one has spoken moreover i wouldnt have let them  then there you are brissenden exclaimed if youve kept them off it must be because you differ with them  i shant be sure of that i returned till i know what they think however i repeat i added that i shouldnt even then care i dont mind admitting that she much interests me  there you are there you are he said again  thats all thats the matter with her so far as im concerned you see at any rate how little it need make her afraid of me shes lovely and shes gentle and shes happy  my friend kept his eyes on me what is there to interest you so in that isnt it a description that applies here to a dozen other women you cant say you know that youre interested in them for you just spoke of them as so many fools  there was a certain surprise for me in so much acuteness which however doubtless admonished me as to the need of presence of mind i wasnt thinking of the ladiesi was thinking of the men  thats amiable to me he said with his gentle gloom  oh my dear brissenden i except you  and why should you  i felt a trifle pushed ill tell you some other time and among the ladies i except mrs brissenden with whom as you may have noticed ive been having much talk  and will you tell me some other time about that too on which as i but amicably shook my head for no he had his first dimness of pleasantry ill get it then from my wife  never she wont tell you  she has passed you her word that wont alter the fact that she tells me everything  he really said it in a way that made me take refuge for an instant in looking at my watch are you going back to tea if you are ill in spite of my desire to roam walk twenty steps with you i had already again put my hand into his arm and we strolled for a little till i threw off that i was sure mrs server was waiting for him to this he replied that if i wished to get rid of him he was as willing to take that as anything else for grantedan observation that i on my side answered with an inquiry though an inquiry that had nothing to do with it do you also tell everything to mrs brissenden  it brought him up shorter than i had expected do you ask me that in order that i shant speak to her of this  i showed myself at a loss of this  why of what weve made out  about mrs server you and i you must act as to that my dear fellow quite on your own discretion all the more that what on earth have we made out i assure you i havent a secret to confide to you about her except that ive never seen a person more unquenchably radiant  he almost jumped at it well thats just it  but just what  why what theyre all talking about that she is so awfully radiant that shes so tremendously happy its the question he explained of what in the world she has to make her so  i winced a little but tried not to show it my dear man how do i know  she thinks you know he after a moment answered  i could only stare mrs server thinks i know what makes her happy i the more easily represented such a conviction as monstrous in that it truly had its surprise for me  but brissenden now was all with his own thought she isnt happy  you mean that thats whats the matter with her under her appearance then what makes the appearance so extraordinary  why exactly what i mentionthat one doesnt see anything whatever in her to correspond to it  i hesitated do you mean in her circumstances  yesor in her character her circumstances are nothing wonderful she has none too much money she has had three children and lost them and nobody that belongs to her appears ever to have been particularly nice to her  i turned it over how you do get on with her  do you call it getting on with her to be the more bewildered the more i see her  isnt to say youre bewildered only on the whole to say youre charmed that alwaysdoesnt itdescribes more or less any engrossed relation with a lovely lady  well im not sure im so charmed he spoke as if he had thought this particular question over for himself he had his way of being lucid without brightness im not at all easily charmed you know he the next moment added and im not a fellow who goes about much after women  ah that i never supposed why in the world should you its the last thing i laughed but isnt thisquite what shall one call it innocentlyrather a peculiar case  my question produced in him a little gesture of elationa gesture emphasised by a snap of his forefinger and thumb i knew you knew it was special i knew youve been thinking about it  you certainly i replied with assurance have during the last five minutes made me do so with some sharpness i dont pretend that i dont now recognise that there must be something the matter i only desirenot unnaturallythat there should be to put me in the right for having thought if as youre so sure such a freedom as that can be brought home to me if mrs server is beautiful and gentle and strange i speciously went on what are those things but an attraction  i saw how he had them whatever they were before him as he slowly shook his head theyre not an attraction theyre too queer  i caught in an instant my way to fall in with him and not the less that i by this time felt myself committed up to the intellectual eyes to ascertaining just how queer the person under discussion might be oh of course im not speaking of her as a party to a silly flirtation or an object of any sort of trivial pursuit but there are so many different ways of being taken  for a fellow like you but not for a fellow like me for me theres only one  to be you mean in love  he put it a little differently well to be thoroughly pleased  ah thats doubtless the best way and the firm ground and you mean youre not thoroughly pleased with mrs server  noand yet i want to be kind to her therefore whats the matter  oh if its whats the matter with you you ask me that extends the question if you want to be kind to her you get on with her as we were saying quite enough for my argument and isnt the matter also after all i demanded that you simply feel she desires you to be kind  she does that and he looked at me as with the sense of drawing from me for his relief some greater help than i was as yet conscious of the courage to offer it is that she desires me she likes it and the extraordinary thing is that i like it  and why in the world shouldnt you  because she terrifies me she has something to hide  but my dear man i asked with a gaiety singularly out of relation to the small secret thrill produced in me by these wordsmy dear man what woman whos worth anything hasnt  yes but there are different ways what she tries for is this false appearance of happiness  i weighed it but isnt that the best thing  its terrible to have to keep it up  ah but if you dont for her if it all comes on herself  it doesnt guy brissenden presently said i dofor herhelp to keep it up and then still unexpectedly to me came out the rest of his confession i want toi try to thats what i mean by being kind to her and by the gratitude with which she takes it one feels that one doesnt want her to break down  it was on thisfrom the poignant touch in itthat i at last felt i had burnt my ships and didnt care how much i showed i was with him oh but she wont you must keep her going  he stood a little with a thumb in each pocket of his trousers and his melancholy eyes ranging far over my headover the tops of the highest trees who am i to keep people going  why youre just the man arent you happy  he still ranged the treetops yes  well then you belong to the useful class youve the wherewithal to give its the happy people who should help the others  he had in the same attitude another pause its easy for you to talk  because im not happy  it made him bring his eyes again down to me i think youre a little so now at my expense  i shook my head reassuringly it doesnt cost you anything ifas i confess to it nowi do to some extent understand  thats more then thanafter talking of it this way with youi feel that i do  he had brought that out with a sudden sigh turning away to go on so that we took a few steps more youve nothing to trouble about i then freely remarked but that you are as kind as the case requires and that you do help i daresay that youll find her even now on the terrace looking out for you i patted his back as we went a little further but as i still preferred to stay away from the house i presently stopped again dont fall below your chance noblesse oblige well pull her through  you say we he returned but you do keep out of it  why should you wish me to interfere with you i asked i wouldnt keep out of it if she wanted me as much as she wants you that by your own admission is exactly what she doesnt  well then said brissenden ill make her go for you i think i want your assistance quite as much as she can want mine  oh i protested for this ive really given you already every ounce of mine i can squeeze out and you know for yourself far more than i do  no i dontwith which he became quite sharp for you know how you know itwhich ive not a notion of its just what i think he continued facing me again you ought to tell me  im a little in doubt of what youre talking of but i suppose you to allude to the oddity of my being so much interested without my having been more informed  youve got some clue brissenden said and a clue is what i myself want  then get it i laughed from mrs server  he wondered does she know  i had still after all to dodge a little know what  why that youve found out what she has to hide  youre perfectly free to ask her i wonder even that you havent done so yet  well he said with the finest stroke of unconsciousness he had yet shown mewell i suppose its because im afraid of her  but not too much afraid i risked suggesting to be hoping at this moment that youll find her if you go back to where most of our party is gathered youre not going for teayoure going for mrs server just of whom it was as i say you were thinking while you sat there with lady john so what is it you so greatly fear  it was as if i could see through his dim face a sort of gratitude for my making all this out to him i dont know that its anything that she may do to me he could make it out in a manner for himself its as if something might happen to her its what i told youthat she may break down if you ask me how or in what he continued how can i tell you in whatever it is that shes trying to do i dont understand it then he wound up with a sigh that in spite of its softness he imperfectly stifled but its something or other  what would it be then i asked but what you speak of as what ive found out the effort you distinguish in her is the effort of concealmentvain as i gather it strikes you both so far as i in my supernatural acuteness am concerned  following this with the final ease to which my encouragement directly ministered he yet gave me before he had quite arrived a queer sidelong glance wouldnt it really be better if you were to tell me i dont ask her myself you see i dont put things to her in that way  oh noive shown you how i do see thats a part of your admirable consideration but i must repeat that nothing would induce me to tell you  his poor old face fairly pleaded but i want so to know  ah there it is i almost triumphantly laughed  there what is  why everything what ive divined between you and mrs server as the tie your wanting so to know  i felt as if he were now intellectually speaking plastic wax in my hand and her wanting me not to  wanting me not to i smiled  he puzzled it out and being willing therefore  that youyou only for sympathy for fellowship for the wild wonder of itshould know well for all those things and in spite of what you call your fear try her with which now at last i quitted him     viii   im afraid i cant quite say what after that i at first did nor just how i immediately profited by our separation i felt absurdly excited though this indeed was what i had felt all day there had been in fact deepening degrees of it ever since my first mystic throb after finding myself the day before in our railwaycarriage shut up to an hours contemplation and collation as it were of gilbert long and mrs brissenden i have noted how my first full contact with the changed state of these associates had caused the knell of the tranquil mind audibly to ring for me i have spoken of my sharpened perception that something altogether out of the common had happened independently to each and i could now certainly flatter myself that i hadnt missed a feature of the road i had thus been beguiled to travel it was a road that had carried me far and verily at this hour i felt far i daresay that for a while after leaving poor briss after what i may indeed call launching him this was what i predominantly felt to be where i was to whatever else it might lead treated me by its help to the taste of success it appeared then that the more things i fitted together the larger sense every way they madea remark in which i found an extraordinary elation it justified my indiscreet curiosity it crowned my underhand process with beauty the beauty perhaps was only for methe beauty of having been right it made at all events an element in which while the long day softly dropped i wandered and drifted and securely floated this element bore me bravely up and my private triumph struck me as all one with the charm of the moment and of the place  there was a general shade in all the lower reachesa fine clear dusk in garden and grove a thin suffusion of twilight out of which the greater things the high treetops and pinnacles the long crests of motionless wood and chimnied roof rose into golden air the last calls of birds sounded extraordinarily loud they were like the timed serious splashes in wide still water of divers not expecting to rise again i scarce know what odd consciousness i had of roaming at close of day in the grounds of some castle of enchantment i had positively encountered nothing to compare with this since the days of fairytales and of the childish imagination of the impossible then i used to circle round enchanted castles for then i moved in a world in which the strange came true it was the coming true that was the proof of the enchantment which moreover was naturally never so great as when such coming was to such a degree and by the most romantic stroke of all the fruit of ones own wizardry i was positivelyso had the wheel revolvedproud of my work i had thought it all out and to have thought it was wonderfully to have brought it yet i recall how i even then knew on the spot that there was something supreme i should have failed to bring unless i had happened suddenly to become aware of the very presence of the haunting principle as it were of my thought this was the light in which mrs server walking alone now apparently in the grey wood and pausing at sight of me showed herself in her clear dress at the end of a vista it was exactly as if she had been there by the operation of my intelligence or even by thatin a still happier wayof my feeling my excitement as i have called it on seeing her was assuredly emotion yet what was this feeling reallyof which at the point we had thus reached i seemed to myself to have gathered from all things an invitation to render some account  well i knew within the minute that i was moved by it as by an extraordinary tenderness so that this is the name i must leave it to make the best of it had already been my impression that i was sorry for her but it was marked for me now that i was sorrier than i had reckoned all her story seemed at once to look at me out of the fact of her present lonely prowl i met it without demur only wanting her to know that if i struck her as waylaying her in the wood as waiting for her there at eventide with an idea i shouldnt in the least defend myself from the charge i can scarce clearly tell how many fine strange things i thought of during this brief crisis of her hesitation i wanted in the first place to make it end and while i moved a few steps toward her i felt almost as noiseless and guarded as if i were trapping a bird or stalking a fawn my few steps brought me to a spot where another perspective crossed our own so that they made together a verdurous circle with an evening sky above and great lengthening arching recesses in which the twilight thickened oh it was quite sufficiently the castle of enchantment and when i noticed four old stone seats massive and mossy and symmetrically placed i recognised not only the influence in my adventure of the grand style but the familiar identity of this consecrated nook which was so much of the type of all the bemused and remembered we were in a beautiful old picture we were in a beautiful old tale and it wouldnt be the fault of newmarch if some other green carrefour not far off didnt balance with this one and offer the alternative of niches in the greenness occupied by weatherstained statues on florid pedestals  i sat straight down on the nearest of our benches for this struck me as the best way to express the conception with which the sight of mrs server filled me it showed her that if i watched her i also waited for her and that i was therefore not affected in any manner she really need deprecate she had been too far off for me to distinguish her face but her approach had faltered long enough to let me see that if she had not taken it as too late she would to escape me have found some pretext for turning off it was just my seating myself that made the differenceit was my being so simple with her that brought her on she came slowly and a little wearily down the vista and her sad shy advance with the massed wood on either side of her was like the reminiscence of a picture or the refrain of a ballad what made the difference with meif any difference had remained to be madewas the sense of this sharp cessation of her public extravagance she had folded up her manner in her flounced parasol which she seemed to drag after her as a sorry soldier his musket it was present to me without a pang that this was the person i had sent poor briss off to findthe person poor briss would owe me so few thanks for his failure to have found it was equally marked to me that however detached and casual she might at the first sight of me have wished to show herself it was to alight on poor briss that she had come out it was because he had not been at the house and might therefore on his side be wandering that she had taken care to be unaccompanied my demonstration was complete from the moment i thus had them in the act of seeking each other and i was so pleased at having gathered them in that i cared little what else they had missed i neither moved nor spoke till she had come quite near me and as she also gave no sound the meaning of our silence seemed to stare straight out it absolutely phrased there in all the wonderful conditions a relation already established but the strange and beautiful thing was that as soon as we had recognised and accepted it this relation put us almost at our ease you must be weary of walking i said at last and you see ive been keeping a seat for you  i had finally got up as a sign of welcome but i had directly afterwards resumed my position and it was an illustration of the terms on which we met that we neither of us seemed to mind her being meanwhile on her feet she stood before me as if to take inwith her smile that had by this time sunk quite to dimnessmore than we should either of us after all be likely to be able to say i even saw from this moment i think that whatever she might understand she would be able herself to say but little she gave herself in that minute more than she doubtless knewgave herself i mean to my intenser apprehension she went through the form of expression but what told me everything was the way the form of expression broke down her lovely grimace the light of the previous hours was as blurred as a bit of brushwork in watercolour spoiled by the upsetting of the artists glass she fixed me with it as she had fixed during the day forty persons but it fluttered like a bird with a broken wing she looked about and above down each of our dusky avenues and up at our gilded treetops and our painted sky where at the moment the passage of a flight of rooks made a clamour she appeared to wish to produce some explanation of her solitude but i was quickly enough sure that she would never find a presentable one i only wanted to show her how little i required it i like a lonely walk i went on at the end of a day full of people its always to me on such occasions quite as if something has happened that the mind wants to catch and fix before the vividness fades so i mope by myself an houri take stock of my impressions but theres one thing i dont believe you know this is the very first time in such a place and at such an hour that it has ever befallen me to come across a friend stricken with the same perversity and engaged in the same pursuit most people dont you seei kept it up as i coulddont in the least know what has happened to them and dont care to know thats one way and i dont deny it may be practically the best but if one does care to know thats another way as soon as i saw you there at the end of the alley i said to myself with quite a little thrill of elation ah then its her way too i wonder if youll let me tell you i floundered pleasantly on that i immediately liked you the better for it it seemed to bring us more together thats what i sat straight down here to show you yes i wished you to understand me as frankly saying i am as well as you on the mope or on the muse or on whatever you call it and this isnt half a bad corner for such a mood i cant tell you what a pleasure it is to me to see you do understand  i kept it up as i say to reassure and soothe and steady her there was nothing however fantastic and born of the pressure of the moment that i wouldnt have risked for that purpose she was absolutely on my hands with her secreti felt that from the way she stood and listened to me silently showing herself relieved and pacified it was marked that if i had hitherto seen her as all over the place she had yet nowhere seemed to me less so than at this furthermost point but if though only nearer to her secret and still not in possession i felt as justified as i have already described myself so it equally came to me that i was quite near enough at the pass we had reached for what i should have to take from it all she was on my handsit was she herself poor creature who was this was the thing that just now loomed large and the secret was a comparative detail i think youre very kind she said for all answer to the speech i have reported and the minute after this she had sunk down in confessed collapse to my bench on which she sat and stared before her the mere mechanism of her expression the dangling paper lantern itself was now all that was left in her face she remained a little as if discouraged by the sight of the weariness that her surrender had let out i hesitated from just this fear of adding to it to commiserate her for it more directly and she spoke again before i had found anything to say she brought back her attention indeed as if with an effort and from a distance what is it that has happened to you  oh i laughed what is it that has happened to you my question had not been in the least intended for pressure but it made her turn and look at me and this i quickly recognised was all the answer the most pitiless curiosity could have desiredall the more as well that the intention in it had been no greater than in my words beautiful abysmal involuntary her exquisite weakness simply opened up the depths it would have closed it was in short a supremely unsuccessful attempt to say nothing it said everything and by the end of a minute my chatternone the less out of place for being all audiblewas hushed to positive awe by what it had conveyed i saw as i had never seen before what consuming passion can make of the marked mortal on whom with fixed beak and claws it has settled as on a prey she reminded me of a sponge wrung dry and with fine pores agape voided and scraped of everything her shell was merely crushable so it was brought home to me that the victim could be abased and so it disengaged itself from these things that the abasement could be conscious that was mrs servers tragedy that her consciousness survivedsurvived with a force that made it struggle and dissemble this consciousness was all her secretit was at any rate all mine i promised myself roundly that i would henceforth keep clear of any other  i none the lessfrom simply sitting with her theregathered in the sense of more things than i could have named each of which as it came to me made my compassion more tender who of us all could say that his fall might not be as deepor might not at least become so with equal opportunity i for a while fairly forgot mrs server i fear in the intimacy of this vision of the possibilities of our common nature she became such a wasted and dishonoured symbol of them as might have put tears in ones eyes when i presently returned to herour session seeming to resolve itself into a mere mildness of silencei saw how it was that whereas in such cases in general people might have given up much the sort of person this poor lady was could only give up everything she was the absolute wreck of her storm accordingly but to which the pale ghost of a special sensibility still clung waving from the mast with a bravery that went to the heart the last tatter of its flag there are impressions too fine for words and i shall not attempt to say how it was that under the touch of this one i felt how nothing that concerned my companion could ever again be present to me but the fact itself of her admirable state this was the source of her wan little glory constituted even for her a small sublimity in the light of which mere minor identifications turned vulgar i knew who he was now with a vengeance because i had learnt precisely from that who she was and nothing could have been sharper than the force with which it pressed upon me that i had really learnt more than i had bargained for nothing need have happened if i hadnt been so absurdly so fatally meditative about poor longan accident that most people wiser people appeared on the whole to have steered sufficiently clear of compared with my actual sense the sense with which i sat there that other vision was gross and grosser still the connection between the two  such were some of the reflections in which i indulged while her eyeswith their strange intermissions of darkness or of light who could say whichtold me from time to time that she knew whatever i was thinking of to be for her virtual advantage it was prodigious what in the way of suppressed communication passed in these wonderful minutes between us our relation could be at the best but an equal confession and i remember saying to myself that if she had been as subtle as iwhich she wasntshe too would have put it together that i had dreadfully talked about her she would have traced in me my demonstration to mrs briss that whoever she was she must logically have been idiotised it was the special poignancy of her collapse that so far at least as i was concerned this was a ravage the extent of which she had ceased to try to conceal she had been trying and more or less succeeding all day the little drama of her public unrest had had when one came to consider no other argument it had been terror that had directed her steps the need constantly to show herself detached and free followed by the sterner one not to show herself by the same token limp and empty this had been the distinct ferocious logic of her renewals and rupturesthe anxious mistrust of her wit the haunting knowledge of the small distance it would take her at once the consequent importance of her exactly timing herself and the quick instinct of flight before the menace of discovery she couldnt let society alone because that would have constituted a symptom yet for fear of the appearance of a worse one she could only mingle in it with a complex diplomacy she was accordingly exposed on every side and to be with her a while thus quietly was to read back into her behaviour the whole explanation which was positively simple to me now to take up again the vivid analogy she had been sailing all day though scarce able to keep afloat under the flag of her old reputation for easy response she had given to the breeze any sad scrap of a substitute for the play of mind once supposed remarkable the last of all the things her stillness said to me was that i could judge from so poor a show what had become of her conversability what i did judge was that a frantic art had indeed been required to make her pretty silences pass from one crisis to another for pretty speeches half this art doubtless was the glittering deceit of her smile the sublime pathetic overdone geniality which represented so her share in any talk that every other eloquence failing there could only be nothing at all from the moment it abandoned its office there was nothing at all that was the truth in accordance with which i finallyfor everything it might mean to myselfput out my hand and bore ever so gently on her own her own rested listlessly on the stone of our seat of course it had been an immense thing for her that she was in spite of everything so lovely  all this was quite consistent with its eventually coming back to me that though she took from me with appreciation what was expressed in the gesture i have noted it was certainly in quest of a still deeper relief that she had again come forth the more i considered her faceand most of all so permittedly in her passive conscious presencethe more i was sure of this and the further i could go in the imagination of her beautiful duplicity i ended by divining that if i was assuredly good for her because the question of keeping up with me had so completely dropped and if the service i so rendered her was not less distinct to her than to myselfi ended by divining that she had none the less her obscure vision of a still softer ease guy brissenden had become in these few hours her positive needa still greater need than i had lately amused myself with making out that he had found her each had by their unprecedented plight something for the other some intimacy of unspeakable confidence that no one else in the world could have for either they had been feeling their way to it but at the end of their fitful day they had grown confusedly yet beneficently sure the explanation here again was simplethey had the sense of a common fate they hadnt to name it or to phrase itpossibly even couldnt had they tried peace and support came to them without that in the simple revelation of each other oh how i made it out that if it was indeed very well for the poor lady to feel thus in my company that her burden was lifted my company would be after all but a rough substitute for guys he was a still better friend little as he could have told the reason and if i could in this connection have put the words into her mouth here follows something of the sense that i should have made them form  yes my dear man i do understand youquite perfectly now and by i know not what miracle ive really done so to some extent from the first deep is the rest of feeling with you in this way that im watched for the time only as you watch me it has all stopped and i can stop how can i make you understand what it is for me that there isnt at last a creature any more in sight that the wood darkens about me that the sounds drop and the relief goes on what can it mean for you even that ive given myself up to not caring whether or no amongst others im missed and spoken of it does help my strange case in fine as you see to let you keep me here but i should have found still more what i was in need of if i had only found instead of you him whom i had in mind he is as much better than you as you are than everyone else i finally felt in a word so qualified to attribute to my companion some such mute address as that that it could only have as the next consequence a determining effect on mean effect under the influence of which i spoke i parted with him some way from here some time ago i had found him in one of the gardens with lady john after which we came away from her together we strolled a little and talked but i knew what he really wanted he wanted to find you and i told him he would probably do so at tea on the terrace it was visibly with that ideato return to the housethat he left me  she looked at me for some time on this taking it in yet still afraid of it you found him with lady john she at last asked and with a note in her voice that made me see whatas there was a precaution i had neglectedshe feared  the perception of this in its turn operated with me for an instant almost as the rarest of temptations i had puzzled out everything and put everything together i was as morally confident and as intellectually triumphant as i have frankly here described myself but there was no objective test to which i had yet exposed my theory the chance to apply oneand it would be infalliblehad suddenly cropped up there would be excitement amusement discernment in it it would be indeed but a more roundabout expression of interest and sympathy it would above all pack the question i had for so many hours been occupied with into the compass of a needlepoint i was dazzled by my opportunity she had had an uncertainty in other words as to whom i meant and that it kept her for some seconds on the rack was a trifle compared to my chance she would give herself away supremely if she showed she suspected me of placing my finger on the spotif she understood the person i had not named to be nameable as gilbert long what had created her peril of course was my naming lady john well how can i say in any sufficient way how much the extraordinary beauty of her eyes during this brevity of suspense had to do with the event it had everythingfor it was what caused me to be touched beyond even what i had already been and i could literally bear no more of that i therefore took no advantage or took only the advantage i had spoken with the intention of taking i laughed out doubtless too nervously but it didnt compromise my tact dont you know how shes perpetually pouncing on him  still however i had not named himwhich was what prolonged the tension do you meanado you mean with which she broke off on a small weak titter and a still weaker exclamation there are so many gentlemen  there was something in it that might in other conditions have been as trivial as the giggle of a housemaid but it had in fact for my ear the silver ring of poetry i told her instantly whom i meant poor briss you know i said is always in her clutches  oh how it let her off and yet no sooner had it done so and had i thereby tasted on the instant the sweetness of my wisdom than i became aware of something much more extraordinary it let her offshe showed me this for a minute in spite of herself but the next minute she showed me something quite different which was most wonderful of all that she wished me to see her as not quite feeling why i should so much take for granted the person i had named poor briss her face and manner appeared suddenly to repeatquite moreover and it was the drollest saddest part as if all our friends had stood about us to listen wherein did poor briss so intimately concern her what pray was my ground for such free reference to poor briss she quite repudiated poor briss she knew nothing at all about him and the whole airy structure i had erected with his aid might have crumbled at the touch she thus administered if its solidity had depended only on that i had a minute of surprise which had it lasted another minute as surprise pure and simple might almost as quickly have turned to something like chagrin fortunately it turned instead into something even more like enthusiasm than anything i had yet felt the stroke was extraordinary but extraordinary for its nobleness i quickly saw in it from the moment i had got my point of view more fine things than ever i saw for instance that magnificently she wished not to incriminate him all that had passed between us had passed in silence but it was a different matter for what might pass in sound we looked at each other therefore with a strained smile over any question of identities it was as if it had been one thingto her confused relaxed intensityto give herself up to me but quite another thing to give up somebody else  and yet superficially arrested as i was for the time i directly afterwards recognised in this instinctive discriminationthe last the expiring struggle of her native luciditya supremely convincing bit of evidence it was still more convincing than if she had done any of the common thingsstammered changed colour shown an apprehension of what the person named might have said to me she had had it from me that he and i had talked about her but there was nothing that she accepted the idea of his having been able to say i sawstill more than thisthat there was nothing to my purpose since my purpose was to understand that she would have had as matters stood coherence enough to impute to him it was extremely curious to me to divine just here that she hadnt a glimmering of the real logic of brissendens happy effect on her nerves it was the effect as coming from him that a beautiful delicacy forbade her as yet to give me her word for and she was certainly herself in the stage of regarding it as an anomaly why on the contrary i might have wondered shouldnt she have jumped at the chance at the comfort of seeing a preference trivial enough to be worked imputed to her why shouldnt she have been positively pleased that people might helpfully couple her name with that of the wrong man why in short in the language that grace brissenden and i had used together was not that ladys husband the perfection of a red herring just because i perceived the relation that had established itself between them was for its function a real relation the relation of a fellowship in resistance to doom  nothing could have been stranger than for me so to know it was while the stricken parties themselves were in ignorance but nothing at the same time could have been as i have since made out more magnanimous than mrs servers attitude she moved groping and panting in the gathering dusk of her fate but there were calculations she still could dimly make one of these was that she must drag no one else in i verily believe that for that matter she had scruples poignant and exquisite even about letting our friend himself see how much she liked to be with him she wouldnt at all events let another see i saw what i saw i felt what i felt but such things were exactly a sign that i could take care of myself there was apparently i was obliged to admit but little apprehension in her of her unduly showing that our meeting had been anything of a blessing to her there was no one indeed just then to be the wiser for it i might perhaps else even have feared that she would have been influenced to treat the incident as closed i had for that matter no wish to prolong it beyond her own convenience it had already told me everything it could possibly tell i thought i knew moreover what she would have got from it i preferred none the less that we should separate by my own act i wanted not to see her move in order to be free of me so i stood up to put her more at her ease and it was while i remained before her that i tried to turn to her advantage what i had committed myself to about brissenden  i had a fancy at any rate that he was looking for youall the more that he didnt deny it  she had not moved she had let me take my hand from her own with as little sign as on her first feeling its touch she only kept her eyes on me what made you have such a fancy  what makes me ever have any i laughed my extraordinary interest in my fellowcreatures i have more than most men ive never really seen anyone with half so much that breeds observation and observation breeds ideas do you know what it has done i continued it has bred for me the idea that brissendens in love with you  there was something in her eyes that struck me as betrayingand the appeal of it went to the heartthe constant dread that if entangled in talk she might show confusion nevertheless she brought out after a moment as naturally and charmingly as possible how can that be when hes so strikingly in love with his wife  i gave her the benefit of the most apparent consideration strikingly you call it  why i thought it was noticedwhat he does for her  well of course shes extremely handsomeor at least extremely fresh and attractive he is in love with her no doubt if you take it by the quarter or by the year like a yacht or a stable i pushed on at random but isnt there such a state also as being in love by the day  she waited and i guessed from the manner of it exactly why it was the most obscure of intimations that she would have liked better that i shouldnt make her talk but obscurity by this time offered me no more difficulties the hint none the less a trifle disconcerted me and while i vaguely sought for some small provisional middle way between going and not going on the oddest thing as a fruit of my own delay occurred this was neither more nor less than the revival of her terrible little fixed smile it came back as if with an audible clickas a gasburner makes a pop when you light it it told me visibly that from the moment she must talk she could talk only with its aid the effect of its aid i indeed immediately perceived  how do i know she asked in answer to my question ive never been in love  not even by the day  oh a days surely a long time  it is i returned but ive none the less more fortunately than you been in love for a whole one then i continued from an impulse of which i had just become conscious and that was clearly the result of the heartbreaking facial contortionheartbreaking that is when one knew what i knewby which she imagined herself to represent the pleasant giveandtake of society this sense for me was a quick horror of forcing her in such conditions to talk at all poor briss had mentioned to me as an incident of his contact with her his apprehension of her breaking down and now at a touch i saw what he had meant she would break down if i didnt look out i found myself thus from one minute to the other as greatly dreading it for her dreading it indeed for both of us as i might have dreaded some physical accident or danger her fall from an unmanageable horse or the crack beneath her of thin ice it was impossiblethat was the extraordinary impressionto come too much to her assistance we had each of us all in our way hour after hour been as goodnaturedly as unwittingly giving her a lift yet what was the end of it but her still sitting there to assure me of a state of gratitudethat she couldnt even articulatefor every hint of a perch that might still be held out what could only therefore in the connection strike me as indicated was fairly to put into her mouthif one might do so without showing too ungracefully as alarmedthe words one might have guessed her to wish to use were she able to use any it was a small service of anticipation that i tried to render her with as little of an air as possible of being remedial i daresay you wonder i remarked on these lines why at all i should have thrust brissenden in  oh i do so wonder she replied with the refined but exaggerated glee that is a frequent form in high companies and light colloquies i did help herit was admirable to feel it she liked my imposing on her no more complex a proposition she liked my putting the thing to her so much better than she could have put it to me but she immediately afterwards looked away as ifnow that we had put it and it didnt matter which of us bestwe had nothing more to do with it she gave me a hint of drops and inconsequences that might indeed have opened up abysses and all the while she smiled and smiled yet whatever she did or failed of as i even then observed to myself how she remained lovely ones pleasure in that helped one somehow not to break down on ones own sidesince breaking down was in questionfor commiseration i didnt know what she might have hours of for the manwhoever he wasto whom her sacrifice had been made but i doubted if for any other person she had ever been so beautiful as she was for me at these moments to have kept her so to have made her more sohow might that result of their relation not in fact have shone as a blinding light into the eyes of her lover what would he have been bound to make out in her after all but her passion and her beauty wasnt it enough for such wonders as these to fill his consciousness if they didnt fill mineeven though occupying so large a place in itwas that not only because i had not the direct benefit of them as the other party to the prodigy had it they filled mine too for that matter just at this juncture long enough for me to describe myself as rendered subject by them to a temporary loss of my thread what could pass muster with her as an account of my reason for evoking the blighted identity of our friend there came constantly into her aspect i should say the strangest alternatives as i can only most conveniently call them of presence and absencesomething like intermissions of intensity cessations and resumptions of life they were like the slow flickers of a troubled flame breathed upon and then left burning up and burning down she had really burnt downi mean so far as her sense of things wentwhile i stood there  i stood long enough to see that it didnt in the least signify whether or no i explained and during this interval i found myselfto my surprisein receipt of still better assistance than any i had to give i had happened to turn while i awkwardly enough no doubt rested and shifted to the quarter from which mrs server had arrived and there just at the end of the same vista i gathered material for my proper reply her eyes at this moment were fixed elsewhere and that gave me still a little more time at the end of which my reference had all its point i supposed you to have brissenden in your head i said because its evidently what he himself takes for granted but let him tell you he was already close to us missing her at the house he had started again in search of her and had successfully followed the effect on him of coming in sight of us had been for an instant to make him hang back as i had seen mrs server hang but he had then advanced just as she had done i had waited for him to reach us and now she saw him she looked at him as she always looked at all of us yet not at either of us as if we had lately been talking of him if it was vacancy it was eloquent if it was vigilance it was splendid what was most curious at all events was that it was now poor briss who was disconcerted he had counted on finding her but not on finding her with me and i interpreted a certain ruefulness in him as the sign of a quick uneasy sense that he must have been in question between us i instantly felt that the right thing was to let him know he had been and i mentioned to him as a joke that he had come just in time to save himself we had been talking of him and i wouldnt answer for what mrs server had been going to say he took it gravely but he took everything so gravely that i saw no symptom in that in fact as he appeared at first careful not to meet my eyes i saw for a minute or two no symptom in anythingin anything at least but the way in which standing beside me and before mrs servers bench he received the conscious glare of her recognition without returning it and without indeed giving her a look he looked all aboutlooked as she herself had done after our meeting at the charming place and its marks of the hour at the rich twilight deeper now in the avenues and at the treetops and sky more flushed now with colour i found myself of a sudden quite as sorry for him as i had been for mrs server and i scarce know how it was suggested to me that during the short interval since our separation something had happened that made a difference in him was the difference a consciousness still more charged than i had left it i couldnt exactly say and the question really lost itself in what soon came uppermost for methe desire above all to spare them both and to spare them equally  the difficulty however was to spare them in some fashion that would not be more marked than continuing to observe them to leave them together without a decent pretext would be marked but this i eagerly recognised was none the less what most concerned me whatever they might see in it there was by this time little enough doubt of how it would indicate for my own mind that the wheel had completely turned that was the point to which i had been brought by the lapse of a few hours i had verily travelled far since the sight of the pair on the terrace had given its arrest to my first talk with mrs briss i was obliged to admit to myself that nothing could very well have been more singular than some of my sequences i had come round to the opposite pole of the protest my companion had then drawn from mewhich was the pole of agreement with herself and it hung sharply before me that i was pledged to confess to her my revolution i couldnt now be in the presence of the two creatures i was in the very act of finally judging to be not a whit less stricken than i had originally imagined themi couldnt do this and think with any complacency of the redemption of my pledge for the process by which i had at last definitely inculpated mrs server was precisely such a process of providential supervision as made me morally responsible so to speak for her and thereby intensified my scruples well my scruples had the last wordthey were what determined me to look at my watch and profess that whatever sense of a margin brissenden and mrs server might still enjoy it behoved me not to forget that i took on such great occasions an hour to dress for dinner it was a fairly crude cover for my retreat perhaps indeed i should rather say that my retreat was practically naked and unadorned it formulated their relation i left them with the formula on their hands both queerly staring at it both uncertain what to do with it for some passage that would soon be a correction of this however one might surely feel that one could trust them i seemed to feel my trust justified behind my back before i had got twenty yards away by the time i had done this i must add something further had befallen me poor briss had met my eyes just previous to my flight and it was then i satisfied myself of what had happened to him at the house he had met his wife she had in some way dealt with him he had been with her however briefly alone and the intimacy of their union had been afresh impressed upon him poor briss in fine looked ten years older     ix   i shall never forget the impressions of that evening nor the way in particular the immediate effect of some of them was to merge the light of my extravagant perceptions in a glamour much more diffused i remember feeling seriously warned while dinner lasted not to yield further to my idle habit of reading into mere human things an interest so much deeper than mere human things were in general prepared to supply this especial hour at newmarch had always a splendour that asked little of interpretation that even carried itself with an amiable arrogance as indifferent to what the imagination could do for it i think the imagination in those halls of art and fortune was almost inevitably accounted a poor matter the whole place and its participants abounded so in pleasantness and picture in all the felicities for every sense taken for granted there by the very basis of life that even the sense most finely poetic aspiring to extract the moral could scarce have helped feeling itself treated to something of the snub that affectswhen it does affectthe uninvited reporter in whose face a door is closed i said to myself during dinner that these were scenes in which a transcendent intelligence had after all no application and that in short any preposterous acuteness might easily suffer among them such a loss of dignity as overtakes the newspaperman kicked out we existed all of us together to be handsome and happy to be really what we lookedsince we looked tremendously well to be that and neither more nor less so not discrediting by musty secrets and aggressive doubts our high privilege of harmony and taste we were concerned only with what was bright and open and the expression that became us all was at worst that of the shaded but gratified eye the air of being forgivingly dazzled by too much lustre  mrs server at table was out of my range but i wondered if had she not been so i shouldnt now have been moved to recognise in her fixed expressiveness nothing more than our common reciprocal tribute hadnt everyone my eyes could at present take in a fixed expressiveness was i not very possibly myself on this ground of physiognomic congruity more physiognomic than anyone else i made my excellence on the chance go as far as it would to cover my temporary doubts i saw mrs brissenden in another frock naturally and other jewels from those of the evening before but she gave me across the board no more of a look than if she had quite done with me it struck me that she felt she had donethat as to the subject of our discussion she deemed her case by this time so established as to offer comparatively little interest i couldnt come to her to renew the discussion i could only come to her to make my submission and it doubtless appeared to herto do her justicemore delicate not to triumph over me in advance the profession of joy however reigned in her handsome face none the less largely for my not having the benefit of it if i seem to falsify my generalisation by acknowledging that her husband on the same side made no more public profession of joy than usual i am still justified by the fact that there was something in a manner decorative even in brissendens wonted gloom he reminded me at this hour more than ever of some fine old velasquez or other portraita presentation of ugliness and melancholy that might have been royal there was as little of the common in his dry distinguished patience as in the case i had made out for him blighted and ensconed he looked at it over the rigid convention his peculiar perfection of necktie shirtfront and waistcoat as some aged remnant of sovereignty at the opera looks over the ribbon of an order and the ledge of a box  i must add however that in spite of my sense of his wifes indulgence i kept quite aware of the nearer approach as course followed course of my hour of reckoning with hermore and more saw the moment of the evening at which frankly amused at last at having me in a cleft stick she would draw me a little out of the throng of course also i was much occupied in asking myself to what degree i was prepared to be perjured was i ready to pretend that my candour was still unconvinced and was i in this case only instinctively mustering my arguments i was certainly as sorry that mrs server was out of my view as if i proposed still to fight and i really felt so far as that went as if there might be something to fight for after the lady on my left had given me a piece of news i had asked her if she happened to know as we couldnt see who was next mrs server and though unable to say at the moment she made no scruple after a short interval of ascertaining with the last directness the stretch forward in which she had indulged or the information she had caused to be passed up to her while i was again engaged on my right established that it was lord lutley who had brought the lovely lady in and that it was mr long who was on her other side these things indeed were not the finest point of my companions communication for i saw that what she felt i would be really interested in was the fact that mr long had brought in lady john who was naturally therefore his other neighbour beyond lady john was mr obert and beyond mr obert mrs froome not for a wonder this time paired as by the immemorial tradition so fairly comical in its candour with lord lutley wasnt it too funny the kind of grandmotherly view of their relation shown in their always being put together if i perhaps questioned whether grandmotherly were exactly the name for the view what yet at least was definite in the light of this evenings arrangement was that there did occur occasions on which they were put apart my friend of course disposed of this observation by the usual exception that proved the rule but it was absurd how i had thrilled with her announcement and our exchange of ideas meanwhile helped to carry me on  my theory had not at all been framed to embrace the phenomenon thus presented it had been precisely framed on the contrary to hang together with the observed inveteracy of escape on the part of the two persons about whom it busied itself from public juxtaposition of more than a moment i was fairly upset by the need to consider at this late hour whether going in for a new theory or bracing myself for new facts would hold out to me the better refuge it is perhaps not too much to say that i should scarce have been able to sit still at all but for the support afforded me by the oddity of the separation of lord lutley and mrs froome which though resting on a general appearance directly opposed to that of my friends offered somehow the relief of a suggestive analogy what i could directly clutch at was that if the exception did prove the rule in the one case it might equally prove it in the other if on a rare occasion one of these couples might be divided so by as uncommon a chance the other might be joined the only difference being in the gravity of the violated law for which pair was the betrayal greatest it was not till dinner was nearly ended and the ladies were about to withdraw that i recovered lucidity to make out how much more machinery would have had to be put into motion consistently to prevent than once in a way to minimise the disconcerting accident  all accidents i must add were presently to lose themselves in the unexpectedness of my finding myself before we left the diningroom in easy talk with gilbert longtalk that was at least easy for him whatever it might have struck me as necessarily destined to be for me i felt as he approached mefor he did approach methat it was somehow important i was so aware that something in the state of my conscience would have prevented me from assuming conversation between us to be at this juncture possible the state of my conscience was that i knew too muchthat no one had really any business to know what i knew if he suspected but the fiftieth part of it there was no simple spirit in which he could challenge me it would have been simple of course to desire to knock me down but that was barred by its being simple to excess it wouldnt even have been enough for him merely to ground it on a sudden fancy it fitted in fine with my cogitations that it was so significant for him to wish to speak to me that i didnt envy him his attempt at the particular shade of assurance required for carrying the thing off he would have learned from mrs server that i was not as regarded them at all as others were and thus his idea the fruit of that stimulation could only be either to fathom to felicitate oras it wereto destroy me what was at the same time obvious was that no one of these attitudes would go quite of itself the simple sight of him as he quitted his chair to take one nearer my own brought home to me in a flashand much more than anything had yet donethe real existence in him of the condition it was my private madness none the less private for grace brissendens so limited glimpse of it to believe i had coherently stated is not this small touch perhaps the best example i can give of the intensity of amusement i had at last enabled my private madness to yield me i found myself owing it from this time on and for the rest of the evening moments of the highest concentration  whatever there might have been for me of pain or doubt was washed straight out by the special sensation of seeing how clever poor long not only would have to be but confidently and actually was inasmuch as this apprehension seemed to put me in possession of his cleverness besides leaving me all my own i made him welcome i helped him to another cigarette i felt above all that i should enjoy him my response to his overture was in other words quickly enough to launch us yet i fear i can do little justice to the pleasant suppressed tumult of impression and reflection that on my part our ten minutes together produced the elements that mingled in it scarce admit of discrimination it was still more than previously a deep sense of being justified my interlocutor was for those ten minutes immeasurably superiorsuperior i mean to himselfand he couldnt possibly have become so save through the relation i had so patiently tracked he faced me there with another light than his own spoke with another sound thought with another ease and understood with another ear i should put it that what came up between us was the mere things of the occasion were it not for the fine point to which in my view the things of the occasion had been brought while our eyes at all events on either side met serenely and our talk dealing with the idea dealing with the extraordinary special charm of the social day now deepening to its end touched our companions successively touched the manner in which this one and that had happened to be predominantly a part of that charm while such were our immediate conditions i wondered of course if he had not just as consciously and essentially as i quite another business in mind it was not indeed that our allusion to the other business would not have been wholly undiscoverable by a third person  so far as it took place it was of a subtlety as we used to say at newmarch in relation to which the common register of that pressure would have been i fear too oldfashioned a barometer i had moreover the comfortfor it amounted to thatof perceiving after a little that we understood each other too well for our understanding really to have tolerated the interference of passion such passion as would have been represented on his side by resentment of my intelligence and on my side by resentment of his the high sport of such intelligencebetween gentlemen to the senses of any other than whom it must surely be closeddemanded and implied in its own intimate interest a certain amenity yes accordingly i had promptly got the answer that my wonder at his approach required he had come to me for the high sport he would formerly have been incapable of it and he was beautifully capable of it now it was precisely the kind of high sportthe play of perception expression sociabilityin which mrs server would a year or two before have borne as light a hand i need scarcely add how little it would have found itself in that ladys present chords he had said to me in our ten minutes everything amusing she couldnt have said yet if when our host gave us the sign to adjourn to the drawingroom so much as all this had grown so much clearer i had still figuratively speaking a small nut or two left to crack by the time we moved away together however these resistances had yielded the answers had really only been waiting for the questions the play of longs mind struck me as more marked since the morning by the same amount as it might have been called as the march of poor brisss age and if i had a while before in the wood had my explanation of this latter addition so i had it now of the formeras to which i shall presently give it  when music in english society as we know is not an accompaniment to the voice the voice can in general be counted on to assert its pleasant identity as an accompaniment to music but at newmarch we had been considerably schooled and this evening in the room in which most of us had assembled an interesting pianist who had given a concert the night before at the near county town and been brought over during the day to dine and sleep would scarce have felt in any sensitive fibre that he was not having his way with us it may just possibly have been an hallucination of my own but while we sat together after dinner in a dispersed circle i could have worked it out that as a company we were considerably conscious of some experience greater or smaller from one of us to the other that had prepared us for the players spell felicitously scattered and grouped we might in almost any case have had the air of looking for a message from itof an imagination to be flattered nerves to be quieted sensibilities to be soothed the whole scene was as composed as if there were scarce one of us but had a secret thirst for the infinite to be quenched and it was the infinite that for the hour the distinguished foreigner poured out to us causing it to roll in wonderful waves of sound almost of colour over our receptive attitudes and faces each of us i think now wore the expressionor confessed at least to the suggestionof some indescribable thought which might well it was true have been nothing more unmentionable than the simple sense of how the posture of deference to this noble art has always a certain personal grace to contribute we neglected nothing of it that could make our general effect ample and whether or no we were kept quiet by the piano we were at least admonished to and fro by our mutual visibility which each of us clearly desired to make a success i have little doubt furthermore that to each of us was due as the crown of our inimitable day the imputation of having something quite of our own to think over  we thought accordinglywe continued to think and i felt that by the law of the occasion there had as yet been for everyone no such sovereign warrant for an interest in the private affairs of everyone else as a result of this influence all that at dinner had begun to fade away from me came back with a rush and hovered there with a vividness i followed many trains and put together many pieces but perhaps what i most did was to render a fresh justice to the marvel of our civilised state the perfection of that enjoyed as we enjoyed it all made a margin a series of concentric circles of rosecolour shimmering away into the pleasant vague of everything else that didnt matter for the so salient little figure of mrs server still the controlling image for me the real principle of composition in this affluence of fine things what for my part while i listened i most made out was the beauty and the terror of conditions so highly organised that under their rule her small lonely fight with disintegration could go on without the betrayal of a gasp or a shriek and with no worse telltale contortion of lip or brow than the vibration on its golden stem of that constantly renewed flower of amenity which my observation had so often and so mercilessly detached only to find again in its place this flower nodded perceptibly enough in our deeply stirred air but there was a peace none the less in feeling the spirit of the wearer to be temporarily at rest there was for the time no gentleman on whom she need pounce no lapse against which she need guard no presumption she need create nor any suspicion she need destroy in this pause in her career it came over me that i should have liked to leave her it would have prepared for me the pleasant afterconsciousness that i had seen her pass as i might say in music out of sight  but we were alas all too much there too much tangled and involved for that every actor in the play that had so unexpectedly insisted on constituting itself for me sat forth as with an intimation that they were not to be so easily disposed of it was as if there were some last act to be performed before the curtain could fall would the definite dramatic signal for ringing the curtain down be then onlyas a grand climax and coup de théâtrethe due attestation that poor briss had succumbed to inexorable time and mrs server given way under a cerebral lesion were the rest of us to disperse decorously by the simple action of the discovery that on our pianists striking his last note with its consequence of permitted changes of attitude gilbert longs victim had reached the point of final simplification and grace brissendens the limit of age recorded of man i could look at neither of these persons without a sharper sense of the contrast between the tragedy of their predicament and the comedy of the situation that did everything for them but suspect it they had truly been arrayed and anointed they had truly been isolated for their sacrifice i was sufficiently aware even then that if one hadnt known it one might have seen nothing but i was not less aware that one couldnt know anything without seeing all and so it was that while our pianist played my wandering vision played and played as well it took in again while it went from one of them to the other the delicate light that each had shed on the other and it made me wonder afresh what still more delicate support they themselves might not be in the very act of deriving from their dim community it was for the glimmer of this support that i had left them together two or three hours before yet i was obliged to recognise that travel between them as my fancy might it could detect nothing in the way of a consequent result i caught no look from either that spoke to me of service rendered them and i caught none in particular from one of them to the other that i could read as a symptom of their having compared notes the fellowfeeling of each for the lost light of the other remained for me but a tie supposititiousthe fullblown flower of my theory it would show here as another flower equally mature for me to have made out a similar dim community between gilbert long and mrs brissendento be able to figure them as groping side by side proportionately towards a fellowship of light overtaken but if i failed of this for ideal symmetry that seemed to rest on the general truth that joy brings people less together than sorrow  so much for the course of my impressions while the music lasteda course quite consistent with my being prepared for new combinations as soon as it was over promptly when that happened the bow was unbent and the combination i first seized amid motion and murmur and rustle was that once more of poor briss and lady john the latter of whom had already profited by the general reaction to endeavour to cultivate afresh the vainest of her sundry appearances she had laid on him the same coercive hand to which i owed my having found him with her in the afternoon but my intervention was now to operate with less ceremony i chanced to be near enough to them for brissenden on seeing me to fix his eyes on me in silence but in a manner that could only bring me immediately nearer lady john never did anything in silence but she greeted me as i came up to them with a fine false alarm no indeed she cried you shant carry him off this timeand poor briss disappeared leaving us face to face even while she breathed defiance he had made no joke of it and i had from him no other recognition it was therefore a mere touch yet it gave me a sensible hint that he had begun as things were going to depend upon me that i already in a fashion figured to himand on amazingly little evidence after allas his natural protector his providence his effective omniscience like mrs server herself he was materially on my hands and it was proper i should do for him i wondered if he were really beginning to look to me to avert his inexorable fate well if his inexorable fate was to be an unnameable climax it had also its special phases and one of these i had just averted i followed him a moment with my eyes and i then observed to lady john that she decidedly took me for too simple a person she had meanwhile also watched the direction taken by her liberated victim and was the next instant prepared with a reply to my charge because he has gone to talk with may server i dont quite see what you mean for i believe him really to be in terror of her most of the men here are you know and ive really assured myself that he doesnt find her any less awful than the rest he finds her the more so by just the very marked extra attention that you may have noticed she has given him  and does that now happen to be what he has so eagerly gone off to impress upon her  lady john was so placed that she could continue to look at our friends and i made out in her that she was not in respect to them without some slight elements of perplexity these were even sufficient to make her temporarily neglect the defence of the breach i had made in her consistency if you mean by impressing upon her speaking to her he hasnt goneyou can see for yourselfto impress upon her anything they have the most extraordinary way which ive already observed of sitting together without sound i dont know she laughed whats the matter with such people  it proves in general i admitted either some coldness or some warmth and i quite understand that thats not the way you sit with your friends you steer admirably clear of every extravagance i dont see at any rate why mrs server is a terror  but she had already taken me up if she doesnt chatter as i do she thought it over but she doesto everyone but mr briss i mean to every man she can pick up  i emulated her reflection do they complain of it to you  theyre more civil than you she returned for if when they flee before it they bump up against me in their flight they dont explain that by intimating that theyre come from bad to worse besides i see what they suffer  and do you hear it  what they suffer no ive taken care not to suffer myself i dont listen its none of my business  is that a way of gently expressing i ventured to ask that its also none of mine  it might be she replied if i had as you appear to the imagination of atrocity but i dont pretend to so much as conceive whats your business  i wonder if it isnt just now i said after a moment to convict you of an attempt at duplicity that has not even had the saving grace of success was it for brissenden himself that you spoke just now as if you believed him to wish to cling to you  well im kind enough for anything she goodnaturedly enough laughed but what she asked more sharply are you trying to find out  such an awful lot the answer to this would politely have been that i daresay the aptness of the question produced in my face a shade of embarrassment i felt however the next moment that i neednt fear too much what i on approaching lady john had found myself moved to test using her in it as a happy touchstone was the degree of the surrounding the latent sense of things an impulse confirmed by the manner in which she had momentarily circled about the phenomenon of mrs servers avidity about the mystery of the terms made with it by our friend it was present to me that if i could catch on the part of my interlocutress anything of a straight scent i might take that as the measure of a diffused danger i mentally applied this term to the possibility of diffusion because i suddenly found myself thinking with a kind of horror of any accident by which i might have to expose to the world to defend against the world to share with the world that now so complex tangle of hypotheses that i have had for convenience to speak of as my theory i could toss the ball myself i could catch it and send it back and familiarity had now made this exercisein my own inner precinctseasy and safe but the mere brush of lady johns clumsier curiosity made me tremble for the impunity of my creation if there had been so to speak a discernment however feeble of my discernment it would have been irresistible to me to take this as the menace of some incalculable catastrophe or some public ugliness it wasnt for me definitely to image the logical result of a verification by the sense of others of the matter of my vision but the thing had only to hang before me as a chance for me to feel that i should utterly object to it though i may appear to weaken this statement if i add that the opportunity to fix the degree of my actual companions betrayed mystification was almost a spell this i conceive was just by reason of what was at stake how could i happily tell her what i was trying to find outtell her that is not too much for security and yet enough for relief the best answer seemed a brave jump i was conscious of a certain credit open with her in my appearance of intellectual sympathy  well i brought out at last im quite aching to ask you if youll forgive me a great liberty which i owe to your candid challenge my opportunity to name will you allow me to say frankly that i think you play a dangerous game with poor briss in whom i confess im interested i dont of course speak of the least danger to yourself but its an injustice to any man to make use of him quite so flagrantly you dont in the least flatter yourself that the poor fellow is in love with youyou wouldnt care a bit if he were yet youre willing to make him think you like him so far as that may be necessary to explain your so frequently ingenious appropriation of him he doesnt like you too much as yet doesnt even like you quite enough but your potency may after all work on him and then as your interest is so obviously quite elsewhere what will happen will be that youll find to your inconvenience that youve gone too far a man never likes a woman enough unless he likes her more than enough unfortunately its what the inveterate ass is sure sooner or later to do  lady john looked just enough interested to look detached from most of the more vulgar liabilities to offence do i understand that to be the pretty name by which you describe mr briss  he has his share of it for im thinking of the idiots that we everyone of us are i throw out a warning against a contingency  are you providing for the contingency of his ceasing to care for his wife if you areand lady johns amusement took on a breadthyou may be said to have a prudent mind and to be taking time by the forelock  at this i pricked up my ears do you mean because of his apparently incorruptible constancy  i mean because the whole things so before one she has him so in hand that theyre neither of them in as much danger as would count for a mouse it doesnt prevent his liking to dally by the wayfor she dallies by the way and he does everything she does havent i observed her lady john continued dallying a little so far as that goes with you youve the tact to tell me that he doesnt think me good enough but i dont require do ifor such a purpose as histo be very extraordinarily good you may say that you wrap it up immensely and try to sugar the dose well all the same give up for a quiet life the attempt to be a providence you cant be a providence and not be a bore a real providence knows whereas you said lady john making her point neatly have to find outand to find out even by asking the likes of me your fine speech meanwhile doesnt a bit tell me what  it affected me again that she could get so near without getting nearer true enough it was that i wanted to find out and though i might expect or fear too much of her i wondered at her only seeing thisat her not reading deeper the peril of the public ugliness that haunted me rose or fell at this moment with my varying view of her density or rather to be more exact i already saw her as necessarily stupid because i saw her as extravagantly vain what i see now of course is that i was on my own side almost stupidly hard with heras i may also at that hour have been subject to her other vice didnt i perhaps in proportion as i felt how little she saw think awfully well of myself as we said at newmarch for seeing so much more it comes back to me that the sense thus established of my superior vision may perfectly have gone a little to my head if it was a frenzied fallacy i was all to blame but if it was anything else whatever it was naturally intoxicating i really remember in fact that nothing so much as this confirmed presumption of my impunity had appeared to me to mark the fine quality of my state i think there must fairly have been a pitch at which i was not sure that not to partake of that state was on the part of others the sign of a gregarious vulgarity as if there were a positive advantage an undiluted bliss in the intensity of consciousness that i had reached i alone was magnificently and absurdly awareeveryone else was benightedly out of it so i reflected that there would be almost nothing i mightnt with safety mention to my present subject of practice as an acknowledgment that i was meddlesome i could put no clue in her hand that her notorious acuteness would make of the smallest use to her the most she could do would be to make it of use to myself and the clue it seemed best to select was therefore a complete confession of guilt  youve a lucidity of your own in which im forced to recognise that the highest purity of motive looks shrivelled and black you bring out accordingly what has made me thus beat about the bush have you really such a fund of indulgence for gilbert long as we most of us i gatherthough perhaps in our blindnessseem to see it stick out again that he supposes may he fondly feel that he can continue to count on it or if you object to my question in that form is it not frankly to making his attitudeafter all so thoroughly publicmore convenient to each of you that without perhaps quite measuring what youre about youve gone on sacrificing poor briss i call it sacrificing you see in spite of there having been as yet no such great harm done and if you ask me again what business of mine such inquiries may represent why the best thing will doubtless be to say to you that with a smaller dose of irrepressible irony in my composition than you have in yours i cant make so light as you of my tendency to worry on behalf of those i care for let me finally hasten to add that im not now including in that category either of the two gentlemen ive named  i freely concede as i continue my record that to follow me at all at this point gave proof on lady johns part of a faculty that should have prevented my thinking of her as inordinately backward then who in the world are these objects of your solicitude  i showed over and above my hesitation my regret for the need of it im afraid i cant tell you  at this not unnaturally she fairly scoffed asking me everything and telling me nothing you nevertheless look to me to satisfy you do you mean she pursued that you speak for persons whose interest is more legitimately founded than the interest you so flatteringly attribute to myself  well yeslet them be so described cant you guess i further risked who constitutes at least one of my preoccupations  the condescension of her consent to think marked itself handsomely enough is it your idea to pretend to me that im keeping grace brissenden awake there was consistency enough in her wonder she has not been anything but nice to me shes not a person whose path one crosses without finding it out and i cant imagine what has got into her if any such grievance as that is what she has been pouring out to you in your apparently so deep confabulations  this toss of the ball was one that i saw quickly enough even a taste for sport wouldnt justify my answering and my logical interest lay moreover elsewhere dear no mrs brissenden certainly feels her strength and i should never presume to take under my charge any personal situation of hers i had in my mind a very different identity  lady john as if to be patient with me looked about at our companions for a hint of it wondering which of the ladies i might have been supposed to care for so much as to tolerate in her a preference for a rival but the effect of this survey was i the next instant observed a drop of her attention from what i had been saying her eye had been caught by the sight of gilbert long within range of us and then had been just visibly held by the fact that the person seated with him on one of the small sofas that almost of necessity made conversation intimate was the person whose name just uttered between us was in default of the name she was in search of still in the air gilbert long and mrs briss were in familiar colloquythough i was aware at the first flush of nothing in this that should have made my interlocutress stare that is i was aware of nothing but that i had simultaneously myself been moved to some increase of sharpness what could i have known that should have caused me to wonder at the momentary existence of this particular conjunction of minds unless it were simply the fact that i hadnt seen it occur amid the many conjunctions i had already noticedplus the fact that i had a few minutes before in the interest of the full roundness of my theory actually been missing it these two persons had met in my presence at paddington and had travelled together under my eyes i had talked of mrs briss with long and of long with mrs briss but the vivid picture that their social union forthwith presented stirred within me though so strangely late in the day it might have seemed for such an emotion more than enough freshness of impression yetnow that i did have it therewhy should it be vivid why stirring why a picture at all was any temporary collocation in a house so encouraging to sociability out of the range of nature intensely prompt i need scarcely say were both my freshness and my perceived objections to it the happiest objection could i have taken time to phrase it would doubtless have been that the particular effect of this juxtapositionto my eyes at leastwas a thing not to have been foreseen the parties to it looked certainly as i felt that i hadnt prefigured them though even this for my reason was not a description of their aspect much less was it a description for the intelligence of lady johnto whom however after all some formulation of what she dimly saw would not be so indispensable  we briefly watched at any rate together and as our eyes met again we moreover confessed that we had watched and we could ostensibly have offered each other no explanation of that impulse save that we had been talking of those concerned as separate and that it was in consequence a little odd to find ourselves suddenly seeing them as one for that was itthey were as one as one at all events for my large reading my large reading had meanwhile for the convenience of the rest of my little talk with lady john to make itself as small as possible i had an odd sense till we fell apart again as of keeping my finger rather stiffly fixed on a passage in a favourite author on which i had not previously lighted i held the book out of sight and behind me i spoke of things that were not at all in itor not at all on that particular page but my volume none the less was only waiting what might be written there hummed already in my ears as a result of my mere glimpse had they also wonderfully begun to know had she most wonderfully and had they in that case prodigiously come together on it this was a possibility into which my imagination could dip even deeper than into the depths over which it had conceived the other pair as hovering these opposed couples balanced like bronze groups at the two ends of a chimneypiece and the most i could say to myself in lucid deprecation of my thought was that i mustnt take them equally for granted merely because they balanced things in the real had a way of not balancing it was all an affair this fine symmetry of artificial proportion yet even while i kept my eyes away from mrs briss and long it was vivid to me that composing there beautifully they could scarce help playing a part in my exhibition the mind of man furthermoreand my generalisation pressed hard with a quick twist on the supersubtlety as to which i had just been privately complacentthe mind of man doubtless didnt know from one minute to the other under the appeal of phantasmagoric life what it would profitably be at it had struck me a few seconds before as vulgarly gross in lady john that she was curious or conscious of so small a part in spite of which i was already secretly wincing at the hint that these others had begun to find themselves less in the dark and perhaps even directly to exchange their glimmerings  my personal privilege on the basis of the full consciousness had become on the spot in the turn of an eye more than questionable and i was really quite scared at the chance of having to faceof having to see them faceanother recognition what did this alarm imply but the complete reversal of my estimate of the value of perception mrs brissenden and long had been hitherto magnificently without it and i was responsible perhaps for having in a mood practically much stupider than the stupidest of theirs put them gratuitously and helplessly on it to be without it was the most consistent the most successful because the most amiable form of selfishness and why should people admirably equipped for remaining so people bright and insolent in their prior state people in whom this state was to have been respected as a surface without a scratch is respected be made to begin to vibrate to crack and split from within wasnt it enough for me to pay vicariously the tax on being absurd were we all to be landed without an issue or a remedy in a condition on which that tax would be generally levied it was as if abruptly with a new emotion i had wished to unthink every thought with which i had been occupied for twentyfour hours let me add however that even had this process been manageable i was aware of not proposing to begin it till i should have done with lady john  the time she took to meet my last remark is naturally not represented by this prolonged glance of mine at the amount of suggestion that just then happened to reach me from the other quarter it at all events duly came out between us that mrs server was the person i did have on my mind and i remember that it had seemed to me at the end of a minute to matter comparatively little by which of us after all she was first designated there is perhaps an odditywhich i must set down to my emotion of the momentin my not now being able to say i should have been hugely startled if the sight of gilbert long had appeared to make my companion suddenly think of her and reminiscence of that shock is not one of those i have found myself storing up what does abide with me is the memory of how after a little my apprehensions of various kinds droppedmost of all under the deepening conviction that lady john was not a whit less agreeably superficial than i could even at the worst have desired the point established for me was that whereas she passed with herself and so many others as taking in everything she had taken in nothing whatever that it was to my purpose she should not take vast truly was the world of observation that we could both glean in it so actively without crossing each others steps there we stood close together yetsave for the accident of a final dash as i shall notewere at opposite ends of the field  its a matter as to which the truth sounds priggish but i cant help it ifyes positivelyit affected me as hopelessly vulgar to have made any induction at all about our companions but those i have recorded in such detail on behalf of my own energy it was better verily not to have touched themwhich was the case of everyone elsethan to have taken them up with knowing gestures only to do so little with them that i felt the interest of may server that may server felt the interest of poor briss and that my feeling incongruously presented itself as putting up philosophically with the inconvenience of the ladysthese were in fine circumstances to which she clearly attached ideas too commonplace for me to judge it useful to gather them in she read all things lady john heaven knows in the light of the universal possibility of a relation but most of the relations that she had up her sleeve could thrust themselves into my theory only to find themselves the next minute eliminated they were of alien substanceinsoluble in the whole gilbert long had for her no connection in my deeper sense with mrs server nor mrs server with gilbert long nor the husband with the wife nor the wife with the husband nor i with either member of either pair nor anyone with anything nor anything with anyone she was thus exactly where i wanted her to be for frankly i became conscious at this climax of my conclusion that i a little wanted her to be where she had distinctly ended by betraying to me that her proper inspiration had placed her if i have just said that my apprehensions of various kinds had finally and completely subsided a more exact statement would perhaps have been that from the moment our eyes met over the show of our couple on the sofa the question of any other calculable thing than that hint of a relation had simply known itself superseded reduced to its plainest terms this sketch of an improved acquaintance between our comrades was designed to make lady john think it was designed to make me do no less but we thought inevitably on different lines  i have already so represented my successions of reflection as rapid that i may not appear to exceed in mentioning the amusement and philosophy with which i presently perceived it as unmistakable that she believed in the depth of her new sounding it visibly went down for her much nearer to the bottom of the sea than any plumb i might be qualified to drop poor briss was in love with his wifethat when driven to the wall she had had to recognise but she had not had to recognise that his wife was in love with poor briss what was then to militate on that ladys part against a due consciousness at the end of a splendid summer day a day on which occasions had been so multiplied of an impression of a special order what was to prove that there was nothing in it when two persons sat looking so very exceptionally much as if there were everything in it as if they were for the first timethanks to finer opportunitydoing each other full justice mustnt it indeed at this juncture have come a little over my friend that grace had lent herself with uncommon good nature the previous afternoon to the arrangement by which on the way from town her ladyships reputation was to profit by no worse company precisely than poor brisss mrs brissendens own was obviously now free to profit by my companions rememberingif the fact had reached her earsthat mrs brissenden had meanwhile had long for an escort so much at least i saw lady john as seeing and my vision may be taken as representing the dash i have confessed myself as making from my end of our field it offers us to be exact as jostling each other just sensiblythough i only might feel the bruisein our business of picking up straws our view of the improved acquaintance was only a straw but as i stooped to it i felt my head bump with my neighbours this might have made me ashamed of my eagerness but oddly enough that effect was not to come i felt in fact that since we had even pulled against each other at the straw i carried off in turning away the larger piece     x   it was in the moment of turning away that i somehow learned without looking that mrs brissenden had also immediately moved i wanted to look and yet had my reasons for not appearing to do it too quickly in spite of which i found my friends even after an interval still distinguishable as separating for the avoidance of comment gilbert long rising directly after his associate had already walked away but this associate lingering where she stood and meeting me with it availed herself of the occasion to show that she wished to speak to me such was the idea she threw out on my forthwith going to her for a few minutespresently  do you mean alone shall i come with you  she hesitated long enough for me to judge her as a trifle surprised at my being so readyas if indeed she had rather hoped i wouldnt be which would have been an easy pretext to her to gain time in fact with a face not quite like the brave face she had at each step hitherto shown me yet unlike in a fashion i should certainly not have been able to define on the spot with an expression in short that struck me as taking refuge in a general reminder that not my convenience but her own was in question she replied oh nobut before its too late a few minutes hence where shall you be she asked with a shade as i imagined of awkwardness she had looked about as for symptoms of acceptance of the evenings end on the part of the ladies but we could both see our hostess otherwise occupied we dont go up quite yet in the morning she added as with an afterthought i suppose you leave early  i debated i havent thought and you  she looked at me straighter now i havent thought either then she was silent neither turning away nor coming to the point as it seemed to me she might have done of telling me what she had in her head i even fancied that her momentary silence combined with the way she faced meas if that might speak for herwas meant for an assurance that whatever train she should take in the morning she would arrange that it shouldnt be as it had been the day before the same as mine i really caught in her attitude a world of invidious reference to the little journey we had already made together she had sympathies she had proprieties that imposed themselves and i was not to think that any little journey was to be thought of again in those conditions it came over me that this might have been quite a matter discussed by her discussed and settled with her interlocutor on the sofa it came over me that if before our breakup for the night i should happen also to have a minutes talk with that interlocutor i would equally get from it the sense of an intention unfavourable to our departing in the same group and i wondered if this in that case wouldnt affect me as marking a change back to longs old mannera forfeiture of the conditions whatever view might be taken of them that had made him at paddington suddenly show himself as so possible and so pleasant if he changed back wouldnt grace brissenden change by the same law and if grace brissenden did wouldnt her husband wouldnt the miracle take the form of the rejuvenation of that husband would it still by the same token take the form of her becoming very old becoming if not as old as her husband at least as old as one might say as herself would it take the form of her becoming dreadfully plainplain with the plainness of mere stout maturity and artificial preservation and if it took this form for the others which would it take for may server would she at a bound as marked as theirs recover her presence of mind and her lost equipment  the kind of suspense that these rising questions produced for me suffered naturally no drop after mrs briss had cut everything short by rustling voluminously away she had something to say to me and yet she hadnt she had nothing to say and yet i felt her to have already launched herself in a statement there were other persons i had made uncomfortable without at all intending it but she at least had not suffered from me and i had no wish that she should according to which she had no pressure to fear my suspense in spite of this remainedindeed all the more sensibly that i had suddenly lost my discomfort on the subject of redeeming my pledge to her it had somehow left me at a stroke my dread of her calling me as by our agreement to submit in respect to what we had talked of as the identification of the woman that call had been what i looked for from her after she had seen me break with lady john my first idea then could only be that i must come as it were to time it was strange that the next minute i should find myself sure that i was as i may put it free it was at all events indisputable that as i stood there watching her recede and fairly studying in my preoccupation her handsome affirmative back and the special sweep of her long dressit was indisputable that on some intimation i could at the instant recognise but not seize my consciousness was aware of having performed a full revolution if i was free that was what i had been only so short a time before what i had been as i drove in london to the station was this now a foreknowledge that on the morrow in driving away i should feel myself restored to that blankness the state lost was the state of exemption from intense obsessions and the state recovered would therefore logically match it if the foreknowledge had thus as by the stir of the air from my friends whisk of her train descended upon me my liberation was in a manner what i was already tasting yet how i also felt with it something of the threat of a chill to my curiosity the taste of its being all over that really sublime success of the strained vision in which i had been living for crowded hourswas this a taste that i was sure i should particularly enjoy marked enough it was doubtless that even in the stress of perceiving myself broken with i ruefully reflected on all the more on the ever so much i still wanted to know  well something of this quantity in any case would come since mrs briss did want to speak to me the suspense that remained with me as i have indicated was the special fresh one she had just produced it fed for a little positively on that survey of her fine retreating person to which i have confessed that my eyes attached themselves these seconds were naturally few and yet my memory gathers from them something that i can only compare in its present effect to the scent of a strange flower passed rapidly under my nose i seem in other words to recall that i received in that brush the very liveliest impression that my whole adventure was to yieldthe impression that is my reason for speaking of myself as having at the juncture in question studied mrs brissendens back study of a profound sort would appear needed in truth to account for it it was as handsome and affirmative that she at once met and evaded my view but was not the affirmation as distinguished from the handsomeness which was a matter of stature and mass fairly downright and defiant didnt what i saw strike me as saying straight at me as far as possible i am youngi am and i will be see see if im not there there therewith theres as insistent and rhythmical as the undulations of her fleeing presence as the bejewelled nod of her averted brow if her face had not been hidden should i not precisely have found myself right in believing that it looked exactly for those instants dreadfully older than it had ever yet had to the answer ideally cynical would have been oh any woman of your resources can look young with her back turned but youve had to turn it to make that proclamation she passed out of the room proclaiming and i did stand there a little defeated even though with her word for another chance at her was this word one that she would keep i had got offyes to a certainty but so too had not she  naturally at any rate i didnt stay planted and though it seemed long it was probably for no great time after this that i roamed in my impatience i was divided between the discourtesy of wishing the ladies would go to bed and the apprehension that if they did too soon go i might yet lose everything was mrs briss waiting for more privacy or was she only waiting for a complete escape of course even while i asked myself that i had to remember how much i was taking for granted on her part in the way of conscious motive still if she had not a motive for escaping why had she not had one five minutes before for coming to the point with me this inquiry kept me hovering where she might at any instant find me but that was not inconsistent with my presently passing like herself into another room the first one i enteredthere were great chains of them at newmarchshowed me once more at the end opposite the door the object that all day had been present or absent most in my eyes and that there now could be no fallacy in my recognising mrs servers unquenchable little smile had never yet been so far from quenched as when it recognised on its own side that i had just had time to note how ford obert was for a change taking it in these two friends of mine appeared to have moved together after the music to the corner in which i should not have felt it as misrepresenting the matter to say that i surprised them they owed nothing of the harmony that held themunlike my other coupleto the constraint of a common seat a small glazed table a receptacle for minute objects of price extended itself between them as if it had offered itself as an occasion for their drawing toward it a pair of low chairs but their union had nevertheless such an air of accepted duration as led it slightly to puzzle me this would have been a reason the more for not interrupting it even had i not peculiarly wished to respect it it was grist to my mill somehow that something or other had happened as a consequence of which obert had lost the impulse to repeat to me his odd invitation to intervene he gave me no notice as i passed the notice was all from his companion it constituted i felt on her part precisely as much and precisely as little of an invitation as it had constituted at the momentso promptly following our arrivalof my first seeing them linked which is but another way of saying that nothing in mrs server appeared to acknowledge a lapse it was nearly midnight but she was again under arms everything conceivableor perhaps rather inconceivablehad passed between us before dinner but her face was exquisite again in its repudiation of any reference  any reference i saw would have been difficult to me had i unluckily been forced to approach her what would have made the rare delicacy of the problem was that blankness itself was the most direct reference of all i had however as i passed her by a comprehension as inward as that with which i had watched mrs brisss retreat what shall i see when i next see you was what i had mutely asked of mrs briss but god grant i dont see you again at all was the prayer sharply determined in my heart as i left mrs server behind me i left her behind me for ever but the prayer has not been answered i did see her again i see her now i shall see her always i shall continue to feel at moments in my own facial muscles the deadly little ache of her heroic grin with this however i was not then to reckon and my simple philosophy of the moment could be but to get out of the room the result of that movement was that two minutes later at another doorway but opening this time into a great corridor i found myself arrested by a combination that should really have counted for me as the least of my precious anomalies but thatas accident happened to protect mei watched so long as i might with intensity i should in this connection describe my eyes as yet again engaging the less scrutable side of the human figure were it not that poor brisss back now presented to me beside his wifesfor these were the elements of the combinationhad hitherto seemed to me the most eloquent of his aspects it was when he presented his face that he looked each time older but it was when he showed you from behind the singular stoop of his shoulders that he looked oldest  they had just passed the door when i emerged and they receded at a slow pace and with a kind of confidential nearness down the long avenue of the lobby her head was always high and her husbands always low so that i couldnt be sureit might have been only my fancythat the contrast of this habit was more marked in them than usual if i had known nothing about them i should have just unimaginatively said that talk was all on one side and attention all on the other i of course for that matter did know nothing about them yet i recall how it came to me as my extemporised shrewdness hung in their rear that i mustnt think anything too grossly simple of what might be taking place between them my position was in spite of myself that of my having mastered enough possibilities to choose from if one of these might befor her face in spite of the backward cock of her head was turned to himthat she was looking her time of life straight at him and yet making love to him with it as hard as ever she could so another was that he had been already so thoroughly got back into hand that she had no need of asking favours that she was more splendid than ever and that the same poor briss as before his brief adventure he was only feeling afresh in his soul as a response to her the gush of the sacred fount presumptous choice as to these alternatives failed on my part in time let me say to flower it rose before me in time that whatever might be for the exposed instant the deep note of their encounter only one thing concerned me in it its being wholly their own business so for that i liberally let it go passing into the corridor but proceeding in the opposite sense and aiming at an issue which i judged i should reach before they would turn in their walk i had not however reached it before i caught the closing of the door furthest from me at the sound of which i looked about to find the brissendens gone they had not remained for another turn but had taken their course evidently back to the principal drawingroom where no less presumably the procession of the ladies bedward was even then forming mrs briss would fall straight into it and i had accordingly lost her i hated to appear to pursue her late in the day as it may appear to affirm that i put my dignity before my curiosity  free again at all events to wait or to wander i lingered a minute where i had stoppedclose to a wide window as it happened that at this end of the passage stood open to the warm darkness and overhung from no great height one of the terraces the night was mild and rich and though the lights within were in deference to the temperature not too numerous i found the breath of the outer air a sudden corrective to the grossness of our lustre and the thickness of our medium our general heavy humanity i felt its taste sweet and while i leaned for refreshment on the sill i thought of many things one of those that passed before me was the way that newmarch and its hospitalities were sacrificed after all and much more than smaller circles to material frustrations we were all so fine and formal and the ladies in particular at once so little and so much clothed so beflounced yet so denuded that the summer stars called to us in vain we had ignored them in our crystal cage among our tinkling lamps no more free really to alight than if we had been dashing in a locked railwaytrain across a lovely land i remember asking myself if i mightnt still take a turn under them and i remember that on appealing to my watch for its sanction i found midnight to have struck that then was the end and my only real alternatives were bed or the smokingroom the difficulty with bed was that i was in no condition to sleep and the difficulty about rejoining the men was thatdefinitely yesthere was one of them i desired not again to see i felt it with sharpness as i leaned on the sill i felt it with sadness as i looked at the stars i felt once more what i had felt on turning a final back five minutes before so designedly on mrs server i saw poor briss as he had just moved away from me and i knew as i had known in the other case that my troubled sense would fain feel i had practically done with him it would be well for aught i could do for him that i should have seen the last of him what remained with me from that vision of his pacing there with his wife was the conviction that his fate whatever it was held him fast it wouldnt let him go and all i could ask of it now was that it should let me i would goi was going if i had not had to accept the interval of the night i should indeed already have gone the admonitions of that momentonly confirmed i hasten to add by what was still to comewere that i should catch in the morning with energy an earlier train to town than anyone else was likely to take and get off alone by it bidding farewell for a long day to newmarch i should be in small haste to come back for i should leave behind me my tangled theory no loose thread of which need i ever again pick up in no stray mesh of which need my foot again trip it was on my way to the place in fine that my obsession had met me and it was by retracing those steps that i should be able to get rid of it only i must break off sharp must escape all reminders by forswearing all returns  that was very well but it would perhaps have been better still if i had gone straight to bed in that case i should have broken off sharptoo sharp to become aware of something that kept me a minute longer at the window and that had the instant effect of making me wonder if in the interest of observation i mightnt snap down the electric light that playing just behind me must show where i stood i resisted this impulse and with the thought that my position was in no way compromising chanced being myself observed i presently saw moreover that i was really not in evidence i could take in freely what i had at first not been sure of the identity of the figure stationed just within my range but just out of that of the light projected from my window one of the men of our company had come out by himself for a stroll and the man was gilbert long he had paused i made out in his walk his back was to the house and resting on the balustrade of the terrace with a cigarette in his lips he had given way to a sense of the fragrant gloom he moved so little that i was suremaking no turn that would have made me draw back he only smoked slowly in his place and seemed as lost in thought as i was lost in my attention to him i scarce knew what this told me all i felt was that however slight the incident and small the evidence it essentially fitted in it had for my imagination a value for my theory a price and it in fact constituted an impression under the influence of which this theory just impatiently shaken off perched again on my shoulders it was of the deepest interest to me to see long in such detachment in such apparent concentration these things marked and presented him more than any had yet done and placed him more than any yet in relation to other matters they showed him i thought as serious his situation as grave i couldnt have said what they proved but i was as affected by them as if they proved everything the proof simply acted from the instant the vision of him alone there in the warm darkness was caught it was just with all that was in the business that he was that he had fitfully needed to be alone nervous and restless after separating under my eyes from mrs briss he had wandered off to the smokingroom as yet empty he didnt know what to do either and was incapable of bed and of sleep he had observed the communication of the smokingroom with the terrace and had come out into the air this was what suited him and with pauses and meditations much possibly by this time to turn over he prolonged his soft vigil but he at last moved and i found myself startled i gave up watching and retraced my course i felt none the less fairly humiliated it had taken but another turn of an eye to reestablish all my connections  i had not however gone twenty steps before i met ford obert who had entered the corridor from the other end and was as he immediately let me know on his way to the smokingroom  is everyone then dispersing  some of the men i think he said are following me others i believewonderful creatureshave gone to array themselves others still doubtless have gone to bed  and the ladies  oh theyve floated awaysoared aloft to high jinksisnt that the ideain their own quarters dont they too at these hours practise sociabilities of sorts they make at any rate here an extraordinary picture on that great staircase  i thought a moment i wish i had seen it but i do see it yessplendid is the place wholly cleared of them  save it struck me so far as they may have left some black plume as a token  not i trust i returned of any lie their soul hath spoken but not one of them lingers  he seemed to wonder lingers for what  oh i dont knowin this house  he looked at our long vista still lightedappeared to feel with me our liberal ease which implied that unseen powers waited on our good pleasure and sat up for us there is nothing like it in fact the liberal ease at newmarch yet obert reminded meif i needed the reminderthat i mustnt after all presume on it was one of them to linger for you  well since you ask me it was what i hoped but since you answer for it that my hope has not been met i bow to a superior propriety  you mean youll come and smoke with me do then come  what if i do i asked with an idea will you give me  im afraid i can promise you nothing more that i deal in than a bad cigarette  and what then i went on will you take from me  he had met my eyes and now looked at me a little with a smile that i thought just conscious well im afraid i cant take any more  of the sort of stuff i laughed youve already had sorry stuff perhapsa poor thing but mine own such as it is i only ask to keep it for myself and that isnt what i meant i meant what flower will you gather what havoc will you play  well he said as i hesitated  among superstitions that i after all cherish mon siège est faita great glittering crystal palace how many panes will you reward me for amiably sitting up with you by smashing  it might have been my mere fancybut it was my fancythat he looked at me a trifle harder how on earth can i tell what youre talking about  i waited a moment then went on did you happen to count them  count whom  why the ladies as they filed up was the number there  he gave a jerk of impatience go and see for yourself  once more i just waited but suppose i should find mrs server  prowling there on the chance of you welli thought she was what you wanted  then i returned you could tell what i was talking about for a moment after this we faced each other without more speech but i presently continued you didnt really notice if any lady stayed behind  i think you ask too much of me he at last brought out take care of your ladies my dear man yourself go he repeated and see  certainlyits better but ill rejoin you in three minutes and while he went his way to the smokingroom i proceeded without more delay to assure myself performing in the opposite sense the journey i had made ten minutes before it was extraordinary what the sight of long alone in the outer darkness had done for me my expression of it would have been that it had put me on again at the moment of my decidedly feeling myself off i believed that if i hadnt seen him i could now have gone to bed without seeing mrs briss but my renewed impression had suddenly made the difference if that was the way he struck me how might not if i could get at her she and she might after all in the privacy at last offered us by empty rooms be waiting for me i went through them all however only to find them empty indeed in conformity with the large allowances of every sort that were the law of newmarch they were still open and lighted so that if i had believed in mrs brisss reappearance i might conveniently on the spot have given her five minutes more i am not sure for that matter that i didnt i remember at least wondering if i mightnt ring somewhere for a servant and cause a question to be sent up to her i didnt ring but i must have lingered a little on the chance of the arrival of servants to extinguish lights and see the house safe they had not arrived however by the time i again felt that i must give up     xi   i gave up by going decidedly to the smokingroom where several men had gathered and where obert a little apart from them was in charmed communion with the bookshelves they are wonderful everywhere at newmarch the bookshelves but he put a volume back as he saw me come in and a moment later when we were seated i said to him again as a recall of our previous passage then you could tell what i was talking about and i added to complete my reference since you thought mrs server was the person whom when i stopped you i was sorry to learn from you i had missed  his momentary silence appeared to admit the connection i established then you find you have missed her she wasnt there for you  theres no one there for me so that i fear that if you werent as it happens here for me my amusement would be quite at an end i had in fact i continued already given it up as lost when i came upon you a while since in conversation with the lady weve named at that i confess my prospects gave something of a flare i said to myself that since your interest hadnt then wholly dropped why even at the worst should mine yours was mine wasnt it for a little this morning or was it mine that was yours we exchanged at any rate some lively impressions only before we had done your effort dropped or your discretion intervened you gave up as none of your business the question that had suddenly tempted us  and you gave it up too said my friend  yes and it was on the idea that it was mine as little as yours that we separated  well then he kept his eyes with his head thrown back on the warm bindings admirable for old gilt and old colour that covered the opposite wall  well then if ive correctly gathered that youre in spite of our common renunciation still interested i confess to you that i am i took my detachment too soon for granted i havent been detached im not hang me detached now and its all because you were originally so suggestive  originally  why from the moment we met here yesterdaythe moment of my first seeing you with mrs server the look you gave me then was really the beginning of everything everythingand i spoke now with real convictionwas traceably to spring from it  what do you mean he asked by everything  well this failure of detachment what you said to me as we were going up yesterday afternoon to dresswhat you said to me then is responsible for it and since it comes to that i pursued i make out for myself now that youre not detached eitherunless that is simply detached from me i had indeed a suspicion of that as i passed through the room there  he smoked through another pause youve extraordinary notions of responsibility  i watched him a moment but he only stared at the books without looking round something in his voice had made me more certain and my certainty made me laugh i see you are serious  but he went on quietly enough youve extraordinary notions of responsibility i deny altogether mine  you are seriousyou are i repeated with a gaiety that i meant as inoffensive and that i believe remained so but no matter youre no worse than i  im clearly by your own story not half so bad but as you say no matter i dont care  i ventured to keep it up oh dont you  his good nature was proof i dont care  then why didnt you so much as look at me a while ago  didnt i look at you  you know perfectly you didnt mrs server didwith her unutterable intensity making me feel afresh by the way that ive never seen a woman compromise herself so little by proceedings so compromising but though you saw her intensity it never diverted you for an instant from your own  he lighted before he answered this a fresh cigarette a man engaged in talk with a charming woman scarcely selects that occasion for winking at somebody else  you mean he contents himself with winking at her my dear fellow that wasnt enough for you yesterday and it wouldnt have been enough for you this morning among the impressions that led to our last talk it was just the fact that you did wink that you had winked at me that wound me up  and what about the fact that you had winked at me your winkscomeobert laughedare portentous  oh if we recriminate i cheerfully said after a moment we agree  im not so sure he returned that we agree  ah then if we differ its still more interesting because you know we didnt differ either yesterday or this morning  without hurry or flurry but with a decent confusion his thoughts went back i thought you said just now we didrecognising as you ought that you were keen about a chase of which i washed my hands  noi wasnt keen youve just mentioned that you remember my giving up i washed my hands too  it seemed to leave him with the moral of this then if our hands are clean what are we talking about  i turned on it a little more to him and looked at him so long that he had at last to look at me with which after holding his eyes another moment i made my point our hands are not clean  ah speak for your ownand as he moved back i might really have thought him uneasy there was a hint of the same note in the way he went on i assure you i decline all responsibility i see the responsibility as quite beautifully yours  well i said i only want to be fair you were the first to bring it out that she was changed  well she isnt changed said my friend with an almost startling effect for me of suddenness or rather he immediately and incongruously added she is shes changed back  back it made me stare  back he repeated with a certain sharpness and as if to have done at last for himself with the muddle of it  but there was that in me that could let him see he had far from done and something above all told me now that he absolutely mustnt have before i had i quickly moreover saw that i must with an art make him want not to back to what she was when you painted her  he had to think an instant for this nonot quite to that  to what then  he tried in a manner to oblige me to something else  it seemed so for my thought the gleam of something that fitted that i was almost afraid of quenching the gleam by pressure i must then get everything i could from him without asking too much you dont quite know to what else  noi dont quite know but there was a sound in it this time that i took as the hint of a wish to knowalmost a recognition that i might help him  i helped him accordingly as i could and i may add as far as the positive flutter he had stirred in me suffered it fittedit fitted if her change is to something other i suppose then a change back is not quite the exact name for it  perhaps not i fairly thrilled at his taking the suggestion as if it were an assistance she isnt at any rate what i thought her yesterday  it was amazing into what depths this dropped for me and with what possibilities it mingled i remember what you said of her yesterday  i drew him on so that i brought back for him the very words he had used she was so beastly unhappy and he used them now visibly not as a remembrance of what he had said but for the contrast of the fact with what he at present perceived so that the value this gave for me to what he at present perceived was immense  and do you mean that thats gone  he hung fire however a little as to saying so much what he meant and while he waited he again looked at me what do you mean dont you think so yourself  i laid my hand on his arm and held him a moment with a grip that betrayed i daresay the effort in me to keep my thoughts together and lose not a thread it betrayed at once doubtless the danger of that failure and the sharp foretaste of success i remember that with it absolutely i struck myself as knowing again the joy of the intellectual mastery of things unamenable that joy of determining almost of creating results which i have already mentioned as an exhilaration attached to some of my plunges of insight it would take long to tell you what i mean  the tone of it made him fairly watch me as i had been watching him well havent we got the whole night  oh it would take more than the whole nighteven if we had it  by which you suggest that we havent it  nowe havent it i want to get away  to go to bed i thought you were so keen  i am keen keen is no word for it i dont want to go to bed i want to get away  to leave the housein the middle of the night  yesabsurd as it may seem you excite me too much you dont know what you do to me  he continued to look at me then he gave a laugh which was not the contradiction but quite the attestation of the effect produced on him by my grip if i had wanted to hold him i held him it only came to me even that i held him too much i felt this in fact with the next thing he said if youre too excited then to be coherent now will you tell me tomorrow  i took time myself now to relight ridiculous as it may sound i had my nerves to steady which is a proof surely that for real excitement there are no such adventures as intellectual ones oh tomorrow i shall be off in space  certainly we shall neither of us be here but cant we arrange say to meet in town or even to go up together in such conditions as will enable us to talk  i patted his arm again thank you for your patience its really good of you who knows if i shall be alive tomorrow we are meeting we do talk  but with all i had to think of i must have fallen on this into the deepest of silences for the next thing i remember is his returning we dont i repeated my gesture of reassurance i conveyed that i should be with him again in a minute and presently while he gave me time he came back to something of his own my wink at all events would have been nothing for any question between us as ive just said without yours thats what i call your responsibility it was as we put the matter the torch of your analogy  oh the torch of my analogy  i had so groaned itas if for very ecstasythat it pulled him up and i could see his curiosity as indeed reaffected but he went on with a coherency that somewhat admonished me it was your making me as i told you this morning think over what you had said about brissenden and his wife it was that  that made you think overi took him straight upwhat you yourself had said about our troubled lady yes precisely that was the torch of my analogy what i showed you in the one case seemed to tell you what to look for in the other you thought it over i accuse you of nothing worse than of having thought it over but you see what thinking it over does for it  the way i said this appeared to amuse him i see what it does for you  no you dont not at all yet thats just the embarrassment  just whose if i had thanked him for his patience he showed that he deserved it just yours  well say mine but when you do and i paused as for the rich promise of it  when i do see where you are you mean  the only difficulty is whether you can see but we must try youve set me whirling round but we must go step by step oh but its all in your germi kept that up if she isnt now beastly unhappy  shes beastly happy he broke in getting firmer hold if not of the real impression he had just been gathering under my eyes then at least of something he had begun to make out that my argument required well that is the way i see her difference her difference i mean he added in his evident wish to work with me her difference from her other difference there he laughed as if also he had found himself fairly fantastic isnt that clear for you  crystallinefor me but thats because i know why  i can see again now the long look that on this he gave me i made out already much of what was in it so then do i  but how in the world i know for myself how i know  so then do i he after a moment repeated  and can you tell me  certainly but what ive already named to youthe torch of your analogy  i turned this over youve made evidently an admirable use of it but the wonderful thing is that you seem to have done so without having all the elements  he on his side considered what do you call all the elements  oh it would take me long to tell you i couldnt help laughing at the comparative simplicity with which he asked it thats the sort of thing we just now spoke of taking a day for at any rate such as they are these elements i went on i believe myself practically in possession of them but what i dont quite see is how you can be  well he was able to tell me why in the world shouldnt your analogy have put me he spoke with gaiety but with lucidity im not an idiot either  i see but there was so much  did you think i was he amiably asked  no i see i repeated yet i didnt really fully which he presently perceived  you made me think of your view of the brissenden pair till i could think of nothing else  yesyes i said go on  well as you had planted the theory in me it began to bear fruit i began to watch them i continued to watch them i did nothing but watch them  the sudden lowering of his voice in this confessionas if it had represented a sort of darkening of his consciousnessagain amused me you too how then weve been occupied for i you see have watchedor had until i found you just now with mrs servereveryone everything but you  oh ive watched you said ford obert as if he had then perhaps after all the advantage of me i admit that i made you out for myself to be back on the scent for i thought i made you out baffled  to learn whether i really had been was i saw what he would most have liked but i also saw that he had as to this a scruple about asking me what i most saw however was that to tell him i should have to understand what scent do you allude to  he smiled as if i might have fancied i could fence why the pursuit of the identification thats none of our businessthe identification of her lover  ah its as to that i instantly replied youve judged me baffled im afraid i almost as quickly added that i must admit i have been luckily at all events it is none of our business  yes said my friend amused on his side nothings our business that we cant find out i saw you hadnt found him and what obert continued does he matter now  it took but a moment to place me for seeing that my companions conviction on this point was a conviction decidedly to respect and even that amount of hesitation was but the result of my wondering how he had reached it what indeed i promptly replied but how did you see i had failed  by seeing that i myself had for ive been looking too he isnt here said ford obert  delighted as i was that he should believe it i was yet struck by the complacency of his confidence which connected itself again with my observation of their so recent colloquy oh for you to be so sure has mrs server squared you  is he here he for all answer to this insistently asked  i faltered but an instant no he isnt here its no thanks to ones scruples but perhaps its lucky for ones manners i speak at least for mine if youve watched i pursued youve doubtless sufficiently seen what has already become of mine he isnt here at all events i repeated and we must do without his identity what in fact are we showing each other i asked but that we have done without it  i have my friend declared with supreme frankness and with something of the note as i was obliged to recognise of my own constructive joy ive done perfectly without it  i saw in fact that he had and it struck me really as wonderful but i controlled the expression of my wonder so that if you spoke therefore just now of watching them  i meant of coursehe took it straight upwatching the brissendens and naturally above all he as quickly subjoined the wife  i was now full of concurrence ah naturally above all the wife  so far as was required it encouraged him a womans lover doesnt matterdoesnt matter at least to anyone but himself doesnt matter to you or to me or to herwhen once she has given him up  it made me this testimony of his observation show in spite of my having by this time so counted on it something of the vivacity of my emotion she has given him up  but the surprise with which he looked round put me back on my guard of what else then are we talking  of nothing else of course i stammered but the way you see i found my refuge in the gasp of my admiration  i do see buthe would come back to thatonly through your having seen first you gave me the pieces ive but put them together you gave me the brissendensbound hand and foot and ive but made them in that sorry state pull me through ive blown on my torch in other words till flaring and smoking it has guided me through a magnificent chiaroscuro of colour and shadow out into the light of day  i was really dazzled by his image for it represented his personal work youve done more than i it strikes meand with less to do it with if i gave you the brissendens i gave you all i had  but all you had was immense my dear man the brissendens are immense  of course the brissendens are immense if they hadnt been immense they wouldnt have beennothing would have beenanything then after a pause your image is splendid i went onyour being out of the cave but what is it exactly i insidiously threw out that you call the light of day  i remained a moment however not sure whether i had been too subtle or too simple he had another of his cautions what do you  but i was determined to make him give it me all himself for it was from my not prompting him that its value would come you tell me i accordingly rather crudely pleaded first  it gave us a moment during which he so looked as if i asked too much that i had a fear of losing all he even spoke with some impatience if you really havent found it for yourself you know i scarce see what you can have found  then i had my inspiration i risked an approach to roughness and all the more easily that my words were strict truth oh dont be afraidgreater things than yours  it succeeded for it played upon his curiosity and he visibly imagined that with impatience controlled he should learn what these things were he relaxed he responded and the next moment i was in all but full enjoyment of the piece wanted to make all my other pieces rightright because of that special beauty in my scheme through which the whole depended so on each part and each part so guaranteed the whole what i call the light of day is the sense ive arrived at of her vision  her visioni just balanced in the air  of what they have in common hispoor chapsextraordinary situation too  bravo and you see in that  what all these hours has touched fascinated drawn her it has been an instinct with her  bravissimo  it saw him my approval safely into port the instinct of sympathy pitythe response to fellowship in misery the sight of another fate as strange as monstrous as her own  i couldnt help jumping straight upi stood before him so that whoever may have been the man the man now the actual man  oh said obert looking luminous and straight up at me from his seat the man now the actual man but he stopped short with his eyes suddenly quitting me and his words becoming a formless ejaculation the door of the room to which my back was turned had opened and i quickly looked round it was brissenden himself who to my supreme surprise stood there with rapid inquiry in his attitude and face i saw as soon as he caught mine that i was what he wanted and immediately excusing myself for an instant to obert i anticipated by moving across the room the need on poor brisss part of my further demonstration my whole sense of the situation blazed up at the touch of his presence and even before i reached him it had rolled over me in a prodigious wave that i had lost nothing whatever i cant begin to say how the fact of his appearance crowned the communication my interlocutor had just made me nor in what a bright confusion of many things i found myself facing poor briss one of these things was precisely that he had never been so much poor briss as at this moment that ministered to the confusion as well as to the brightness for if his being there at all renewed my sources and replenished my currentspoke all in short for my gainso on the other hand in the light of what i had just had from obert his particular aspect was something of a shock i cant present this especial impression better than by the mention of my instant certitude that what he had come for was to bring me a message and that somehowyes indubitablythis circumstance seemed to have placed him again at the very bottom of his hole it was down in that depth that he let me see himit was out of it that he delivered himself poor briss poor brissi had asked myself before he spoke with what kindness enough i could meet him poor briss poor brissi am not even now sure that i didnt first meet him by that irrepressible murmur it was in it all for me that thus at midnight he had traversed on his errand the length of the great dark house i trod with him over the velvet and the marble through the twists and turns among the glooms and glimmers and echoes every inch of the way and i dont know what humiliation for him was constituted there between us by his long pilgrimage it was the final expression of his sacrifice  my wife has something to say to you  mrs briss goodand i could only hope the candour of my surprise was all i tried to make it is she with you there  no but she has asked me to say to you that if youll presently be in the drawingroom shell come  who could doubt as i laid my hand on his shoulder fairly patting it in spite of myself for applausewho could doubt where i would presently be its most uncommonly good of both of you  there was something in his inscrutable service that making him almost august gave my dissimulated eagerness the sound of a heartless compliment i stood for the hollow chatter of the vulgar world and heoh he was as serious as he was conscious which was enough she says youll know what she wishesand she was sure id find you here so i may tell her youll come  his courtesy half broke my heart why my dear man with all the pleasure so many thousand thanks ill be with her  thanks to you shell be down goodnight he looked round the roomat the two or three clusters of men smoking engaged contented on their easy seats and among their popped corks he looked over an instant at ford obert whose eyes i thought he momentarily held it was absolutely as if for me he were seeking such thingsout of what was closing over himfor the last time then he turned again to the door which just not to fail humanly to accompany him a step i had opened on the other side of it i took leave of him the passage though there was a light in the distance was darker than the smokingroom and i had drawn the door to  goodnight brissenden i shall be gone tomorrow before you show  i shall never forget the way that struck by my word he let his white face fix me in the dusk show what do i show  i had taken his hand for farewell and inevitably laughing but as the falsest of notes i gave it a shake you show nothing youre magnificent  he let me keep his hand while things unspoken and untouched unspeakable and untouchable everything that had been between us in the wood a few hours before were between us again but so we could only leave them and with a short sharp goodbye he completely released himself with my hand on the latch of the closed door i watched a minute his retreat along the passage and i remember the reflection that before rejoining obert i made on it i seemed perpetually at newmarch to be taking his measure from behind  ford obert has since told me that when i came back to him there were tears in my eyes and i didnt know at the moment how much the words with which he met me took for granted my consciousness of them he looks a hundred years old  oh but you should see his shoulders always as he goes off two centuriesten isnt it amazing  it was so amazing that for a little it made us reciprocally stare i should have thought he said that he would have been on the contrary  visibly rejuvenated so should i i must make it out i added i shall  but obert with less to go upon couldnt wait it was wonderful for that matterand for all i had to go uponhow i myself could i did so at this moment in my refreshed intensity by the help of confusedly lighting another cigarette which i should have no time to smoke i should have thought my friend continued that he too might have changed back  i took in for myself so much more of it than i could say certainly you wouldnt have thought he would have changed forward then with an impulse that bridged over an abyss of connections i jumped to another place was what you most saw while you were there with herwas this that her misery the misery you first phrased to me has dropped  dropped yes he was clear about it i called her beastly unhappy to you though i even then knew that beastly unhappiness wasnt quite all of it it was part of it it was enough of it for she waswell no doubt you could tell me just now at all eventsand recalling reflecting deciding he used with the strongest effect as he so often did in painting the simplest termjust now shes all right  all right  he couldnt know how much more than was possible my question gave him to answer but he answered it on what he had he repeated all right  i wondered in spite of the comfort i took as i had more than once in life had occasion to take it before at the sight of the paintersense deeply applied my wonder came from the fact that lady john had also found mrs server all right and lady john had a vision as closed as oberts was open it didnt suit my book for both these observers to have been affected in the same way you mean you saw nothing whatever in her that was the least bit strange  oh i wont say as much as that but nothing that was more strange than that she should bewell after all all right  all there eh i after an instant risked  i couldnt put it to him more definitely than that though there was a temptation to try to do so for obert to have found her all there an hour or two after i had found her all absent made me again in my nervousness feel even now a trifle menaced things had from step to step to hang together and just here they seemedwith all allowancesto hang a little apart my whole superstructure i could only remember reared itself on my view of mrs servers condition but it was part of my predicamentreally equal in its way to her ownthat i couldnt without dishonouring myself give my interlocutor a practical lead the question of her happiness was essentially subordinate what i stood or fell by was that of her faculty but i couldnt on the other handand remain straightinsist to my friend on the whereabouts of this stolen property if he hadnt missed it in her for himself i mightnt put him on the track of it since with the demonstration he had before my eyes received of the rate at which long was as one had to call it intellectually living nothing would be more natural than that he should make the cases fit now my personal problem unaltered in the least particular by anything was for me to have worked to the end without breathing in another ear that long had been her lover that was the only thing in the whole business that was simple it made me cling an instant the more both for bliss and bale to the bearing of this fact of oberts insistence even as a sequel to his vision of her change almost everything was wrong for her being all right except the one fact of my recent view from the window of the man unnamed i saw him again sharply in these seconds and to notice how he still kept clear of our company was almost to add certitude to the presumption of his rare reasons mrs servers being now by a wonderful turn all right would at least decidedly offer to these reasons a basis it would be something longs absence would fit it would supply ground in short for the possibility that by a process not less wonderful he himself was all wrong if he was all wrong my last impression of him would be amply accounted for if he was all wrongif he in any case felt himself going sowhat more consequent than that he should have wished to hide it and that the most immediate way for this should have seemed to him markedly gregarious as he usually was to keep away from the smokers it came to me unspeakably that he was still hiding it and was keeping away how accordingly must he notand must not mrs brisshave been in the spirit of this from the moment that while i talked with lady john the sight of these two seated together had given me its message but oberts answer to my guarded challenge had meanwhile come oh when a womans so clever  that was all with its touch of experience and its hint of philosophy but it was stupefying she was already then positively again so clever this was really more than i could as yet provide an explanation for but i was pressed brissenden would have reached his wifes room again and i temporised it was her cleverness that held you so that when i passed you couldnt look at me  he looked at me at present well enough i knew you were passing but i wanted precisely to mark for you the difference if you really want to know the poor man confessed i was a little ashamed of myself i had given her away to you you know rather before  and you were bound you wouldnt do it again  he smiled in his now complete candour ah there was no reason then he used happily to right himself my own expression she was all there  i seei see yet i really didnt see enough not to have for an instant to turn away  where are you going he asked  to do what brissenden came to me for  but i dont know you see what brissenden came to you for  well with a message she was to have seen me this evening but as she gave me no chance i was afraid i had lost it and that so rather awkwardly late she didnt venture but what he arrived for just now at her request was to say she does venture  my companion stared at this extraordinary hour  ah the hour i laughed is no more extraordinary than any other part of the business no more so for instance than this present talk of yours and mine what part of the business isnt extraordinary if it is at all events remarkably late thats her fault  yet he not unnaturally in spite of my explanation continued to wonder andawhere is it then you meet  oh in the drawingroom or the hall so goodnight  he got up to it moving with me to the door but his mystification little as i could on the whole soothe it still kept me the household sits up for you  i wondered myself but found an assurance she must have squared the household and it wont probably take us very long  his mystification frankly confessed itself at this plain curiosity the ground of such a conference for all the point i had given his ingenuity simply baffled him do you mean you propose to discuss with her  my dear fellow i smiled with my hand on the door its shedont you seewho proposes  but what in the world  oh that i shall have to wait to tell you  with all the other things his face while he sounded mine seemed to say that i must then take his expectation as serious but it seemed to say also that he wasdefinitely yesmore at a loss than consorted with being quite sure of me well it will make a lot really but he broke off you do he sighed with an effort at resignation know more than i  and havent i admitted that  ill be hanged if you dont know who he is the poor fellow for all answer now produced  he said it as if i had after all not been playing fair and it made me for an instant hesitate no i really dont know but its exactly what i shall perhaps now learn  you mean that what she has proposed is to tell you  his darkness had so deepened that i saw only now what i should have seen soonerthe misconception that in my excessive estimate of the distance he had come with me i had not at first caught but it was a misconception that only enriched his testimony it involved such a conviction of the new link between our two sacrificed friends that it immediately constituted for me the strongest light he would in our whole talk have thrown yes he had not yet thrown so much as in this erroneous supposition of the source of my summons it took me of course at the same time but a few seconds to remind myself again of the innumerable steps he had necessarily missed his question meanwhile rightly applied by my own thought brought back to that thought by way of answer an immense suggestion which moreover for him too was temporarily answer enough shell tell me who he wont have been  he looked vague ah but that  that i declared will be luminous  he made it out as a sign you think that he must be the very one she denies  the very one i laughed and i left him under this simple and secure impression that my appointment was with mrs server     xii   i went from one room to the other but to find only at first as on my previous circuit a desert on which the sun had still not set mrs brissenden was nowhere but the whole place waited as we had left it with seats displaced and flowers dispetalled a fan forgotten on a table a book laid down upon a chair it came over me as i looked about that if she had squared the household so large an order as they said was a sign sufficient of what i was to have from her i had quite rather it were her doingnot mine but it showed with eloquence that she had after all judged some effort or other to be worth her while her renewed delay moreover added to my impatience of mind in respect to the nature of this effort by striking me as already part of it what i asked myself could be so much worth her while as to have to be paid for by so much apparent reluctance but at last i saw her through a vista of open doors and as i forthwith went to hershe took no step to meet mei was doubtless impressed afresh with the pull that in social intercourse a woman always has she was able to assume on the spot by mere attitude and air the appearance of having been ready and therefore inconvenienced oh i saw soon enough that she was ready and that one of the forms of her readiness would be precisely to offer herself as having acted entirely to oblige meto give me as a sequel to what had already passed between us the opportunity for which she had assured me i should thank her before i had done with her yet as i felt sure at the same time that she had taken a line i was curious as to how in her interest our situation could be worked what it had originally left us with was her knowing i was wrong i had promised her on my honour to be candid but even if i were disposed to cease to contest her identification of mrs server i was scarce to be looked to for such an exhibition of gratitude as might be held to repay her for staying so long out of bed there were in short elements in the business that i couldnt quite clearly see handled as favours to me her dress gave with felicity no sign whatever of preparation for the night and if since our last words she had stood with any anxiety whatever before her glass it had not been to remove a jewel or to alter the place of a flower she was as much under arms as she had been on descending to dinneras fresh in her array as if that banquet were still to come she met me in fact as admirablythat was the truth that covered every otheras if she had been able to guess the most particular curiosity with which from my end of the series of rooms i advanced upon her  a part of the mixture of my thoughts during these seconds had been the possibilityabsurd preposterous though it looks when phrased hereof some change in her person that would correspond for me to the other changes i had had such keen moments of flattering myself i had made out i had just had them over in the smokingroom some of these differences and then had had time to ask myself if i were not now to be treated to the vision of the greatest the most wonderful of all i had already on facing her after my last moments with lady john seen difference peep out at me and i had seen the impression of it confirmed by what had afterwards happened it had been in her way of turning from me after that brief passage it had been in her going up to bed without seeing me again it had been once more in her thinking for reasons of her own better of that and it had been most of all in her sending her husband down to me well wouldnt it finally be still more than most of all but i scarce had known at this point what grossness or what fineness of material correspondence to forecast i only had waited there with these general symptoms so present that almost any further development of them occurred to me as conceivable so much as this was true but i was after a moment to become aware of something by which i was as strongly affected as if i had been quite unprepared yes literally that final note in the smokingroom the note struck in oberts ejaculation on poor brisss hundred years had failed to achieve for me a worthy implication i was forced after looking at grace brissenden a minute to recognise that my imagination had not risen to its opportunity the full impression took a minutea minute during which she said nothing then it left me deeply and above all as i felt discernibly conscious of the prodigious thing the thing i had not thought of this it was that gave her such a beautiful chance not to speak she was so quite sufficiently occupied with seeing what i hadnt thought of and with seeing me to make up for lost time breathlessly think of it while she watched me  all i had at first taken in was as i say her untouched splendour i dont know why that should have impressed meas if it had been probable she would have appeared in her dressinggown it was the only thing to have expected and it in fact plumed and enhanced her assurance sustained her propriety lent our belated interview the natural and casual note but there was another service it still more rendered her it so covered at the first blush the real message of her aspect that she enjoyed the luxuryand i felt her enjoy itof seeing my perception in arrest amazing when i think of it the number of things that occurred in these stayed seconds of our silence but they are perhaps best represented by the two most marked intensities of my own sensation the first the certitude that she had at no moment since her marriage so triumphantly asserted her defeat of time and the second the conviction that i losing with her while as it were we closed a certain advantage i should never recover had at no moment since the day before made so poor a figure on my own ground ah it may have been only for six seconds that she caught me gaping at her renewed beauty but six seconds it was inevitable to feel were quite enough for every purpose with which she had come down to me she might have been a large fair rich prosperous person of twentyfive she was at any rate near enough to it to put me for ever in my place it was a success on her part that though i couldnt as yet fully measure it there could be no doubt of whatever any more than of my somehow paying for it her being there at all at such an hour in such conditions became each moment on the whole business more and more a part of her advantage the case for her was really in almost any aspect she could now make it wear to my imagination my wealth of that faculty never so stimulated was thus in a manner her strength by which i mean the impossibility of my indifference to the mere immense suggestiveness of our circumstances how can i tell now to what tune the sense of all these played into my mindthe huge oddity of the nameless idea on which we foregathered the absence and hush of everything except that idea so magnified in consequence and yet still after all altogether fantastic there remained for her there spoke for her too her vividly unconventional step the bravery of her rustling on an understanding so difficult to give an account of through places and times only made safe by the sleep of the unsuspecting my imagination in short since i have spoken of it couldnt do other than work for her from the moment she had so simply yet so wonderfully not failed me therefore it was all with me again the vision of her reasons they were in fact sufficiently in the sound of what she presently said perhaps you dont knowbut i mentioned in the proper quarter that i should sit up a little theyre of a kindness here luckily so its all right it was all right obviouslyshe made it so but she made it so as well that in spite of the splendour she showed me she should be a little nervous we shall only take moreover she added a minute  i should perhaps have wondered more what she proposed to do in a minute had i not felt it as already more or less done yes she might have been twentyfive and it was a short time for that to have taken however what i clutched at what i clung to was that it was a nervous twentyfive i might pay for her assurance but wasnt there something of mine for which she might pay i was nervous also but as i took in again with a glance through our great chain of chambers the wonderful conditions that protected us i did my best to feel sure that it was only because i was so amused thatin so high a formwas what it came to in the end i supposed i replied that youd have arranged for in spite of the way things were going i hadnt given you up i havent understood i confess i went on why youve preferred a conference so intensely nocturnalof which i quite feel however that if it has happened to suit you it isnt for me to complain but i felt sure of youthat was the great thingfrom the moment half an hour ago you so kindly spoke to me i gave you you see i laughed whats called rope  i dont suppose you mean she exclaimed for me to hang myselffor that i assure you is not at all what im prepared for then she seemed again to give me the magnificence of her youth it wasnt throughout i was to feel that she at all had abysses of irony for she in fact happily needed none her triumph was in itself ironic enough and all her point in her sense of her freshness were you really so impatient but as i inevitably hung fire a little she continued before i could answer which somewhat helped me indeed by showing the one flaw in her confidence more extraordinary perhaps than anything else moreover was just my perception of this which gives the value of all that each of us so visibly felt the other to have put together to have been making out and gathering in since we parted on the terrace after seeing mrs server and briss come up from under their tree we had of a truth arrived at our resultsthough mine were naturally the ones for me to believe in and it was prodigious that we openly met not at all where we had last left each other but exactly on what our subsequent suppressed processes had achieved we hadnt named themhadnt alluded to them and we couldnt no doubt have done either but they were none the less intensely there between us with the whole bright empty scene given up to them only she had her shrewd sense that mine for reasons might have been still more occult than her own hadnt i possibly burrowed the deeperto come out in some uncalculated place behind her back that was the flaw in her confidence she had in spite of it her firm ground and i could feel to do her justice how different a complacency it was from such smug ignorance as lady johns if i didnt fear to seem to drivel about my own knowledge i should say that she had in addition to all the rest of her pull the benefit of striking me as worthy of me she was in the mystic circlenot one of us more she knew the size of it and it was our now being in it alone together with everyone else out and with the size greater than it had yet been at allit was this that gave the hour in fine so sharp a stamp  but she had meanwhile taken up my allusion to her having preferred so to wait i wanted to see you quietly which was what i triednot altogether successfully it rather struck me at the momentto make you understand when i let you know about it you stared so that i didnt quite know what was the matter nothing could be quiet i saw till the going to bed was over and i felt it coming off then from one minute to the other i didnt wish publicly to be called away for it from this putting of our heads together and though you may think me absurd i had a dislike to having our question of may up so long as she was hanging about i knew of course that she would hang about till the very last moment and that was what i perhaps a little clumsilyif it was my own faultmade the effort to convey to you she may be hanging about still mrs briss continued with her larger look roundher looks round were now immense but at any rate i shall have done what i could i had a feelingperfectly preposterous i admitagainst her seeing us together but if she comes down again as ive so boldly done and finds us shell have no one but herself to thank its a funny house for that matter my friend rambled on and im not sure that anyone has gone to bed one does what one likes im an old woman at any rate and i do she explained now she explained too much she abounded talking herself stoutly into any assurance that failed her i had meanwhile with every word she uttered a sharper sense of the pressure behind them all of a new consciousness it was full of everything she didnt say and what she said was no representation whatever of what was most in her mind we had indeed taken a jump since noonwe had indeed come out further on just this fine dishonesty of her eyes moreoverthe light of a part to play the excitement heaven knows what it struck me as being of a happy duplicitymay well have been what contributed most to her present grand air  it was in any case what evoked for me most the contrasted image so fresh with me of the other the tragic ladythe image that had so embodied the unutterable opposite of everything actually before me what was actually before me was the positive pride of life and expansion the amplitude of conscious action and design not the arid channel forsaken by the stream but the fullfed river sweeping to the sea the volume of water the stately current the flooded banks into which the source had swelled there was nothing mrs server had been able to risk but there was a rich indifference to risk in the mere carriage of grace brissendens head her reference for that matter to our discussed subject had the effect of relegating to the realm of dim shades the lady representing it and there was small soundness in her glance at the possibility on the part of this person of an anxious prowl back there was indeedthere could besmall sincerity in any immediate demonstration from a woman so markedly gaining time and getting her advantages in hand the connections between the two certainly were indirect and intricate but it was positive to me that for the spiritual ear my companions words had the sound of a hard bump a contact from the force of which the weaker vessel might have been felt to crack at last merciful powers it was in pieces the shock of the brass had told upon the porcelain and i fancied myself for an instant facing mrs briss over the damagea damage from which i was never as i knew to see the poor banished ghost recover as strange as anything was this effect almost of surprise for me in the freedom of her mention of may for what had she come to me if for anything but to insist on her view of may and what accordingly was more to the point than to mention her yet it was almost already as if to mention her had been to get rid of her she was mentioned however inevitably and none the less promptly aneweven as if simply to receive a final shake before being quite dropped my friend kept it up if you were so bent on not losing what i might have to give you that you fortunately stuck to the ship for poor briss to pick you up wasnt this alsoshe roundly put it to mea good deal because youve been nursing all day the grievance with which i this morning so comfortably furnished you  i just waited but fairly for admiration oh i certainly had my reasonsas ive no less certainly had my luckfor not indeed deserting our dear little battered but still just sufficiently buoyant vessel from which everyone else appears i recognise to sêtre sauvé shell float a few minutes more but before she sinks do you mean by my grievance  oh you know what i mean by your grievance she had no intention mrs briss of sinking i was to give you time to make up your mind that mrs server was our lady you so resented for some reason my suggesting it that i scarcely believed youd consider it at all only i hadnt forgotten when i spoke to you a while since that you had nevertheless handsomely promised me that you would do your best  yes and still more handsomely that if i changed my mind i would eat in your presence for my error the largest possible slice of humble pie if you didnt see this morning i continued quite why i should have cared so much so i dont quite see why in your different way you should at the same time that i do full justice to the good faith with which youve given me my chance please believe that if i could candidly embrace that chance i should feel all the joy in the world in repaying you its only alas because i cling to my candour that i venture to disappoint you if i cared this morning it was really simple enough you didnt convince me but i should have cared just as much if you had i only didnt see what you saw i needed more than you could then give me i knew you see what i neededi mean before i struck it was the element of collateral support that we both lacked i couldnt do without it as you could this was what i clumsily enough tried to show you i felt you on your side i pursued grasped admirably the evident truth that that element could be present only in such doses as practically to escape detection i kept it up as she had done and i remember striking myself as scarce less excitedly voluble i was conscious of being at a point at which i should have to go straight to go fast to go it as the phrase is blind in order to go at all i was also consciousand it came from the look with which she listened to me and that told me more than she wishedi felt sharply though but instinctively in fine that i should still whatever i practically had lost make my personal experience most rich and most complete by putting it definitely to her that sorry as i might be not to oblige her i had even at this hour no submission to make i doubted in fact whether my making one would have obliged her but i felt that for all so much had come and gone i was not there to take for her possible profit any new tone with her she would sufficiently profit at the worst by the old my old motiveold with the prodigious antiquity the few hours had given ithad quite left me i seemed to myself to know little now of my desire to protect mrs server she was certainly with mrs briss at least past all protection and the conviction had grown with me in these few minutes that there was now no rag of the queer truth that mrs briss hadnt secretlyby which i meant morallyhandled but i none the less on a perfectly simple reasoning stood to my guns and with no sense whatever i must add of now breaking my vow of the morning i had made another vow since thenmade it to the poor lady herself as we sat together in the wood passed my word to her that there was no approximation i pretended even to myself to have made how then was i to pretend to mrs briss and what facts had i collected on which i could respectably ground an acknowledgment to her that i had come round to her belief if i had caught our incriminated pair togetherreally togethereven for three minutes i would i sincerely considered have come round but i was to have performed this revolution on nothing less as i now went on to explain to her of course if youve got new evidence i shall be delighted to hear it and of course i cant help wondering whether the possession of it and the desire to overwhelm me with it arent together the one thing youve been nursing till now  oh how intensely she didnt like such a tone if she hadnt looked so handsome i would say she made a wry face over it though i didnt even yet see where her dislike would make her come out before she came out in fact she waited as if it were a question of dashing her head at a wall then at last she charged its nonsense ive nothing to tell you i feel theres nothing in it and ive given it up  i almost gapedby which i mean that i looked as if i didfor surprise you agree that its not she then as she again waited its you whove come round i insisted  to your doubt of its being may yesive come round  ah pardon me i returned what i expressed this morning was if i remember rightly not at all a doubt but a positive intimate conviction that was inconsistent with any doubt i was emphaticpurely and simplythat i didnt see it  she looked however as if she caught me in a weakness here then why did you say to me that if you should reconsider  you should handsomely have it from me and my grounds why as ive just reminded you as a form of courtesy to youmagnanimously to help you as it were to feel as comfortable as i conceived you naturally would desire to feel in your own conviction only for that and now i smiled im to understand from you that in spite of that immense allowance you havent all this while felt comfortable  she gave on this in a wonderful beautiful way a slow simplifying headshake mrs server isnt in it  the only way then to take it from her was that her concession was a prelude to something still better and when i had given her time to see this dawn upon me i had my eagerness and i jumped into the breathless youve made out then who is  oh i dont make out you know she laughed so much as you she isnt she simply repeated  i looked at it on my inspiration quite ruefullyalmost as if i now wished after all she were ah but do you know it really strikes me you make out marvels you made out this morning quite what i couldnt i hadnt put together anything so extraordinary as thatin the total absence of everythingit should have been our friend  mrs briss appeared on her side to take in the intention of this what do you mean by the total absence when i made my mistake she declared as if in the interest of her dignity i didnt think everything absent  i see i admitted i see i thoughtfully repeated and do you then think everything now  i had my honest impression of the moment she pursued as if she had not heard me there were appearances that as it at the time struck me fitted  preciselyand i recalled for her the one she had made most of there was in especial the appearance that she was at a particular moment using brissenden to show whom she was not using you felt then i ventured to observe the force of that  i ventured less than already i should have liked to venture yet i none the less seemed to see her try on me the effect of the intimation that i was going far is it your wish she inquired with much nobleness to confront me to my confusion with my inconsistency her nobleness offered itself somehow as such a rebuke to my mere logic that in my momentary irritation i might have been on the point of assenting to her question this imminence of my assent justified by my horror of her huge egotism but justified by nothing else and precipitating everything seemed as marked for these few seconds as if we each had our eyes on it but i sat so tight that the danger passed leaving my silence to do what it could for my manners she proceeded meanwhile to add a very handsome account of her own you should do me the justice to recognise how little i need have spoken another word to you and how little also this amiable explanation to you is in the interest of ones natural pride it seems to me ive come to you here altogether in the interest of yours you talk about humble pie but i think that upon my wordwith all ive said to youits i who have had to eat it the magnanimity you speak of she continued with all her grandeuri really dont see either whose it is but mine i dont see what account of anything im in any way obliged to give  i granted it quickly and without reserve youre not obliged to give anyyoure quite right you do it only because youre such a large splendid creature i quite feel that beside youi did at least treat myself to the amusement of sayingi move in a tiny circle still i wont have iti could also again keep it upthat our occasion has nothing for you but the taste of abasement you gulp your mouthful down but hasnt it been served on gold plate youve had a magnificent daya brimming cup of triumph and youre more beautiful and fresh after it all and at an hour when fatigue would be almost positively graceful than you were even this morning when you met me as a daughter of the dawn thats the sort of sense i laughed that must sustain a woman and i wound up on a complete recovery of my goodhumour no no i thank youthank you immensely but i dont pity you you can afford to lose i wanted her perplexitythe proper sharp dose of itto result both from her knowing and her not knowing sufficiently what i meant and when i in fact saw how perplexed she could be and how little again she could enjoy it i felt anew my private wonder at her having cared and dared to meet me where was enjoyment for her where the insolence of success if the breath of irony could chill them why since she was bold should she be susceptible and how since she was susceptible could she be bold i scarce know what at this moment determined the divination but everything the distinct and the dim alike had cleared up the next instant at the touch of the real truth the certitude of the source of my present opportunity had rolled over me before we exchanged another word the source was simply gilbert long and she was there because he had directed it this connection hooked itself like a sudden picture and with a click that fairly resounded through our empty rooms into the array of the other connections to the immense enrichment as it was easy to feel of the occasion and to the immense confirmation of the very idea that in the course of the evening i had come near dismissing from my mind as too fantastic even for the rest of the company it should enjoy there what i now was sure of flashed back at any rate every syllable of sense i could have desired into the suggestion i had after the music caught from the juxtaposition of these two thus solidified this conviction it spread and spread to a distance greater than i could just then traverse under mrs brisss eyes but which exactly for that reason perhaps quickened my pride in the kingdom of thought i had won i was really not to have felt more in the whole business than i felt at this moment that by my own right hand i had gained the kingdom long and she were together and i was alone thus in face of them but there was none the less not a single flower of the garden that my woven wreath should lack  i must have looked queer to my friend as i grinned to myself over this vow but my relish of the way i was keeping things together made me perhaps for the instant unduly rash i cautioned myself however fortunately before it could leave herscared a little all the same even with long behind heran advantage to take and in infinitely less time than i have needed to tell it i had achieved my flight into luminous ether and alighting gracefully on my feet reported myself at my post i had in other words taken in both the full prodigy of the entente between mrs servers lover and poor brisss wife and the finer strength it gave the lastnamed as the representative of their interest i may add too that i had even taken time fairly not to decide which of these two branches of my visionthat of the terms of their intercourse or that of their need of itwas likely to prove in delectable retrospect the more exquisite all this i admit was a good deal to have come and gone while my privilege trembled in its very essence in the scale mrs briss had but a back to turn and everything was over she had in strictness already uttered what saved her honour and her revenge on impertinence might easily be her withdrawing with one of her sweeps i couldnt certainly in that case hurry after her without spilling my cards as my accumulations of lucidity however were now such as to defy all leakage i promptly recognised the facilities involved in a superficial sacrifice and with one more glance at the beautiful fact that she knew the strength of longs hand i again went steadily and straight she was acting not only for herself and since she had another also to serve and as i was sure report to i should sufficiently hold her i knew moreover that i held her as soon as i had begun afresh i dont mean that anything alters the fact that you lose gracefully it is awfully charming your thus giving yourself up and yet justified as i am by it i cant help regretting a little the excitement i found it this morning to pull a different way from you shall i tell you it suddenly came to me to put to her what for some reason a man feels aware of and then as guarded still uneasy she would commit herself to no permission that pulling against you also had its thrill you defended your cause oh i quickly added i knowwho should know betterthat it was bad onlywhat shall i sayyou werent bad and one had to fight and then there was what one was fighting for well youre not bad now either so that you may ask me of course what more i want i tried to think a moment it isnt that thrown back on the comparative dullness of security i findas people have been known tomy own cause less good no it isnt that after which i had my illumination ill tell you what it is its the comedown of ceasing to work with you  she looked as if she were quite excusable for not following me to work  i immediately explained even fighting was working for we struck youll remember sparks and sparks were what we wanted there we are then i cheerfully went on sparks are what we still want and youve not come to me i trust with a mere spent match i depend upon it that youve another to strike i showed her without fear all i took for granted who then has  she was superb in her coldness but her stare was partly blank who then has what  why done it and as even at this she didnt light i gave her something of a jog you havent with the force of your revulsion i hope literally lost our thread but as in spite of my thus waiting for her to pick it up she did nothing i offered myself as fairly stooping to the carpet for it and putting it back in her hand done what we spent the morning wondering at who then if it isnt certainly mrs server is the woman who has made gilbert longwell what you know  i had needed the moment to take in the special shade of innocence she was by this time prepared to show me it was an innocence in particular in respect to the relation of anyone in all the vast impropriety of things to anyone im afraid i know nothing  i really wondered an instant how she could expect help from such extravagance but i thought you just recognised that you do enjoy the sense of your pardonable mistake you knew something when you knew enough to see you had made it  she faced me as with the frank perception that of whatever else one might be aware i abounded in traps and that this would probably be one of my worst oh i think one generally knows when one has made a mistake  thats all then i invite youa mistake as you properly call itto allow me to impute to you im not accusing you of having made fifty you made none whatever i hold when you agreed with me with such eagerness about the striking change in him  she affected me as asking herself a little on this whether vagueness the failure of memory the rejection of nonsense mightnt still serve her but she saw the next moment a better way it all came back to her but from so very far off the change do you mean in poor mr long  of what other changeexcept as you may say your ownhave you met me here to speak of your own i neednt remind you is part and parcel of longs  oh my own she presently returned is a much simpler matter even than that my own is the recognition that i just expressed to you and that i cant consent if you please to your twisting into the recognition of anything else its the recognition that i know nothing of any other change i stick if youll allow me to my ignorance  ill allow you with joy i laughed if youll let me stick to it with you your own change is quite sufficientit gives us all we need it will give us if we retrace the steps of it everything everything  mrs briss considered i dont quite see do i why at this hour of the night we should begin to retrace steps  simply because its the hour of the night youve happened in your generosity and your discretion to choose im struck i confess i declared with a still sharper conviction with the wonderful charm of it for our purpose  and pray what do you call with such solemnity she inquired our purpose  i had fairly recovered at lastso far from being solemnan appropriate gaiety i can only with positiveness answer for mine that has remained all day the sameto get at the truth not that is to relax my grasp of that tip of the tail of it which you so helped me this morning to fasten to if youve ceased to care to help me i pursued thats a difference indeed but why i candidly pleadingly asked should you cease to care it was more and more of a comfort to feel her imprisoned in her inability really to explain her being there to show herself as she was explained it only so far as she could express that which was just the freedom she could least take what on earth is between us anyhow i insisted but our confounded interest thats only quickened for me dont you see by the charming way youve come round and i dont see how it can logically be anything less than quickened for yourself were like the messengers and heralds in the tale of cinderella and i protest i assure you against any sacrifice of our dénoûment weve still the glass shoe to fit  i took pleasure at the moment in my metaphor but this was not the case i soon enough perceived with my companion how can i tell please she demanded what you consider youre talking about  i smiled it was so quite the question ford obert in the smokingroom had begun by putting me i hadnt to take time to remind myself how i had dealt with him and you knew i sighed so beautifully you glowed over it so this morning she continued to give me in every way her disconnection from this morning so that i had only to proceed youve not availed yourself of this occasion to pretend to me that poor mr long as you call him is after all the same limited person  that he always was and that you yesterday so suddenly discovered him to have ceased to befor with this she had waked up but she was still thinking how she could turn it you see too much  oh i know i doever so much too much and much as i see i express only half of itso you may judge i laughed but what will you have i see what i see and this morning for a good bit you did me the honour to do the same i returned also the compliment didnt i by seeing something of what you saw we put it the whole thing together and we shook the bottle hard im to take from you after this i wound up that what it contains is a perfectly colourless fluid  i paused for a reply but it was not to come so happily as from obert you talk too much said mrs briss  i met it with amazement why whom have i told  i looked at her so hard with it that her colour began to rise which made me promptly feel that she wouldnt press that point i mean youre carried awayyoure abused by a fine fancy so that with your art of putting things one doesnt know where one isnor if youll allow me to say so do i quite think you always do of course i dont deny youre awfully clever but you build up she brought out with a regret so indulgent and a reluctance so marked that she for some seconds fairly held the blowyou build up houses of cards  i had been impatient to learn what and frankly i was disappointed this broke from me after an instant doubtless with a bitterness not to be mistaken long isnt what he seems  seems to whom she asked sturdily  well call itfor simplicityto me for you seeand i spoke as to show what it was to seeit all stands or falls by that  the explanation presently appeared a little to have softened her if it all stood or fell only by that it stood or fell by something that for her comfort might be not so unsuccessfully disposed of she exhaled with the swell of her fine person a comparative blandnessseemed to play with the idea of a smile she had in short her own explanation the trouble with you is that you overestimate the penetration of others how can it approach your own  well yours had for a while i should say distinct moments of keeping up with it nothing is more possible i went on than that i do talk too much but ive done soabout the question in dispute between usonly to you i havent as i conceived we were absolutely not to do mentioned it to anyone else nor given anyone a glimpse of our difference if youve not understood yourself as pledged to the same reserve and have consequently i went on appealed to the light of other wisdom it shows at least that in spite of my intellectual pace you must more or less have followed me what am i not in fine to think of your intelligence i asked if deciding for a resort to headquarters youve put the question to long himself  the question she was straight out to sea again  of the identity of the lady  she slowly at this headed about to long himself     xiii   i had felt i could risk such directness only by making it extravagantby suggesting it as barely imaginable that she could so have played our game and during the instant for which i had now pulled her up i could judge i had been right it was an instant that settled everything for i saw her with intensity with gallantry too surprised but not really embarrassed recognise that of course she must simply lie i had been justified by making it so possible for her to lie it would have been a short cut i said and even more strikingly perhapsto do it justicea bold deed but it would have been in strictness a departurewouldnt itfrom our so distinguished little compact yet while i look at you i went on i wonder bold deeds are after all quite in your line and im not sure i dont rather want not to have missed so much possible comedy i have it for you from mr long himself that every appearance to the contrary notwithstanding his stupidity is unimpairedisnt that for the beauty of it after all what youve veraciously to give me we stood face to face a moment and i laughed out the beauty of it would be great  i had given her time i had seen her safely to shore it was quite what i had meant to do but she now took still better advantage than i had expected of her opportunity she not only scrambled up the bank she recovered breath and turned round do you imagine he would have told me  it was magnificent but i felt she was still to better it should i give her a new chance who the lady really is well hardly and thats why as you so acutely see the question of your having risked such a step has occurred to me only as a jest fancy indeedi piled it upyour saying to him were all noticing that youre so much less of an idiot than you used to be and weve different views of the miracle  i had been going on but i was checked without a word from her her look alone did it for though it was a look that partly spoiled her lie itby that very factsufficed to my confidence ive not spoken to a creature  it was beautifully said but i felt again the abysses that the mere saying of it covered and the sense of these wonderful things was not a little no doubt in my immediate cheer ah then were all right i could have rubbed my hands over it i mean however i quickly added only as far as that i dont at all feel comfortable about your new theory itself which puts me so wretchedly in the wrong  rather said mrs briss almost gaily wretchedly indeed in the wrong  yet onlyequally of course i returned after a brief brooding if i come within a conceivability of accepting it are you conscious that in default of longs own wordequivocal as that word would beyou press it upon me without the least other guarantee  and pray she asked what guarantee had you  for the theory with which we started why our recognised fact the change in the man you may say i pursued that i was the first to speak for him but being the first didnt in your view constitute a weakness when it came to your speaking yourself for mrs server by which i mean i added speaking against her  she remembered but not for my benefit well you then asked me my warrant and as regards mr long and your speaking against him  do you describe what i say as against him i immediately broke in  it took her but an instant surelyto have made him out horrid  i could only want to fix it horrid  why having such secrets she was roundly ready now sacrificing poor may  but you dear lady sacrificed poor may it didnt strike you as horrid then  well that was only she maintained because you talked me over  i let her see the full process of my takingor not takingthis in and who is it then thatif as you say youve spoken to no onehas as i may call it talked you under  she completed on the spot her statement of a moment before not a creature has spoken to me  i felt somehow the wish to make her say it in as many ways as possiblei seemed so to enjoy her saying it this helped me to make my tone approve and encourage youve communicated so little with anyone i didnt even make it a question  it was scarce yet however quite good enough so little ive not communicated the least mite  precisely but dont think me impertinent for having for a moment wondered what i should say to you if you had you know would be that you just accused me  accused you  of talking too much  it came back to her dim are we accusing each other  her tone seemed suddenly to put us nearer together than we had ever been at all dear no i laughednot each other only with each others help a few of our good friends  a few she handsomely demurred but one or two at the best  or at the worsti continued to laugh and not even those it after all appears very much  she didnt like my laughter but she was now grandly indulgent well i accuse no one  i was silent a little then i concurred its doubtless your best line and i really quite feel at all events that when you mentioned a while since that i talk too much you only meant too much to you  yesi wasnt imputing to you the same direct appeal i didnt suppose she explained thatto match your own supposition of meyou had resorted to may herself  you didnt suppose i had asked her the point was positively that she didnt yet it made us look at each other almost as hard as if she did no of course you couldnt have supposed anything so cruelall the more that as you knew i had not admitted the possibility  she accepted my assent but oddly enough with a sudden qualification that showed her as still sharply disposed to make use of any loose scrap of her embarrassed acuteness of course at the same time you yourself saw that your not admitting the possibility would have taken the edge from your cruelty its not the innocent she suggestively remarked that we fear to frighten  oh i returned i fear mostly i think to frighten any one im not particularly brave i havent at all events in spite of my certitude interrogated mrs server and i give you my word of honour that ive not had any denial from her to prop up my doubt it still stands on its own feet and it was its own battle that when i came here at your summons it was prepared to fight let me accordingly remind you i pursued in connection with that of the one sense in which you were as you a moment ago said talked over by me i persuaded you apparently that longs metamorphosis was not the work of lady john i persuaded you of nothing else  she looked down a little as if again at a trap you persuaded me that it was the work of somebody then she held up her head it came to the same thing  if i had credit then for my trap it at least might serve the same thing as what  why as claiming that it was she  poor mayclaiming when i insisted it wasnt  mrs brissenden flushed you didnt insist it wasnt anybody  why should i when i didnt believe so ive left you in no doubt i indulgently smiled of my beliefs it was somebodyand it still is  she looked about at the top of the room the mistakes now yours  i watched her an instant can you tell me then what one does to recover from such mistakes  one thinks a little  ah the more ive thought the deeper ive sunk and that seemed to me the case with you this morning i added the more you thought  well then she frankly declared i must have stopped thinking  it was a phenomenon i sufficiently showed that thought only could meet could you tell me then at what point  she had to think even to do that at what point  what in particular determined i mean your arrest you surely didntlaunched as you werestop short all of yourself  she fronted me after all still so bravely that i believed her for an instant not to be on this article without an answer she could produce the unexpected therefore broke for me when she fairly produced none i confess i dont make out she simply said while you seem so little pleased that i agree with you  i threw back in despair both head and hands but you poor dear thing you dont in the least agree with me you flatly contradict me you deny my miracle  i dont believe in miracles she panted  so i exactly at this late hour learn but i dont insist on the name nothing is i admit a miracle from the moment ones on the track of the cause which was the scent we were following call the thing simply my fact  she gave her high head a toss if its yours its nobody elses  ah theres just the questionif we could know all but my point is precisely for the present that you do deny it  of course i deny it said mrs briss  i took a moment but my silence held her your of course would be what i would again contest what i would denounce and brand as the word too muchthe word that spoils were it not that it seems best that it in any case seems necessary to let all question of your consistency go  on that i had paused and as i felt myself still holding her i was not surprised when my pause had an effect you do let it go  she had tried i could see to put the inquiry as all ironic but it was not all ironic it was in fact little enough so to suggest for me some intensificationnot quite i trust wantonof her suspense i should be at a loss to say indeed how much it suggested or half of what it told these things again almost violently moved me and if i after an instant in my silence turned away it was not only to keep her waiting but to make my elation more private i turned away to that tune that i literally for a few minutes quitted her availing myself thus superficially of the air of weighing a consequence i wandered off twenty steps and while i passed my hand over my troubled head looked vaguely at objects on tables and sniffed absently at flowers in bowls i dont know how long i so lost myself nor quite whyas i must for some time have kept it upmy companion didnt now really embrace her possible alternative of rupture and retreat or rather as to her action in this last matter i am and was on the spot clear i knew at that moment how much she knew she must not leave me without having got from me it came back in waves in wider glimpses and produced in so doing the excitement i had to control it could not but be exciting to talk as we talked on the basis of those suppressed processes and unavowed references which made the meaning of our meeting so different from its form we knew ourselveswhat moved me that is was that she knew meto mean at every point immensely more than i said or than she answered just as she saw me at the same points measure the space by which her answers fell short this made my conversation with her a totally other and a far more interesting thing than any colloquy i had ever enjoyed it had even a sharpness that had not belonged a few hours before to my extraordinary interview with mrs server she couldnt afford to quarrel with me for catechising her she couldnt afford not to have kept in her way faith with me she couldnt afford after inconceivable passages with long not to treat me as an observer to be squared she had come down to square me she was hanging on to square me she was suffering and stammering and lying she was both carrying it grandly off and letting it desperately go all all to square me and i caught moreover perfectly her vision of her way and i followed her way even while i judged it feeling that the only personal privilege i could after all save from the whole business was that of understanding i couldnt save mrs server and i couldnt save poor briss i could however guard to the last grain of gold my precious sense of their loss their disintegration and their doom and it was for this i was now bargaining  it was of giving herself away just enough not to spoil for me my bargain over my treasure that mrs brisss bribe would consist she would let me see as far as i would if she could feel sure i would do nothing and it was exactly in this question of how much i might have scared my couple into the sense i could do that the savour of my suspense most dwelt i could have made them uneasy of course only by making them fear my intervention and yet the idea of their being uneasy was less wonderful than the idea of my having with all my precautions communicated to them a consciousness this was so the last thing i had wanted to do that i felt during my swift excursion how much time i should need in the future for recovery of the processall of the finest windblown intimations woven of silence and secrecy and airby which their suspicion would have throbbed into life i could only provisionally and sketchily figure it out this suspicion as having little by littlenot with a sudden startfelt itself in the presence of my own just as my own now returned the compliment what came back to me as i have said in waves and wider glimpses was the marvel of their exchange of signals the phenomenon scarce to be represented of their breaking ground with each other they both had their treasure to guard and they had looked to each other with the instinct of help they had felt on either side the victim possibly slip and they had connected the possibility with an interest discernibly inspired in me by this personage and with a relation discoverably established by that interest it wouldnt have been a danger perhaps if the two victims hadnt slipped together and more amazing doubtless than anything else was the recognition by my sacrificing couple of the opportunity drawn by my sacrificed from being conjoined in my charity how could they know gilbert long and mrs briss that actively to communicate a consciousness to my other friends had no part in my plan the most i had dreamed of i could honourably feel was to assure myself of their independent possession of one these things were with me while as i have noted i made grace brissenden wait and it was also with me that though i condoned her deviation she must take it from me as a charity i had presently achieved another of my full revolutions and i faced her again with a view of her overture and my answer to her last question the terms were not altogether what my pity could have wished but i sufficiently kept everything together to have to see that there were limits to my choice yes i let it go your change of front though it vexes me a littleand ill in a moment tell you whyto have to but let us put it that its on a condition  change of front she murmured while she looked at me your expressions are not of the happiest  but i saw it was only again to cover a doubt my condition for her was questionable and i felt it would be still more so on her hearing what it was meanwhile however in spite of her qualification of it i had fallen back once and for all on pure benignity it scarce matters if im clumsy when youre practically so bland i wonder if youll understand i continued if i make you an explanation  most probably she answered as handsome as ever not  let me at all events try you its moreover the one i just promised which was no more indeed than the development of a feeling ive already permitted myself to show you i losei brought it outby your agreeing with me  lose  yes because while we disagreed you were in spite of that on the right side  and what do you call the right side  welli brought it out againon the same side as my imagination  but it gave her at least a chance oh your imagination  yesi know what you think of it youve sufficiently hinted how little that is but its precisely because you regard it as rubbish that i now appeal to you  she continued to guard herself by her surprises appeal i thought you were on the ground rather she beautifully smiled of dictation  well im that too i dictate my terms but my terms are in themselves the appeal i was ingenious but patient see  how in the world can i see  voyons then light or darkness my imagination rides me but of course if its all wrong i want to get rid of it you cant naturally help me to destroy the faculty itself but you can aid in the defeat of its application to a particular case it was because you so smiled before on that application that i valued even my minor difference with you and what i refer to as my loss is the fact that your frown leaves me struggling alone the best thing for me accordingly as i feel is to get rid altogether of the obsession the way to do that clearly since youve done it is just to quench the fire by the fire i mean the flame of the fancy that blazed so for us this morning what the deuce have you for yourself poured on it tell me i pleaded and teach me  equally with her voice her face echoed me again teach you  to abandon my false gods lead me back to peace by the steps youve trod by so much as they must have remained traceable to you shall i find them of interest and profit they must in fact be most remarkable wont they evenfor what i may find in thembe more remarkable than those we should now be taking together if we hadnt separated if we hadnt pulled up that was a proposition i could present to her with candour but before her absence of precipitation had permitted her much to consider it i had already followed it on youll just tell me however that since i do pull up and turn back with you we shall just have not separated well then so much the betteri see youre right but i want i earnestly declared not to lose an inch of the journey  she watched me now as a roman lady at the circus may have watched an exemplary christian the journey has been a very simple one she said at last with my mind made up on a single point it was taken at a stride  i was all interest on a single point then as almost excessively deliberate she still kept me you mean the still commonplace character of longsaconsciousness  she had taken at last again the time she required do you know what i think  its exactly what im pressing you to make intelligible  well said mrs briss i think youre crazy  it naturally struck me crazy  crazy  i turned it over but do you call that intelligible  she did it justice no i dont suppose it can be so for you if you are insane  i risked the long laugh which might have seemed that of madness if i am is lovely and whether or not it was the special sound in my ear of my hilarity i remember just wondering if perhaps i mightnt be dear woman its the point at issue  but it was as if she too had been affected its not at issue for me now  i gave her then the benefit of my stirred speculation it always happens of course that one is ones self the last to know youre perfectly convinced  she not ungracefully for an instant faltered but since i really would have it oh so far as what weve talked of is concerned perfectly  and its actually what youve come down then to tell me  just exactly what and if its a surprise to you she added that i should have come downwhy i can only say i was prepared for anything  anything i smiled  in the way of a surprise  i thought but her preparation was natural though in a moment i could match it do you know thats what i was too  prepared  for anything in the way of a surprise but only from you i explained and of courseyes i mused ive got it if i am crazy i went onits indeed simple  she appeared however to feel from the influence of my present tone the impulse in courtesy to attenuate oh i dont pretend its simple  no i thought that was just what you did pretend  i didnt suppose said mrs briss that youd like it i didnt suppose that youd accept it or even listen to it but i owed it to you she hesitated  you owed it to me to let me know what you thought of me even should it prove very disagreeable  that perhaps was more than she could adopt i owed it to myself she replied with a touch of austerity  to let me know im demented  to let you know im not we each looked i think when she had said it as if she had done what she said thats all  all i wailed ah dont speak as if it were so little its much its everything  its anything you will said mrs briss impatiently goodnight  goodnight i was aghast you leave me on it  she appeared to profess for an instant all the freshness of her own that she was pledged to guard i must leave you on something i couldnt come to spend a whole hour  but do you think its so quickly doneto persuade a man hes crazy  i havent expected to persuade you  only to throw out the hint  well she admitted it would be good if it could work in you but ive told you she added as if to wind up and have done what determined me  i beg your pardonoh i protested thats just what youve not told me the reason of your change  im not speaking she broke in of my change  ah but i am i declared with a sharpness that threw her back for a minute on her reserves its your change i again insisted thats the interesting thing if im crazy i must once more remind you you were simply crazy with me and how can i therefore be indifferent to your recovery of your wit or let you go without having won from you the secret of your remedy i shook my head with kindness but with decision you mustnt leave me till youve placed it in my hand  the reserves i had spoken of were not however to fail her i thought you just said that you let my inconsistency go  your moral responsibility for itperfectly but how can i show a greater indulgence than by positively desiring to enter into its history its in that sense that as i say i developed i do speak of your change there must have been a given moment when the need of itor when in other words the truth of my personal statedawned upon you that moment is the key to your whole positionthe moment for us to fix  fix it said poor mrs briss when you like  i had much rather i protested fix it when you like i wantyou surely must understand if i want anything of it at allto get it absolutely right then as this plea seemed still not to move her i once more compressed my palms you wont help me  she bridled at last with a higher toss it wasnt with such views i came i dont believe she went on a shade more patiently i dont believeif you want to know the reasonthat youre really sincere  here indeed was an affair not sincerei  not properly honest i mean in giving up  giving up what  why everything  everything is it a questioni staredof that  you would if you were honest  everything i repeated  again she stood to it everything  but is that quite the readiness ive professed  if it isnt then what is  i thought a little why isnt it simply a matter rather of the renunciation of a confidence  in your sense and your truth this she indicated was all she asked well what is that but everything  perhaps i reflected perhaps in fact it no doubt was well take it then for everything and its as so taking it that i renounce i keep nothing at all now do you believe im honest  she hesitated wellyes if you say so  ah i sighed i see you dont what can i do i asked to prove it  you can easily prove it you can let me go  does it strike you i considered that i should take your going as a sign of your belief  of what else then  why surely i promptly replied my assent to your leaving our discussion where it stands would constitute a very different symptom wouldnt it much rather represent i inquired a failure of belief on my own part in your honesty if you can judge me in short as only pretending  why shouldnt you she put in for me also judge me what have i to gain by pretending  ill tell you i returned laughing if youll tell me what i have  she appeared to ask herself if she could and then to decide in the negative if i dont understand you in any way of course i dont in that put it at any rate she now rather wearily quavered that one of us has as little to gain as the other i believe you she repeated there  thanks i smiled for the way you say it if you dont as you say understand me i insisted its because you think me crazy and if you think me crazy i dont see how you can leave me  she presently met this if i believe youre sincere in saying you give up i believe youve recovered and if i believe youve recovered i dont think you crazy its simple enough  then why isnt it simple to understand me  she turned about and there were moments in her embarrassment now from which she fairly drew beauty her awkwardness was somehow noble her sense of her predicament was in itself young is it ever she charmingly threw out  i felt she must see at this juncture how wonderful i found her and even that that impressionones whole consciousness of her personal victorywas a force that in the last resort was all on her side it was quite worth your while this sitting up to this hour to show a fellow how you bloom when other women are fagged if that was really with the truth that were so pulling about laid bare what you did most want to show why then youve splendidly triumphed and i congratulate and thank you no i quickly went on i daresay to do you justice the interpretation of my tropes and figures isnt ever perfectly simple you doubtless have driven me into a corner with my dangerous explosive and my only fair course must be therefore to sit on it till you get out of the room im sitting on it now and i think youll find you can get out as soon as youve told me this was the moment your change of view dawned upon you the moment of our exchanging a while ago in the drawingroom our few words  the light that under my last assurances had so considerably revived faded in her a little as she saw me again tackle the theme of her inconstancy but the prospect of getting rid of me on these terms made my inquiry none the less worth trying to face that moment she showed the effort to think back  i gave her every assistance it was when after the music i had been talking to lady john you were on a sofa not far from us with gilbert long and when on lady johns dropping me i made a slight movement toward you you most graciously met it by rising and giving me a chance while mr long walked away  it was as if i had hung the picture before her so that she had fairly to look at it but the point that she first in her effort took up was not superficially the most salient mr long walked away  oh i dont mean to say that that had anything to do with it  she continued to think to do with what  with the way the situation comes back to me now as possibly marking your crisis  she wondered was it a situation  thats just what im asking you was it was it the situation  but she had quite fallen away again i remember the moment you meanit was when i said i would come to you here but why should it have struck you as a crisis  it didnt in the least at the time for i didnt then know you were no longer with me but in the light of what ive since learned from you i seem to recover an impression which on the spot was only vague the impression i explained of your taking a decision that presented some difficulty but that was determined by something that had thenand even perhaps a little suddenlycome up for you thats the pointi continued to unfold my caseon which my question bears was this something your conclusion then and there that theres nothing in anything  she kept her distance in anything  and that i could only be accordingly out of my mind come i patiently pursued such a perception as that had at some instant or other to begin and im only trying to aid you to recollect when the devil it did  does it particularly matter mrs briss inquired  i felt my chin that depends a littledoesnt iton what you mean by matter it matters for your meeting my curiosity and that matters in its turn as we just arranged for my releasing you you may ask of course if my curiosity itself matters but to that fortunately my reply can only be of the clearest the satisfaction of my curiosity is the pacification of my mind weve granted weve accepted i again press upon you in respect to that precarious quantity its topsyturvy state only give me a lead i dont ask you for more let me for an instant see play before me any feeble reflection whatever of the flash of new truth that unsettled you  i thought for a moment that in her despair she would find something that would do but she only found it didnt come in a flash  i remained all patience it came little by little it began then perhaps earlier in the day than the moment to which i allude and yet i continued we were pretty well on in the day i must keep in mind when i had your last news of your credulity  my credulity  call it then if you dont like the word your sympathy  i had given her time however to produce at last something that it visibly occurred to her might pass as soon as i was not with youi mean with you personallyyou never had my sympathy  is my person then so irresistible  well she was brave it was but its not thank god now  then there we are again at our mystery i dont think you know i made out for her it was my person really that gave its charm to my theory i think it was much more my theory that gave its charm to my person my person i flatter myself has remained through these few hourshours of tension but of a tension you see purely intellectualas good as ever so that if were not even in our anomalous situation in danger from any such source its simply that my theory is dead and that the blight of the rest is involved  my words were indeed many but she plumped straight through them as soon as i was away from you i hated you  hated me  well hated what you call the resthated your theory  i see yet i reflected youre not at presentthough you wish to goodness no doubt you wereaway from me  oh i dont care now she said with courage sincefor you see i believe youwere away from your delusions  you wouldnt in spite of your beliefi smiled at herlike to be a little further off yet but before she could answer and because also doubtless the question had too much the sound of a taunt i came up as if for her real convenience quite in another place perhaps my ideamy timing that is of your crisisis the result in my mind of my own association with that particular instant it comes back to me that what i was most full of while your face signed to me and your voice then so graciously confirmed it and while too as ive said long walked awaywhat i was most full of as a consequence of another go just ended at lady john was once more this same lady johns want of adjustability to the character you and i in our associated speculation of the morning had so candidly tried to fit her with i was still even then you see speculatingall on my own hook alasand it had just rolled over me with renewed force that she was nothing whatever not the least little bit to our purpose the moment in other words if you understand happened to be one of my moments so that by the same token i simply wondered if it mightnt likewise have happened to be one of yours  it was one of mine mrs briss replied as promptly as i could reasonably have expected in the sense thatas youve only to considerit was to lead more or less directly to these present words of ours  if i had only to consider nothing was more easy but each time i considered i was ready to show the less there seemed left by the act ah but you had then already backed out wont you understandfor youre a little discouragingthat i want to catch you at the earlier stage  to catch me i had indeed expressions  absolutely catch focus you under the first shock of the observation that was to make everything fall to pieces for you  but ive told you she stoutly resisted that there was no first shock  well then the second or the third  there was no shock mrs briss magnificently said at all  it made me somehow break into laughter you found it so natural thenand you so rather liked itto make up your mind of a sudden that you had been steeped in the last intellectual intimacy with a maniac  she thought once more and then as i myself had just previously done came up in another place i had at the moment you speak of wholly given up any idea of lady john  but it was so feeble it made me smile of course you had you poor innocent you couldnt otherwise hours before have strapped the saddle so tight on another woman  i had given up everything she stubbornly continued  its exactly what in reference to that juncture i perfectly embrace  well even in reference to that juncture she resumed you may catch me as much as you like with which suddenly during some seconds i saw her hold herself for a leap you talk of focussing but what else even in those minutes were you in fact engaged in  ah then you do recognise them i criedthose minutes  she took her jump though with something of a flop yesas consenting thus to be catechised i cudgel my brain for your amusementi do recognise them i remember what i thought you focussedi felt you focus i saw you wonder whereabouts in what you call our associated speculation i would by that time be i asked myself whether youd understand if i should try to convey to you simply by my expression such a look as would tell you all by all i meant the fact that sorry as i was for youor perhaps for myselfit had struck me as only fair to let you know as straight as possible that i was nowhere that was why i stared so and i of course couldnt explain to you she lucidly pursued to whom my stare had reference  i hung on her lips but you can now  perfectly to mr long  i remained suspended ah but this is lovely its what i want  i saw i should have more of it and more in fact came you were saying just now what you were full of and i can do the same i was full of him  i on my side was now full of eagerness yes he had left you full as he walked away  she winced a little at this renewed evocation of his retreat but she took it as she had not done before and i felt that with another push she would be fairly afloat he had reason to walk  i wondered what had you said to him  she pieced it out nothingor very little but i had listened  and to what  to what he says to his platitudes  his platitudes i stared longs  why dont you know hes a prize fool  i mused sceptical but reasonable he was  he is  mrs briss was superb but as i quickly felt i might remind her there was her possibly weak judgment your confidence is splendid only mustnt i remember that your sense of the finer kinds of cleverness isnt perhaps absolutely secure dont you knowyou also till just now thought me a prize fool  if i had hoped however here to trip her up i had reckoned without the impulse and even perhaps the example that she properly owed to me oh nonot anything of that sort you at all only an intelligent man gone wrong  i followed but before i caught up whereas longs only a stupid man gone right i threw out  it checked her too briefly and there was indeed something of my own it brought straight back i thought that just what you told me this morning or yesterday was that you had never known a case of the conversion of an idiot  i laughed at her readiness well i had wanted to make her fight its true it would have been the only one  ah youll have to do without it oh she was brisk now and if you know what i think of him you know no more than he does  you mean you told him  she hung fire but an instant i told him practicallyand it was in fact all i did have to say to him it was enough however and he disgustedly left me on it then it was that as you gave me the chance i tried to telegraph youto say to you on the spot and under the sharp impression what on earth do you mean by your nonsense it doesnt hold water its a pity i didnt succeed she continuedfor she had become almost voluble it would have settled the question and i should have gone to bed  i weighed it with the grimace that i feared had become almost as fixed as mrs servers it would have settled the question perhaps but i should have lost this impression of you  oh this impression of me  ah but dont undervalue it its what i want what was it then long had said  she had it more and more but she had it as nothing at all not a word to repeatyou wouldnt believe he does say nothing at all one cant remember its what i mean i tried him on purpose while i thought of you but hes perfectly stupid i dont see how we can have fancied i had interrupted her by the movement with which again uncontrollably tossed on one of my surges of certitude i turned away how deep they must have been in together for her to have so at last gathered herself up and in how doubly interesting a light above all it seemed to present long for the future that was while i warned myself what i most read inliterally an implication of the enhancement of this latter side of the prodigy if his cleverness under the alarm that first stirring their consciousness but dimly had so swiftly developed as to make next of each a mirror for the other and then to precipitate for them in some silence deeper than darkness the exchange of recognitions admissions and as they certainly would have phrased it tipsif his excited acuteness was henceforth to protect itself by dissimulation what wouldnt perhaps for ones diversion be the new spectacle and wonder i could in a manner already measure this larger play by the amplitude freshly determined in mrs briss and i was for a moment actually held by the thought of the possible finish our friend would find it in him to give to a represented a fictive ineptitude the sharpest jostle to my thought in this rush might well have been i confess the reflection that as it was i who had arrested who had spoiled their unconsciousness so it was natural they should fight against me for a possible life in the state i had given them instead i had spoiled their unconsciousness i had destroyed it and it was consciousness alone that could make them effectively cruel therefore if they were cruel it was i who had determined it inasmuch as consciously they could only want they could only intend to live wouldnt that question have been i managed even now to ask myself the very basis on which they had inscrutably come together its life you know each had said to the other and i accordingly can only cling to mine but you poor dearshall you give up give up the other had replied for what do you take me i shall fight by your side please and we can compare and exchange weapons and manoeuvres and you may in every way count upon me  that was what with greater vividness was for the rest of the occasion before me or behind me and that i had done it all and had only myself to thank for it was what from this minute by the same token was more and more for me the inner essence of mrs brisss attitude i know not what heavy admonition of my responsibility had thus suddenly descended on me but nothing under it was indeed more sensible than that practically it paralysed me and i could only say to myself that this was the pricethe price of the secret success the lonely liberty and the intellectual joy there were things that for so private and splendid a revelthat of the exclusive king with his wagner operai could only let go and the special torment of my case was that the condition of light of the satisfaction of curiosity and of the attestation of triumph was in this direct way the sacrifice of feeling there was no point at which my assurance could by the scientific method judge itself complete enough not to regard feeling as an interference and in consequence as a possible check if it had to go i knew well who went with it but i wasnt there to save them i was there to save my priceless pearl of an inquiry and to harden to that end my heart i should need indeed all my hardness as well as my brightness moreover to meet mrs briss on the high level to which i had at last induced her to mount and even while i prolonged the movement by which i had momentarily stayed her the intermission of her speech became itself for me a hint of the peculiar pertinence of caution it lasted long enough this drop to suggest that her attention was the sharper for my having turned away from it and i should have feared a renewed challenge if she hadnt by good luck presently gone on theres really nothing in him at all     xiv   i had faced her again just in time to take it and i immediately made up my mind how best to do so then i go utterly to pieces  you shouldnt have perched yourself she laughedshe could by this time almost coarsely laughin such a preposterous place  ah thats my affair i returned and if i accept the consequences i dont quite see what youve to say to it that i do accept themso far as i make them out as not too intolerable and you as not intending them to bethat i do accept them is what ive been trying to signify to you only my fall i added is an inevitable shock you remarked to me a few minutes since that you didnt recover yourself in a flash i differ from you you see in that i do i take my collapse all at once here then i am im smashed i dont see as i look about me a piece i can pick up i dont attempt to account for my going wrong i dont attempt to account for yours with me i dont attempt to account for anything if long is just what he always was it settles the matter and the special clincher for us can be but your honest final impression made precisely more aware of itself by repentance for the levity with which you had originally yielded to my contagion  she didnt insist on her repentance she was too taken up with the facts themselves oh but add to my impression everyone elses impression has anyone noticed anything  ah i dont know what anyone has noticed i havent i brooded venturedas you knowto ask anyone  well if you had youd have seenseen i mean all they dont see if they had been conscious theyd have talked  i thought to me  well im not sure to you people have such a notion of what you embroider on things that theyre rather afraid to commit themselves or to lead you on theyre sometimes in you know she luminously reminded me for more than they bargain for than they quite know what to do with or than they care to have on their hands  i tried to do justice to this account of myself you mean i see so much  it was a delicate matter but she risked it dont you sometimes see horrors  i wondered well names are a convenience people catch me in the act  they certainly think you critical  and is criticism the vision of horrors  she couldnt quite be sure where i was taking her it isnt perhaps so much that you see them  i started as that i perpetrate them  she was sure now however and wouldnt have it for she was serious dear noyou dont perpetrate anything perhaps it would be better if you did she tossed off with an odd laugh butalways by peoples ideayou like them  i followed horrors  well you dont  yes  but she wouldnt be hurried now you take them too much for what they are you dont seem to want  to come down on them strong oh but i often do  so much the better then  though i do likewhether for that or not i hastened to confess to look them first well in the face  our eyes met with this for a minute but she made nothing of that when they have no face then you cant do it it isnt at all events now a question she went on of peoples keeping anything back and youre perhaps in any case not the person to whom it would first have come  i tried to think then who the person would be it would have come to long himself  but she was impatient of this oh one doesnt know what comesor what doesntto long himself im not sure hes too modest to misrepresentif he had the intelligence to play a part  which he hasnt i concluded  which he hasnt its to me they might have spokenor to each other  but i thought you exactly held they had chattered in accounting for his state by the influence of lady john  she got the matter instantly straight not a bit that chatter was mine onlyand produced to meet yours there had so by your theory to be a woman  that to oblige me you invented her precisely but i thought  you neednt have thought mrs briss broke in i didnt invent her  then what are you talking about  i didnt invent her she repeated looking at me hard shes true i echoed it in vagueness though instinctively again in protest yet i held my breath for this was really the point at which i felt my companions forces most to have mustered her manner now moreover gave me a great idea of them and her whole air was of taking immediate advantage of my impression well see here since youve wanted it im afraid that however little you may like it youll have to take it youve pressed me for explanations and driven me much harder than you must have seen i found convenient if ive seemed to beat about the bush its because i hadnt only myself to think of one can be simple for ones selfone cant be always for others  ah to whom do you say it i encouragingly sighed not even yet quite seeing for what issue she was heading  she continued to make for the spot whatever it was with a certain majesty i should have preferred to tell you nothing more than what i have told you i should have preferred to close our conversation on the simple announcement of my recovered sense of proportion but you have i see got me in too deep  ooh i courteously attenuated  youve made of me she lucidly insisted too big a talker too big a thinker of nonsense  thank you i laughed for intimating that i trifle so agreeably  oh youve appeared not to mind but let me then at last not fail of the luxury of admitting that i mind yes i mind particularly i may be bad but ive a grain of gumption  bad it seemed more closely to concern me  bad i may be in fact she pursued at this high pitch and pressure theres no doubt whatever i am  im delighted to hear it i cried for it was exactly something strong i wanted of you  it is then strongand i could see indeed she was ready to satisfy me youve worried me for my motive and harassed me for my moment and ive had to protect others and at the cost of a decent appearance to pretend to be myself half an idiot ive had even for the same purposeif you must have itto depart from the truth to give you that is a false account of the manner of my escape from your tangle but now the truth shall be told and others can take care of themselves she had so wound herself up with this reached so the point of fairly heaving with courage and candour that i for an instant almost miscalculated her direction and believed she was really throwing up her cards it was as if she had decided on some still finer lines just to rub my nose into what i had been spelling out which would have been an anticipation of my own journeys crown of the most disconcerting sort i wanted my personal confidence but i wanted nobodys confession and without the journeys crown where was the personal confidence without the personal confidence moreover where was the personal honour that would be really the single thing to which i could attach authority for a confession might after all be itself a lie anybody at all events could fit the shoe to one my friends intention however remained but briefly equivocal my danger passed and i recognised in its place a still richer assurance it was not the unnamed in short who were to be named lady john is the woman  yet even this was prodigious but i thought your present position was just that shes not  lady john is the woman mrs briss again announced  but i thought your present position was just that nobody is  lady john is the woman she a third time declared  it naturally left me gaping then there is one i cried between bewilderment and joy  a woman theres her mrs briss replied with more force than grammar i know she briskly almost breezily added that i said she wouldnt do as i had originally said she would do better than any one when you a while ago mentioned her but that was to save her  and you dont care now i smiled if shes lost  she hesitated she is lost but she can take care of herself  i could but helplessly think of her im afraid indeed that with what youve done with her i cant take care of her but why is she now to the purpose i articulately wondered any more than she was  why on the very system you yourself laid down when we took him for brilliant she couldnt be but now that we see him as he is  we can only see her also as she is well i tried as far as my amusement would permit so to see her but still there were difficulties possibly i at most conceded do you owe your discovery however wholly to my system my system where so much made for protection i explained wasnt intended to have the effect of exposure  it appears to have been at all events intended my companion returned to have the effect of driving me to the wall and the consequence of that effect is nobodys fault but your own  she was all logic now and i could easily see between my light and my darkness how she would remain so yet i was scarce satisfied and its only on that effect  that ive made up my mind she was positively free at last to enjoy my discomfort wouldnt it be surely if your ideas were worth anything enough but it isnt she added only on that its on something else  i had after an instant extracted from this the single meaning it could appear to yield im to understand that you know  that theyre intimate enough for anything she faltered but she brought it out i know  it was the oddest thing in the world for a little the way this affected me without my at all believing it it was preposterous hang though it would with her somersault and she had quite succeeded in giving it the note of sincerity it was the mere sound of it that as i felt even at the time made it a little of a blowa blow of the smart of which i was conscious just long enough inwardly to murmur what if she should be right she had for these seconds the advantage of stirring within me the memory of her having indeed the day previous at paddington known as i hadnt it had been really on what she then knew that we originally started and an element of our start had been that i admired her freedom the form of it at leastso beautifully had she recovered herselfwas all there now well i at any rate reflected it wasnt the form that need trouble me and i quickly enough put her a question that related only to the matter of course if she isit is smash  and havent you yet got used to its being  i kept my eyes on her i traced the buried figure in the ruins shes good enough for a fool and soi made it outis he if he is the same assyesthey might be  and he is said mrs briss the same ass  i continued to look at her he would have no need then of her having transformed and inspired him  or of her having deformed and idiotised herself my friend subjoined  oh how it sharpened my look no noshe wouldnt need that  the great point is that he wouldnt mrs briss laughed  i kept it up she would do perfectly  mrs briss was not behind my dear man she has got to do  this was brisker still but i held my way almost anyone would do  it seemed for a little between humour and sadness to strike her almost anyone would still she less pensively declared we want the right one  surely the right onei could only echo it but how i then proceeded has it happily been confirmed to you  it pulled her up a trifle confirmed  that hes her lover  my eyes had been meeting hers without as it were hers quite meeting mine but at this there had to be intercourse by my husband  it pulled me up a trifle brissenden knows  she hesitated then as if at my tone gave a laugh dont you suppose ive told him  i really couldnt but admire her ahso you have talked  it didnt confound her ones husband isnt talk youre cruel moreover she continued to my joke it was briss poor dear who talkedthough i mean only to me he knows  i cast about since when  but she had it ready since this evening  once more i couldnt but smile just in time then and the way he knows  oh the wayshe had at this a slight drop but she came up again i take his word  you havent then asked him  the beauty of it washalf an hour ago upstairsthat i hadnt to ask he came out with it himself and thatto give you the whole thingwas if you like my moment he dropped it on me she continued to explain without in the least sweet innocent knowing what he was doing more at least that is than give her away  which i concurred was comparatively nothing  but she had no ear for irony and she made out still more of her story hes simplebut he sees  and when he seesi completed the picturehe luckily tells  she quite agreed with me that it was lucky but without prejudice to his acuteness and to what had been in him moreover a natural revulsion he has seen in short there comes some chance when one does his as luckily as you please came this evening if you ask me what it showed him you ask more than ive either cared or had time to ask do you consider for that mattershe put it to methat one does ask as her high smoothnesssuch was the wonder of this reascendancyalmost deprived me of my means she was wise and gentle with me let us leave it alone  i fairly while my look at her turned rueful scratched my head dont you think it a little late for that  late for everything she impatiently said but there you are  i fixed the floor there indeed i was but i tried to stay therejust there onlyas short a time as possible something moreover after all caught me up but if brissenden already knew  if he knew she still gave me without prejudice to her ingenuityand indeed it was a part of thisall the work she could  why that long and lady john were thick  ah then she cried you admit they are  am i not admitting everything you tell me but the more i admit i explained the more i must understand its to admit you see that i inquire if briss came down with lady john yesterday to oblige mr long  he didnt come she interrupted to oblige mr long  well then to oblige lady john herself  he didnt come to oblige lady john herself  well then to oblige his clever wife  he didnt come to oblige his clever wife he came said mrs briss just to amuse himself he has his amusements and its odd she remarkably laughed that you should grudge them to him  it would be odd indeed if i did but put his proceeding i continued on any ground you like you described to me the purpose of it as a screening of the pair  i described to you the purpose of it as nothing of the sort i didnt describe to you the purpose of it said mrs briss at all i described to you she triumphantly set forth the effect of itwhich is a very different thing  i could only meet her with admiration youre of an astuteness  of course im of an astuteness i see effects and i saw that one how much briss himself had seen it is as ive told you another matter and what he had at any rate quite taken the affair for was the sort of flirtation in which if one is a friend to either party and ones own feelings are not at stake one may now and then give people a lift havent i asked you before she demanded if you suppose he would have given one had he had an idea where these people are  i scarce know what you have asked me before i sighed and where they are is just what you havent told me  its where my husband was so annoyed unmistakably to discover them and as if she had quite fixed the point she passed to another hes peculiar dear old briss but in a way by which if one uses himby which i mean if one depends on himat all one gains i think more than one loses up to a certain point in any case thats the least a case for subtlety he sees nothing at all but beyond itwhen once he does wake uphell go through a house nothing then escapes him and what he drags to light is sometimes appalling  rather i thoughtfully respondedsince witness this occasion  but isnt the interest of this occasion as ive already suggested she propounded simply that it makes an end bursts a bubble rids us of an incubus and permits us to go to bed in peace i thank god she moralised for dear old briss tonight  so do i i after a moment returned but i shall do so with still greater fervour if youll have for the space of another question a still greater patience with which as a final movement from her seemed to say how much this was to ask i had on my own side a certain exasperation of soreness for all i had to acknowledgeeven were it mere acknowledgmentthat she had brought rattling down remember i pleaded that youre costing me a perfect palace of thought  i could see too that held unexpectedly by something in my tone she really took it in couldnt i even almost see that for an odd instant she regretted the blighted pleasure of the pursuit of truth with me i needed at all events no better proof either of the sweet or of the bitter in her comprehension than the accent with which she replied oh those who live in glass houses  shouldntno i know they shouldntthrow stones and thats precisely why i dont i had taken her immediately up and i held her by it and by something better still you from your fortress of granite can chuck them about as you will all the more reason however i quickly added that before my frail but as i maintain quite sublime structure you honour me for a few seconds with an intelligent look at it i seem myself to see it again perfect in every part i pursued even while i thus speak to you and to feel afresh that werent the wretched accident of its weak foundation it wouldnt have the shadow of a flaw ive spoken of it in my conceivable regret i conceded as already a mere heap of disfigured fragments but that was the extravagance of my vexation my despair its in point of fact so beautifully fitted that it comes apart piece by piecewhich so far as that goes youve seen it do in the last quarter of an hour at your own touch quite handing me the pieces one by one yourself and watching me stack them along the ground theyre not even in this statesee i wound upa pile of ruins i wound up as i say but only for long enough to have with the vibration the exaltation of my eloquence my small triumph as against her great one i should almost like piece by piece to hand them back to you and this time i completed my figure i believe that for the very charm of it youd find yourself placing them by your own sense in their order and rearing once more the splendid pile will you take just one of them from me again i insisted and let me see if only to have it in your hands doesnt positively start you off thats what i meant just now by asking you for another answer she had remained silent as if really in the presence of the rising magnificence of my metaphor and it was not too late for the one chance left me there was nothing you know i had so fitted as your account of poor mrs server when on our seeing them from the terrace together below you struck off your explanation that old briss was her screen for long  fittedand there was sincerity in her surprise i thought my stupid idea the one for which you had exactly no use  i had no use i instantly concurred for your stupid idea but i had great use for your stupidly alas having it that fitted beautifully i smiled till the piece came out and even now i added i dont feel it quite accounted for  their being there together  no your not liking it that they were  she stared not liking it  i could see how little indeed she minded now but i also kept the thread of my own intellectual history yes your not liking it is what i speak of as the piece i hold it you see up before you what artistically would you do with it  but one might take a horse to water i held it up before her but i couldnt make her look at it how do you know what i maynt or may have liked  it did bring me to because you were conscious of not telling me well even if you didnt  that made no difference she inquired with a generous derision because you could always imagine of course you could always imaginewhich is precisely what is the matter with you but im surprised at your coming to me with it once more as evidence of anything  i stood rebuked and even more so than i showed her for she need obviously only decline to take one of my counters to deprive it of all value as coin when she pushed it across i had but to pocket it again it is the weakness of my case i feebly and i daresay awkwardly mused at her that any particular thing you dont grant me becomes straightway the strength of yours of course howeverand i gave myself a shakeim absolutely rejoicing am i not in the strength of yours the weakness of my own is what under your instruction im now going into but dont you see how much weaker it will show if i draw from you the full expression of your indifference how could you in fact care when what you were at the very moment urging on me so hard was the extravagance of mrs servers conduct that extravagance then proved her to your eyes the woman who had a connection with long to keep the world off the scent ofthough you maintained that in spite of the dust she kicked up by it she was at a pinch now and then to be caught with him that instead of being caught with him she was caught only with brissenden annoyed you naturally for the moment but what was that annoyance compared to your appreciation of her showingby undertaking your husband of all peoplejust the more markedly as extravagant  she had been sufficiently interested this time to follow me what was it indeed  i greeted her acquiescence but i insisted and yet if she is extravagantwhat do you do with it  i thought you wouldnt hear of it she exclaimed  i sought to combine firmness with my mildness what do you do with it  but she could match me at this i thought you wouldnt hear of it  its not a question of my dispositions its a question of her having been or not been for you all over the place and of everyones also being for you on the chatter about it you go by that in respect to longby your holding that is that nothing has been noticed therefore mustnt you go by it in respect to hersince i understand from you that everything has  everything always is mrs briss agreeably replied in a place and a party like this but so littleanything in particularthat with people moving every which way it comes to the same as if nothing was things are not also gouged out to your tune and it depends still further on what you mean by extravagant  i mean whatever you yourself meant  well i myself mean no longer you know what i did mean  she isnt then  but suddenly she was almost sharp with me isnt what  what the woman we so earnestly looked for would have to be  all gone she had hesitated but she went on with decision no she isnt all gone since there was enough of her left to make up to poor briss  preciselyand its just what we saw and just what with her other dashes of the same sort led us to have to face the question of her beingwell what i say or rather i added what you say that is i amended to keep perfectly straight what you say you dont say  i took indeed too many precautions for my friend not to have to look at them extravagant the irritation of the word had grown for her yet i risked repeating it and with the effect of its giving her another pause i tell you she isnt that  exactly and its only to ask you what in the world then she is  shes horrid said mrs briss  horrid i gloomily echoed  horrid it wasnt she then developed with decision a dash as you say of the same sortthough goodness knows of what sort you mean it wasnt to be plain a dash at all my companion was plain she settled she stuck and finally as i could but echo her again she made love to him  butareally  really thats how i knew  i was at sea knew but you saw  i knewthat is i learntmore than i saw i knew she couldnt be gone  it in fact brought light knew it by him  he told me said mrs briss  it brought light but it brought also i fear for me another queer grimace does he then regularly tell  regularly but what he tells she did herself the justice to declare is not always so much to the point as the two things ive repeated to you  their weight then suggested that i should have them over again his revelation in the first place of long and lady john  and his revelation in the secondshe spoke of it as a broad jokeof may server and himself  there was something in her joke that was a chill to my mind but i nevertheless played up and what does he say thats further interesting about that  why that shes awfully sharp  i gaspedshe turned it out so shemrs server  it made her however equally stare why isnt it the very thing you maintained  i felt her dreadful logic but i couldntwith my exquisite image all contrasted as in a flash from flint with this monstrosityso much as entertain her question i could only stupidly again sound it awfully sharp  you after all then now dont it was she herself whom the words at present described then what on earth do you think the strange mixture in my face naturally made her ask it but everything within a minute had somehow so given way under the touch of her supreme assurance the presentation of her own now finished system that i dare say i couldnt at the moment have in the least trusted myself to tell her she left me however in fact small timeshe only took enough with her negations arrayed and her insolence recaptured to judge me afresh which she did as she gathered herself up into the strength of twentyfive i didnt after allit appeared part of my smashknow the weight of her husbands years but i knew the weight of my own they might have been a thousand and nothing but the sense of them would in a moment i saw be left me my poor dear you are crazy and i bid you goodnight  nothing but the sense of themon my taking it from her without a sound and watching her through the lighted rooms retreat and disappearwas at first left me but after a minute something else came and i grew conscious that her verdict lingered she had so had the last word that to get out of its planted presence i shook myself as i had done before from my thought when once i had started to my room indeedand to preparation for a livelier start as soon as the house should stir againi almost breathlessly hurried such a last wordthe word that put me altogether nowherewas too unacceptable not to prescribe afresh that prompt test of escape to other air for which i had earlier in the evening seen so much reason i should certainly never again on the spot quite hang together even though it wasnt really that i hadnt three times her method what i too fatally lacked was her tone   the end
