joy because it took the shape of verse but with more pain on some accounts than he chooses to express however he has done what he conceived himself bound to do and if every zealous lover of his

 canto i p 1     captain sword and captain pen   i  how captain sword marched to war              captain sword got up one day           over the hills to march away           over the hills and through the towns           they heard him coming across the downs           stepping in music and thunder sweet           which his drums sent before him into the street           and lo twas a beautiful sight in the sun           for first came his foot all marching like one           with tranquil faces and bristling steel           and the flag full of honour as though it could feel           and the officers gentle the sword that hold           gainst the shoulder heavy with trembling gold           and the massy tread that in passing is heard           though the drums and the music say never a word              and then came his horse a clustering sound           of shapely potency forward bound           glossy black steeds and riders tall           rank after rank each looking like all           midst moving repose and a threatening charm           with mortal sharpness at each right arm           and hues that painters and ladies love           and ever the small flag blushd above              and ever and anon the kettledrums beat           hasty power midst order meet           and ever and anon the drums and fifes           came like motions voice and lifes           or into the golden grandeurs fell           of deeper instruments mingling well           burdens of beauty for winds to bear           and the cymbals kissd in the shining air           and the trumpets their visible voices reard           each looking forth with its tapestried beard           bidding the heavens and earth make way           for captain sword and his battlearray              he nevertheless rode indifferenteyed           as if pomp were a toy to his manly pride           whilst the ladies lovd him the more for his scorn           and thought him the noblest man ever was born           and tears came into the bravest eyes           and hearts swelld after him double their size           and all that was weak and all that was strong           seemd to think wrongs self in him could not be wrong           such love though with bosom about to be gored           did sympathy get for brave captain sword              so half that night as he stoppd in the town           twas all one dance going merrily down           with lights in windows and love in eyes           and a constant feeling of sweet surprise           but all the next morning twas tears and sighs           for the sound of his drums grew less and less           walking like carelessness off from distress           and captain sword went whistling gay           over the hills and far away     ii  how captain sword won a great victory               through fair and through foul went captain sword           pacer of highway and piercer of ford           steady of face in rain or sun           he and his merry men all as one           till they came to a place where in battlearray           stood thousands of faces firm as they           waiting to see which could best maintain           bloody

round about goeth the golden sun     v  how captain sword in consequence of his great victories became infirm in his wits               but to win at the game whose moves are death           it maketh a man draw too proud a breath           and to see his force taken for reason and right           it tendeth to unsettle his reason quite           never did chief of the line of sword           keep his wits whole at that drunken board           he taketh the size and the roar and fate           of the field of his action for soul as great           he smiteth and stunneth the cheek of mankind           and saith lo i rule both body and mind              captain sword forgot his own soul           which of aught save itself resented controul           which whatever his deeds ordained them still           bodiless monarch enthrond in his will           he forgot the close thought and the burning heart           and prayrs and the mild moon hanging apart           which lifteth the seas with her gentle looks           and growth and death and immortal books           and the infinite mildness the soul of souls           which layeth earth soft twixt her silver poles           which ruleth the stars and saith not a word           whose speed in the hair of no comet is heard           which sendeth the soft sun day by day           mighty and genial and just alway           owning

earthquake near           and that same night of the letter some strange           compulsion of soul brought a sense of change           and at midnight the sound grew into a roll           as the sound of all gathrings from pole to pole           from pole unto pole and from clime to clime           like the roll of the wheels of the coming of time           a sound as of cities and sound as of swords           sharpening and solemn and terrible words           and laughter as solemn and thunderous drumming           a tread as if all the world were coming           and then was a lull and soft voices sweet           calld into music those terrible feet           which rising on wings lo the earth went round           to the burn of their speed with a golden sound           with a golden sound and a swift repose           such as the blood in the young heart knows           such as love knows when his tumults cease           when all is quick and yet all is at peace

his own men strike a single blow           not a blow for their old unconsidering lord           would strike the good soldiers of captain sword           but weaponless all and wise they stood

swordless men     postscript  containing some remarks on war and military statesmen     postscript  containing some remarks on war and military statesmen   the object of this poem is to show the horrors of war the false ideas of power produced in the minds of its leaders and by inference the unfitness of those leaders for the government of the world  the author intends no more offence to any one than can be helped he feels due admiration for that courage and energy the supposed misdirection of which it deplores he heartily acknowledges the probability that that supposed misdirection has been hitherto no misdirection but a necessitybut he believes that the time is come when by encouraging the disposition to question it its services and its sufferings may be no longer required and he would fain tear asunder the veil from the sore places of warwould show what has been hitherto kept concealed or not shown earnestly and for the purposewould prove at all events that the time has come for putting an end to those phrases in the narratives of warfare by which a suspicious delicacy is palmed upon the reader who is told after everything has been done to excite his admiration of war that his feelings are spared a recital of its miseriesthat a veil is drawn over thema truce given to descriptions which only harrow up the soul c  suppose it be necessary to harrow up the soul in order that the soul be no longer harrowed moralists and preachers do not deal after this tender fashion with moral or even physical consequences resulting from other evils why should they spare these why refuse to look their own effeminacy in the facetheir own gaudy and overweening encouragement of what they dare not contemplate in its results is a murder in the streets worth attending toa single wounded man worth carrying to the hospitaland are all the murders and massacres and fields of wounded and the madness the conflagrations the famines the miseries of families and the rickety frames and melancholy bloods of posterity only fit to have an embroidered handkerchief thrown over them must ladies and gentlemen be called off that they may not look that way the sight is so shocking does it become us to let others endure what we cannot bear even to think of  even if nothing else were to come of inquiries into the horrors of war surely they would cry aloud for some better provision against their extremity after battlefor some regulated and certain assistance to the wounded and agonizedso that we might hear no longer of men left in cold and misery all night writhing with tortureof bodies stripped by prowlers perhaps murderersand of frenzied men the other day the darlings of their friends dying two and even several days after the battle of famine the field of waterloo was not completely cleared of its dead and dying till nearly a week surely large companies of men should be organized for the sole purpose of assisting and clearing away the field after battle they should be steady men not lightly admitted nor unpossessed of some knowledge of surgery and they should be attached to the surgeons staff both sides would respect them for their office and keep them sacred from violence their duties would be too painful and useful to get them disrespected for not joining in the fightand possibly before long they would help to do away their own necessity by detailing what they beheld is that the reason why there is no such establishment the question is asked not in bitterness but to suggest a selfinterrogation to the instincts of war  i have not thought proper to put notes to the poem detailing the horrors which i have touched upon nor even to quote my authorities which are unfortunately too numerous and contain worse horrors still they are furnished by almost every history of a campaign in all quarters of the world circumstances so painful in a first attempt to render them public for their own sakes would i thought even meet with less attention in prose than in verse however less fitted they may appear for it at first sight verse if it has any enthusiasm at once demands and conciliates attention it proposes to say much in little and it associates with it the idea of something consolatory or otherwise sustaining but there is one prose specimen of these details which i will give because it made so great an impression on me in my youth that i never afterwards could help calling it to mind when war was spoken of and as i had a good deal to say on that subject having been a public journalist during one of the most interesting periods of modern history and never having been blinded into an admiration of war by the dazzle of victory the circumstance may help to show how salutary a record of this kind may be and what an impression the subject might be brought to make on society the passage is in a note to one of mr southeys poems the ode to horror and is introduced by another frightful record less horrible because there is not such agony implied in it nor is it alive  i extract says mr southey the following picture of consummate horror from notes to a poem written in twelvesyllable verse upon the campaign of 1794 and 1795 it was during the retreat to deventer we could not proceed a hundred yards without perceiving the dead bodies of men women children and horses in every direction one scene made an impression upon my memory which time will never be able to efface near another cart we perceived a stoutlooking man and a beautiful young woman with an infant about seven months old at the breast all three frozen and dead the mother had most certainly expired in the act of suckling her child as with one breast exposed she lay upon the drifted snow the milk to all appearance in a stream drawn from the nipple by the babe and instantly congealed the infant seemed as if its lips had but just then been disengaged and it reposed its little head upon the mothers bosom with an overflow of milk frozen as it trickled from the mouth their countenances were perfectly composed and fresh resembling those of persons in a sound and tranquil slumber  the following description he continues of a field of battle is in the words of one who passed over the field of jemappe after doumouriers victory it was on the third day after the victory obtained by general doumourier over the austrians that i rode across the field of battle the scene lies on a waste common rendered then more dreary by the desertion of the miserable hovels before occupied by peasants everything that resembled a human habitation was desolated and for the most part they had been burnt or pulled down to prevent their affording shelter to the posts of the contending armies the ground was ploughed up by the wheels of the artillery and waggons everything like herbage was trodden into mire broken carriages arms accoutrements dead horses and men were strewed over the heath this was the third day after the battle it was the beginning of november and for three days a bleak wind and heavy rain had continued incessantly there were still remaining alive several hundreds of horses and of the human victims of that dreadful fight i can speak with certainty of having seen more than four hundred men still living unsheltered without food and without any human assistance most of them confined to the spot where they had fallen by broken limbs the two armies had proceeded and abandoned these miserable wretches to their fate some of the dead persons appeared to have expired in the act of embracing each other two young french officers who were brothers had crawled under the side of a dead horse where they had contrived a kind of shelter by means of a cloak they were both mortally wounded and groaning for each other one very fine young man had just strength enough to drag himself out of a hollow partly filled with water and was laid upon a little hillock groaning with agony a grapeshot had cut across the upper part of his belly and he was keeping in his bowels with a handkerchief and hat he begged of me to end his misery he complained of dreadful thirst i filled him the hat of a dead soldier with water which he nearly drank off at once and left him to that end of his wretchedness which could not be far distant  i hope concludes mr southey i have always felt and expressed an honest and christian abhorrence of wars and of the systems that produce them but my ideas of their immediate horrors fell infinitely short of this authentic picture  mr southey in his subsequent lives of conquerors and his other writings will hardly be thought to have acted up to this abhorrence of wars and of the systems that produce them nor is he to be blamed for qualifying his view of the subject equally blameless surely as they are to be held who have retained their old views especially by him who helped to impress them his friend mr wordsworth in the vivacity of his admonitions to hasty complaints of evil has gone so far as to say that carnage is gods daughter and thereby subjected himself to the scoffs of a late noble wit he is addressing the deity himself            but thy most dreaded instrument            in working out a pure intent            is man arrayd for mutual slaughter            yea carnage is thy daughter  mr wordsworth is a great poet and a philosophical thinker in spite of his having here paid a tremendous compliment to a rhyme for unquestionably the word slaughter provoked him into that imperative yea and its subsequent venturous affiliation but the judgment to say no more of it is rash whatever the divine being intends by his permission or use of evil it becomes us to think the best of it but not to affirm the appropriation of the particulars to him under their worst appellation seeing that he has implanted in us a horror of them and a wish to do them away what it is right in him to do is one thing what it is proper in us to affirm that he actually does is another and above all it is idle to affirm what he intends to do for ever and to have us eternally venerate and abstain from questioning an evil all good and evil and vice and virtue themselves might become confounded in the human mind by a like daring and humanity sit down under every buffet of misfortune without attempting to resist it which fortunately is impossible plato cut this knotty point better by regarding evil as a thing senseless and unmalignant indeed no philosopher regards anything as malignant or malignant for malignitys sake out of which or notwithstanding it good is worked and to be worked perhaps finally to the abolition of evil but whether this consummation be possible or not and even if the dark horrors of evil be necessary towards the enjoyment of the light of good still the horror must be maintained where the object is really horrible otherwise we but the more idly resist the contrast if necessaryand what is worse endanger the chance of melioration if possible  did war appear to me an inevitable evil i should be one of the last men to shew it in any other than its holiday clothes i can appeal to writings before the public to testify whether i am in the habit of making the worst of anything or of not making it yield its utmost amount of good my inclinations as well as my reason lie all that way i am a passionate and grateful lover of all the beauties of the universe moral and material and the chief business of my life is to endeavour to give others the like fortunate affection but on the same principle i feel it my duty to look evil in the face in order to discover if it be capable of amendment and i do not see why the miseries of war are to be spared this interrogation simply because they are frightful and enormous men get rid of smaller evils which lie in their waynay of great ones and there appears to be no reason why they should not get rid of the greatest if they will but have the courage we have abolished inquisitions and the rack burnings for religion burnings for witchcraft hangings for forgery a great triumph in a commercial country much of the punishment of death in some countries all of it in others why not abolish war mr wordsworth writes no odes to tell us that the inquisition was gods daughter though lope de vega who was one of its officers might have done soand mr wordsworth too had he lived under its dispensation lope de vega like mr wordsworth and mr southey was a good man as well as a celebrated poet and we will concede to his memory what the english poets will perhaps not be equally disposed to grant for they are severe on the romish faith that even the inquisition like war might possibly have had some utility in its evil were it no other than a hastening of christianity by its startling contradictions of it yet it has gone the inquisition as war may be hereafter is no more daughter if it was of the supreme good it was no immortal daughter why should carnage beespecially as god has put it in our heads to get rid of it  i am aware of what may be said on these occasions to puzzle the will and i concede of course that mankind may entertain false views of their power to change anything for the better i concede that all change may be only in appearance and not make any real difference in the general amount of good and evil that evil to a certain invariable amount may be necessary to the amount of good the overbalance of which with a most hearty and loving sincerity i ever acknowledge and finally that all which the wisest of men could utter on any such subject might possibly be nothing but a jargonthe witless and puny voice of what we take to be a mighty orb but which after all is only a particle in the starry dust of the universe  on the other hand all this may be something very different from what we take it to be setting aside even the opinions which consider mind as everything and time and space themselves as only modifications of it or breathingroom in which it exists weaving the thoughts which it calls life death and materiality  but be his metaphysical opinions what they may who but some fantastic individual or ultracontemplative scholar ever thinks of subjecting to them his practical notions of bettering his condition and how soon is it likely that men will leave off endeavouring to secure themselves against the uneasier chances of vicissitude even if providence ordains them to do so for no other end than the preservation of vicissitude itself and not in order to help them out of the husks and thorns of action into the flowers of it and into the air of heaven certain it is at all events that the human being is incited to increase his amount of good and that when he is endeavouring to do so he is at least not fulfilling the worst part of his necessity nobody tells us when we attempt to put out a fire and to save the lives of our neighbours that conflagration is gods daughter or murder gods daughter on the contrary these are things which christendom is taught to think ill off and to wish to put down and therefore we should put down war which is murder and conflagration by millions  to those who tell us that nations would grow cowardly and effeminate without war we answer try a reasonable condition of peace first and then prove it try a state of things which mankind have never yet attained because they had no press and no universal comparison of notes and consider in the meanwhile whether so cheerful and intelligent and just a state seeing fair play between body and mind and educated into habits of activity would be likely to uneducate itself into what was neither respected nor customary prove in the meanwhile that nations are cowardly and effeminate that have been long unaccustomed to war that the south americans are so or that all our robust countrymen who do not go for soldiers are timid agriculturists and manufacturers with not a quoit to throw on the green or a saucy word to give to an insult moral courage is in selfrespect and the sense of duty physical courage is a matter of health or organization are these predispositions likely to fail in a community of instructed freemen doubters of advancement are always arguing from a limited past to an unlimited future that is to say from a past of which they know but a point to a future of which they know nothing they stand on the bridge between two eternities seeing a little bit of it behind them and nothing at all of what is before and uttering those words unfit for mortal tongue man ever was and man ever will be they might as well say what is beyond the stars it appears to be a part of the necessity of things from what we see of the improvements they make that all human improvement should proceed by the cooperation of human means but what blinker into the night of next weekwhat luckless prophet of the impossibilities of steamboats and steamcarriagesshall presume to say how far those improvements are to extend let no man faint in the cooperation with which god has honoured him  as to those superabundances of population which wars and other evils are supposed to be necessary in order to keep down there are questions which have a right to be put long before any such necessity is assumed and till those questions be answered and the experiments dependent upon them tried the interrogators have a right to assume that no such necessity exists i do not enter upon themfor i am not bound to do so but i have touched upon them in the poem and the too rich and other disingenuous halfreasoners know well what they are all passionate remedies for evil are themselves evil and tend to reproduce what they remedy it is high time for the world to show that it has come to mans estate and can put down what is wrong without violence should the wrong still return we should have a right to say with the apostle sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof for meanwhile we should not have done evil that good may come that good may come nay that evil may be perpetuated for what good superior to the alternatives denounced is achieved by this eternal round of war and its causes let us do good in a good and kind manner and trust to the cooperation of providence for the result it seems the only real way of attaining to the very best of which our earth is capable and at the very worst necessity like the waters will find its level and the equity of things be justified  i firmly believe that war or the sending thousands of our fellowcreatures to cut one another to bits often for what they have no concern in nor understand will one day be reckoned far more absurd than if people were to settle an argument over the dinnertable with their knivesa logic indeed which was once fashionable in some places during the good old times the world has seen the absurdity of that practice why should it not come to years of discretion with respect to violence on a larger scale the other day our own country and the united states agreed to refer a point in dispute to the arbitration of the king of holland a compliment if we are to believe the newspapers of which his majesty was justly proud he struck a medal on the strength of it which history will show as a setoff against his less creditable attempts to force his opinions upon the belgians why should not every national dispute be referred in like manner to a third party there is reason to suppose that the judgment would stand a good chance of being impartial and it would benefit the character of the judge and dispose him to receive judgments of the same kind till at length the custom would prevail like any other custom and men be astonished at the customs that preceded it in private life none but schoolboys and the vulgar settle disputes by blows even duelling is losing its dignity  two nations or most likely two governments have a dispute they reason the point backwards and forwards they cannot determine it perhaps they do not wish to determine so like two carmen in the street they fight it out first however dressing themselves up to look fine and pluming themselves on their absurdity just as if the two carmen were to go and put on their sunday clothes and stick a feather in their hat besides in order to be as dignified and fantastic as possible they then go at it and cover themselves with mud blood and glory can anything be more ridiculous yet apart from the habit of thinking otherwise and being drummed into the notion by the very toys of infancy the similitude is not one atom too ludicrous no nor a thousandth part enough so i am aware that a sarcasm is but a sarcasm and need not imply any argument never includes allbut it acquires a more respectable character when so much is done to keep it out of sightwhen so many questions are begged against it by pride pomp and circumstance and allegations of necessity similar allegations may be and are brought forward by other nations of the world in behalf of customs which we for our parts think very ridiculous and do our utmost to put down never referring them as we refer our own to the mysterious ordinations of providence or if we do never hesitating to suppose that providence in moving us to interfere is varying its ordinations now all that i would ask of the advocates of war is to apply the possible justice of this supposition to their own case for the purpose of thoroughly investigating the question  but they will exultingly say perhaps is this a time for investigating the question when military genius even for civil purposes has regained its ascendancy in the person of the duke of wellington when the world has shown that it cannot do without him when whigs radicals liberals of all sorts have proved to be but idle talkers in comparison with this man of few words and many deeds i answer that it remains to be proved whether the ascendancy be gained or not that i have no belief it will be regained and that in the meanwhile never was time fitter for questioning the merits of war and by inference those of its leaders the general peacefulness of the world presents a fair opportunity for laying the foundations of peaceful opinion and the alarm of the moment renders the interrogation desirable for its immediate sake  the reappearance of a military administration or of an administration barely civil and military at heart may not at first sight be thought the most promising one for hastening a just appreciation of war and the ascendancy of moral over physical strength but is it or can it be lasting will it not provokeis it not now provokinga reaction still more peremptory against the claims of toryism than the state of things which preceded it is it anything but a flash of success still more indicative of expiring life and caused only by its convulsive efforts  if it be this it is easy enough to predict that sir robert peel notwithstanding his abilities and the better ambition which is natural to them and which struggles in him with an inferior one impatient of his origin will turn out to be nothing but a servant of the aristocracy and more or less openly of a barrackmaster he will be the servant not of the king not of the house of commons but of the house of lords and as long as such influence lasts which can be but a short while of its military leader he will do nothing whatsoever contrary to their dictation upon peril of being treated worse than canning and all the reform which he is permitted to bring about will be only just as much as will serve to keep off the spirit of it as long as possible and to continue the people in that state of comparative ignorance which is the only safeguard of monopoly every unwilling step of reform will be accompanied with some retrograde or bye effort in favour of the abuses reformed cunning occasion will be seized to convert boons demanded by the age into gifts of party favour and bribes for the toleration of what is withheld and as knowledge proceeds to extort public education for extort it it will and in its own way too at last mark and see what attempts will be made to turn knowledge against itself and to catechise the nation back into the schoolboy acquiescence of the good people of germany much good is there in that peoplei would not be thought to undervalue itmuch bonhommieand in the most despotic districts as much sensual comfort as can make any people happy who know no other happiness but england and france the leaders of europe the peregrinators of the world cannot be confined to those lazy and prospectless paths they have gone through the feudal reign they must now go through the commercial god forbid that for any bodys sake they should stop there and they will continue to advance till all are instructed and all are masters and government in however gorgeous a shape be truly their servant the problem of existing governments is how to prepare for this inevitable period and to continue to be its masters by converting themselves frankly and truly into its friends for my part as one of the people i confess i like the colours and shows of feudalism and would retain as much of them as would adorn nobler things i would keep the tigers skin though the beast be killed the painted window though the superstition be laid in the tomb nature likes external beauty and man likes it it softens the heart enriches the imagination and helps to show us that there are other goods in the world besides bare utility i would fain see the splendours of royalty combined with the cheapness of a republic and the equal knowledge of all classes is such a combination impossible i would exhort the lovers of feudal splendour to be the last men to think so for a thousand times more impossible will they find its retention under any other circumstances their royalties their educations their accomplishments of all sorts must go along with the press and its irresistible consequences or they will be set aside like a child in a corner who has insisted on keeping the toys and books of his brothers to himself  now there is nothing that irritates a just cause so much as a threatening of force and all impositions of a military chief on a state where civil directors will at least do as well is a threatening of force disguise it or pretend to laugh at it as its imposers may this irritation in england will not produce violence public opinion is too strong and the future too secure but deeply and daily will increase the disgust and the ridicule and individuals will get laughed at and catechised who cannot easily be sent out of the way as ambassadors and who might as well preserve their selfrespect a little better to attempt however quietly to overawe the advance of improvement by the aspect of physical force is as idle as if soldiers were drawn out to suppress the rising of a flood the flood rises quietly irresistibly without violenceit cannot help itthe waters of knowledge are out and will cover the earth of what use is it to see the representative of a bygone influencea poor individual mortal for he is nothing else in the comparison fretting and fuming on the shore of this mighty sea and playing the part of a canute reversedan antic really taking his flatterers at their word  the first thirtyfive years of the nineteenth century have been rich in experiences of the sure and certain failure of all soldiership and toryism to go heartily along in the cause of the many there has been the sovereign instance of napoleon bonaparte himselfof the allies after himof charles the tenthof louis philippe albeit a schoolmasterand lastly of this strange and most involuntary reformer the duke of wellington who refused to do under canning or for principles sake what he consented to do when canning died for the sake of regaining power and of keeping it with as few concessions as possible canning perished because toryism or the principle of power for its own sake to which he had been a servant could not bear to acknowledge him as its master his intellect was just great enough as his birth was small enough to render it jealous of him under that aspect there is an instinct in toryism which renders pure intellect intolerable to it except in some inferior or mechanical shape or in the flattery of voluntary servitude but by a like instinct it is not so jealous of military renown it is glad of the doubtful amount of intellect in military genius and knows it to be a good ally in the preservation of power and in the substitution of noise and show for qualities fearless of inspection is it an ascendancy of this kind which the present age requires or will permit do we want a soldier at the head of us when there is nobody abroad to fight with when international as well as national questions can manifestly settle themselves without him and when his appearance in the seat of power can indicate nothing but a hankering after those old substitutions of force for argument or at best of an authority for a reason which every step of reform is hoping to do away do we want him to serve in our shops to preside over our studies to cultivate peace and good will among nations wounding no self lovethreatening no social  there never was a soldier purely brought up as suchand it is of such only i speak and not of rare and even then perilous exceptionsmen educated in philosophy like epaminondas or in homely household virtues and citizenship like washingtonbut there never was a soldier such as i speak of who did more for the world than was compatible with his confined and arbitrary breeding i do not speak of course with reference to the unprofessional part of his character circumstances especially the participation of dangers and vicissitude often conspire with naturally good qualities to render soldiers the most amiable of men and nothing is more delightful to contemplate than an old military veteran whose tenderness of heart has survived the shocks of the rough work it has been tried in till twenty miserable sights of war and horror start up to the imagination as a setoff against its attractiveness but publicly speaking the more a soldier succeeds the more he looks upon soldiership as something superior to all other kinds of ascendancy and qualified to dispense with them he always ends in considering the flower of the art of government as consisting in issuing orders and that of popular duty as comprised in obedience cities with him are barracks and the nation a conquered country he is at best but a pioneer of civilization when he undertakes to be the civilizer himself he makes mistakes that betray him to others even supposing him selfdeceived napoleon though he was the accidental instrument of a popular reaction was one of the educated tools of the system that provoked itan officer brought up at a royal military college and in spite of his boasted legislation and his real genius such he ever remained he did as much for his own aggrandizement as he could and no more for the world than he thought compatible with it the same military genius which made him as great as he was stopped him short of a greater greatness because quick and imposing as he was in acting the part of a civil ruler he was in reality a soldier and nothing else and by the excess of the soldiers propensity aggrandizement by force he overtoppled himself and fell to pieces soldiership appears to have narrowed or hardened the public spirit of every man who has spent the chief part of his life in it who has died at an age which gives final proofs of its tendency and whose history is thoroughly known we all know what cromwell did to an honest parliament marlborough ended in being a miser and the tool of his wife even goodnatured heroic nelson condescended to become an executioner at naples frederick did much for prussia as a power but what became of her as a people or power either before the popular power of france even washington seemed not to comprehend those who thought that negroslaves ought to be freed  in the name of common sense then what do we want with a soldier who was born and bred in circumstances the most arbitrary who never advocated a liberal measure as long as he could help it and who without meaning to speak presumptuously or in ones own person unauthorized by opinion is one of the merest soldiers though a great one that ever existedwithout genius of any other sortwith scarcely a civil public quality either commanding or engaging as far as the world in general can seeand with no more to say for himself than the most mechanical clerk in office in what respect is the duke of wellington better fitted to be a parliamentary leader than the sir arthur wellesley of twenty years back or what has recast the habits and character of the colonel wellesley of the east indies to give him an unprofessional consideration for the lives and liberties of his fellowcreatures  and yet the duke of wellington it is said may after all be in earnest in his professions of reform and advancement if so he will be the most remarkable instance that ever existed of the triumph of reason over the habits of a life and the experience of mankind i have looked for some such man through a very remarkable period of the world when an honest declaration to this effect would have set him at the top of mankind to be worshipped for ever and i never found the glorious opportunity seizednot by napoleon when he came from elbanot by the allies when they conquered himnot by louis philippe though he was educated in adversity i mean that he has shown himself a prince born of the most aristocratic kind and evidently considers himself as nothing but the head of a new dynasty when the duke of wellington had the opportunity of being a reformer of his own free will he resisted it as long as he could he opposed reform up to the last moment of its freedom from his dictation he declared that ruin would follow it that the institutions of the country were perfect without it and that at the very least the less of it the better and for this enmity even if no other reason existedeven if his new light were sincerethe duke of wellington ought not to have the honour of leading reform it is just as if a man had been doing all he could to prevent another from entering his own house and then when he found that the bystanders would insist on his having free passage were to turn to them smiling and say well since it must be so allow me to do the honours of the mansion everybody knows what this proposal would be called by the bystanders and if the way in which greatness is brought up and spoilt gives it a right to a less homely style of rebuke as i grant it does still the absurdity of the dukes claim is not the less evident nor the air of it less provoking  i can imagine but two reasons for the remotest possible permission of this glaring anomalythis government of antireforming reformersthis hospital of sick guides for the healthy supported by involuntary contributions first sheer necessity which is ludicrous and second a facilitation of church reform through the lords and the bench of bishops the desirableness of which facilitation appears to be in no proportion to the compromise it is likely to make with abuses i have read i believe all the utmost possible things that can be said in its favour the articles for instance written by the times newspaper admirable as far as a rotten cause can let them be and when not afflicted by some portentous mystery of personal resentment and though i trust i may lay claim to as much willingness to be convinced as most men who have suffered and reflected i have not seen a single argument which did not appear to me fully answered by the above objection alone about the honour setting aside the innumerable convincing ones urged by reasoners on the other side for as to any dearth of statesmen in a country like this it never existed nor ever can till education and public spirit have entirely left it there have been the same complaints at every change in the history of administrations and the crop has never failed  allow me to state here that any appearance of personality in this book is involuntary public principles are sometimes incarnate in individual shapes and in attacking them the individual may be seemingly attacked where to eyes which look a little closer there is evidently no such intention i have been obliged to identify in some measure the power of the sword with several successive individuals and with the duke of wellington most because he is the reigning shape and includes all its pretensions but as an individual who am nothing except in connexion with what i humanly feel i dare to affirm that i have not only the consideration that becomes me for all human beings but a flesh and blood regard for every body and that i as truly respect in the noble duke the possession of military science of a straightforward sincerity and a valour of which no circumstances or years can diminish the ready firmness as i doubt the fitness of a man of his education habits and political principles for the guidance of an intellectual age  i dislike toryism because i think it an unjust exacting and pernicious thing which tends to keep the interests of the many in perpetual subjection to those of the few but far be it from me in common modesty to dislike those who have been brought up in its principles and taught to think them goodfar less such of them as adorn it by intellectual or moral qualities and who justly claim for it under its best aspect in private life that ease and urbanity of behaviour which implies an acknowledgment of its claims to respect even where those claims are partly grounded in prejudice i heartily grant to the privileged classes that enjoying in many respects the best educations they have been conservators of polished manners and of the other graces of intercourse my quarrel with them is that the inferior part of their education induces them to wish to keep these manners and graces to themselves together with a superabundance good for nobody of all other advantages and that thus instead of being the preservers of a beautiful and genial flame good for all and in due season partakeable by all they would hoard and make an idolatrous treasure of it sacred to one class alone and such as the diffusion of knowledge renders it alike useless and exasperating to endeavour to withhold  i will conclude this postscript with quotations from three writers of the present day who may be fairly taken to represent the three distinct classes of the leaders of knowledge and who will show what is thought of the feasibility of putting an end to warthe utilitarian or those who are all for the tangible and materialthe metaphysical or those who recognize in addition the spiritual and imaginative wants of mankindand lastly in no offensive sense the men of the world whose opinion will have the greatest weight of all with the incredulous and whose speaker is a soldier to boot and a man who evidently sees fair play to all the weaknesses as well as strengths of our nature  the first quotation is from the venerable mr bentham a man who certainly lost sight of no existing or possible phase of society such as the ordinary disputants on this subject contemplate i venture to think him not thoroughly philosophical on the point especially in what he says in reproach of men educated to think differently from himself but the passage will show the growth of opinion in a practical and highly influential quarter            nothing can be worse says mr bentham than the           general feeling on the subject of war the church           the state the ruling few the subject many all           seem to have combined in order to patronise vice           and crime in their very widest sphere of evil           dress a man in particular garments call him by a           particular name and he shall have authority on           divers occasions to commit every species of           offence to pillage to murder to destroy human           felicity and for so doing he shall be rewarded            of all that is pernicious in admiration the           admiration of heroes is the most pernicious and           how delusion should have made us admire what           virtue should teach us to hate and loathe is           among the saddest evidences of human weakness and           folly the crimes of heroes seem lost in the           vastness of the field they occupy a lively idea           of the mischief they do of the misery they           create seldom penetrates the mind through the           delusions with which thoughtlessness and falsehood           have surrounded their names and deeds is it that           the magnitude of the evil is too gigantic for           entrance we read of twenty thousand men killed in           a battle with no other feeling than that it was           a glorious victory twenty thousand or ten           thousand what reck we of their sufferings the           hosts who perished are evidence of the           completeness of the triumph and the completeness           of the triumph is the measure of merit and the           glory of the conqueror our schoolmasters and the           immoral books they so often put into our hands           have inspired us with an affection for heroes and           the hero is more heroic in proportion to the           numbers of the slainadd a cypher not one iota           is added to our disapprobation four or two           figures give us no more sentiment of pain than one           figure while they add marvellously to the           grandeur and splendour of the victor let us draw           forth one individual from those thousands or tens           of thousandshis leg has been shivered by one           ball his jaw broken by anotherhe is bathed in           his own blood and that of his fellowsyet he           lives tortured by thirst fainting famishing he           is but one of the twenty thousandone of the           actors and sufferers in the scene of the heros           gloryand of the twenty thousand there is           scarcely one whose suffering or death will not be           the centre of a circle of misery look again           admirers of that hero is not this wretchedness           because it is repeated ten ten hundred ten           thousand times is not this wretchedness            the period will assuredly arrive when better           instructed generations will require all the           evidence of history to credit that in times           deeming themselves enlightened human beings           should have been honoured with public approval in           the very proportion of the misery they caused and           the mischiefs they perpetrated they will call           upon all the testimony which incredulity can           require to persuade them that in passed ages           men there weremen too deemed worthy of popular           recompensewho for some small pecuniary           retribution hired themselves out to do any deeds           of pillage devastation and murder which might           be demanded of them and still more will it shock           their sensibilities to learn that such men such           mendestroyers were marked out as the eminent and           the illustriousas the worthy of laurels and           monumentsof eloquence and poetry in that better           and happier epoch the wise and the good will be           busied in hurling into oblivion or dragging forth           for exposure to universal ignominy and obloquy           many of the heads we deem heroic while the true           fame and the perdurable glories will be gathered           around the creators and diffusers of           happinessdeontology  our second quotation is from one of the subtilest and most universal thinkers now livingthomas carlylechiefly known to the public as a german scholar and the friend of goethe but deeply respected by other leading intellects of the day as a man who sees into the utmost recognized possibilities of knowledge see what he thinks of war and of the possibility of putting an end to it we forget whether we got the extract from the edinburgh or the foreign quarterly review having made it sometime back and mislaid the reference and we take a liberty with him in mentioning his name as the writer for which his zeal in the cause of mankind will assuredly pardon us            the better minds of all countries observes mr           carlyle begin to understand each other and           which follows naturally to love each other and           help each other by whom ultimately all countries           in all their proceedings are governed            late in mans history yet clearly at length it           becomes manifest to the dullest that mind is           stronger than matterthat mind is the creator and           shaper of matterthat not brute force but only           persuasion and faith is the king of this world           the true poet who is but an inspired thinker is           still an orpheus whose lyre tames the savage           beasts and evokes the dead rocks to fashion           themselves into palaces and stately inhabited           cities it has been said and may be

at the boundless           unknown the more cheering is this one thing           which we do see and knowthat its tendency is to           a universal european commonweal that the wisest           in all nations will communicate and cooperate           whereby europe will again have its true sacred           college and council of amphictyons wars will           become rarer less inhuman and in the course of           centuries such delirious ferocity in nations as           in individuals it already is may be proscribed           and become obsolete for ever  my last and not least conclusive extract for it shows the actual hold which these speculations have taken of the minds of practical menof men out in the world and even of soldiers is from a book popular among all classes of readersthe bubbles from the brunnens of nassau written by major sir francis head what he says of one countrys educating another by the natural progress of books and opinion and of the effect which this is likely to have upon governments even as remote and unwilling as russia is particularly worthy of attention  the author is speaking of some bathers at whom he had been looking and of a russian prince who lets us into some curious information respecting the leadingstrings in which grown gentlemen are kept by despotism            for more than half an hour i had been indolently           watching this amphibious scene when the landlord           entering my room said that the russian prince           gn wished to speak to me on some business           and the information was scarcely communicated           when i perceived his highness standing at the           threshold of my door with the attention due to           his rank i instantly begged he would do me the           honour to walk in and after we had sufficiently           bowed to each other and that i had prevailed on           my guest to sit down i gravely requested him as           i stood before him to be so good as to state in           what way i could have the good fortune to render           him any service the prince very briefly replied           that he had called upon me considering that i was           the person in the hotel best capable he politely           inclined his head of informing him by what route           it would be most adviseable for him to proceed to           london it being his wish to visit my country            in order at once to solve this very simple           problem i silently unfolded and spread out upon           the table my map of europe and each of us as we           leant over it placing a forefinger on or near           wiesbaden our eyes being fixed upon dover we           remained in this reflecting attitude for some           seconds until the princes finger first solemnly           began to trace its route in doing this i           observed that his highnesss hand kept swerving           far into the netherlands so gently pulling it by           the thumb towards paris i used as much force as i           thought decorous to induce it to advance in a           straight line however finding my efforts           ineffectual i ventured with respectful           astonishment to ask why travel by so           uninteresting a route            the prince at once acknowledged that the route i           had recommended would by visiting paris afford           him the greatest pleasure but he frankly told me           that no russian not even a personage of his rank           could enter that capital without first obtaining           a written permission from the emperor            these words were no sooner uttered than i felt           my fluent civility suddenly begin to coagulate           the attention i paid my guest became forced and           unnatural i was no longer at my ease and though           i bowed strained and endeavoured to be if           possible more respectful than ever yet i really           could hardly prevent my lips from muttering aloud           that i had sooner die a homely english peasant           than live to be a russian princein short his           highnesss words acted upon my mind like thunder           upon beer and moreover i could almost have           sworn that i was an old lean wolf contemptuously           observing a bald ring rubbed by the collar from           the neck of a sleek wellfed mastiff dog           however recovering myself i managed to give as           much information as it was in my humble power to           afford and my noble guest then taking his           departure i returned to my open window to give           vent in solitude as i gazed upon the horse bath           to my own reflection upon the subject            although the petty rule of my life has been never           to trouble myself about what the world calls           politicsa fine word by the by much easier           expressed than understoodyet i must own i am           always happy when i see a nation enjoying itself           and melancholy when i observe any large body of           people suffering pain or imprisonment but of all           sorts of imprisonment that of the mind is to my           taste the most cruel and therefore when i           consider over what immense dominions the emperor           of russia presides and how he governs i cannot           help sympathizing most sincerely with those           innocent sufferers who have the misfortune to be           born his subjects for if a russian prince be not           freely permitted to go to paris in what a           melancholy state of slavery and debasement must           exist the minds of what we call the lower classes            as a sovereign remedy for this lamentable           political disorder many very sensible people in           england prescribe i know that we ought to have           resource to arms i must confess however it           seems to me that one of the greatest political           errors england could commit would be to declare           or to join in declaring war with russia in           short that an appeal to brute force would at           this moment be at once most unscientifically to           stop an immense moral engine which if left to           its work is quite powerful enough without           bloodshed to gain for humanity at no expense at           all its object the individual who is i           conceive to overthrow the emperor of russiawho           is to direct his own legions against himselfwho           is to do what napoleon had at the head of his           great army failed to effect is the little child           who lighted by the single wick of a small lamp           sits at this moment perched above the great steam           press of the penny magazine feeding it from           morning till night with blank papers which at           almost every pulsation of the engine comes out           stamped on both sides with engravings and with           pages of plain useful harmless knowledge which           by making the lower orders acquainted with foreign           lands foreign productions various states of           society c tend practically to inculcate glory           to god in the highest and on earth peacegood           will towards men it has already been stated           that what proceeds from this press is now           greedily devoured by the people of europe indeed           even at berlin we know it can hardly be reprinted           fast enough            this child thenthis sweet little cherub that           sits up aloftis the only army that an           enlightened country like ours should i humbly           think deign to oppose to one who reigns in           darknesswho trembles at daylight and whose           throne rests upon ignorance and despotism compare           this mild peaceful intellectual policy with the           dreadful savage alternative of going to war and           the difference must surely be evident to everyone           in the former case we calmly enjoy first of all           the pleasing reflection that our country is           generously imparting to the nations of europe the           blessing she is tranquilly deriving from the           purification of civilization to her own mindfar           from wishing to exterminate we are gradually           illuminating the russian peasant we are mildly           throwing a gleam of light upon the fetters of the           russian prince and surely every welldisposed           person must see that if we will only have           patience the result of this noble temperate           conduct must produce all that reasonable beings           can desirebubbles from the brunnens of

hope the beneficent reason why all are restless the solution of the problem is cooperationthe means of solving it is the press if the greeks had had a press we should probably have heard nothing of the inconsiderate question which demands why they with all their philosophy did not alter the world they had not the means they could not command a general hearing neither had christianity come up to
