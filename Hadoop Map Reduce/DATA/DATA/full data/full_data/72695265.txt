183940 was written by mr thackeray under the name of ikey solomons jun to counteract the injurious influence of some popular fictions of that day which made heroes of highwaymen and burglars and created a false sympathy for the vicious and criminal  with this purpose the author chose for the subject of his story a woman named catherine hayes who was burned at tyburn in 1726 for the deliberate murder of her husband under very revolting circumstances mr thackerays aim obviously was to describe the career of this wretched woman and her associates with such fidelity to truth as to exhibit the danger and folly of investing such persons with heroic and romantic qualities     chapter i introducing to the reader the chief personages of this narrative   at that famous period of history when the seventeenth century after a deal of quarrelling kingkilling reforming republicanising restoring rerestoring playwriting sermonwriting olivercromwellising stuartising and orangising to be sure had sunk into its grave giving place to the lusty eighteenth when mr isaac newton was a tutor of trinity and mr joseph addison commissioner of appeals when the presiding genius that watched over the destinies of the french nation had played out all the best cards in his hand and his adversaries began to pour in their trumps when there were two kings in spain employed perpetually in running away from one another when there was a queen in england with such rogues for ministers as have never been seen no not in our own day and a general of whom it may be severely argued whether he was the meanest miser or the greatest hero in the world when mrs masham had not yet put madam marlboroughs nose out of joint when people had their ears cut off for writing very meek political pamphlets and very large fullbottomed wigs were just beginning to be worn with powder and the face of louis the great as his was handed in to him behind the bedcurtains was when issuing thence observed to look longer older and more dismal daily  about the year one thousand seven hundred and five that is in the glorious reign of queen anne there existed certain characters and befell a series of adventures which since they are strictly in accordance with the present fashionable style and taste since they have been already partly described in the newgate calendar since they are as shall be seen anon agreeably low delightfully disgusting and at the same time eminently pleasing and pathetic may properly be set down here  and though it may be said with some considerable show of reason that agreeably low and delightfully disgusting characters have already been treated both copiously and ably by some eminent writers of the present and indeed of future ages though to tread in the footsteps of the immortal fagin requires a genius of inordinate stride and to go arobbing after the late though deathless turpin the renowned jack sheppard or the embryo duval may be impossible and not an infringement but a wasteful indication of illwill towards the eighth commandment though it may on the one hand be asserted that only vain coxcombs would dare to write on subjects already described by men really and deservedly eminent on the other hand that these subjects have been described so fully that nothing more can be said about them on the third hand allowing for the sake of argument three hands to one figure of speech that the public has heard so much of them as to be quite tired of rogues thieves cutthroats and newgate altogetherthough all these objections may be urged and each is excellent yet we intend to take a few more pages from the old bailey calendar to bless the public with one more draught from the stone jugyet awhile to listen hurdlemounted and riding down the oxford road to the bland conversation of jack ketch and to hang with him round the neck of his patient at the end of our and his history we give the reader fair notice that we shall tickle him with a few such scenes of villainy throatcutting and bodily suffering in general as are not to be found no not in never mind comparisons for such are odious        this as your ladyship is aware is the polite name for      her majestys prison of newgate  in the year 1705 then whether it was that the queen of england did feel seriously alarmed at the notion that a french prince should occupy the spanish throne or whether she was tenderly attached to the emperor of germany or whether she was obliged to fight out the quarrel of william of orange who made us pay and fight for his dutch provinces or whether poor old louis quatorze did really frighten her or whether sarah jennings and her husband wanted to make a fight knowing how much they should gain by itwhatever the reason was it was evident that the war was to continue and there was almost as much soldiering and recruiting parading pike and gunexercising flagflying drumbeating powderblazing and military enthusiasm as we can all remember in the year 1801 what time the corsican upstart menaced our shores a recruitingparty and captain of cuttss regiment which had been so mangled at blenheim the year before were now in warwickshire and having their depot at warwick the captain and his attendant the corporal were used to travel through the country seeking for heroes to fill up the gaps in cuttss corpsand for adventures to pass away the weary time of a country life  our captain plume and sergeant kite it was at this time by the way that those famous recruitingofficers were playing their pranks in shrewsbury were occupied very much in the same manner with farquhars heroes they roamed from warwick to stratford and from stratford to birmingham persuading the swains of warwickshire to leave the plough for the pike and despatching from time to time small detachments of recruits to extend marlboroughs lines and to act as food for the hungry cannon at ramillies and malplaquet  of those two gentlemen who are about to act a very important part in our history one only was probably a native of britainwe say probably because the individual in question was himself quite uncertain and it must be added entirely indifferent about his birthplace but speaking the english language and having been during the course of his life pretty generally engaged in the british service he had a tolerably fair claim to the majestic title of briton his name was peter brock otherwise corporal brock of lord cuttss regiment of dragoons he was of age about fiftyseven even that point has never been ascertained in height about five feet six inches in weight nearly thirteen stone with a chest that the celebrated leitch himself might envy an arm that was like an operadancers leg a stomach so elastic that it would accommodate itself to any given or stolen quantity of food a great aptitude for strong liquors a considerable skill in singing chansons de table of not the most delicate kind he was a lover of jokes of which he made many and passably bad when pleased simply coarse boisterous and jovial when angry a perfect demon bullying cursing storming fighting as is sometimes the wont with gentlemen of his cloth and education  mr brock was strictly what the marquis of rodil styled himself in a proclamation to his soldiers after running away a hijo de la guerraa child of war not seven cities but one or two regiments might contend for the honour of giving him birth for his mother whose name he took had acted as campfollower to a royalist regiment had then obeyed the parliamentarians died in scotland when monk was commanding in that country and the first appearance of mr brock in a public capacity displayed him as a fifer in the generals own regiment of coldstreamers when they marched from scotland to london and from a republic at once into a monarchy since that period brock had been always with the army he had had too some promotion for he spake of having a command at the battle of the boyne though probably as he never mentioned the fact upon the losing side the very year before this narrative commences he had been one of mordaunts forlorn hope at schellenberg for which service he was promised a pair of colours he lost them however and was almost shot but fate did not ordain that his career should close in that way for drunkenness and insubordination immediately after the battle but having in some measure reinstated himself by a display of much gallantry at blenheim it was found advisable to send him to england for the purposes of recruiting and remove him altogether from the regiment where his gallantry only rendered the example of his riot more dangerous  mr brocks commander was a slim young gentleman of twentysix about whom there was likewise a history if one would take the trouble to inquire he was a bavarian by birth his mother being an english lady and enjoyed along with a dozen other brothers the title of count eleven of these of course were penniless one or two were priests one a monk six or seven in various military services and the elder at home at schloss galgenstein breeding horses hunting wild boars swindling tenants living in a great house with small means obliged to be sordid at home all the year to be splendid for a month at the capital as is the way with many other noblemen our young count count gustavus adolphus maximilian von galgenstein had been in the service of the french as page to a nobleman then of his majestys gardes du corps then a lieutenant and captain in the bavarian service and when after the battle of blenheim two regiments of germans came over to the winning side gustavus adolphus maximilian found himself among them and at the epoch when this story commences had enjoyed english pay for a year or more it is unnecessary to say how he exchanged into his present regiment how it appeared that before her marriage handsome john churchill had known the young gentlemans mother when they were both penniless hangerson at charles the seconds courtit is we say quite useless to repeat all the scandal of which we are perfectly masters and to trace step by step the events of his history here however was gustavus adolphus in a small inn in a small village of warwickshire on an autumn evening in the year 1705 and at the very moment when this history begins he and mr brock his corporal and friend were seated at a round table before the kitchenfire while a small groom of the establishment was leading up and down on the village green before the inn door two black glossy longtailed barrelbellied thickflanked archnecked romannosed flanders horses which were the property of the two gentlemen now taking their ease at the bugle inn the two gentlemen were seated at their ease at the inn table drinking mountainwine and if the reader fancies from the sketch which we have given of their lives or from his own blindness and belief in the perfectibility of human nature that the sun of that autumn evening shone upon any two men in county or city at desk or harvest at court or at newgate drunk or sober who were greater rascals than count gustavus galgenstein and corporal peter brock he is egregiously mistaken and his knowledge of human nature is not worth a fig if they had not been two prominent scoundrels what earthly business should we have in detailing their histories what would the public care for them who would meddle with dull virtue humdrum sentiment or stupid innocence when vice agreeable vice is the only thing which the readers of romances care to hear  the little horseboy who was leading the two black flanders horses up and down the green might have put them in the stable for any good that the horses got by the gentle exercise which they were now taking in the cool evening air as their owners had not ridden very far or very hard and there was not a hair turned of their sleek shining coats but the lad had been especially ordered so to walk the horses about until he received further commands from the gentlemen reposing in the bugle kitchen and the idlers of the village seemed so pleased with the beasts and their smart saddles and shining bridles that it would have been a pity to deprive them of the pleasure of contemplating such an innocent spectacle over the counts horse was thrown a fine red cloth richly embroidered in yellow worsted a very large counts coronet and a cipher at the four corners of the covering and under this might be seen a pair of gorgeous silver stirrups and above it a couple of silvermounted pistols reposing in bearskin holsters the bit was silver too and the horses head was decorated with many smart ribbons of the corporals steed suffice it to say that the ornaments were in brass as bright though not perhaps so valuable as those which decorated the captains animal the boys who had been at play on the green first paused and entered into conversation with the horseboy then the village matrons followed and afterwards sauntering by ones and twos came the village maidens who love soldiers as flies love treacle presently the males began to arrive and lo the parson of the parish taking his evening walk with mrs dobbs and the four children his offspring at length joined himself to his flock  to this audience the little ostler explained that the animals belonged to two gentlemen now reposing at the bugle one young with gold hair the other old with grizzled locks both in red coats both in jackboots putting the house into a bustle and calling for the best he then discoursed to some of his own companions regarding the merits of the horses and the parson a learned man explained to the villagers that one of the travellers must be a count or at least had a counts horsecloth pronounced that the stirrups were of real silver and checked the impetuosity of his son william nassau dobbs who was for mounting the animals and who expressed a longing to fire off one of the pistols in the holsters  as this family discussion was taking place the gentlemen whose appearance had created so much attention came to the door of the inn and the elder and stouter was seen to smile at his companion after which he strolled leisurely over the green and seemed to examine with much benevolent satisfaction the assemblage of villagers who were staring at him and the quadrupeds  mr brock when he saw the parsons band and cassock took off his beaver reverently and saluted the divine i hope your reverence wont baulk the little fellow said he i think i heard him calling out for a ride and whether he should like my horse or his lordships horse i am sure it is all one dont be afraid sir the horses are not tired we have only come seventy mile today and prince eugene once rode a matter of fiftytwo leagues a hundred and fifty miles sir upon that horse between sunrise and sunset  gracious powers on which horse said doctor dobbs very solemnly  on this siron mine corporal brock of cuttss black gelding william of nassau the prince sir gave it me after blenheim fight for i had my own legs carried away by a cannonball just as i cut down two of sauerkrauters regiment who had made the prince prisoner  your own legs sir said the doctor gracious goodness this is more and more astonishing  no no not my own legs my horses i mean sir and the prince gave me william of nassau that very day  to this no direct reply was made but the doctor looked at mrs dobbs and mrs dobbs and the rest of the children at her eldest son who grinned and said isnt it wonderful the corporal to this answered nothing but resuming his account pointed to the other horse and said that horse sirgood as mine isthat horse with the silver stirrups is his excellencys horse captain count maximilian gustavus adolphus von galgenstein captain of horse and of the holy roman empire he lifted here his hat with much gravity and all the crowd even to the parson did likewise we call him george of denmark sir in compliment to her majestys husband he is blenheim too sir marshal tallard rode him on that day and you know how he was taken prisoner by the count  george of denmark marshal tallard william of nassau this is strange indeed most wonderful why sir little are you aware that there are before you at this moment two other living beings who bear these venerated names my boys stand forward look here sir these children have been respectively named after our late sovereign and the husband of our present queen  and very good names too sir ay and very noble little fellows too and i propose that with your reverence and your ladyships leave william nassau here shall ride on george of denmark and george of denmark shall ride on william of nassau  when this speech of the corporals was made the whole crowd set up a loyal hurrah and with much gravity the two little boys were lifted up into the saddles and the corporal leading one entrusted the other to the horseboy and so together marched stately up and down the green  the popularity which mr brock gained by this manoeuvre was very great but with regard to the names of the horses and children which coincided so extraordinarily it is but fair to state that the christening of the quadrupeds had only taken place about two minutes before the dragoons appearance on the green for if the fact must be confessed he while seated near the inn window had kept a pretty wistful eye upon all going on without and the horses marching thus to and fro for the wonderment of the village were only placards or advertisements for the riders  there was besides the boy now occupied with the horses and the landlord and landlady of the bugle inn another person connected with that establishmenta very smart handsome vain giggling servantgirl about the age of sixteen who went by the familiar name of cat and attended upon the gentlemen in the parlour while the landlady was employed in cooking their supper in the kitchen this young person had been educated in the village poorhouse and having been pronounced by doctor dobbs and the schoolmaster the idlest dirtiest and most passionate little minx with whom either had ever had to do she was after receiving a very small portion of literary instruction indeed it must be stated that the young lady did not know her letters bound apprentice at the age of nine years to mrs score her relative and landlady of the bugle inn  if miss cat or catherine hall was a slattern and a minx mrs score was a far superior shrew and for the seven years of her apprenticeship the girl was completely at her mistresss mercy yet though wondrously stingy jealous and violent while her maid was idle and extravagant and her husband seemed to abet the girl mrs score put up with the wenchs airs idleness and caprices without ever wishing to dismiss her from the bugle the fact is that miss catherine was a great beauty and for about two years since her fame had begun to spread the custom of the inn had also increased vastly when there was a debate whether the farmers on their way from market would take tother pot catherine by appearing with it would straightway cause the liquor to be swallowed and paid for and when the traveller who proposed riding that night and sleeping at coventry or birmingham was asked by miss catherine whether he would like a fire in his bedroom he generally was induced to occupy it although he might before have vowed to mrs score that he would not for a thousand guineas be absent from home that night the girl had too halfadozen lovers in the village and these were bound in honour to spend their pence at the alehouse she inhabited o woman lovely woman what strong resolves canst thou twist round thy little finger what gunpowder passions canst thou kindle with a single sparkle of thine eye what lies and fribble nonsense canst thou make us listen to as they were gospel truth or splendid wit above all what bad liquor canst thou make us swallow when thou puttest a kiss within the cupand we are content to call the poison wine  the mountainwine at the bugle was in fact execrable but mrs cat who served it to the two soldiers made it so agreeable to them that they found it a passable even a pleasant task to swallow the contents of a second bottle the miracle had been wrought instantaneously on her appearance for whereas at that very moment the count was employed in cursing the wine the landlady the winegrower and the english nation generally when the young woman entered and choosing so to interpret the oaths said coming your honour i think your honour calledgustavus adolphus whistled stared at her very hard and seeming quite dumbstricken by her appearance contented himself by swallowing a whole glass of mountain by way of reply  mr brock was however by no means so confounded as his captain he was thirty years older than the latter and in the course of fifty years of military life had learned to look on the most dangerous enemy or the most beautiful woman with the like daring devilmaycare determination to conquer  my dear mary then said that gentleman his honour is a lord as good as a lord that is for all he allows such humble fellows as i am to drink with him  catherine dropped a low curtsey and said well i dont know if you are joking a poor country girl as all you soldier gentlemen do but his honour looks like a lord though i never see one to be sure  then said the captain gathering courage how do you know i look like one pretty mary  pretty catherine i mean catherine if you please sir  here mr brock burst into a roar of laughter and shouting with many oaths that she was right at first invited her to give him what he called a buss  pretty catherine turned away from him at this request and muttered something about keep your distance low fellow buss indeed poor country girl etc etc placing herself as if for protection on the side of the captain that gentleman looked also very angry but whether at the sight of innocence so outraged or the insolence of the corporal for daring to help himself first we cannot say hark ye mr brock he cried very fiercely i will suffer no such liberties in my presence remember it is only my condescension which permits you to share my bottle in this way take care i dont give you instead a taste of my cane so saying he in a protecting manner placed one hand round mrs catherines waist holding the other clenched very near to the corporals nose  mrs catherine for her share of this action of the counts dropped another curtsey and said thank you my lord but galgensteins threat did not appear to make any impression on mr brock as indeed there was no reason that it should for the corporal at a combat of fisticuffs could have pounded his commander into a jelly in ten minutes so he contented himself by saying well noble captain theres no harm done it is an honour for poor old peter brock to be at table with you and i am sorry sure enough  in truth peter i believe thou art thou hast good reason eh peter but never fear man had i struck thee i never would have hurt thee  i know you would not replied brock laying his hand on his heart with much gravity and so peace was made and healths were drunk miss catherine condescended to put her lips to the captains glass who swore that the wine was thus converted into nectar and although the girl had not previously heard of that liquor she received the compliment as a compliment and smiled and simpered in return  the poor thing had never before seen anybody so handsome or so finely dressed as the count and in the simplicity of her coquetry allowed her satisfaction to be quite visible nothing could be more clumsy than the gentlemans mode of complimenting her but for this perhaps his speeches were more effective than others more delicate would have been and though she said to each oh now my lord and la captain how can you flatter one so and your honours laughing at me and made such polite speeches as are used on these occasions it was manifest from the flutter and blush and the grin of satisfaction which lighted up the buxom features of the little country beauty that the counts first operations had been highly successful when following up his attack he produced from his neck a small locket which had been given him by a dutch lady at the brill and begged miss catherine to wear it for his sake and chucked her under the chin and called her his little rosebud it was pretty clear how things would go anybody who could see the expression of mr brocks countenance at this event might judge of the progress of the irresistible highdutch conqueror  being of a very vain communicative turn our fair barmaid gave her two companions not only a pretty long account of herself but of many other persons in the village whom she could perceive from the window opposite to which she stood yes your honour said shemy lord i mean sixteen last march though theres a many girl in the village that at my age is quite chits theres polly randall now that redhaired girl along with thomas curtis shes seventeen if shes a day though he is the very first sweetheart she has had well as i am saying i was bred up here in the villagefather and mother died very young and i was left a poor orphanwell bless us if thomas havent kissed herto the care of mrs score my aunt who has been a mother to mea stepmother you knowand ive been to stratford fair and to warwick many a time and theres two people who have offered to marry me and ever so many who want to and i wont have noneonly a gentleman as ive always said not a poor clodpole like tom there with the red waistcoat he was one that asked me nor a drunken fellow like sam blacksmith yonder him whose wife has got the black eye but a real gentleman like  like whom my dear said the captain encouraged  la sir how can you why like our squire sir john who rides in such a mortal fine gold coach or at least like the parson doctor dobbsthats he in the black gown walking with madam dobbs in red  and are those his children  yes two girls and two boys and only think he calls one william nassau and one george denmarkisnt it odd and from the parson mrs catherine went on to speak of several humble personages of the village community who as they are not necessary to our story need not be described at full length it was when from the window corporal brock saw the altercation between the worthy divine and his son respecting the latters ride that he judged it a fitting time to step out on the green and to bestow on the two horses those famous historical names which we have just heard applied to them  mr brocks diplomacy was as we have stated quite successful for when the parsons boys had ridden and retired along with their mamma and papa other young gentlemen of humbler rank in the village were placed upon george of denmark and william of nassau the corporal joking and laughing with all the grownup people the women in spite of mr brocks age his red nose and a certain squint of his eye vowed the corporal was a jewel of a man and among the men his popularity was equally great  how much dost thee get thomas clodpole said mr brock to a countryman he was the man whom mrs catherine had described as her suitor who had laughed loudest at some of his jokes how much dost thee get for a weeks work now  mr clodpole whose name was really bullock stated that his wages amounted to three shillings and a puddn  three shillings and a puddnmonstrousand for this you toil like a galleyslave as i have seen them in turkey and americaay gentlemen and in the country of prester john you shiver out of bed on icy winter mornings to break the ice for ball and dapple to drink  yes indeed said the person addressed who seemed astounded at the extent of the corporals information  or you clean pigsty and take dung down to meadow or you act watchdog and tend sheep or you sweep a scythe over a great field of grass and when the sun has scorched the eyes out of your head and sweated the flesh off your bones and wellnigh fried the soul out of your body you go home to whatthree shillings a week and a puddn do you get pudding every day  no only sundays  do you get money enough  no sure  do you get beer enough  oh no never said mr bullock quite resolutely  worthy clodpole give us thy hand it shall have beer enough this day or my names not corporal brock heres the money boy there are twenty pieces in this purse and how do you think i got em and how do you think i shall get others when these are goneby serving her sacred majesty to be sure long life to her and down with the french king  bullock a few of the men and two or three of the boys piped out an hurrah in compliment to this speech of the corporals but it was remarked that the greater part of the crowd drew backthe women whispering ominously to them and looking at the corporal  i see ladies what it is said he you are frightened and think i am a crimp come to steal your sweethearts away what call peter brock a doubledealer i tell you what boys jack churchill himself has shaken this hand and drunk a pot with me do you think hed shake hands with a rogue heres tummas clodpole has never had beer enough and here am i will stand treat to him and any other gentleman am i good enough company for him i have money look you and like to spend it what should i be doing dirty actions forhay tummas  a satisfactory reply to this query was not of course expected by the corporal nor uttered by mr bullock and the end of the dispute was that he and three or four of the rustic bystanders were quite convinced of the good intentions of their new friend and accompanied him back to the bugle to regale upon the promised beer among the corporals guests was one young fellow whose dress would show that he was somewhat better to do in the world than clodpole and the rest of the sunburnt ragged troop who were marching towards the alehouse this man was the only one of his hearers who perhaps was sceptical as to the truth of his stories but as soon as bullock accepted the invitation to drink john hayes the carpenter for such was his name and profession said well thomas if thou goest i will go too  i know thee wilt said thomas thoult goo anywhere catty hall is provided thou canst goo for nothing  nay i have a penny to spend as good as the corporal here  a penny to keep you mean for all your love for the lass at the bugle did thee ever spend a shilling in the house thee wouldnt go now but that i am going too and the captain here stands treat  come come gentlemen no quarrelling said mr brock if this pretty fellow will join us amen say i theres lots of liquor and plenty of money to pay the score comrade tummas give us thy arm mr hayes youre a hearty cock i make no doubt and all such are welcome come along my gentleman farmers mr brock shall have the honour to pay for you all and with this corporal brock accompanied by messrs hayes bullock blacksmith bakersboy butcher and one or two others adjourned to the inn the horses being at the same time conducted to the stable  although we have in this quiet way and without any flourishing of trumpets or beginning of chapters introduced mr hayes to the public and although at first sight a sneaking carpenters boy may seem hardly worthy of the notice of an intelligent reader who looks for a good cutthroat or highwayman for a hero or a pickpocket at the very least this gentlemans words and actions should be carefully studied by the public as he is destined to appear before them under very polite and curious circumstances during the course of this history the speech of the rustic juvenal mr clodpole had seemed to infer that hayes was at once careful of his money and a warm admirer of mrs catherine of the bugle and both the charges were perfectly true hayess father was reported to be a man of some substance and young john who was performing his apprenticeship in the village did not fail to talk very big of his pretensions to fortuneof his entering at the close of his indentures into partnership with his fatherand of the comfortable farm and house over which mrs john hayes whoever she might be would one day preside thus next to the barber and butcher and above even his own master mr hayes took rank in the village and it must not be concealed that his representation of wealth had made some impression upon mrs hall toward whom the young gentleman had cast the eyes of affection if he had been tolerably welllooking and not pale rickety and feeble as he was if even he had been ugly but withal a man of spirit it is probable the girls kindness for him would have been much more decided but he was a poor weak creature not to compare with honest thomas bullock by at least nine inches and so notoriously timid selfish and stingy that there was a kind of shame in receiving his addresses openly and what encouragement mrs catherine gave him could only be in secret  but no mortal is wise at all times and the fact was that hayes who cared for himself intensely had set his heart upon winning catherine and loved her with a desperate greedy eagerness and desire of possession which makes passions for women often so fierce and unreasonable among very cold and selfish men his parents whose frugality he had inherited had tried in vain to wean him from this passion and had made many fruitless attempts to engage him with women who possessed money and desired husbands but hayes was for a wonder quite proof against their attractions and though quite ready to acknowledge the absurdity of his love for a penniless alehouse servantgirl nevertheless persisted in it doggedly i know im a fool said he and whats more the girl does not care for me but marry her i must or i think i shall just die and marry her i will for very much to the credit of miss catherines modesty she had declared that marriage was with her a sine qua non and had dismissed with the loudest scorn and indignation all propositions of a less proper nature  poor thomas bullock was another of her admirers and had offered to marry her but three shillings a week and a puddn was not to the girls taste and thomas had been scornfully rejected hayes had also made her a direct proposal catherine did not say no she was too prudent but she was young and could wait she did not care for mr hayes yet enough to marry himit did not seem indeed in the young womans nature to care for anybodyand she gave her adorer flatteringly to understand that if nobody better appeared in the course of a few years she might be induced to become mrs hayes it was a dismal prospect for the poor fellow to live upon the hope of being one day mrs catherines pisaller  in the meantime she considered herself free as the wind and permitted herself all the innocent gaieties which that chartered libertine a coquette can take she flirted with all the bachelors widowers and married men in a manner which did extraordinary credit to her years and let not the reader fancy such pastimes unnatural at her early age the ladiesheaven bless themare as a general rule coquettes from babyhood upwards little shes of three years old play little airs and graces upon small heroes of five simpering misses of nine make attacks upon young gentlemen of twelve and at sixteen a wellgrown girl under encouraging circumstancessay she is pretty in a family of ugly elder sisters or an only child and heiress or a humble wench at a country inn like our fair catherineis at the very pink and prime of her coquetry they will jilt you at that age with an ease and arch infantine simplicity that never can be surpassed in maturer years  miss catherine then was a franche coquette and mr john hayes was miserable his life was passed in a storm of mean passions and bitter jealousies and desperate attacks upon the indifferencerock of mrs catherines heart which not all his tempest of love could beat down o cruel cruel pangs of love unrequited mean rogues feel them as well as great heroes lives there the man in europe who has not felt them many timeswho has not knelt and fawned and supplicated and wept and cursed and raved all in vain and passed long wakeful nights with ghosts of dead hopes for company shadows of buried remembrances that glide out of their graves of nights and whisper we are dead now but we were once and we made you happy and we come now to mock youdespair o lover despair and dieo cruel pangsdismal nightsnow a sly demon creeps under your nightcap and drops into your ear those soft hopebreathing sweet words uttered on the wellremembered evening there in the drawer of your dressingtable along with the razors and macassar oil lies the dead flower that lady amelia wilhelmina wore in her bosom on the night of a certain ballthe corpse of a glorious hope that seemed once as if it would live for ever so strong was it so full of joy and sunshine there in your writingdesk among a crowd of unpaid bills is the dirty scrap of paper thimblesealed which came in company with a pair of muffetees of her knitting she was a butchers daughter and did all she could poor thing begging you would ware them at collidge and think of her whomarried a publichouse three weeks afterwards and cares for you no more now than she does for the potboy but why multiply instances or seek to depict the agony of poor meanspirited john hayes no mistake can be greater than that of fancying such great emotions of love are only felt by virtuous or exalted men depend upon it love like death plays havoc among the pauperum tabernas and sports with rich and poor wicked and virtuous alike i have often fancied for instance on seeing the haggard pale young oldclothesman who wakes the echoes of our street with his nasal cry of cloi have often i said fancied that besides the load of exuvial coats and breeches under which he staggers there is another weight on himan atrior cura at his tailand while his unshorn lips and nose together are performing that mocking boisterous jackindifferent cry of clo clo who knows what woeful utterances are crying from the heart within there he is chaffering with the footman at no 7 about an old dressinggown you think his whole soul is bent only on the contest about the garment psha there is perhaps some faithless girl in holywell street who fills up his heart and that desultory jewboy is a peripatetic hell take another instancetake the man in the beefshop in saint martins court there he is to all appearances quite calm before the same round of beeffrom morning till sundownfor hundreds of years very likely perhaps when the shutters are closed and all the world tired and silent there is he silent but untiredcutting cutting cutting you enter you get your meat to your liking you depart and quite unmoved on on he goes reaping ceaselessly the great harvest of beef you would fancy that if passion ever failed to conquer it had in vain assailed the calm bosom of that man i doubt it and would give much to know his history  who knows what furious aetnaflames are raging underneath the surface of that calm fleshmountainwho can tell me that that calmness itself is not despair                        the reader if he does not now understand why it was that mr hayes agreed to drink the corporals proffered beer had better just read the foregoing remarks over again and if he does not understand then why small praise to his brains hayes could not bear that mr bullock should have a chance of seeing and perhaps making love to mrs catherine in his absence and though the young woman never diminished her coquetries but on the contrary rather increased them in his presence it was still a kind of dismal satisfaction to be miserable in her company  on this occasion the disconsolate lover could be wretched to his hearts content for catherine had not a word or a look for him but bestowed all her smiles upon the handsome stranger who owned the black horse as for poor tummas bullock his passion was never violent and he was content in the present instance to sigh and drink beer he sighed and drank sighed and drank and drank again until he had swallowed so much of the corporals liquor as to be induced to accept a guinea from his purse also and found himself on returning to reason and sobriety a soldier of queen annes  but oh fancy the agonies of mr hayes when seated with the corporals friends at one end of the kitchen he saw the captain at the place of honour and the smiles which the fair maid bestowed upon him when as she lightly whisked past him with the captains supper she pointing to the locket that once reposed on the breast of the dutch lady at the brill looked archly on hayes and said see john what his lordship has given me and when johns face became green and purple with rage and jealousy mrs catherine laughed ten times louder and cried coming my lord in a voice of shrill triumph that bored through the soul of mr john hayes and left him gasping for breath  on catherines other lover mr thomas this coquetry had no effect he and two comrades of his had by this time quite fallen under the spell of the corporal and hope glory strong beer prince eugene pair of colours more strong beer her blessed majesty plenty more strong beer and such subjects martial and bacchic whirled through their dizzy brains at a railroad pace  and now if there had been a couple of experienced reporters present at the bugle inn they might have taken down a conversation on love and warthe two themes discussed by the two parties occupying the kitchenwhich as the parts were sung together duetwise formed together some very curious harmonies thus while the captain was whispering the softest nothings the corporal was shouting the fiercest combats of the war and like the gentleman at penelopes table on it exiguo pinxit praelia tota bero for example  captain what do you say to a silver trimming pretty catherine dont you think a scarlet ridingcloak handsomely laced would become you wonderfully welland a grey hat with a blue featherand a pretty nag to ride onand all the soldiers to present arms as you pass and say there goes the captains lady what do you think of a sidebox at lincolns inn playhouse or of standing up to a minuet with my lord marquis at  corporal the ball sir ran right up his elbow and was found the next day by surgeon splinter of ourswhere do you think sirupon my honour as a gentleman it came out of the nape of his  captain necklaceand a sweet pair of diamond earrings mayhapand a little shower of patches which ornament a ladys face wondrouslyand a leetle rougethough egad such peachcheeks as yours dont want itfie mrs catherine i should think the birds must come and peck at them as if they were fruit  corporal over the wall and threeandtwenty of our fellows jumped after me by the pope of rome friend tummas that was a dayhad you seen how the mounseers looked when fourandtwenty rampaging hedevils sword and pistol cut and thrust pellmell came tumbling into the redoubt why sir we left in three minutes as many artillerymens heads as there were cannonballs it was ah sacre d you take that o mon dieu run him through ventrebleu and it was ventrebleu with him i warrant you for bleu in the french language means through and ventrewhy you see ventre means  captain waists which are worn now excessive long and for the hoops if you could but see themstap my vitals my dear but there was a lady at warwicks assembly she came in one of my lords coaches who had a hoop as big as a tent you might have dined under it comfortablyha ha pon my faith now  corporal and there we found the duke of marlborough seated along with marshal tallard who was endeavouring to drown his sorrow over a cup of johannisberger wine and a good drink too my lads only not to compare to warwick beer who was the man who has done this said our noble general i stepped up how many heads was it says he that you cut off nineteen says i besides wounding several when he heard it mr hayes you dont drink im blest if he didnt burst into tears noble noble fellow says he marshal you must excuse me if i am pleased to hear of the destruction of your countrymen noble noble fellowheres a hundred guineas for you which sum he placed in my hand nay says the marshal the man has done his duty and pulling out a magnificent gold diamondhilted snuffbox he gave me  mr bullock what a goold snuffbox wauns but thee wast in luck corporal  corporal no not the snuffbox buta pinch of snuffha harun me through the body if he didnt could you but have seen the smile on jack churchills grave face at this piece of generosity so beckoning colonel cadogan up to him he pinched his ear and whispered  captain may i have the honour to dance a minuet with your ladyship the whole room was in titters at jacks blunder for as you know very well poor lady susan has a wooden leg ha ha fancy a minuet and a wooden leg hey my dear  mrs catherine gigglegigglegiggle he he he oh captain you rogue you  second table haw haw haw well you be a foony mon sergeant zure enoff                        this little specimen of the conversation must be sufficient it will show pretty clearly that each of the two military commanders was conducting his operations with perfect success three of the detachment of five attacked by the corporal surrendered to him mr bullock namely who gave in at a very early stage of the evening and ignominiously laid down his arms under the table after standing not more than a dozen volleys of beer mr blacksmiths boy and a labourer whose name we have not been able to learn mr butcher himself was on the point of yielding when he was rescued by the furious charge of a detachment that marched to his relief his wife namely who with two squalling children rushed into the bugle boxed butchers ears and kept up such a tremendous fire of oaths and screams upon the corporal that he was obliged to retreat fixing then her claws into mr butchers hair she proceeded to drag him out of the premises and thus mr brock was overcome his attack upon john hayes was a still greater failure for that young man seemed to be invincible by drink if not by love and at the end of the drinkingbout was a great deal more cool than the corporal himself to whom he wished a very polite goodevening as calmly he took his hat to depart he turned to look at catherine to be sure and then he was not quite so calm but catherine did not give any reply to his goodnight she was seated at the captains table playing at cribbage with him and though count gustavus maximilian lost every game he won more than he lostsly fellowand mrs catherine was no match for him  it is to be presumed that hayes gave some information to mrs score the landlady for on leaving the kitchen he was seen to linger for a moment in the bar and very soon after mrs catherine was called away from her attendance on the count who when he asked for a sack and toast was furnished with those articles by the landlady herself and during the halfhour in which he was employed in consuming this drink monsieur de galgenstein looked very much disturbed and out of humour and cast his eyes to the door perpetually but no catherine came at last very sulkily he desired to be shown to bed and walked as well as he could for to say truth the noble count was by this time somewhat unsteady on his legs to his chamber it was mrs score who showed him to it and closed the curtains and pointed triumphantly to the whiteness of the sheets  its a very comfortable room said she though not the best in the house which belong of right to your lordships worship but our best room has two beds and mr corporal is in that locked and doublelocked with his three tipsy recruits but your honour will find this here bed comfortable and wellaired ive slept in it myself this eighteen years  what my good woman you are going to sit up eh its cruel hard on you madam  sit up my lord bless you no i shall have half of our cats bed as i always do when theres company and with this mrs score curtseyed and retired  very early the next morning the active landlady and her bustling attendant had prepared the ale and bacon for the corporal and his three converts and had set a nice white cloth for the captains breakfast the young blacksmith did not eat with much satisfaction but mr bullock and his friend betrayed no sign of discontent except such as may be consequent upon an evenings carouse they walked very contentedly to be registered before doctor dobbs who was also justice of the peace and went in search of their slender bundles and took leave of their few acquaintances without much regret for the gentlemen had been bred in the workhouse and had not therefore a large circle of friends  it wanted only an hour of noon and the noble count had not descended the men were waiting for him and spent much of the queens money earned by the sale of their bodies overnight while thus expecting him perhaps mrs catherine expected him too for she had offered many times to run upwith my lords bootswith the hot waterto show mr brock the way who sometimes condescended to officiate as barber but on all these occasions mrs score had prevented her not scolding but with much gentleness and smiling at last more gentle and smiling than ever she came downstairs and said catherine darling his honour the count is mighty hungry this morning and vows he could pick the wing of a fowl run down child to farmer briggs and get one pluck it before you bring it you know and we will make his lordship a pretty breakfast  catherine took up her basket and away she went by the backyard through the stables there she heard the little horseboy whistling and hissing after the manner of horseboys and there she learned that mrs score had been inventing an ingenious story to have her out of the way the ostler said he was just going to lead the two horses round to the door the corporal had been and they were about to start on the instant for stratford  the fact was that count gustavus adolphus far from wishing to pick the wing of a fowl had risen with a horror and loathing for everything in the shape of food and for any liquor stronger than small beer of this he had drunk a cup and said he should ride immediately to stratford and when on ordering his horses he had asked politely of the landlady why the d she always came up and why she did not send the girl mrs score informed the count that her catherine was gone out for a walk along with the young man to whom she was to be married and would not be visible that day on hearing this the captain ordered his horses that moment and abused the wine the bed the house the landlady and everything connected with the bugle inn  out the horses came the little boys of the village gathered round the recruits with bunches of ribands in their beavers appeared presently corporal brock came swaggering out and slapping the pleased blacksmith on the back bade him mount his horse while the boys hurrahd then the captain came out gloomy and majestic to him mr brock made a military salute which clumsily and with much grinning the recruits imitated i shall walk on with these brave fellows your honour and meet you at stratford said the corporal good said the captain as he mounted the landlady curtseyed the children hurrahd more the little horseboy who held the bridle with one hand and the stirrup with the other and expected a crownpiece from such a noble gentleman got only a kick and a curse as count von galgenstein shouted d you all get out of the way and galloped off and john hayes who had been sneaking about the inn all the morning felt a weight off his heart when he saw the captain ride off alone  o foolish mrs score o dolt of a john hayes if the landlady had allowed the captain and the maid to have their way and meet but for a minute before recruits sergeant and all it is probable that no harm would have been done and that this history would never have been written  when count von galgenstein had ridden half a mile on the stratford road looking as black and dismal as napoleon galloping from the romantic village of waterloo he espied a few score yards onwards at the turn of the road a certain object which caused him to check his horse suddenly brought a tingling red into his cheeks and made his heart to go thumpthump against his side a young lass was sauntering slowly along the footpath with a basket swinging from one hand and a bunch of hedgeflowers in the other she stopped once or twice to add a fresh one to her nosegay and might have seen him the captain thought but no she never looked directly towards him and still walked on sweet innocent she was singing as if none were near her voice went soaring up to the clear sky and the captain put his horse on the grass that the sound of the hoofs might not disturb the music       when the kine had given a pailful         and the sheep came bleating home       poll who knew it would be healthful         went awalking out with tom       hand in hand sir on the land sir         as they walked to and fro       tom made jolly love to polly         but was answered no no no  the captain had put his horse on the grass that the sound of his hoofs might not disturb the music and now he pushed its head on to the bank where straightway george of denmark began chewing of such a salad as grew there and now the captain slid off stealthily and smiling comically and hitching up his great jackboots and moving forward with a jerking tiptoe step he just as she was trilling the last ooo of the last no in the above poem of tom durfey came up to her and touching her lightly on the waist said  my dear your very humble servant  mrs catherine you know you have found her out long ago gave a scream and a start and would have turned pale if she could as it was she only shook all over and said  oh sir how you did frighten me  frighten you my rosebud why run me through id die rather than frighten you gad child tell me now am i so very frightful  oh no your honour i didnt mean that only i wasnt thinking to meet you here or that you would ride so early at all for if you please sir i was going to fetch a chicken for your lordships breakfast as my mistress said you would like one and i thought instead of going to farmer briggs down birmingham way as she told me id go to farmer birds where the chickens is better sirmy lord i mean  said id like a chicken for breakfast the old cat why i told her i would not eat a morsel to save mei was so drui mean i ate such a good supper last nightand i bade her to send me a pot of small beer and to tell you to bring it and the wretch said you were gone out with your sweetheart  what john hayes the creature oh what a naughty storytelling woman  you had walked out with your sweetheart and i was not to see you any more and i was mad with rage and ready to kill myself i was my dear  oh sir pray pray dont  for your sake my sweet angel  yes for my sake if such a poor girl as me can persuade noble gentlemen  well then for your sake i wont no ill live but why live hell and fury if i do live im miserable without you i amyou know i amyou adorable beautiful cruel wicked catherine  catherines reply to this was la bless me i do believe your horse is running away and so he was for having finished his meal in the hedge he first looked towards his master and paused as it were irresolutely then by a sudden impulse flinging up his tail and his hind legs he scampered down the road  mrs hall ran lightly after the horse and the captain after mrs hall and the horse ran quicker and quicker every moment and might have led them a long chasewhen lo debouching from a twist in the road came the detachment of cavalry and infantry under mr brock the moment he was out of sight of the village that gentleman had desired the blacksmith to dismount and had himself jumped into the saddle maintaining the subordination of his army by drawing a pistol and swearing that he would blow out the brains of any person who attempted to run when the captains horse came near the detachment he paused and suffered himself to be caught by tummas bullock who held him until the owner and mrs catherine came up  mr bullock looked comically grave when he saw the pair but the corporal graciously saluted mrs catherine and said it was a fine day for walking  la sir and so it is said she panting in a very pretty and distressing way but not for running i do protesthaand vow that i really can scarcely stand im so tired of running after that naughty naughty horse  how do cattern said thomas zee i be going a zouldiering because thee wouldnt have me and here mr bullock grinned mrs catherine made no sort of reply but protested once more she should die of running if the truth were told she was somewhat vexed at the arrival of the corporals detachment and had had very serious thoughts of finding herself quite tired just as he came in sight  a sudden thought brought a smile of bright satisfaction in the captains eyes he mounted the horse which tummas still held tired mrs catherine said he and for my sake by heavens you shant walk a step farther no you shall ride back with a guard of honour back to the village gentlemenrightabout face show those fellows corporal how to rightabout face now my dear mount behind me on snowball hes easy as a sedan put your dear little foot on the toe of my boot there nowupjump hurrah  thats not the way captain shouted out thomas still holding on to the rein as the horse began to move thee woant goo with him will thee catty  but mrs catherine though she turned away her head never let go her hold round the captains waist and he swearing a dreadful oath at thomas struck him across the face and hands with his riding whip the poor fellow who at the first cut still held on to the rein dropped it at the second and as the pair galloped off sat down on the roadside and fairly began to weep  march you dog shouted out the corporal a minute after and so he did and when next he saw mrs catherine she was the captains lady sure enough and wore a grey hat with a blue feather and red ridingcoat trimmed with silverlace but thomas was then on a barebacked horse which corporal brock was flanking round a ring and he was so occupied looking between his horses ears that he had no time to cry then and at length got the better of his attachment                        this being a good opportunity for closing chapter i we ought perhaps to make some apologies to the public for introducing them to characters that are so utterly worthless as we confess all our heroes with the exception of mr bullock to be in this we have consulted nature and history rather than the prevailing taste and the general manner of authors the amusing novel of ernest maltravers for instance opens with a seduction but then it is performed by people of the strictest virtue on both sides and there is so much religion and philosophy in the heart of the seducer so much tender innocence in the soul of the seduced thatbless the little dearstheir very peccadilloes make one interested in them and their naughtiness becomes quite sacred so deliciously is it described now if we are to be interested by rascally actions let us have them with plain faces and let them be performed not by virtuous philosophers but by rascals another clever class of novelists adopt the contrary system and create interest by making their rascals perform virtuous actions against these popular plans we here solemnly appeal we say let your rogues in novels act like rogues and your honest men like honest men dont let us have any juggling and thimblerigging with virtue and vice so that at the end of three volumes the bewildered reader shall not know which is which dont let us find ourselves kindling at the generous qualities of thieves and sympathising with the rascalities of noble hearts for our own part we know what the public likes and have chosen rogues for our characters and have taken a story from the newgate calendar which we hope to follow out to edification among the rogues at least we will have nothing that shall be mistaken for virtues and if the british public after calling for three or four editions shall give up not only our rascals but the rascals of all other authors we shall be contentwe shall apply to government for a pension and think that our duty is done    chapter ii in which are depicted the pleasures of a sentimental attachment   it will not be necessary for the purpose of this history to follow out very closely all the adventures which occurred to mrs catherine from the period when she quitted the bugle and became the captains lady for although it would be just as easy to show as not that the young woman by following the man of her heart had only yielded to an innocent impulse and by remaining with him for a certain period had proved the depth and strength of her affection for himalthough we might make very tender and eloquent apologies for the error of both parties the reader might possibly be disgusted at such descriptions and such arguments which besides are already done to his hand in the novel of ernest maltravers before mentioned  from the gentlemans manner towards mrs catherine and from his brilliant and immediate success the reader will doubtless have concluded in the first place that gustavus adolphus had not a very violent affection for mrs cat in the second place that he was a professional ladykiller and therefore likely at some period to resume his profession thirdly and to conclude that a connection so begun must in the nature of things be likely to end speedily  and so to do the count justice it would if he had been allowed to follow his own inclination entirely for as many young gentlemen will and yet no praise to them in about a week he began to be indifferent in a month to be weary in two months to be angry in three to proceed to blows and curses and in short to repent most bitterly the hour when he had ever been induced to present mrs catherine the toe of his boot for the purpose of lifting her on to his horse  egad said he to the corporal one day when confiding his griefs to mr brock i wish my toe had been cut off before ever it served as a ladder to this little vixen  or perhaps your honour would wish to kick her downstairs with it delicately suggested mr brock  kick her why the wench would hold so fast by the banisters that i could not kick her down mr brock to tell you a bit of a secret i have tried as muchnot to kick herno no not kick her certainly thats ungentlemanlybut to induce her to go back to that cursed pothouse where we fell in with her i have given her many hints  oh yes i saw your honour give her one yesterdaywith a mug of beer by the laws as the ale run all down her face and she clutched a knife to run at you i dont think i ever saw such a shedevil that woman will do for your honour some day if you provoke her  do for me no hang it mr brock never she loves every hair of my head sir she worships me corporal egad yes she worships me and would much sooner apply a knife to her own weasand than scratch my little finger  i think she does said mr brock  im sure of it said the captain women look you are like dogs they like to be illtreated they like it sir i know they do i never had anything to do with a woman in my life but i illtreated her and she liked me the better  mrs hall ought to be very fond of you then sure enough said mr corporal  very fondha ha corporal you wag youand so she is very fond yesterday after the knifeandbeer sceneno wonder i threw the liquor in her face it was so devlish flat that no gentleman could drink it and i told her never to draw it till dinnertime  oh it was enough to put an angel in a fury said brock  well yesterday after the knife business when you had got the carver out of her hand off she flings to her bedroom will not eat a bit of dinner forsooth and remains locked up for a couple of hours at two oclock afternoon i was over a tankard out comes the little shedevil her face pale her eyes bleared and the tip of her nose as red as fire with sniffling and weeping making for my hand max says she will you forgive me what says i forgive a murderess says i no curse me never your cruelty will kill me sobbed she cruelty be hanged says i didnt you draw that beer an hour before dinner she could say nothing to this you know and i swore that every time she did so i would fling it into her face again whereupon back she flounced to her chamber where she wept and stormed until nighttime  when you forgave her  i did forgive her thats positive you see i had supped at the rose along with tom trippet and halfadozen pretty fellows and i had eased a great fatheaded warwickshire landjunkerwhat dye call himsquire of forty pieces and im devlish goodhumoured when ive won and so cat and i made it up but ive taught her never to bring me stale beer againha ha  this conversation will explain a great deal better than any description of ours however eloquent the state of things as between count maximilian and mrs catherine and the feelings which they entertained for each other the woman loved him that was the fact and as we have shown in the previous chapter how john hayes a meanspirited fellow as ever breathed in respect of all other passions a pigmy was in the passion of love a giant and followed mrs catherine with a furious longing which might seem at the first to be foreign to his nature in the like manner and playing at crosspurposes mrs hall had become smitten of the captain and as he said truly only liked him the better for the brutality which she received at his hands for it is my opinion madam that love is a bodily infirmity from which humankind can no more escape than from smallpox and which attacks every one of us from the first duke in the peerage down to jack ketch inclusive which has no respect for rank virtue or roguery in man but sets each in his turn in a fever which breaks out the deuce knows how or why and raging its appointed time fills each individual of the one sex with a blind fury and longing for some one of the other who may be pure gentle blueeyed beautiful and good or vile shrewish squinting hunchbacked and hideous according to circumstances and luck which dies away perhaps in the natural course if left to have its way but which contradiction causes to rage more furiously than ever is not history from the trojan war upwards and downwards full of instances of such strange inexplicable passions was not helen by the most moderate calculation ninety years of age when she went off with his royal highness prince paris of troy was not madame la valliere illmade bleareyed tallowcomplexioned scraggy and with hair like tow was not wilkes the ugliest charmingest most successful man in the world such instances might be carried out so as to fill a volume but cui bono love is fate and not will its origin not to be explained its progress irresistible and the best proof of this may be had at bow street any day where if you ask any officer of the establishment how they take most thieves he will tell you at the houses of the women they must see the dear creatures though they hang for it they will love though they have their necks in the halter and with regard to the other position that illusage on the part of the man does not destroy the affection of the woman have we not numberless policereports showing how when a bystander would beat a husband for beating his wife man and wife fall together on the interloper and punish him for his meddling  these points then being settled to the satisfaction of all parties the reader will not be disposed to question the assertion that mrs hall had a real affection for the gallant count and grew as mr brock was pleased to say like a beefsteak more tender as she was thumped poor thing poor thing his flashy airs and smart looks had overcome her in a single hour and no more is wanted to plunge into love over head and ears no more is wanted to make a first love withand a womans first love lasts for ever a mans twentyfourth or twentyfifth is perhaps the best you cant kill it do what you will it takes root and lives and even grows never mind what the soil may be in which it is planted or the bitter weather it must bearoften as one has seen a wallflower growout of a stone  in the first weeks of their union the count had at least been liberal to her she had a horse and fine clothes and received abroad some of those flattering attentions which she held at such high price he had however some illluck at play or had been forced to pay some bills or had some other satisfactory reason for being poor and his establishment was very speedily diminished he argued that as mrs catherine had been accustomed to wait on others all her life she might now wait upon herself and him and when the incident of the beer arose she had been for some time employed as the counts housekeeper with unlimited superintendence over his comfort his cellar his linen and such matters as bachelors are delighted to make over to active female hands to do the poor wretch justice she actually kept the mans menage in the best order nor was there any point of extravagance with which she could be charged except a little extravagance of dress displayed on the very few occasions when he condescended to walk abroad with her and extravagance of language and passion in the frequent quarrels they had together perhaps in such a connection as subsisted between this precious couple these faults are inevitable on the part of the woman she must be silly and vain and will pretty surely therefore be fond of dress and she must disguise it as she will be perpetually miserable and brooding over her fall which will cause her to be violent and quarrelsome  such at least was mrs hall and very early did the poor vain misguided wretch begin to reap what she had sown  for a man remorse under these circumstances is perhaps uncommon no stigma affixes on him for betraying a woman no bitter pangs of mortified vanity no insulting looks of superiority from his neighbour and no sentence of contemptuous banishment is read against him these all fall on the tempted and not on the tempter who is permitted to go free the chief thing that a man learns after having successfully practised on a woman is to despise the poor wretch whom he has won the game in fact and the glory such as it is is all his and the punishment alone falls upon her consider this ladies when charming young gentlemen come to woo you with soft speeches you have nothing to win except wretchedness and scorn and desertion consider this and be thankful to your solomons for telling it  it came to pass then that the count had come to have a perfect contempt and indifference for mrs hallhow should he not for a young person who had given herself up to him so easilyand would have been quite glad of any opportunity of parting with her but there was a certain lingering shame about the man which prevented him from saying at once and abruptly go and the poor thing did not choose to take such hints as fell out in the course of their conversation and quarrels and so they kept on together he treating her with simple insult and she hanging on desperately by whatever feeble twig she could find to the rock beyond which all was naught or death to her  well after the night with tom trippet and the pretty fellows at the rose to which we have heard the count allude in the conversation just recorded fortune smiled on him a good deal for the warwickshire squire who had lost forty pieces on that occasion insisted on having his revenge the night after when strange to say a hundred and fifty more found their way into the pouch of his excellency the count such a sum as this quite set the young nobleman afloat again and brought back a pleasing equanimity to his mind which had been a good deal disturbed in the former difficult circumstances and in this for a little and to a certain extent poor cat had the happiness to share he did not alter the style of his establishment which consisted as before of herself and a small person who acted as scourer kitchenwench and scullion mrs catherine always putting her hand to the principal pieces of the dinner but he treated his mistress with tolerable goodhumour or to speak more correctly with such bearable brutality as might be expected from a man like him to a woman in her condition besides a certain event was about to take place which not unusually occurs in circumstances of this nature and mrs catherine was expecting soon to lie in  the captain distrusting naturally the strength of his own paternal feelings had kindly endeavoured to provide a parent for the coming infant and to this end had opened a negotiation with our friend mr thomas bullock declaring that mrs cat should have a fortune of twenty guineas and reminding tummas of his ancient flame for her but mr tummas when this proposition was made to him declined it with many oaths and vowed that he was perfectly satisfied with his present bachelor condition in this dilemma mr brock stepped forward who declared himself very ready to accept mrs catherine and her fortune and might possibly have become the possessor of both had not mrs cat the moment she heard of the proposed arrangement with fire in her eyes and rageoh how bitterin her heart prevented the success of the measure by proceeding incontinently to the first justice of the peace and there swearing before his worship who was the father of the coming child  this proceeding which she had expected would cause not a little indignation on the part of her lord and master was received by him strangely enough with considerable goodhumour he swore that the wench had served him a good trick and was rather amused at the anger the outbreak of fierce rage and contumely and the wretched wretched tears of heartsick desperation which followed her announcement of this step to him for mr brock she repelled his offer with scorn and loathing and treated the notion of a union with mr bullock with yet fiercer contempt marry him indeed a workhouse pauper carrying a brownbess she would have died sooner she said or robbed on the highway and so to do her justice she would for the little minx was one of the vainest creatures in existence and vanity as i presume everybody knows becomes the principle in certain womens heartstheir moral spectacles their conscience their meat and drink their only rule of right and wrong  as for mr tummas he as we have seen was quite unfriendly to the proposition as she could be and the corporal with a good deal of comical gravity vowed that as he could not be satisfied in his dearest wishes he would take to drinking for a consolation which he straightway did  come tummas said he to mr bullock since we cant have the girl of our hearts why hang it tummas lets drink her health to which bullock had no objection and so strongly did the disappointment weigh upon honest corporal brock that even when after unheardof quantities of beer he could scarcely utter a word he was seen absolutely to weep and in accents almost unintelligible to curse his confounded illluck at being deprived not of a wife but of a child he wanted one so he said to comfort him in his old age  the time of mrs catherines couche drew near arrived and was gone through safely she presented to the world a chopping boy who might use if he liked the galgenstein arms with a barsinister and in her new cares and duties had not so many opportunities as usual of quarrelling with the count who perhaps respected her situation or at least was so properly aware of the necessity of quiet to her that he absented himself from home morning noon and night  the captain had it must be confessed turned these continued absences to a considerable worldly profit for he played incessantly and since his first victory over the warwickshire squire fortune had been so favourable to him that he had at various intervals amassed a sum of nearly a thousand pounds which he used to bring home as he won and which he deposited in a strong iron chest cunningly screwed down by himself under his own bed this mrs catherine regularly made and the treasure underneath it could be no secret to her however the noble count kept the key and bound her by many solemn oaths that he discharged at her himself not to reveal to any other person the existence of the chest and its contents  but it is not in a womans nature to keep such secrets and the captain who left her for days and days did not reflect that she would seek for confidants elsewhere for want of a female companion she was compelled to bestow her sympathies upon mr brock who as the counts corporal was much in his lodgings and who did manage to survive the disappointment which he had experienced by mrs catherines refusal of him  about two months after the infants birth the captain who was annoyed by its squalling put it abroad to nurse and dismissed its attendant mrs catherine now resumed her household duties and was as before at once mistress and servant of the establishment as such she had the keys of the beer and was pretty sure of the attentions of the corporal who became as we have said in the counts absence his ladys chief friend and companion after the manner of ladies she very speedily confided to him all her domestic secrets the causes of her former discontent the counts illtreatment of her the wicked names he called her the prices that all her gowns had cost her how he beat her how much money he won and lost at play how she had once pawned a coat for him how he had four new ones laced and paid for what was the best way of cleaning and keeping goldlace of making cherrybrandy pickling salmon etc etc her confidences upon all these subjects used to follow each other in rapid succession and mr brock became ere long quite as well acquainted with the captains history for the last year as the count himselffor he was careless and forgot things women never do they chronicle all the lovers small actions his words his headaches the dresses he has worn the things he has liked for dinner on certain daysall which circumstances commonly are expunged from the male brain immediately after they have occurred but remain fixed with the female  to brock then and to brock only for she knew no other soul mrs cat breathed in strictest confidence the history of the counts winnings and his way of disposing of them how he kept his money screwed down in an iron chest in their room and a very lucky fellow did brock consider his officer for having such a large sum he and cat looked at the chest it was small but mighty strong sure enough and would defy picklocks and thieves well if any man deserved money the captain did though he might buy me a few yards of that lace i love so interrupted catif any man deserved money he did for he spent it like a prince and his hand was always in his pocket  it must now be stated that monsieur de galgenstein had during cats seclusion cast his eyes upon a young lady of good fortune who frequented the assembly at birmingham and who was not a little smitten by his title and person the four new coats laced and paid for as cat said had been purchased most probably by his excellency for the purpose of dazzling the heiress and he and the coats had succeeded so far as to win from the young woman an actual profession of love and a promise of marriage provided pa would consent this was obtainedfor pa was a tradesman and i suppose every one of my readers has remarked how great an effect a title has on the lower classes yes thank heaven there is about a freeborn briton a cringing baseness and lickspittle awe of rank which does not exist under any tyranny in europe and is only to be found here and in america  all these negotiations had been going on quite unknown to cat and as the captain had determined before two months were out to fling that young woman on the pave he was kind to her in the meanwhile people always are when they are swindling you or meditating an injury against you  the poor girl had much too high an opinion of her own charms to suspect that the count could be unfaithful to them and had no notion of the plot that was formed against her but mr brock had for he had seen many times a gilt coach with a pair of fat white horses ambling in the neighbourhood of the town and the captain on his black steed caracolling majestically by its side and he had remarked a fat pudgy palehaired woman treading heavily down the stairs of the assembly leaning on the captains arm all these mr brock had seen not without reflection indeed the count one day in great goodhumour had slapped him on the shoulder and told him that he was about speedily to purchase a regiment when by his great gods mr brock should have a pair of colours perhaps this promise occasioned his silence to mrs catherine hitherto perhaps he never would have peached at all and perhaps therefore this history would never have been written but for a small circumstance which occurred at this period  what can you want with that drunken old corporal always about your quarters said mr trippet to the count one day as they sat over their wine in the midst of a merry company at the captains rooms  what said he old brock the old thief has been more useful to me than many a better man he is as brave in a row as a lion as cunning in intrigue as a fox he can nose a dun at an inconceivable distance and scent out a pretty woman be she behind ever so many stone walls if a gentleman wants a good rascal now i can recommend him i am going to reform you know and must turn him out of my service  and pretty mrs cat  oh curse pretty mrs cat she may go too  and the brat  why you have parishes and what not here in england egad if a gentleman were called upon to keep all his children there would be no living no stap my vitals croesus couldnt stand it  no indeed said mr trippet you are right and when a gentleman marries he is bound in honour to give up such low connections as are useful when he is a bachelor  of course and give them up i will when the sweet mrs dripping is mine as for the girl you can have her tom trippet if you take a fancy to her and as for the corporal he may be handed over to my successor in cuttssfor i will have a regiment to myself thats poz and to take with me such a swindling pimping thieving brandyfaced rascal as this brock will never do egad hes a disgrace to the service as it is ive often a mind to have the superannuated vagabond drummed out of the corps  although this resume of mr brocks character and accomplishments was very just it came perhaps with an ill grace from count gustavus adolphus maximilian who had profited by all his qualities and who certainly would never have given this opinion of them had he known that the door of his diningparlour was open and that the gallant corporal who was in the passage could hear every syllable that fell from the lips of his commanding officer we shall not say after the fashion of the storybooks that mr brock listened with a flashing eye and a distended nostril that his chest heaved tumultuously and that his hand fell down mechanically to his side where it played with the brass handle of his sword mr kean would have gone through most of these bodily exercises had he been acting the part of a villain enraged and disappointed like corporal brock but that gentleman walked away without any gestures of any kind and as gently as possible hell turn me out of the regiment will he says he quite piano and then added con molta espressione ill do for him  and it is to be remarked how generally in cases of this nature gentlemen stick to their word    chapter iii in which a narcotic is administered and a great deal of genteel society depicted   when the corporal who had retreated to the streetdoor immediately on hearing the above conversation returned to the captains lodgings and paid his respects to mrs catherine he found that lady in high goodhumour the count had been with her she said along with a friend of his mr trippet had promised her twelve yards of the lace she coveted so much had vowed that the child should have as much more for a cloak and had not left her until he had sat with her for an hour or more over a bowl of punch which he made on purpose for her mr trippet stayed too a mighty pleasant man said she only not very wise and seemingly a good deal in liquor  a good deal indeed said the corporal he was so tipsy just now that he could hardly stand he and his honour were talking to nan fantail in the marketplace and she pulled trippets wig off for wanting to kiss her  the nasty fellow said mrs cat to demean himself with such low people as nan fantail indeed why upon my conscience now corporal it was but an hour ago that mr trippet swore he never saw such a pair of eyes as mine and would like to cut the captains throat for the love of me nan fantail indeed  nans an honest girl madam catherine and was a great favourite of the captains before someone else came in his way no one can say a word against hernot a word  and pray corporal who ever did said mrs cat rather offended a nasty ugly slut i wonder what the men can see in her  she has got a smart way with her sure enough its what amuses the men and  and what you dont mean to say that my max is fond of her now said mrs catherine looking very fierce  oh no not at all not of herthat is  not of her screamed she of whom then  oh psha nonsense of you my dear to be sure who else should he care for and besides what business is it of mine and herewith the corporal began whistling as if he would have no more of the conversation but mrs cat was not to be satisfiednot sheand carried on her crossquestions  why look you said the corporal after parrying many of thesewhy look you im an old fool catherine and i must blab that man has been the best friend i ever had and so i was quiet but i cant keep it in any longerno hang me if i can its my belief hes acting like a rascal by you he deceives you catherine hes a scoundrel mrs hall thats the truth ont  catherine prayed him to tell all he knew and he resumed  he wants you off his hands hes sick of you and so brought here that fool tom trippet who has taken a fancy to you he has not the courage to turn you out of doors like a man though indoors he can treat you like a beast but ill tell you what hell do in a month he will go to coventry or pretend to go there on recruiting business no such thing mrs hall hes going on marriage business and hell leave you without a farthing to starve or to rot for him its all arranged i tell you in a month you are to be starved into becoming tom trippets mistress and his honour is to marry rich miss dripping the twentythousandpounder from london and to purchase a regimentand to get old brock drummed out of cuttss too said the corporal under his breath but he might have spoken out if he chose for the poor young woman had sunk on the ground in a real honest fit  i thought i should give it her said mr brock as he procured a glass of water and lifting her on to a sofa sprinkled the same over her hang it how pretty she is                        when mrs catherine came to herself again brocks tone with her was kind and almost feeling nor did the poor wench herself indulge in any subsequent shiverings and hysterics such as usually follow the faintingfits of persons of higher degree she pressed him for further explanations which he gave and to which she listened with a great deal of calmness nor did many tears sobs sighs or exclamations of sorrow or anger escape from her only when the corporal was taking his leave and said to her pointblankwell mrs catherine and what do you intend to do she did not reply a word but gave a look which made him exclaim on leaving the room  by heavens the woman means murder i would not be the holofernes to lie by the side of such a judith as thatnot i and he went his way immersed in deep thought when the captain returned at night she did not speak to him and when he swore at her for being sulky she only said she had a headache and was dreadfully ill with which excuse gustavus adolphus seemed satisfied and left her to herself  he saw her the next morning for a moment he was going ashooting  catherine had no friend as is usual in tragedies and romancesno mysterious sorceress of her acquaintance to whom she could apply for poisonso she went simply to the apothecaries pretending at each that she had a dreadful toothache and procuring from them as much laudanum as she thought would suit her purpose  when she went home again she seemed almost gay mr brock complimented her upon the alteration in her appearance and she was enabled to receive the captain at his return from shooting in such a manner as made him remark that she had got rid of her sulks of the morning and might sup with them if she chose to keep her goodhumour the supper was got ready and the gentlemen had the punchbowl when the cloth was clearedmrs catherine with her delicate hands preparing the liquor  it is useless to describe the conversation that took place or to reckon the number of bowls that were emptied or to tell how mr trippet who was one of the guests and declined to play at cards when some of the others began chose to remain by mrs catherines side and make violent love to her all this might be told and the account however faithful would not be very pleasing no indeed and here though we are only in the third chapter of this history we feel almost sick of the characters that appear in it and the adventures which they are called upon to go through but how can we help ourselves the public will hear of nothing but rogues and the only way in which poor authors who must live can act honestly by the public and themselves is to paint such thieves as they are not dandy poetical rosewater thieves but real downright scoundrels leading scoundrelly lives drunken profligate dissolute low as scoundrels will be they dont quote plato like eugene aram or live like gentlemen and sing the pleasantest ballads in the world like jolly dick turpin or prate eternally about to kalon like that precious canting maltravers whom we all of us have read about and pitied or die whitewashed saints like poor biss dadsy in oliver twist no my dear madam you and your daughters have no right to admire and sympathise with any such persons fictitious or real you ought to be made cordially to detest scorn loathe abhor and abominate all people of this kidney men of genius like those whose works we have above alluded to have no business to make these characters interesting or agreeable to be feeding your morbid fancies or indulging their own with such monstrous food for our parts young ladies we beg you to bottle up your tears and not waste a single drop of them on any one of the heroes or heroines in this history they are all rascals every soul of them and behave as sich keep your sympathy for those who deserve it dont carry it for preference to the old bailey and grow maudlin over the company assembled there        anglicised version of the authors original greek text  just then have the kindness to fancy that the conversation which took place over the bowls of punch which mrs catherine prepared was such as might be expected to take place where the host was a dissolute daredevil libertine captain of dragoons the guests for the most part of the same class and the hostess a young woman originally from a country alehouse and for the present mistress to the entertainer of the society they talked and they drank and they grew tipsy and very little worth hearing occurred during the course of the whole evening mr brock officiated half as the servant half as the companion of the society mr thomas trippet made violent love to mrs catherine while her lord and master was playing at dice with the other gentlemen and on this night strange to say the captains fortune seemed to desert him the warwickshire squire from whom he had won so much had an amazing run of good luck the captain called perpetually for more drink and higher stakes and lost almost every throw three hundred four hundred six hundredall his winnings of the previous months were swallowed up in the course of a few hours the corporal looked on and to do him justice seemed very grave as sum by sum the squire scored down the counts losses on the paper before him  most of the company had taken their hats and staggered off the squire and mr trippet were the only two that remained the latter still lingering by mrs catherines sofa and table and as she as we have stated had been employed all the evening in mixing the liquor for the gamesters he was at the headquarters of love and drink and had swallowed so much of each as hardly to be able to speak  the dice went rattling on the candles were burning dim with great long wicks mr trippet could hardly see the captain and thought as far as his muzzy reason would let him that the captain could not see him so he rose from his chair as well as he could and fell down on mrs catherines sofa his eyes were fixed his face was pale his jaw hung down and he flung out his arms and said in a maudlin voice oh you byooooootifile cathrine i must have a kickkickiss  beast said mrs catherine and pushed him away the drunken wretch fell off the sofa and on to the floor where he stayed and after snorting out some unintelligible sounds went to sleep  the dice went rattling on the candles were burning dim with great long wicks  sevens the main cried the count four three to two against the caster  ponies said the warwickshire squire  rattle rattle rattle rattle clatter nine clap clap clap clap eleven clutter clutter clutter clutter seven it is says the warwickshire squire that makes eight hundred count  one throw for two hundred said the count but stop cat give us some more punch  mrs cat came forward she looked a little pale and her hand trembled somewhat here is the punch max said she it was steaming hot in a large glass dont drink it all said she leave me some  how dark it is said the count eyeing it  its the brandy said cat  well here goes squire curse you heres your health and bad luck to you and he gulped off more than half the liquor at a draught but presently he put down the glass and cried what infernal poison is this cat  poison said she its no poison give me the glass and she pledged max and drank a little of it tis good punch max and of my brewing i dont think you will ever get any better and she went back to the sofa again and sat down and looked at the players  mr brock looked at her white face and fixed eyes with a grim kind of curiosity the count sputtered and cursed the horrid taste of the punch still but he presently took the box and made his threatened throw  as before the squire beat him and having booked his winnings rose from table as well as he might and besought to lead him downstairs which mr brock did  liquor had evidently stupefied the count he sat with his head between his hands muttering wildly about illluck sevens the main bad punch and so on the streetdoor banged to and the steps of brock and the squire were heard until they could be heard no more  max said she but he did not answer max said she again laying her hand on his shoulder  curse you said that gentleman keep off and dont be laying your paws upon me go to bed you jade or to  for what i care and give me first some more puncha gallon more punch do you hear  the gentleman by the curses at the commencement of this little speech and the request contained at the end of it showed that his losses vexed him and that he was anxious to forget them temporarily  oh max whimpered mrs cat youdontwant any more punch  dont shant i be drunk in my own house you cursed whimpering jade you get out and with this the captain proceeded to administer a blow upon mrs catherines cheek  contrary to her custom she did not avenge it or seek to do so as on the many former occasions when disputes of this nature had arisen between the count and her but now mrs catherine fell on her knees and clasping her hands and looking pitifully in the counts face cried oh count forgive me forgive me  forgive you what for because i slapped your face ha ha ill forgive you again if you dont mind  oh no no no said she wringing her hands it isnt that max dear max will you forgive me it isnt the blowi dont mind that its  its what youmaudlin fool  its the punch  the count who was more than half seas over here assumed an air of much tipsy gravity the punch no i never will forgive you that last glass of punch of all the foul beastly drinks i ever tasted that was the worst no i never will forgive you that punch  oh it isnt that it isnt that said she  i tell you it is thatyou that punch i say that punch was no better than pawawoison and here the counts head sank back and he fell to snore  it was poison said she  what screamed he waking up at once and spurning her away from him what you infernal murderess have you killed me  oh maxdont kill me max it was laudanumindeed it was you were going to be married and i was furious and i went and got  hold your tongue you fiend roared out the count and with more presence of mind than politeness he flung the remainder of the liquor and indeed the glass with it at the head of mrs catherine but the poisoned chalice missed its mark and fell right on the nose of mr tom trippet who was left asleep and unobserved under the table  bleeding staggering swearing indeed a ghastly sight up sprang mr trippet and drew his rapier come on says he never say die whats the row im ready for a dozen of you and he made many blind and furious passes about the room  curse you well die together shouted the count as he too pulled out his toledo and sprang at mrs catherine  help murder thieves shrieked she save me mr trippet save me and she placed that gentleman between herself and the count and then made for the door of the bedroom and gained it and bolted it  out of the way trippet roared the countout of the way you drunken beast ill murder her i willill have the devils life and here he gave a swinging cut at mr trippets sword it sent the weapon whirling clean out of his hand and through a window into the street  take my life then said mr trippet im drunk but im a man and damme will never say die  i dont want your life you stupid fool hark you trippet wake and be sober if you can that woman has heard of my marriage with miss dripping  twenty thousand pound ejaculated trippet  she has been jealous i tell you and poisoned us she has put laudanum into the punch  what in my punch said trippet growing quite sober and losing his courage o lord o lord  dont stand howling there but run for a doctor tis our only chance and away ran mr trippet as if the deuce were at his heels  the count had forgotten his murderous intentions regarding his mistress or had deferred them at least under the consciousness of his own pressing danger and it must be said in the praise of a man who had fought for and against marlborough and tallard that his courage in this trying and novel predicament never for a moment deserted him but that he showed the greatest daring as well as ingenuity in meeting and averting the danger he flew to the sideboard where were the relics of a supper and seizing the mustard and salt pots and a bottle of oil he emptied them all into a jug into which he further poured a vast quantity of hot water this pleasing mixture he then without a moments hesitation placed to his lips and swallowed as much of it as nature would allow him but when he had imbibed about a quart the anticipated effect was produced and he was enabled by the power of this ingenious extemporaneous emetic to get rid of much of the poison which mrs catherine had administered to him  he was employed in these efforts when the doctor entered along with mr brock and mr trippet who was not a little pleased to hear that the poisoned punch had not in all probability been given to him he was recommended to take some of the counts mixture as a precautionary measure but this he refused and retired home leaving the count under charge of the physician and his faithful corporal  it is not necessary to say what further remedies were employed by them to restore the captain to health but after some time the doctor pronouncing that the danger was he hoped averted recommended that his patient should be put to bed and that somebody should sit by him which brock promised to do  that shedevil will murder me if you dont gasped the poor count you must turn her out of the bedroom or break open the door if she refuses to let you in  and this step was found to be necessary for after shouting many times and in vain mr brock found a small iron bar indeed he had the instrument for many days in his pocket and forced the lock the room was empty the window was open the pretty barmaid of the bugle had fled  the chest said the countis the chest safe  the corporal flew to the bed under which it was screwed and looked and said it is safe thank heaven the window was closed the captain who was too weak to stand without help was undressed and put to bed the corporal sat down by his side slumber stole over the eyes of the patient and his wakeful nurse marked with satisfaction the progress of the beneficent restorer of health  when the captain awoke as he did some time afterwards he found very much to his surprise that a gag had been placed in his mouth and that the corporal was in the act of wheeling his bed to another part of the room he attempted to move and gave utterance to such unintelligible sounds as could issue through a silk handkerchief  if your honour stirs or cries out in the least i will cut your honours throat said the corporal  and then having recourse to his iron bar the reader will now see why he was provided with such an implement for he had been meditating this coup for some days he proceeded first to attempt to burst the lock of the little iron chest in which the count kept his treasure and failing in this to unscrew it from the ground which operation he performed satisfactorily  you see count said he calmly when rogues fall out theres the deuce to pay youll have me drummed out of the regiment will you im going to leave it of my own accord look you and to live like a gentleman for the rest of my days schlafen sie wohl noble captain bon repos the squire will be with you pretty early in the morning to ask for the money you owe him  with these sarcastic observations mr brock departed not by the window as mrs catherine had done but by the door quietly and so into the street and when the next morning the doctor came to visit his patient he brought with him a story how at the dead of night mr brock had roused the ostler at the stables where the captains horses were kepthad told him that mrs catherine had poisoned the count and had run off with a thousand pounds and how he and all lovers of justice ought to scour the country in pursuit of the criminal for this end mr brock mounted the counts best horsethat very animal on which he had carried away mrs catherine and thus on a single night count maximilian had lost his mistress his money his horse his corporal and was very near losing his life    chapter iv in which mrs catherine becomes an honest woman again   in this woeful plight moneyless wifeless horseless corporalless with a gag in his mouth and a rope round his body are we compelled to leave the gallant galgenstein until his friends and the progress of this history shall deliver him from his durance mr brocks adventures on the captains horse must likewise be pretermitted for it is our business to follow mrs catherine through the window by which she made her escape and among the various chances that befell her  she had one cause to congratulate herselfthat she had not her baby at her back for the infant was safely housed under the care of a nurse to whom the captain was answerable beyond this her prospects were but dismal no home to fly to but a few shillings in her pocket and a whole heap of injuries and dark revengeful thoughts in her bosom it was a sad task to her to look either backwards or forwards whither was she to fly how to live what good chance was to befriend her there was an angel watching over the steps of mrs catnot a good one i think but one of those from that unnameable place who have their many subjects here on earth and often are pleased to extricate them from worse perplexities  mrs cat now had not committed murder but as bad as murder and as she felt not the smallest repentance in her heartas she had in the course of her life and connection with the captain performed and gloried in a number of wicked coquetries idlenesses vanities lies fits of anger slanders foul abuses and what notshe was fairly bound over to this dark angel whom we have alluded to and he dealt with her and aided her as one of his own children  i do not mean to say that in this strait he appeared to her in the likeness of a gentleman in black and made her sign her name in blood to a document conveying over to him her soul in exchange for certain conditions to be performed by him such diabolical bargains have always appeared to me unworthy of the astute personage who is supposed to be one of the parties to them and who would scarcely be fool enough to pay dearly for that which he can have in a few years for nothing it is not then to be supposed that a demon of darkness appeared to mrs cat and led her into a flaming chariot harnessed by dragons and careering through air at the rate of a thousand leagues a minute no such thing the vehicle that was sent to aid her was one of a much more vulgar description  the liverpool carryvan then which in the year 1706 used to perform the journey between london and that place in ten days left birmingham about an hour after mrs catherine had quitted that town and as she sat weeping on a hillside and plunged in bitter meditation the lumbering jingling vehicle overtook her the coachman was marching by the side of his horses and encouraging them to maintain their pace of two miles an hour the passengers had some of them left the vehicle in order to walk up the hill and the carriage had arrived at the top of it and meditating a brisk trot down the declivity waited there until the lagging passengers should arrive when jehu casting a goodnatured glance upon mrs catherine asked the pretty maid whence she was come and whether she would like a ride in his carriage to the latter of which questions mrs catherine replied truly yes to the former her answer was that she had come from stratford whereas as we very well know she had lately quitted birmingham  hast thee seen a woman pass this way on a black horse with a large bag of goold over the saddle said jehu preparing to mount upon the roof of his coach  no indeed said mrs cat  nor a trooper on another horse after herno well there be a mortal row down birmingham way about sich a one she have killed they say nine gentlemen at supper and have strangled a german prince in bed she have robbed him of twenty thousand guineas and have rode away on a black horse  that cant be i said mrs cat naively for i have but three shillings and a groat  no it cant be thee truly for wheres your bag of goold and besides thee hast got too pretty a face to do such wicked things as to kill nine gentlemen and strangle a german prince  law coachman said mrs cat blushing archly law coachman do you think so the girl would have been pleased with a compliment even on her way to be hanged and the parley ended by mrs catherine stepping into the carriage where there was room for eight people at least and where two or three individuals had already taken their places for these mrs catherine had in the first place to make a story which she did and a very glib one for a person of her years and education being asked whither she was bound and how she came to be alone of a morning sitting by a roadside she invented a neat history suitable to the occasion which elicited much interest from her fellowpassengers one in particular a young man who had caught a glimpse of her face under her hood was very tender in his attentions to her  but whether it was that she had been too much fatigued by the occurrences of the past day and sleepless night or whether the little laudanum which she had drunk a few hours previously now began to act upon her certain it is that mrs cat now suddenly grew sick feverish and extraordinarily sleepy and in this state she continued for many hours to the pity of all her fellowtravellers at length the carryvan reached the inn where horses and passengers were accustomed to rest for a few hours and to dine and mrs catherine was somewhat awakened by the stir of the passengers and the friendly voice of the innservant welcoming them to dinner the gentleman who had been smitten by her beauty now urged her very politely to descend which taking the protection of his arm she accordingly did  he made some very gallant speeches to her as she stepped out and she must have been very much occupied by them or wrapt up in her own thoughts or stupefied by sleep fever and opium for she did not take any heed of the place into which she was going which had she done she would probably have preferred remaining in the coach dinnerless and ill indeed the inn into which she was about to make her entrance was no other than the bugle from which she set forth at the commencement of this history and which then as now was kept by her relative the thrifty mrs score that good landlady seeing a lady in a smart hood and cloak leaning as if faint upon the arm of a gentleman of good appearance concluded them to be man and wife and folks of quality too and with much discrimination as well as sympathy led them through the public kitchen to her own private parlour or bar where she handed the lady an armchair and asked what she would like to drink by this time and indeed at the very moment she heard her aunts voice mrs catherine was aware of her situation and when her companion retired and the landlady with much officiousness insisted on removing her hood she was quite prepared for the screech of surprise which mrs score gave on dropping it exclaiming why law bless us its our catherine  im very ill and tired aunt said cat and would give the world for a few hours sleep  a few hours and welcome my love and a sackposset too you do look sadly tired and poorly sure enough ah cat cat you great ladies are sad rakes i do believe i wager now that with all your balls and carriages and fine clothes you are neither so happy nor so well as when you lived with your poor old aunt who used to love you so and with these gentle words and an embrace or two which mrs catherine wondered at and permitted she was conducted to that very bed which the count had occupied a year previously and undressed and laid in it and affectionately tucked up by her aunt who marvelled at the fineness of her clothes as she removed them piece by piece and when she saw that in mrs catherines pocket there was only the sum of three and fourpence said archly there was no need of money for the captain took care of that  mrs cat did not undeceive her and deceived mrs score certainly wasfor she imagined the welldressed gentleman who led cat from the carriage was no other than the count and as she had heard from time to time exaggerated reports of the splendour of the establishment which he kept up she was induced to look upon her niece with the very highest respect and to treat her as if she were a fine lady and so she is a fine lady mrs score had said months ago when some of these flattering stories reached her and she had overcome her first fury at catherines elopement the girl was very cruel to leave me but we must recollect that she is as good as married to a nobleman and must all forget and forgive you know  this speech had been made to doctor dobbs who was in the habit of taking a pipe and a tankard at the bugle and it had been roundly reprobated by the worthy divine who told mrs score that the crime of catherine was only the more heinous if it had been committed from interested motives and protested that were she a princess he would never speak to her again mrs score thought and pronounced the doctors opinion to be very bigoted indeed she was one of those persons who have a marvellous respect for prosperity and a corresponding scorn for illfortune when therefore she returned to the public room she went graciously to the gentleman who had led mrs catherine from the carriage and with a knowing curtsey welcomed him to the bugle told him that his lady would not come to dinner but bade her say with her best love to his lordship that the ride had fatigued her and that she would lie in bed for an hour or two  this speech was received with much wonder by his lordship who was indeed no other than a liverpool tailor going to london to learn fashions but he only smiled and did not undeceive the landlady who herself went off smilingly to bustle about dinner  the two or three hours allotted to that meal by the liberal coachmasters of those days passed away and mr coachman declaring that his horses were now rested enough and that they had twelve miles to ride put the steeds to and summoned the passengers mrs score who had seen with much satisfaction that her niece was really ill and her fever more violent and hoped to have her for many days an inmate in her house now came forward and casting upon the liverpool tailor a look of profound but respectful melancholy said my lord for i recollect your lordship quite well the lady upstairs is so ill that it would be a sin to move her had i not better tell coachman to take down your lordships trunks and the ladys and make you a bed in the next room  very much to her surprise this proposition was received with a roar of laughter madam said the person addressed im not a lord but a tailor and draper and as for that young woman before today i never set eyes on her  what screamed out mrs score are not you the count do you mean to say that you ant cats do you mean to say that you didnt order her bed and that you wont pay this here little bill and with this she produced a document by which the counts lady was made her debtor in a sum of halfaguinea  these passionate words excited more and more laughter pay it my lord said the coachman and then come along for time presses our respects to her ladyship said one passenger tell her my lord cant wait said another and with much merriment one and all quitted the hotel entered the coach and rattled off  dumbpale with terror and ragebill in hand mrs score had followed the company but when the coach disappeared her senses returned back she flew into the inn overturning the ostler not deigning to answer doctor dobbs who from behind soft tobaccofumes mildly asked the reason of her disturbance and bounding upstairs like a fury she rushed into the room where catherine lay  well madam said she in her highest key do you mean that you have come into this here house to swindle me do you dare for to come with your airs here and call yourself a noblemans lady and sleep in the best bed when youre no better nor a common tramper ill thank you maam to get out maam ill have no sick paupers in this house maam you know your way to the workhouse maam and there ill trouble you for to go and here mrs score proceeded quickly to pull off the bedclothes and poor cat arose shivering with fright and fever  she had no spirit to answer as she would have done the day before when an oath from any human being would have brought halfadozen from her in return or a knife or a plate or a leg of mutton if such had been to her hand she had no spirit left for such repartees but in reply to the above words of mrs score and a great many more of the same kindwhich are not necessary for our history but which that lady uttered with inconceivable shrillness and volubility the poor wench could say littleonly sob and shiver and gather up the clothes again crying oh aunt dont speak unkind to me im very unhappy and very ill  ill you strumpet ill be hanged ill is as ill does and if you are ill its only what you merit get out dress yourselftramp get to the workhouse and dont come to cheat me any more dress yourselfdo you hear satin petticoat forsooth and lace to her smock  poor wretched chattering burning shivering catherine huddled on her clothes as well she might she seemed hardly to know or see what she was doing and did not reply a single word to the many that the landlady let fall cat tottered down the narrow stairs and through the kitchen and to the door which she caught hold of and paused awhile and looked into mrs scores face as for one more chance get out you nasty trull said that lady sternly with arms akimbo and poor catherine with a most piteous scream and outgush of tears let go of the doorpost and staggered away into the road                        why noyesnoit is poor catherine hall as i live said somebody starting up shoving aside mrs score very rudely and running into the road wig off and pipe in hand it was honest doctor dobbs and the result of his interview with mrs cat was that he gave up for ever smoking his pipe at the bugle and that she lay sick of a fever for some weeks in his house                        over this part of mrs cats history we shall be as brief as possible for to tell the truth nothing immoral occurred during her whole stay at the good doctors house and we are not going to insult the reader by offering him silly pictures of piety cheerfulness good sense and simplicity which are milkandwater virtues after all and have no relish with them like a good strong vice highly peppered well to be short doctor dobbs though a profound theologian was a very simple gentleman and before mrs cat had been a month in the house he had learned to look upon her as one of the most injured and repentant characters in the world and had with mrs dobbs resolved many plans for the future welfare of the young magdalen she was but sixteen my love recollect said the doctor she was carried off not by her own wish either the count swore he would marry her and though she did not leave him until that monster tried to poison her yet think what a fine christian spirit the poor girl has shown she forgives him as heartilymore heartily i am sure than i do mrs score for turning her adrift in that wicked way the reader will perceive some difference in the doctors statement and ours which we assure him is the true one but the fact is the honest rector had had his tale from mrs cat and it was not in his nature to doubt if she had told him a history ten times more wonderful  the reverend gentleman and his wife then laid their heads together and recollecting something of john hayess former attachment to mrs cat thought that it might be advantageously renewed should hayes be still constant having very adroitly sounded catherine so adroitly indeed as to ask her whether she would like to marry john hayes that young woman had replied no she had loved john hayeshe had been her early only love but she was fallen now and not good enough for him and this made the dobbs family admire her more and more and cast about for means to bring the marriage to pass  hayes was away from the village when mrs cat had arrived there but he did not fail to hear of her illness and how her aunt had deserted her and the good doctor taken her in the worthy doctor himself met mr hayes on the green and telling him that some repairs were wanting in his kitchen begged him to step in and examine them hayes first said no plump and then no gently and then pished and then pshad and then trembling very much went in and there sat mrs catherine trembling very much too  what passed between them if your ladyship is anxious to know think of that morning when sir john himself popped the question could there be anything more stupid than the conversation which took place such stuff is not worth repeating no not when uttered by people in the very genteelest of company as for the amorous dialogue of a carpenter and an exbarmaid it is worse still suffice it to say that mr hayes who had had a year to recover from his passion and had to all appearances quelled it was over head and ears again the very moment he saw mrs cat and had all his work to do again  whether the doctor knew what was going on i cant say but this matter is certain that every evening hayes was now in the rectory kitchen or else walking abroad with mrs catherine and whether she ran away with him or he with her i shall not make it my business to inquire but certainly at the end of three months which must be crowded up into this one little sentence another elopement took place in the village i should have prevented it certainly said doctor dobbswhereat his wife smiled but the young people kept the matter a secret from me and so he would had he known it but though mrs dobbs had made several attempts to acquaint him with the precise hour and method of the intended elopement he peremptorily ordered her to hold her tongue the fact is that the matter had been discussed by the rectors lady many times young hayes would she say has a pretty little fortune and trade of his own he is an only son and may marry as he likes and though not specially handsome generous or amiable has an undeniable love for cat who you know must not be particular and the sooner she marries him i think the better they cant be married at our church you know and well said the doctor if they are married elsewhere i cant help it and know nothing about it look you and upon this hint the elopement took place which indeed was peaceably performed early one sunday morning about a month after mrs hall getting behind mr hayes on a pillion and all the children of the parsonage giggling behind the windowblinds to see the pair go off  during this month mr hayes had caused the banns to be published at the town of worcester judging rightly that in a great town they would cause no such remark as in a solitary village and thither he conducted his lady o illstarred john hayes whither do the dark fates lead you o foolish doctor dobbs to forget that young people ought to honour their parents and to yield to silly mrs dobbss ardent propensity for making matches                        the london gazette of the 1st april 1706 contains a proclamation by the queen for putting into execution an act of parliament for the encouragement and increase of seamen and for the better and speedier manning of her majestys fleet which authorises all justices to issue warrants to constables petty constables headboroughs and tythingmen to enter and if need be to break open the doors of any houses where they shall believe deserting seamen to be and for the further increase and encouragement of the navy to take ablebodied landsmen when seamen fail this act which occupies four columns of the gazette and another of similar length and meaning for pressing men into the army need not be quoted at length here but caused a mighty stir throughout the kingdom at the time when it was in force  as one has seen or heard after the march of a great army a number of rogues and loose characters bring up the rear in like manner at the tail of a great measure of state follow many roguish personal interests which are protected by the main body the great measure of reform for instance carried along with it much private jobbing and swindlingas could be shown were we not inclined to deal mildly with the whigs and this enlistment act which in order to maintain the british glories in flanders dealt most cruelly with the british people in england it is not the first time that a man has been pinched at home to make a fine appearance abroad created a great company of rascals and informers throughout the land who lived upon it or upon extortion from those who were subject to it or not being subject to it were frightened into the belief that they were  when mr hayes and his lady had gone through the marriage ceremony at worcester the former concluding that at such a place lodging and food might be procured at a cheaper rate looked about carefully for the meanest publichouse in the town where he might deposit his bride  in the kitchen of this inn a party of men were drinking and as mrs hayes declined with a proper sense of her superiority to eat in company with such low fellows the landlady showed her and her husband to an inner apartment where they might be served in private  the kitchen party seemed indeed not such as a lady would choose to join there was one huge lanky fellow that looked like a soldier and had a halberd another was habited in a sailors costume with a fascinating patch over one eye and a third who seemed the leader of the gang was a stout man in a sailors frock and a horsemans jackboots whom one might fancy if he were anything to be a horsemarine  of one of these worthies mrs hayes thought she knew the figure and voice and she found her conjectures were true when all of sudden three people without with your leave or by your leave burst into the room into which she and her spouse had retired at their head was no other than her old friend mr peter brock he had his sword drawn and his finger to his lips enjoining silence as it were to mrs catherine he with the patch on his eye seized incontinently on mr hayes the tall man with the halberd kept the door two or three heroes supported the oneeyed man who with a loud voice exclaimed down with your armsno resistance you are my prisoner in the queens name  and here at this lock we shall leave the whole company until the next chapter which may possibly explain what they were    chapter v contains mr brocks autobiography and other matters   you dont sure believe these men said mrs hayes as soon as the first alarm caused by the irruption of mr brock and his companions had subsided these are no magistrates men it is but a trick to rob you of your money john  i will never give up a farthing of it screamed hayes  yonder fellow continued mrs catherine i know for all his drawn sword and fierce looks his name is  wood madam at your service said mr brock i am follower to mr justice gobble of this town ant i tim said mr brock to the tall halberdman who was keeping the door  yes indeed said tim archly were all followers of his honour justice gobble  certainly said the oneeyed man  of course cried the man in the nightcap  i suppose madam youre satisfied now continued mr brock alias wood you cant deny the testimony of gentlemen like these and our commission is to apprehend all ablebodied male persons who can give no good account of themselves and enrol them in the service of her majesty look at this mr hayes who stood trembling in his shoes can there be a bolder properer straighter gentleman well have him for a grenadier before the days over  take heart johndont be frightened psha i tell you i know the man cried out mrs hayes he is only here to extort money  oh for that matter i do think i recollect the lady let me see where was it at birmingham i thinkay at birminghamabout the time when they tried to murder count gal  oh sir here cried madam hayes dropping her voice at once from a tone of scorn to one of gentlest entreaty what is it you want with my husband i know not indeed if ever i saw you before for what do you seize him how much will you take to release him and let us go name the sum he is rich and  rich catherine cried hayes richo heavens sir i have nothing but my hands to support me i am a poor carpenter sir working under my father  he can give twenty guineas to be free i know he can said mrs cat  i have but a guinea to carry me home sighed out hayes  but you have twenty at home john said his wife give these brave gentlemen a writing to your mother and she will pay and you will let us free then gentlemenwont you  when the moneys paid yes said the leader mr brock  oh in course echoed the tall man with the halberd whats a thrifling detintion my dear continued he addressing hayes well amuse you in your absence and drink to the health of your pretty wife here  this promise to do the halberdier justice he fulfilled he called upon the landlady to produce the desired liquor and when mr hayes flung himself at that ladys feet demanding succour from her and asking whether there was no law in the land  theres no law at the three rooks except this said mr brock in reply holding up a horsepistol to which the hostess grinning assented and silently went her way  after some further solicitations john hayes drew out the necessary letter to his father stating that he was pressed and would not be set free under a sum of twenty guineas and that it would be of no use to detain the bearer of the letter inasmuch as the gentlemen who had possession of him vowed that they would murder him should any harm befall their comrade as a further proof of the authenticity of the letter a token was added a ring that hayes wore and that his mother had given him  the missives were after some consultation entrusted to the care of the tall halberdier who seemed to rank as second in command of the forces that marched under corporal brock this gentleman was called indifferently ensign mr or even captain macshane his intimates occasionally in sport called him nosey from the prominence of that feature in his countenance or spindleshins for the very reason which brought on the first edward a similar nickname mr macshane then quitted worcester mounted on hayess horse leaving all parties at the three rooks not a little anxious for his return  this was not to be expected until the next morning and a weary nuit de noces did mr hayes pass dinner was served and according to promise mr brock and his two friends enjoyed the meal along with the bride and bridegroom punch followed and this was taken in company then came supper mr brock alone partook of this the other two gentlemen preferring the society of their pipes and the landlady in the kitchen  it is a sorry entertainment i confess said the excorporal and a dismal way for a gentleman to spend his bridal night but somebody must stay with you my dears for who knows but you might take a fancy to scream out of window and then there would be murder and the deuce and all to pay one of us must stay and my friends love a pipe so you must put up with my company until they can relieve guard  the reader will not of course expect that three people who were to pass the night however unwillingly together in an innroom should sit there dumb and moody and without any personal communication on the contrary mr brock as an old soldier entertained his prisoners with the utmost courtesy and did all that lay in his power by the help of liquor and conversation to render their durance tolerable on the bridegroom his attentions were a good deal thrown away mr hayes consented to drink copiously but could not be made to talk much and in fact the fright of the seizure the fate hanging over him should his parents refuse a ransom and the tremendous outlay of money which would take place should they accede to it weighed altogether on his mind so much as utterly to unman it  as for mrs cat i dont think she was at all sorry in her heart to see the old corporal for he had been a friend of old timesdear times to her she had had from him too and felt for him not a little kindness and there was really a very tender innocent friendship subsisting between this pair of rascals who relished much a nights conversation together  the corporal after treating his prisoners to punch in great quantities proposed the amusement of cards over which mr hayes had not been occupied more than an hour when he found himself so excessively sleepy as to be persuaded to fling himself down on the bed dressed as he was and there to snore away until morning  mrs catherine had no inclination for sleep and the corporal equally wakeful plied incessantly the bottle and held with her a great deal of conversation the sleep which was equivalent to the absence of john hayes took all restraint from their talk she explained to brock the circumstances of her marriage which we have already described they wondered at the chance which had brought them together at the three rooks nor did brock at all hesitate to tell her at once that his calling was quite illegal and that his intention was simply to extort money the worthy corporal had not the slightest shame regarding his own profession and cut many jokes with mrs cat about her late one her attempt to murder the count and her future prospects as a wife  and here having brought him upon the scene again we may as well shortly narrate some of the principal circumstances which befell him after his sudden departure from birmingham and which he narrated with much candour to mrs catherine  he rode the captains horse to oxford having exchanged his military dress for a civil costume on the road and at oxford he disposed of george of denmark a great bargain to one of the heads of colleges as soon as mr brock who took on himself the style and title of captain wood had sufficiently examined the curiosities of the university he proceeded at once to the capital the only place for a gentleman of his fortune and figure  here he read with a great deal of philosophical indifference in the daily post the courant the observator the gazette and the chief journals of those days which he made a point of examining at buttons and wills an accurate description of his person his clothes and the horse he rode and a promise of fifty guineas reward to any person who would give an account of him so that he might be captured to captain count galgenstein at birmingham to mr murfey at the golden ball in the savoy or mr bates at the blew anchor in pickadilly but captain wood in an enormous fullbottomed periwig that cost him sixty pounds with high red heels to his shoes a silver sword and a gold snuffbox and a large wound obtained he said at the siege of barcelona which disfigured much of his countenance and caused him to cover one eye was in small danger he thought of being mistaken for corporal brock the deserter of cuttss and strutted along the mall with as grave an air as the very best nobleman who appeared there he was generally indeed voted to be very good company and as his expenses were unlimited a few convent candlesticks my dear he used to whisper melt into a vast number of doubloons he commanded as good society as he chose to ask for and it was speedily known as a fact throughout town that captain wood who had served under his majesty charles iii of spain had carried off the diamond petticoat of our lady of compostella and lived upon the proceeds of the fraud people were good protestants in those days and many a one longed to have been his partner in the pious plunder        in the ingenious contemporary history of moll flanders a      periwig is mentioned as costing that sum  all surmises concerning his wealth captain wood with much discretion encouraged he contradicted no report but was quite ready to confirm all and when two different rumours were positively put to him he used only to laugh and say my dear sir i dont make the stories but im not called upon to deny them and i give you fair warning that i shall assent to every one of them so you may believe them or not as you please and so he had the reputation of being a gentleman not only wealthy but discreet in truth it was almost a pity that worthy brock had not been a gentleman born in which case doubtless he would have lived and died as became his station for he spent his money like a gentleman he loved women like a gentleman he would fight like a gentleman he gambled and got drunk like a gentleman what did he want else only a matter of six descents a little money and an estate to render him the equal of st john or harley ah those were merry days would mr brock sayfor he loved in a good old age to recount the story of his london fashionable campaignand when i think how near i was to become a great man and to die perhaps a general i cant but marvel at the wicked obstinacy of my illluck  i will tell you what i did my dear i had lodgings in piccadilly as if i were a lord i had two large periwigs and three suits of laced clothes i kept a little black dressed out like a turk i walked daily in the mall i dined at the politest ordinary in covent garden i frequented the best of coffeehouses and knew all the pretty fellows of the town i cracked a bottle with mr addison and lent many a piece to dick steele a sad debauched rogue my dear and above all ill tell you what i didthe noblest stroke that sure ever a gentleman performed in my situation  one day going into wills i saw a crowd of gentlemen gathered together and heard one of them say captain wood i dont know the man but there was a captain wood in southwells regiment egad it was my lord peterborough himself who was talking about me so putting off my hat i made a most gracious conge to my lord and said i knew him and rode behind him at barcelona on our entry into that town  no doubt you did captain wood says my lord taking my hand and no doubt you know me for many more know tom fool than tom fool knows and with this at which all of us laughed my lord called for a bottle and he and i sat down and drank it together  well he was in disgrace as you know but he grew mighty fond of me andwould you believe itnothing would satisfy him but presenting me at court yes to her sacred majesty the queen and my lady marlborough who was in high feather ay truly the sentinels on duty used to salute me as if i were corporal john himself i was on the high road to fortune charley mordaunt used to call me jack and drink canary at my chambers i used to make one at my lord treasurers levee i had even got mr armysecretary walpole to take a hundred guineas as a compliment and he had promised me a majority when bad luck turned and all my fine hopes were overthrown in a twinkling  you see my dear that after we had left that gaby galgensteinha hawith a gag in his mouth and twopencehalfpenny in his pocket the honest count was in the sorriest plight in the world owing money here and there to tradesmen a cool thousand to the warwickshire squire and all this on eighty pounds a year well for a little time the tradesmen held their hands while the jolly count moved heaven and earth to catch hold of his dear corporal and his dear moneybags over again and placarded every town from london to liverpool with descriptions of my pretty person the bird was flown howeverthe money clean goneand when there was no hope of regaining it what did the creditors do but clap my gay gentleman into shrewsbury gaol where i wish he had rotted for my part  but no such luck for honest peter brock or captain wood as he was in those days one blessed monday i went to wait on mr secretary and he squeezed my hand and whispered to me that i was to be major of a regiment in virginiathe very thing for you see my dear i didnt care about joining my lord duke in flanders being pretty well known to the army there the secretary squeezed my hand it had a fiftypound bill in it and wished me joy and called me major and bowed me out of his closet into the anteroom and as gay as may be i went off to the tiltyard coffeehouse in whitehall which is much frequented by gentlemen of our profession where i bragged not a little of my good luck  amongst the company were several of my acquaintance and amongst them a gentleman i did not much care to see look you i saw a uniform that i knewred and yellow facingscuttss my dear and the wearer of this was no other than his excellency gustavus adolphus maximilian whom we all know of  he stared me full in the face right into my eye tother one was patched you know and after standing stockstill with his mouth open gave a step back and then a step forward and then screeched out its brock  i beg your pardon sir says i did you speak to me  ill swear its brock cries gal as soon as he hears my voice and laid hold of my cuff a pretty bit of mechlin as ever you saw by the way  sirrah says i drawing it back and giving my lord a little touch of the fist just at the last button of the waistcoat my deara rare place if you wish to prevent a man from speaking too much it sent him reeling to the other end of the room ruffian says i dog says i insolent puppy and coxcomb what do you mean by laying your hand on me  faith major you giv him his billyful roared out a long irish unattached ensign that i had treated with many a glass of nantz at the tavern and so indeed i had for the wretch could not speak for some minutes and all the officers stood laughing at him as he writhed and wriggled hideously  gentlemen this is a monstrous scandal says one officer men of rank and honour at fists like a parcel of carters  men of honour says the count who had fetched up his breath by this time i made for the door but macshane held me and said major you are not going to shirk him sure whereupon i gripped his hand and vowed i would have the dogs life  men of honour says the count i tell you the man is a deserter a thief and a swindler he was my corporal and ran away with a thou  dog you lie i roared out and made another cut at him with my cane but the gentlemen rushed between us  o bluthanowns says honest macshane the lying scounthrel this fellow is gentlemen i swear be me honour that captain wood was wounded at barcelona and that i saw him there and that he and i ran away together at the battle of almanza and bad luck to us  you see my dear that these irish have the strongest imaginations in the world and that i had actually persuaded poor mac that he and i were friends in spain everybody knew mac who was a character in his way and believed him  strike a gentleman says i ill have your blood i will  this instant says the count who was boiling with fury and where you like  montague house says i good says he and off we went in good time too for the constables came in at the thought of such a disturbance and wanted to take us in charge  but the gentlemen present being military men would not hear of this out came macs rapier and that of halfadozen others and the constables were then told to do their duty if they liked or to take a crownpiece and leave us to ourselves off they went and presently in a couple of coaches the count and his friends i and mine drove off to the fields behind montague house oh that vile coffeehouse why did i enter it  we came to the ground honest macshane was my second and much disappointed because the second on the other side would not make a fight of it and exchange a few passes with him but he was an old major a cool old hand as brave as steel and no fool well the swords are measured galgenstein strips off his doublet and i my handsome cutvelvet in like fashion galgenstein flings off his hat and i handed mine overthe lace on it cost me twenty pounds i longed to be at him forcurse himi hate him and know that he has no chance with me at swordsplay  youll not fight in that periwig sure says macshane of course not says i and took it off  may all barbers be roasted in flames may all periwigs bobwigs scratchwigs and ramillies cocks frizzle in purgatory from this day forth to the end of time mine was the ruin of me what might i not have been now but for that wig  i gave it over to ensign macshane and with it went what i had quite forgotten the large patch which i wore over one eye which popped out fierce staring and lively as was ever any eye in the world  come on says i and made a lunge at my count but he sprang back the dog was as active as a hare and knew from old times that i was his master with the smallsword and his second wondering struck up my blade  i will not fight that man says he looking mighty pale i swear upon my honour that his name is peter brock he was for two years my corporal and deserted running away with a thousand pounds of my moneys look at the fellow what is the matter with his eye why did he wear a patch over it but stop says he i have more proof hand me my pocketbook and from it sure enough he produced the infernal proclamation announcing my desertion see if the fellow has a scar across his left ear and i cant say my dear but what i have it was done by a cursed dutchman at the boyne tell me if he has not got cr in blue upon his right arm and there it is sure enough yonder swaggering irishman may be his accomplice for what i know but i will have no dealings with mr brock save with a constable for a second  this is an odd story captain wood said the old major who acted for the count  a scounthrelly falsehood regarding me and my friend shouted out mr macshane and the count shall answer for it  stop stop says the major captain wood is too gallant a gentleman i am sure not to satisfy the count and will show us that he has no such mark on his arm as only private soldiers put there  captain wood says i will do no such thing major ill fight that scoundrel galgenstein or you or any of you like a man of honour but i wont submit to be searched like a thief  no in coorse said macshane  i must take my man off the ground says the major  well take him sir says i in a rage and just let me have the pleasure of telling him that hes a coward and a liar and that my lodgings are in piccadilly where if ever he finds courage to meet me he may hear of me  faugh i shpit on ye all cries my gallant ally macshane and sure enough he kept his word or all butsuiting the action to it at any rate  and so we gathered up our clothes and went back in our separate coaches and no blood spilt  and is it thrue now said mr macshane when we were aloneis it thrue now all these divvles have been saying ensign says i youre a man of the world  deed and i am and insign these twentytwo years  perhaps youd like a few pieces says i  faith and i should for to tell you the secred thrut ive not tasted mate these four days  well then ensign it is true says i and as for meat you shall have some at the first cookshop i bade the coach stop until he bought a plateful which he ate in the carriage for my time was precious i just told him the whole story at which he laughed and swore that it was the best piece of generalship he ever heard on when his belly was full i took out a couple of guineas and gave them to him mr macshane began to cry at this and kissed me and swore he never would desert me as indeed my dear i dont think he will for we have been the best of friends ever since and hes the only man i ever could trust i think  i dont know what put it into my head but i had a scent of some mischief in the wind so stopped the coach a little before i got home and turning into a tavern begged macshane to go before me to my lodging and see if the coast was clear which he did and came back to me as pale as death saying that the house was full of constables the cursed quarrel at the tiltyard had i suppose set the beaks upon me and a pretty sweep they made of it ah my dear five hundred pounds in money five suits of laced clothes three periwigs besides laced shirts swords canes and snuffboxes and all to go back to that scoundrel count  it was all over with me i sawno more being a gentleman for me and if i remained to be caught only a choice between tyburn and a file of grenadiers my love under such circumstances a gentleman cant be particular and must be prompt the liverystable was hard by where i used to hire my coach to go to courtha haand was known as a man of substance thither i went immediately mr warmmash says i my gallant friend here and i have a mind for a ride and a supper at twickenham so you must lend us a pair of your best horses which he did in a twinkling and off we rode  we did not go into the park but turned off and cantered smartly up towards kilburn and when we got into the country galloped as if the devil were at our heels bless you my love it was all done in a minute and the ensign and i found ourselves regular knights of the road before we knew where we were almost only think of our finding you and your new husband at the three rooks theres not a greater fence than the landlady in all the country it was she that put us on seizing your husband and introduced us to the other two gentlemen whose names i dont know any more than the dead  and what became of the horses said mrs catherine to mr brock when his tale was finished  rips madam said he mere rips we sold them at stourbridge fair and got but thirteen guineas for the two  andandthe count max where is he brock sighed she  whew whistled mr brock what hankering after him still my dear he is off to flanders with his regiment and i make no doubt there have been twenty countesses of galgenstein since your time  i dont believe any such thing sir said mrs catherine starting up very angrily  if you did i suppose youd laudanum him wouldnt you  leave the room fellow said the lady but she recollected herself speedily again and clasping her hands and looking very wretched at brock at the ceiling at the floor at her husband from whom she violently turned away her head she began to cry piteously to which tears the corporal set up a gentle accompaniment of whistling as they trickled one after another down her nose  i dont think they were tears of repentance but of regret for the time when she had her first love and her fine clothes and her white hat and blue feather of the two the corporals whistle was much more innocent than the girls sobbing he was a rogue but a goodnatured old fellow when his humour was not crossed surely our novelwriters make a great mistake in divesting their rascals of all gentle human qualities they have suchand the only sad point to think of is in all private concerns of life abstract feelings and dealings with friends and so on how dreadfully like a rascal is to an honest man the man who murdered the italian boy set him first to play with his children whom he loved and who doubtless deplored his loss    chapter vi adventures of the ambassador mr macshane   if we had not been obliged to follow history in all respects it is probable that we should have left out the last adventure of mrs catherine and her husband at the inn at worcester altogether for in truth very little came of it and it is not very romantic or striking but we are bound to stick closely above all by the truththe truth though it be not particularly pleasant to read of or to tell as anybody may read in the newgate calendar mr and mrs hayes were taken at an inn at worcester were confined there were swindled by persons who pretended to impress the bridegroom for military service what is one to do after that had we been writing novels instead of authentic histories we might have carried them anywhere else we chose and we had a great mind to make hayes philosophising with bolingbroke like a certain devereux and mrs catherine maitresse en titre to mr alexander pope doctor sacheverel sir john reade the oculist dean swift or marshal tallard as the very commonest romancer would under such circumstances but alas and alas truth must be spoken whatever else is in the wind and the excellent newgate calendar which contains the biographies and thanatographies of hayes and his wife does not say a word of their connections with any of the leading literary or military heroes of the time of her majesty queen anne the calendar says in so many words that hayes was obliged to send to his father in warwickshire for money to get him out of the scrape and that the old gentleman came down to his aid by this truth must we stick and not for the sake of the most brilliant episodeno not for a bribe of twenty extra guineas per sheet would we depart from it  mr brocks account of his adventure in london has given the reader some short notice of his friend mr macshane neither the wits nor the principles of that worthy ensign were particularly firm for drink poverty and a crack on the skull at the battle of steenkirk had served to injure the former and the ensign was not in his best days possessed of any share of the latter he had really at one period held such a rank in the army but pawned his halfpay for drink and play and for many years past had lived one of the hundred thousand miracles of our city upon nothing that anybody knew of or of which he himself could give any account who has not a catalogue of these men in his list who can tell whence comes the occasional clean shirt who supplies the continual means of drunkenness who wards off the dailyimpending starvation their life is a wonder from day to day their breakfast a wonder their dinner a miracle their bed an interposition of providence if you and i my dear sir want a shilling tomorrow who will give it us will our butchers give us muttonchops will our laundresses clothe us in clean linennot a bone or a rag standing as we do may it be ever so somewhat removed from want is there one of us who does not shudder at the thought of descending into the lists to combat with it and expect anything but to be utterly crushed in the encounter        the author it must be remembered has his lodgings and      food provided for him by the government of his country  not a bit of it my dear sir it takes much more than you think for to starve a man starvation is very little when you are used to it some people i know even who live on it quite comfortably and make their daily bread by it it had been our friend macshanes sole profession for many years and he did not fail to draw from it such a livelihood as was sufficient and perhaps too good for him he managed to dine upon it a certain or rather uncertain number of days in the week to sleep somewhere and to get drunk at least three hundred times a year he was known to one or two noblemen who occasionally helped him with a few pieces and whom he helped in turnnever mind how he had other acquaintances whom he pestered undauntedly and from whom he occasionally extracted a dinner or a crown or mayhap by mistake a goldheaded cane which found its way to the pawnbrokers when flush of cash he would appear at the coffeehouse when low in funds the deuce knows into what mystic caves and dens he slunk for food and lodging he was perfectly ready with his sword and when sober or better still a very little tipsy was a complete master of it in the art of boasting and lying he had hardly any equals in shoes he stood six feet five inches and here is his complete signalement it was a fact that he had been in spain as a volunteer where he had shown some gallantry had had a brainfever and was sent home to starve as before  mr macshane had however like mr conrad the corsair one virtue in the midst of a thousand crimeshe was faithful to his employer for the time being and a story is told of him which may or may not be to his credit viz that being hired on one occasion by a certain lord to inflict a punishment upon a roturier who had crossed his lordship in his amours he macshane did actually refuse from the person to be belaboured and who entreated his forbearance a larger sum of money than the nobleman gave him for the beating which he performed punctually as bound in honour and friendship this tale would the ensign himself relate with much selfsatisfaction and when after the sudden flight from london he and brock took to their roving occupation he cheerfully submitted to the latter as his commanding officer called him always major and bating blunders and drunkenness was perfectly true to his leader he had a notionand indeed i dont know that it was a wrong onethat his profession was now as before strictly military and according to the rules of honour robbing he called plundering the enemy and hanging was in his idea a dastardly and cruel advantage that the latter took and that called for the sternest reprisals  the other gentlemen concerned were strangers to mr brock who felt little inclined to trust either of them upon such a message or with such a large sum to bring back they had strange to say a similar mistrust on their side but mr brock lugged out five guineas which he placed in the landladys hand as security for his comrades return and ensign macshane being mounted on poor hayess own horse set off to visit the parents of that unhappy young man it was a gallant sight to behold our thieves ambassador in a faded skyblue suit with orange facings in a pair of huge jackboots unconscious of blacking with a mighty baskethilted sword by his side and a little shabby beaver cocked over a large towperiwig ride out from the inn of the three rooks on his mission to hayess paternal village  it was eighteen miles distant from worcester but mr macshane performed the distance in safety and in sobriety moreover for such had been his instructions and had no difficulty in discovering the house of old hayes towards which indeed johns horse trotted incontinently mrs hayes who was knitting at the housedoor was not a little surprised at the appearance of the wellknown grey gelding and of the stranger mounted upon it  flinging himself off the steed with much agility mr macshane as soon as his feet reached the ground brought them rapidly together in order to make a profound and elegant bow to mrs hayes and slapping his greasy beaver against his heart and poking his periwig almost into the nose of the old lady demanded whether he had the shooprame honour of adthressing misthriss hees  having been answered in the affirmative he then proceeded to ask whether there was a blackguard boy in the house who would take the horse to the steeble whether he could have a dthrink of smallbeer or buthermilk being faith uncommon dthry and whether finally he could be feevored with a few minutes private conversation with her and mr hees on a matther of consitherable impartance all these preliminaries were to be complied with before mr macshane would enter at all into the subject of his visit the horse and man were cared for mr hayes was called in and not a little anxious did mrs hayes grow in the meanwhile with regard to the fate of her darling son where is he how is he is he dead said the old lady oh yes im sure hes dead  indeed madam and youre misteeken intirely the young man is perfectly well in health  oh praised be heaven  but mighty cast down in sperrits to misfortunes madam look you the best of us are subject and a trifling one has fell upon your son  and herewith mr macshane produced a letter in the handwriting of young hayes of which we have had the good luck to procure a copy it ran thus  honored father and motherthe bearer of this is a kind gentleman who has left me in a great deal of trouble yesterday at this towne i fell in with some gentlemen of the queenes servas after drinking with whom i accepted her majestys mony to enliste repenting thereof i did endeavour to escape and in so doing had the misfortune to strike my superior officer whereby i made myself liable to death according to the rules of warr if however i pay twenty ginnys all will be wel you must give the same to the barer els i shall be shott without fail on tewsday morning and so no more from your loving son  john hayes  from my prison at bristol this unhappy monday   when mrs hayes read this pathetic missive its success with her was complete and she was for going immediately to the cupboard and producing the money necessary for her darling sons release but the carpenter hayes was much more suspicious i dont know you sir said he to the ambassador  do you doubt my honour sir said the ensign very fiercely  why sir replied mr hayes i know little about it one way or other but shall take it for granted if you will explain a little more of this business  i sildom condescind to explean said mr macshane for its not the custom in my rank but ill explean anything in reason  pray will you tell me in what regiment my son is enlisted  in coorse in colonel woods fut my dear and a gallant corps it is as any in the army  and you left him  on me soul only three hours ago having rid like a horsejockey ever since as in the sacred cause of humanity curse me every man should  as hayess house was seventy miles from bristol the old gentleman thought this was marvellous quick riding and so cut the conversation short you have said quite enough sir said he to show me there is some roguery in the matter and that the whole story is false from beginning to end  at this abrupt charge the ensign looked somewhat puzzled and then spoke with much gravity roguery said he misthur hees is a sthrong term and which in consideration of my friendship for your family i shall pass over you doubt your sons honour as there wrote by him in black and white  you have forced him to write said mr hayes  the sly old divvles right muttered mr macshane aside well sir to make a clean breast of it he has been forced to write it the story about the enlistment is a pretty fib if you will from beginning to end and what then my dear do you think your sons any better off for that  oh where is he screamed mrs hayes plumping down on her knees we will give him the money wont we john  i know you will madam when i tell you where he is he is in the hands of some gentlemen of my acquaintance who are at war with the present government and no more care about cutting a mans throat than they do a chickens he is a prisoner madam of our sword and spear if you choose to ransom him well and good if not peace be with him for never more shall you see him  and how do i know you wont come back tomorrow for more money asked mr hayes  sir you have my honour and id as lieve break my neck as my word said mr macshane gravely twenty guineas is the bargain take ten minutes to talk of ittake it then or leave it its all the same to me my dear and it must be said of our friend the ensign that he meant every word he said and that he considered the embassy on which he had come as perfectly honourable and regular  and pray what prevents us said mr hayes starting up in a rage from taking hold of you as a surety for him  you wouldnt fire on a flag of truce would ye you dishonourable ould civilian replied mr macshane besides says he theres more reasons to prevent you the first is this pointing to his sword here are two moreand these were pistols and the last and the best of all is that you might hang me and dthraw me and quarther me an yet never see so much as the tip of your sons nose again look you sir we run mighty risks in our professionits not all play i can tell you were obliged to be punctual too or its all up with the thrade if i promise that your son will die as sure as fate tomorrow morning unless i return home safe our people must keep my promise or else what chance is there for me you would be down upon me in a moment with a posse of constables and have me swinging before warwick gaol pooh my dear you never would sacrifice a darling boy like john hayes let alone his lady for the sake of my long carcass one or two of our gentlemen have been taken that way already because parents and guardians would not believe them  and what became of the poor children said mrs hayes who began to perceive the gist of the argument and to grow dreadfully frightened  dont lets talk of them maam humanity shudthers at the thought and herewith mr macshane drew his finger across his throat in such a dreadful way as to make the two parents tremble its the way of war madam look you the service i have the honour to belong to is not paid by the queen and so were obliged to make our prisoners pay according to established military practice  no lawyer could have argued his case better than mr macshane so far and he completely succeeded in convincing mr and mrs hayes of the necessity of ransoming their son promising that the young man should be restored to them next morning along with his beautiful lady he courteously took leave of the old couple and made the best of his way back to worcester again the elder hayes wondered who the lady could be of whom the ambassador had spoken for their sons elopement was altogether unknown to them but anger or doubt about this subject was overwhelmed by their fears for their darling johns safety away rode the gallant macshane with the money necessary to effect this and it must be mentioned as highly to his credit that he never once thought of appropriating the sum to himself or of deserting his comrades in any way  his ride from worcester had been a long one he had left that city at noon but before his return thither the sun had gone down and the landscape which had been dressed like a prodigal in purple and gold now appeared like a quaker in dusky grey and the trees by the roadside grew black as undertakers or physicians and bending their solemn heads to each other whispered ominously among themselves and the mists hung on the common and the cottage lights went out one by one and the earth and heaven grew black but for some twinkling useless stars which freckled the ebon countenance of the latter and the air grew colder and about two oclock the moon appeared a dismal palefaced rake walking solitary through the deserted sky and about four mayhap the dawn wretched prenticeboy opened in the east the shutters of the dayin other words more than a dozen hours had passed corporal brock had been relieved by mr redcap the latter by mr sicklop the oneeyed gentleman mrs john hayes in spite of her sorrows and bashfulness had followed the example of her husband and fallen asleep by his sideslept for many hoursand awakened still under the guardianship of mr brocks troop and all parties began anxiously to expect the return of the ambassador mr macshane  that officer who had performed the first part of his journey with such distinguished prudence and success found the night on his journey homewards was growing mighty cold and dark and as he was thirsty and hungry had money in his purse and saw no cause to hurry he determined to take refuge at an alehouse for the night and to make for worcester by dawn the next morning he accordingly alighted at the first inn on his road consigned his horse to the stable and entering the kitchen called for the best liquor in the house  a small company was assembled at the inn among whom mr macshane took his place with a great deal of dignity and having a considerable sum of money in his pocket felt a mighty contempt for his society and soon let them know the contempt he felt for them after a third flagon of ale he discovered that the liquor was sour and emptied with much spluttering and grimaces the remainder of the beer into the fire this process so offended the parson of the parish who in those good old times did not disdain to take the post of honour in the chimneynook that he left his corner looking wrathfully at the offender who without any more ado instantly occupied it it was a fine thing to hear the jingling of the twenty pieces in his pocket the oaths which he distributed between the landlord the guests and the liquorto remark the sprawl of his mighty jackboots before the sweep of which the timid guests edged farther and farther away and the languishing leers which he cast on the landlady as with widespread arms he attempted to seize upon her  when the ostler had done his duties in the stable he entered the inn and whispered the landlord that the stranger was riding john hayess horse of which fact the host soon convinced himself and did not fail to have some suspicions of his guest had he not thought that times were unquiet horses might be sold and one mans money was as good as anothers he probably would have arrested the ensign immediately and so lost all the profit of the score which the latter was causing every moment to be enlarged  in a couple of hours with that happy facility which one may have often remarked in men of the gallant ensigns nation he had managed to disgust every one of the landlords other guests and scare them from the kitchen frightened by his addresses the landlady too had taken flight and the host was the only person left in the apartment who there stayed for interests sake merely and listened moodily to his tipsy guests conversation in an hour more the whole house was awakened by a violent noise of howling curses and pots clattering to and fro forth issued mrs landlady in her nightgear out came john ostler with his pitchfork downstairs tumbled mrs cook and one or two guests and found the landlord and ensign on the kitchenfloorthe wig of the latter lying much singed and emitting strange odours in the fireplace his face hideously distorted and a great quantity of his natural hair in the partial occupation of the landlord who had drawn it and the head down towards him in order that he might have the benefit of pummelling the latter more at his ease in revenge the landlord was undermost and the ensigns arms were working up and down his face and body like the flaps of a paddlewheel the man of war had clearly the best of it  the combatants were separated as soon as possible but as soon as the excitement of the fight was over ensign macshane was found to have no further powers of speech sense or locomotion and was carried by his late antagonist to bed his sword and pistols which had been placed at his side at the commencement of the evening were carefully put by and his pocket visited twenty guineas in gold a large knifeused probably for the cutting of breadandcheesesome crumbs of those delicacies and a paper of tobacco found in the breechespockets and in the bosom of the skyblue coat the leg of a cold fowl and half of a raw onion constituted his whole property  these articles were not very suspicious but the beating which the landlord had received tended greatly to confirm his own and his wifes doubts about their guest and it was determined to send off in the early morning to mr hayes informing him how a person had lain at their inn who had ridden thither mounted upon young hayess horse off set john ostler at earliest dawn but on his way he woke up mr justices clerk and communicated his suspicions to him and mr clerk consulted with the village baker who was always up early and the clerk the baker the butcher with his cleaver and two gentlemen who were going to work all adjourned to the inn  accordingly when ensign macshane was in a trucklebed plunged in that deep slumber which only innocence and drunkenness enjoy in this world and charming the ears of morn by the regular and melodious music of his nose a vile plot was laid against him and when about seven of the clock he woke he found on sitting up in his bed three gentlemen on each side of it armed and looking ominous one held a constables staff and albeit unprovided with a warrant would take upon himself the responsibility of seizing mr macshane and of carrying him before his worship at the hall  taranouns man said the ensign springing up in bed and abruptly breaking off a loud sonorous yawn with which he had opened the business of the day you wont deteen a gentleman whos on life and death i give ye my word an affair of honour  how came you by that there horse said the baker  how came you by these here fifteen guineas said the landlord in whose hands by some process five of the gold pieces had disappeared  what is this here idolatrous string of beads said the clerk  mr macshane the fact is was a catholic but did not care to own it for in those days his religion was not popular  baids holy mother of saints give me back them baids said mr macshane clasping his hands they were blest i tell you by his holiness the popsha i mane they belong to a darling little daughter i had thats in heaven now and as for the money and the horse i should like to know how a gentleman is to travel in this counthry without them  why you see he may travel in the country to git em here shrewdly remarked the constable and its our belief that neither horse nor money is honestly come by if his worship is satisfied why so in course shall we be but there is highwaymen abroad look you and to our notion you have very much the cut of one  further remonstrances or threats on the part of mr macshane were useless although he vowed that he was first cousin to the duke of leinster an officer in her majestys service and the dearest friend lord marlborough had his impudent captors would not believe a word of his statement which further was garnished with a tremendous number of oaths and he was about eight oclock carried up to the house of squire ballance the neighbouring justice of the peace  when the worthy magistrate asked the crime of which the prisoner had been guilty the captors looked somewhat puzzled for the moment since in truth it could not be shown that the ensign had committed any crime at all and if he had confined himself to simple silence and thrown upon them the onus of proving his misdemeanours justice ballance must have let him loose and soundly rated his clerk and the landlord for detaining an honest gentleman on so frivolous a charge  but this caution was not in the ensigns disposition and though his accusers produced no satisfactory charge against him his own words were quite enough to show how suspicious his character was when asked his name he gave it in as captain geraldine on his way to ireland by bristol on a visit to his cousin the duke of leinster he swore solemnly that his friends the duke of marlborough and lord peterborough under both of whom he had served should hear of the manner in which he had been treated and when the justicea sly old gentleman and one that read the gazettes asked him at what battles he had been present the gallant ensign pitched on a couple in spain and in flanders which had been fought within a week of each other and vowed that he had been desperately wounded at both so that at the end of his examination which had been taken down by the clerk he had been made to acknowledge as followscaptain geraldine six feet four inches in height thin with a very long red nose and red hair grey eyes and speaks with a strong irish accent is the firstcousin of the duke of leinster and in constant communication with him does not know whether his grace has any children does not know whereabouts he lives in london cannot say what sort of a looking man his grace is is acquainted with the duke of marlborough and served in the dragoons at the battle of ramillies at which time he was with my lord peterborough before barcelona borrowed the horse which he rides from a friend in london three weeks since peter hobbs ostler swears that it was in his masters stable four days ago and is the property of john hayes carpenter cannot account for the fifteen guineas found on him by the landlord says there were twenty says he won them at cards a fortnight since at edinburgh says he is riding about the country for his amusement afterwards says he is on a matter of life and death and going to bristol declared last night in the hearing of several witnesses that he was going to york says he is a man of independent property and has large estates in ireland and a hundred thousand pounds in the bank of england has no shirt or stockings and the coat he wears is marked ss in his boots is written thomas rodgers and in his hat is the name of the rev doctor snoffler  doctor snoffler lived at worcester and had lately advertised in the hue and cry a number of articles taken from his house mr macshane said in reply to this that his hat had been changed at the inn and he was ready to take his oath that he came thither in a goldlaced one but this fact was disproved by the oaths of many persons who had seen him at the inn and he was about to be imprisoned for the thefts which he had not committed the fact about the hat being that he had purchased it from a gentleman at the three rooks for two pints of beerhe was about to be remanded when behold mrs hayes the elder made her appearance and to her it was that the ensign was indebted for his freedom  old hayes had gone to work before the ostler arrived but when his wife heard the lads message she instantly caused her pillion to be placed behind the saddle and mounting the grey horse urged the stableboy to gallop as hard as ever he could to the justices house  she entered panting and alarmed oh what is your honour going to do to this honest gentleman said she in the name of heaven let him go his time is precioushe has important businessbusiness of life and death  i tould the jidge so said the ensign but he refused to take my wordthe sacred wurrd of honour of captain geraldine  macshane was good at a single lie though easily flustered on an examination and this was a very creditable stratagem to acquaint mrs hayes with the name that he bore  what you know captain geraldine said mr ballance who was perfectly well acquainted with the carpenters wife  in coorse she does hasnt she known me these tin years are we not related didnt she give me the very horse which i rode and to make belave tould you id bought in london  let her tell her own story are you related to captain geraldine mrs hayes  yesoh yes  a very elegant connection and you gave him the horse did you of your own freewill  oh yes of my own willi would give him anything do do your honour let him go his child is dying said the old lady bursting into tears it may be dead before he gets tobefore he gets there oh your honour your honour pray pray dont detain him  the justice did not seem to understand this excessive sympathy on the part of mrs hayes nor did the father himself appear to be nearly so affected by his childs probable fate as the honest woman who interested herself for him on the contrary when she made this passionate speech captain geraldine only grinned and said niver mind my dear if his honour will keep an honest gentleman for doing nothing why let himthe law must settle between us and as for the child poor thing the lord deliver it  at this mrs hayes fell to entreating more loudly than ever and as there was really no charge against him mr ballance was constrained to let him go  the landlord and his friends were making off rather confused when ensign macshane called upon the former in a thundering voice to stop and refund the five guineas which he had stolen from him again the host swore there were but fifteen in his pocket but when on the bible the ensign solemnly vowed that he had twenty and called upon mrs hayes to say whether yesterday halfanhour before he entered the inn she had not seen him with twenty guineas and that lady expressed herself ready to swear that she had mr landlord looked more crestfallen than ever and said that he had not counted the money when he took it and though he did in his soul believe that there were only fifteen guineas rather than be suspected of a shabby action he would pay the five guineas out of his own pocket which he did and with the ensigns or rather mrs hayess own coin  as soon as they were out of the justices house mr macshane in the fulness of his gratitude could not help bestowing an embrace upon mrs hayes and when she implored him to let her ride behind him to her darling son he yielded with a very good grace and off the pair set on john hayess grey  who has nosey brought with him now said mr sicklop brocks oneeyed confederate who about three hours after the above adventure was lolling in the yard of the three rooks it was our ensign with the mother of his captive they had not met with any accident in their ride  i shall now have the shooprame bliss said mr macshane with much feeling as he lifted mrs hayes from the saddlethe shooprame bliss of intwining two harrts that are mead for one another ours my dear is a dismal profession but ah dont moments like this make aminds for years of pain this way my dear turn to your right then to your leftmind the stipand the third door round the corner  all these precautions were attended to and after giving his concerted knock mr macshane was admitted into an apartment which he entered holding his gold pieces in the one hand and a lady by the other  we shall not describe the meeting which took place between mother and son the old lady wept copiously the young man was really glad to see his relative for he deemed that his troubles were over mrs cat bit her lips and stood aside looking somewhat foolish mr brock counted the money and mr macshane took a large dose of strong waters as a pleasing solace for his labours dangers and fatigue  when the maternal feelings were somewhat calmed the old lady had leisure to look about her and really felt a kind of friendship and goodwill for the company of thieves in which she found herself it seemed to her that they had conferred an actual favour on her in robbing her of twenty guineas threatening her sons life and finally letting him go  who is that droll old gentleman said she and being told that it was captain wood she dropped him a curtsey and said with much respect captain your very humble servant which compliment mr brock acknowledged by a gracious smile and bow and who is this pretty young lady continued mrs hayes  whyhumohmother you must give her your blessing she is mrs john hayes and herewith mr hayes brought forward his interesting lady to introduce her to his mamma  the news did not at all please the old lady who received mrs catherines embrace with a very sour face indeed however the mischief was done and she was too glad to get back her son to be on such an occasion very angry with him so after a proper rebuke she told mrs john hayes that though she never approved of her sons attachment and thought he married below his condition yet as the evil was done it was their duty to make the best of it and she for her part would receive her into her house and make her as comfortable there as she could  i wonder whether she has any more money in that house whispered mr sicklop to mr redcap who with the landlady had come to the door of the room and had been amusing themselves by the contemplation of this sentimental scene  what a fool that wild hirishman was not to bleed her for more said the landlady but hes a poor ignorant papist im sure my man this gentleman had been hanged wouldnt have come away with such a beggarly sum  suppose we have some more out of em said mr redcap what prevents us we have got the old mare and the colt tooha haand the pair of em ought to be worth at least a hundred to us  this conversation was carried on sotto voce and i dont know whether mr brock had any notion of the plot which was arranged by the three worthies the landlady began it which punch madam will you take says she you must have something for the good of the house now you are in it  in coorse said the ensign  certainly said the other three but the old lady said she was anxious to leave the place and putting down a crownpiece requested the hostess to treat the gentlemen in her absence goodbye captain said the old lady  ajew cried the ensign and long life to you my dear you got me out of a scrape at the justices yonder and split me but insign macshane will remimber it as long as he lives  and now hayes and the two ladies made for the door but the landlady placed herself against it and mr sicklop said no no my pretty madams you aint agoing off so cheap as that neither you are not going out for a beggarly twenty guineas look youwe must have more  mr hayes starting back and cursing his fate fairly burst into tears the two women screamed and mr brock looked as if the proposition both amused and had been expected by him but not so ensign macshane  major said he clawing fiercely hold of brocks arms  ensign said mr brock smiling  arr we or arr we not men of honour  oh in coorse said brock laughing and using macshanes favourite expression  if we arr men of honour we are bound to stick to our word and hark ye you dirty oneeyed scoundrel if you dont immadiately make way for these leedies and this lilylivered young jontleman whos crying so the meejor here and i will lug out and force you and so saying he drew his great sword and made a pass at mr sicklop which that gentleman avoided and which caused him and his companion to retreat from the door the landlady still kept her position at it and with a storm of oaths against the ensign and against two englishmen who ran away from a wild hirishman swore she would not budge a foot and would stand there until her dying day  faith then needs must said the ensign and made a lunge at the hostess which passed so near the wretchs throat that she screamed sank on her knees and at last opened the door  down the stairs then with great state mr macshane led the elder lady the married couple following and having seen them to the street took an affectionate farewell of the party whom he vowed that he would come and see you can walk the eighteen miles aisy between this and nightfall said he  walk exclaimed mr hayes why havent we got ball and shall ride and tie all the way  madam cried macshane in a stern voice honour before everything did you not in the presence of his worship vow and declare that you gave me that horse and now dye talk of taking it back again let me tell you madam that such paltry thricks ill become a person of your years and respectability and ought never to be played with insign timothy macshane  he waved his hat and strutted down the street and mrs catherine hayes along with her bridegroom and motherinlaw made the best of their way homeward on foot    chapter vii which embraces a period of seven years   the recovery of so considerable a portion of his property from the clutches of brock was as may be imagined no trifling source of joy to that excellent young man count gustavus adolphus de galgenstein and he was often known to say with much archness and a proper feeling of gratitude to the fate which had ordained things so that the robbery was in reality one of the best things that could have happened to him for in event of mr brocks not stealing the money his excellency the count would have had to pay the whole to the warwickshire squire who had won it from him at play he was enabled in the present instance to plead his notorious poverty as an excuse and the warwickshire conqueror got off with nothing except a very badly written autograph of the counts simply acknowledging the debt  this point his excellency conceded with the greatest candour but as doubtless the reader may have remarked in the course of his experience to owe is not quite the same thing as to pay and from the day of his winning the money until the day of his death the warwickshire squire did never by any chance touch a single bob tizzy tester moidore maravedi doubloon tomaun or rupee of the sum which monsieur de galgenstein had lost to him  that young nobleman was as mr brock hinted in the little autobiographical sketch which we gave in a former chapter incarcerated for a certain period and for certain other debts in the donjons of shrewsbury but he released himself from them by that noble and consolatory method of whitewashing which the law has provided for gentlemen in his oppressed condition and he had not been a week in london when he fell in with and overcame or put to flight captain wood alias brock and immediately seized upon the remainder of his property after receiving this the count with commendable discretion disappeared from england altogether for a while nor are we at all authorised to state that any of his debts to his tradesmen were discharged any more than his debts of honour as they are pleasantly called  having thus settled with his creditors the gallant count had interest enough with some of the great folk to procure for himself a post abroad and was absent in holland for some time it was here that he became acquainted with the lovely madam silverkoop the widow of a deceased gentleman of leyden and although the lady was not at that age at which tender passions are usually inspiredbeing sixtyand though she could not like mademoiselle ninon de lenclos then at paris boast of charms which defied the progress of timefor mrs silverkoop was as red as a boiled lobster and as unwieldy as a porpoise and although her mental attractions did by no means make up for her personal deficienciesfor she was jealous violent vulgar drunken and stingy to a miracle yet her charms had an immediate effect on monsieur de galgenstein and hence perhaps the reader the rogue how well he knows the world will be led to conclude that the honest widow was rich  such indeed she was and count gustavus despising the difference between his twenty quarterings and her twenty thousand pounds laid the most desperate siege to her and finished by causing her to capitulate as i do believe after a reasonable degree of pressing any woman will do to any man such at least has been my experience in the matter  the count then married and it was curious to see how hewho as we have seen in the case of mrs cat had been as great a tiger and domestic bully as any extantnow by degrees fell into a quiet submission towards his enormous countess who ordered him up and down as a lady orders her footman who permitted him speedily not to have a will of his own and who did not allow him a shilling of her money without receiving for the same an accurate account  how was it that he the abject slave of madam silverkoop had been victorious over mrs cat the first blow is i believe the decisive one in these cases and the countess had stricken it a week after their marriageestablishing a supremacy which the count never afterwards attempted to question  we have alluded to his excellencys marriage as in duty bound because it will be necessary to account for his appearance hereafter in a more splendid fashion than that under which he has hitherto been known to us and just comforting the reader by the knowledge that the union though prosperous in a worldly point of view was in reality extremely unhappy we must say no more from this time forth of the fat and legitimate madam de galgenstein our darling is mrs catherine who had formerly acted in her stead and only in so much as the fat countess did influence in any way the destinies of our heroine or those wise and virtuous persons who have appeared and are to follow her to her end shall we in any degree allow her name to figure here it is an awful thing to get a glimpse as one sometimes does when the time is past of some little little wheel which works the whole mighty machinery of fate and see how our destinies turn on a minutes delay or advance or on the turning of a street or on somebody elses turning of a street or on somebody elses doing of something else in downing street or in timbuctoo now or a thousand years ago thus for instance if miss poots in the year 1695 had never been the lovely inmate of a spielhaus at amsterdam mr van silverkoop would never have seen her if the day had not been extraordinarily hot the worthy merchant would never have gone thither if he had not been fond of rhenish wine and sugar he never would have called for any such delicacies if he had not called for them miss ottilia poots would never have brought them and partaken of them if he had not been rich she would certainly have rejected all the advances made to her by silverkoop if he had not been so fond of rhenish and sugar he never would have died and mrs silverkoop would have been neither rich nor a widow nor a wife to count von galgenstein nay nor would this history have ever been written for if count galgenstein had not married the rich widow mrs catherine would never have  oh my dear madam you thought we were going to tell you pooh nonsenseno such thing not for two or three and seventy pages or sowhen perhaps you may know what mrs catherine never would have done  the reader will remember in the second chapter of these memoirs the announcement that mrs catherine had given to the world a child who might bear if he chose the arms of galgenstein with the further adornment of a barsinister this child had been put out to nurse some time before its mothers elopement from the count and as that nobleman was in funds at the time having had that success at play which we duly chronicled he paid a sum of no less than twenty guineas which was to be the yearly reward of the nurse into whose charge the boy was put the woman grew fond of the brat and when after the first year she had no further news or remittances from father or mother she determined for a while at least to maintain the infant at her own expense for when rebuked by her neighbours on this score she stoutly swore that no parents could ever desert their children and that some day or other she should not fail to be rewarded for her trouble with this one  under this strange mental hallucination poor goody billings who had five children and a husband of her own continued to give food and shelter to little tom for a period of no less than seven years and though it must be acknowledged that the young gentleman did not in the slightest degree merit the kindnesses shown to him goody billings who was of a very soft and pitiful disposition continued to bestow them upon him because she said he was lonely and unprotected and deserved them more than other children who had fathers and mothers to look after them if then any difference was made between toms treatment and that of her own brood it was considerably in favour of the former to whom the largest proportions of treacle were allotted for his bread and the handsomest supplies of hasty pudding besides to do mrs billings justice there was a party against him and that consisted not only of her husband and her five children but of every single person in the neighbourhood who had an opportunity of seeing and becoming acquainted with master tom  a celebrated philosopheri think miss edgeworthhas broached the consolatory doctrine that in intellect and disposition all human beings are entirely equal and that circumstance and education are the causes of the distinctions and divisions which afterwards unhappily take place among them not to argue this question which places jack howard and jack thurtell on an exact levelwhich would have us to believe that lord melbourne is by natural gifts and excellences a man as honest brave and farsighted as the duke of wellingtonwhich would make out that lord lyndhurst is in point of principle eloquence and political honesty no better than mr oconnellnot i say arguing this doctrine let us simply state that master thomas billings for having no other he took the name of the worthy people who adopted him was in his longcoats fearfully passionate screaming and roaring perpetually and showing all the ill that he could show at the age of two when his strength enabled him to toddle abroad his favourite resort was the coalhole or the dungheap his roarings had not diminished in the least and he had added to his former virtues two new onesa love of fighting and stealing both which amiable qualities he had many opportunities of exercising every day he fought his little adoptive brothers and sisters he kicked and cuffed his father and mother he fought the cat stamped upon the kittens was worsted in a severe battle with the hen in the backyard but in revenge nearly beat a little suckingpig to death whom he caught alone and rambling near his favourite haunt the dunghill as for stealing he stole the eggs which he perforated and emptied the butter which he ate with or without bread as he could find it the sugar which he cunningly secreted in the leaves of a bakers chronicle that nobody in the establishment could read and thus from the pages of history he used to suck in all he knewthieving and lying namely in which for his years he made wonderful progress if any followers of miss edgeworth and the philosophers are inclined to disbelieve this statement or to set it down as overcharged and distorted let them be assured that just this very picture was of all the pictures in the world taken from nature i ikey solomons once had a dear little brother who could steal before he could walk and this not from encouragementfor if you know the world you must know that in families of our profession the point of honour is sacred at homebut from pure naturewho could steal i say before he could walk and lie before he could speak and who at four and a half years of age having attacked my sister rebecca on some question of lollipops had smitten her on the elbow with a fireshovel apologising to us by saying simply  her i wish it had been her head dear dear aminadab i think of you and laugh these philosophers to scorn nature made you for that career which you fulfilled you were from your birth to your dying a scoundrel you couldnt have been anything else however your lot was cast and blessed it was that you were born among the prigsfor had you been of any other profession alas alas what ills might you have done as i have heard the author of richelieu siamese twins etc say poeta nascitur non fit which means that though he had tried ever so much to be a poet it was all moonshine in the like manner i say roagus nascitur non fit we have it from nature and so a fig for miss edgeworth  in this manner then while his father blessed with a wealthy wife was leading in a fine house the life of a galleyslave while his mother married to mr hayes and made an honest women of as the saying is was passing her time respectably in warwickshire mr thomas billings was inhabiting the same county not cared for by either of them but ordained by fate to join them one day and have a mighty influence upon the fortunes of both for as it has often happened to the traveller in the york or the exeter coach to fall snugly asleep in his corner and on awaking suddenly to find himself sixty or seventy miles from the place where somnus first visited him as we say although you sit still time poor wretch keeps perpetually running on and so must run day and night with never a pause or a halt of five minutes to get a drink until his dying day let the reader imagine that since he left mrs hayes and all the other worthy personages of this history in the last chapter seven years have sped away during which all our heroes and heroines have been accomplishing their destinies  seven years of country carpentering or rather trading on the part of a husband of ceaseless scolding violence and discontent on the part of a wife are not pleasant to describe so we shall omit altogether any account of the early married life of mr and mrs john hayes the newgate calendar to which excellent compilation we and the other popular novelists of the day can never be sufficiently grateful states that hayes left his house three or four times during this period and urged by the restless humours of his wife tried several professions returning however as he grew weary of each to his wife and his paternal home after a certain time his parents died and by their demise he succeeded to a small property and the carpentering business which he for some time followed  what then in the meanwhile had become of captain wood or brock and ensign macshanethe only persons now to be accounted for in our catalogue for about six months after their capture and release of mr hayes those noble gentlemen had followed with much prudence and success that trade which the celebrated and polite duval the ingenious sheppard the dauntless turpin and indeed many other heroes of our most popular novels had pursuedor were pursuing in their time and so considerable were said to be captain woods gains that reports were abroad of his having somewhere a buried treasure to which he might have added more had not fate suddenly cut short his career as a prig he and the ensign wereshame to saytransported for stealing three pewterpots off a railing at exeter and not being known in the town which they had only reached that morning they were detained by no further charges but simply condemned on this one for this misdemeanour her majestys government vindictively sent them for seven years beyond the sea and as the fashion then was sold the use of their bodies to virginian planters during that space of time it is thus alas that the strong are always used to deal with the weak and many an honest fellow has been led to rue his unfortunate difference with the law  thus then we have settled all scores the count is in holland with his wife mrs cat in warwickshire along with her excellent husband master thomas billings with his adoptive parents in the same county and the two military gentlemen watching the progress and cultivation of the tobacco and cotton plant in the new world all these things having passed between the acts dingaringadingaringadingledingleding the drop draws up and the next act begins by the way the play ends with a drop but that is neither here nor there                        here as in a theatre the orchestra is supposed to play something melodious the people get up shake themselves yawn and settle down in their seats again porter ale gingerbeer cider comes round squeezing through the legs of the gentlemen in the pit nobody takes anything as usual and lo the curtain rises again sh shsh shshshhh hats off says everybody                        mrs hayes had now been for six years the adored wife of mr hayes and no offspring had arisen to bless their loves and perpetuate their name she had obtained a complete mastery over her lord and master and having had as far as was in that gentlemans power every single wish gratified that she could demand in the way of dress treats to coventry and birmingham drink and what notfor though a hard man john hayes had learned to spend his money pretty freely on himself and herhaving had all her wishes gratified it was natural that she should begin to find out some more and the next whim she hit upon was to be restored to her child it may be as well to state that she had never informed her husband of the existence of that phenomenon although he was aware of his wifes former connection with the countmrs hayes in their matrimonial quarrels invariably taunting him with accounts of her former splendour and happiness and with his own meanness of taste in condescending to take up with his excellencys leavings  she determined then but as yet had not confided her determination to her husband she would have her boy although in her seven years residence within twenty miles of him she had never once thought of seeing him and the kind reader knows that when his excellent lady determines on a thinga shawl or an operabox or a new carriage or twentyfour singinglessons from tamburini or a night at the eagle tavern city road or a ride in a bus to richmond and tea and brandyandwater at rose cottage hotelthe reader high or low knows that when mrs reader desires a thing have it she will you may just as well talk of avoiding her as of avoiding gout bills or grey hairsand that you know is impossible i for my part have had all threeay and a wife too  i say that when a woman is resolved on a thing happen it will if husbands refuse fate will interfere flectere si nequeo etc but quotations are odious and some hidden power was working in the case of mrs hayes and for its own awful purposes lending her its aid  who has not felt how he worksthe dreadful conquering spirit of ill who cannot see in the circle of his own society the fated and foredoomed to woe and evil some call the doctrine of destiny a dark creed but for me i would fain try and think it a consolatory one it is better with all ones sins upon ones head to deem oneself in the hands of fate than to thinkwith our fierce passions and weak repentances with our resolves so loud so vain so ludicrously despicably weak and frail with our dim wavering wretched conceits about virtue and our irresistible propensity to wrongthat we are the workers of our future sorrow or happiness if we depend on our strength what is it against mighty circumstance if we look to ourselves what hope have we look back at the whole of your life and see how fate has mastered you and it think of your disappointments and your successes has your striving influenced one or the other a fit of indigestion puts itself between you and honours and reputation an apple plops on your nose and makes you a worlds wonder and glory a fit of poverty makes a rascal of you who were and are still an honest man clubs trumps or six lucky mains at dice make an honest man for life of you who ever were will be and are a rascal who sends the illness who causes the apple to fall who deprives you of your worldly goods or who shuffles the cards and brings trumps honour virtue and prosperity back again you call it chance ay and so it is chance that when the floor gives way and the rope stretches tight the poor wretch before st sepulchres clock dies only with us clearsighted mortals as we are we cant see the rope by which we hang and know not when or how the drop may fall  but revenons a nos moutons let us return to that sweet lamb master thomas and the milkwhite ewe mrs cat seven years had passed away and she began to think that she should very much like to see her child once more it was written that she should and you shall hear how soon after without any great exertions of hers back he came to her  in the month of july in the year 1715 there came down a road about ten miles from the city of worcester two gentlemen not mounted templarlike upon one horse but having a horse between thema sorry bay with a sorry saddle and a large pack behind it on which each by turn took a ride of the two one was a man of excessive stature with red hair a very prominent nose and a faded military dress while the other an old weatherbeaten soberlooking personage wore the costume of a civilianboth man and dress appearing to have reached the autumnal or seedy state however the pair seemed in spite of their apparent poverty to be passably merry the old gentleman rode the horse and had in the course of their journey ridden him two miles at least in every three the tall one walked with immense strides by his side and seemed indeed as if he could have quickly outstripped the fourfooted animal had he chosen to exert his speed or had not affection for his comrade retained him at his stirrup  a short time previously the horse had cast a shoe and this the tall man on foot had gathered up and was holding in his hand it having been voted that the first blacksmith to whose shop they should come should be called upon to fit it again upon the bay horse  do you remimber this counthry meejor said the tall man who was looking about him very much pleased and sucking a flower i think thim green cornfields is prettier looking at than the d tobacky out yondther and bad lack to it  i recollect the place right well and some queer pranks we played here seven years agone responded the gentleman addressed as major you remember that man and his wife whom we took in pawn at the three rooks  and the landlady only hung last michaelmas said the tall man parenthetically  hang the landladyweve got all we ever would out of her you know but about the man and woman you went after the chaps mother and like a jackass as you are let him loose well the woman was that catherine that youve often heard me talk about i like the wench  her for i almost brought her up and she was for a year or two along with that scoundrel galgenstein who has been the cause of my ruin  the infernal blackguard and ruffian said the tall man who with his companion has no doubt been recognised by the reader  well this catherine had a child by galgenstein and somewhere here hard by the woman lived to whom we carried the brat to nurse she was the wife of a blacksmith one billings it wont be out of the way to get our horse shod at his house if he is alive still and we may learn something about the little beast i should be glad to see the mother well enough  do i remimber her said the ensign do i remimber whisky sure i do and the snivelling sneak her husband and the stout old lady her motherinlaw and the dirty oneeyed ruffian who sold me the parsons hat that had so nearly brought me into trouble oh but it was a rare rise we got out of them chaps and the old landlady thats hanged too and here both ensign macshane and major brock or wood grinned and showed much satisfaction  it will be necessary to explain the reason of it we gave the british public to understand that the landlady of the three rooks at worcester was a notorious fence or banker of thieves that is a purchaser of their merchandise in her hands mr brock and his companion had left property to the amount of sixty or seventy pounds which was secreted in a cunning recess in a chamber of the three rooks known only to the landlady and the gentlemen who banked with her and in this place mr sicklop the oneeyed man who had joined in the hayes adventure his comrade and one or two of the topping prigs of the county were free mr sicklop had been shot dead in a night attack near bath the landlady had been suddenly hanged as an accomplice in another case of robbery and when on their return from virginia our two heroes whose hopes of livelihood depended upon it had bent their steps towards worcester they were not a little frightened to hear of the cruel fate of the hostess and many of the amiable frequenters of the three rooks all the goodly company were separated the house was no longer an inn was the money gone too at least it was worth while to lookwhich messrs brock and macshane determined to do  the house being now a private one mr brock with a genius that was above his station visited its owner with a huge portfolio under his arm and in the character of a painter requested permission to take a particular sketch from a particular window the ensign followed with the artists materials consisting simply of a screwdriver and a crowbar and it is hardly necessary to say that when admission was granted to them they opened the wellknown door and to their inexpressible satisfaction discovered not their own peculiar savings exactly for these had been appropriated instantly on hearing of their transportation but stores of money and goods to the amount of near three hundred pounds to which mr macshane said they had as just and honourable a right as anybody else and so they had as just a right as anybodyexcept the original owners but who was to discover them  with this booty they set out on their journeyanywhere for they knew not whither and it so chanced that when their horses shoe came off they were within a few furlongs of the cottage of mr billings the blacksmith as they came near they were saluted by tremendous roars issuing from the smithy a small boy was held across the bellows two or three children of smaller and larger growth were holding him down and many others of the village were gazing in at the window while a man halfnaked was lashing the little boy with a whip and occasioning the cries heard by the travellers as the horse drew up the operator looked at the newcomers for a moment and then proceeded incontinently with his work belabouring the child more fiercely than ever  when he had done he turned round to the newcomers and asked how he could serve them whereupon mr wood for such was the name he adopted and by such we shall call him to the end wittily remarked that however he might wish to serve them he seemed mightily inclined to serve that young gentleman first  its no joking matter said the blacksmith if i dont serve him so now hell be worse off in his old age hell come to the gallows as sure as his name is billnever mind what his name is and so saying he gave the urchin another cut which elicited of course another scream  oh his name is bill said captain wood  his names not bill said the blacksmith sulkily hes no name and no heart neither my wife took the brat in seven years ago from a beggarly french chap to nurse and she kept him for she was a good soul here his eyes began to wink and shesshes gone now here he began fairly to blubber and d him out of love for her i kept him too and the scoundrel is a liar and a thief this blessed day merely to vex me and my boys here he spoke ill of her he did and illcuthislifeoutiwill and with each word honest mulciber applied a whack on the body of little tom billings who by shrill shrieks and oaths in treble acknowledged the receipt of the blows  come come said mr wood set the boy down and the bellows agoing my horse wants shoeing and the poor lad has had strapping enough  the blacksmith obeyed and cast poor master thomas loose as he staggered away and looked back at his tormentor his countenance assumed an expression which made mr wood say grasping hold of macshanes arm its the boy its the boy when his mother gave galgenstein the laudanum she had the selfsame look with her  had she really now said mr macshane and pree meejor who was his mother  mrs cat you fool answered wood  then upon my secred word of honour she has a mighty fine kitten anyhow my dear aha  they dont drown such kittens said mr wood archly and macshane taking the allusion clapped his finger to his nose in token of perfect approbation of his commanders sentiment  while the blacksmith was shoeing the horse mr wood asked him many questions concerning the lad whom he had just been chastising and succeeded beyond a doubt in establishing his identity with the child whom catherine hall had brought into the world seven years since billings told him of all the virtues of his wife and the manifold crimes of the lad how he stole and fought and lied and swore and though the youngest under his roof exercised the most baneful influence over all the rest of his family he was determined at last he said to put him to the parish for he did not dare to keep him  hes a fine whelp and would fetch ten pieces in virginny sighed the ensign  crimp of bristol would give five for him said mr wood ruminating  why not take him said the ensign  faith why not said mr wood his keep meanwhile will not be sixpence a day then turning round to the blacksmith mr billings said he you will be surprised perhaps to hear that i know everything regarding that poor lads history his mother was an unfortunate lady of high family now no more his father a german nobleman count de galgenstein by name  the very man said billings a young fairhaired man who came here with the child and a dragoon sergeant  count de galgenstein by name who on the point of death recommended the infant to me  and did he pay you seven years boarding said mr billings who was quite alive at the very idea  alas sir not a jot he died sir six hundred pounds in my debt didnt he ensign  six hundred upon my secred honour i remember when he got into the house along with the poli  psha what matters it here broke out mr wood looking fiercely at the ensign six hundred pounds he owes me how was he to pay you but he told me to take charge of this boy if i found him and found him i have and will take charge of him if you will hand him over  send our tom cried billings and when that youth appeared scowling and yet trembling and prepared as it seemed for another castigation his father to his surprise asked him if he was willing to go along with those gentlemen or whether he would be a good lad and stay with him  mr tom replied immediately i wont be a good lad and id rather go to  than stay with you  will you leave your brothers and sisters said billings looking very dismal  hang my brothers and sistersi hate em and besides i havent got any  but you had a good mother hadnt you tom  tom paused for a moment  mothers gone said he and you flog me and ill go with these men  well then go thy ways said billings starting up in a passion go thy ways for a graceless reprobate and if this gentleman will take you he may do so  after some further parley the conversation ended and the next morning mr woods party consisted of three a little boy being mounted upon the bay horse in addition to the ensign or himself and the whole company went journeying towards bristol                        we have said that mrs hayes had on a sudden taken a fit of maternal affection and was bent upon being restored to her child and that benign destiny which watched over the life of this lucky lady instantly set about gratifying her wish and without cost to herself of coachhire or saddlehorse sent the young gentleman very quickly to her arms the village in which the hayeses dwelt was but a very few miles out of the road from bristol whither on the benevolent mission above hinted at our party of worthies were bound and coming towards the afternoon in sight of the house of that very justice ballance who had been so nearly the ruin of ensign macshane that officer narrated for the hundredth time and with much glee the circumstances which had then befallen him and the manner in which mrs hayes the elder had come forward to his rescue  suppose we go and see the old girl suggested mr wood no harm can come to us now and his comrade always assenting they wound their way towards the village and reached it as the evening came on in the publichouse where they rested wood made inquiries concerning the hayes family was informed of the death of the old couple of the establishment of john hayes and his wife in their place and of the kind of life that these latter led together when all these points had been imparted to him he ruminated much an expression of sublime triumph and exultation at length lighted up his features i think tim said he at last that we can make more than five pieces of that boy  oh in coorse said timothy macshane esquire who always agreed with his meejor  in coorse you fool and how ill tell you how this hayes is well to do in the world and  and well nab him againha ha roared out macshane by my secred honour meejor there never was a gineral like you at a strathyjam  peace you bellowing donkey and dont wake the child the man is well to do his wife rules him and they have no children now either she will be very glad to have the boy back again and pay for the finding of him or else she has said nothing about him and will pay us for being silent too or at any rate hayes himself will be ashamed at finding his wife the mother of a child a year older than his marriage and will pay for the keeping of the brat away theres profit my dear in any one of the cases or my names not peter brock  when the ensign understood this wondrous argument he would fain have fallen on his knees and worshipped his friend and guide they began operations almost immediately by an attack on mrs hayes on hearing as she did in private interview with the excorporal the next morning that her son was found she was agitated by both of the passions which wood attributed to her she longed to have the boy back and would give any reasonable sum to see him but she dreaded exposure and would pay equally to avoid that how could she gain the one point and escape the other  mrs hayes hit upon an expedient which i am given to understand is not uncommon nowadays she suddenly discovered that she had a dear brother who had been obliged to fly the country in consequence of having joined the pretender and had died in france leaving behind him an only son this boy her brother had with his last breath recommended to her protection and had confided him to the charge of a brother officer who was now in the country and would speedily make his appearance and to put the story beyond a doubt mr wood wrote the letter from her brother stating all these particulars and ensign macshane received full instructions how to perform the part of the brother officer what consideration mr wood received for his services we cannot say only it is well known that mr hayes caused to be committed to gaol a young apprentice in his service charged with having broken open a cupboard in which mr hayes had forty guineas in gold and silver and to which none but he and his wife had access  having made these arrangements the corporal and his little party decamped to a short distance and mrs catherine was left to prepare her husband for a speedy addition to his family in the shape of this darling nephew john hayes received the news with anything but pleasure he had never heard of any brother of catherines she had been bred at the workhouse and nobody ever hinted that she had relatives but it is easy for a lady of moderate genius to invent circumstances and with lies tears threats coaxings oaths and other blandishments she compelled him to submit  two days afterwards as mr hayes was working in his shop with his lady seated beside him the trampling of a horse was heard in his courtyard and a gentleman of huge stature descended from it and strode into the shop his figure was wrapped in a large cloak but mr hayes could not help fancying that he had somewhere seen his face before  this i preshoom said the gentleman is misther hayes that i have come so many miles to see and this is his amiable lady i was the most intimate frind madam of your laminted brother who died in king lewiss service and whose last touching letthers i despatched to you two days ago i have with me a further precious token of my dear friend captain hallit is here  and so saying the military gentleman with one arm removed his cloak and stretching forward the other into hayess face almost stretched likewise forward a little boy grinning and sprawling in the air and prevented only from falling to the ground by the hold which the ensign kept of the waistband of his little coat and breeches  isnt he a pretty boy said mrs hayes sidling up to her husband tenderly and pressing one of mr hayess hands                        about the lads beauty it is needless to say what the carpenter thought but that night and for many many nights after the lad stayed at mr hayess    chapter viii enumerates the accomplishments of master thomas billingsintroduces brock as doctor woodand announces the execution of ensign macshane   we are obliged in recording this history to follow accurately that great authority the calendarium newgaticum roagorumque registerium of which every lover of literature in the present day knows the value and as that remarkable work totally discards all the unities in its narratives and reckons the life of its heroes only by their actions and not by periods of time we must follow in the wake of this mighty arka humble cockboat when it pauses we pause when it runs ten knots an hour we run with the same celerity and as in order to carry the reader from the penultimate chapter of this work unto the last chapter we were compelled to make him leap over a gap of seven blank years ten years more must likewise be granted to us before we are at liberty to resume our history  during that period master thomas billings had been under the especial care of his mother and as may be imagined he rather increased than diminished the accomplishments for which he had been remarkable while under the roof of his fosterfather and with this advantage that while at the blacksmiths and only three or four years of age his virtues were necessarily appreciated only in his family circle and among those few acquaintances of his own time of life whom a youth of three can be expected to meet in the alleys or over the gutters of a small country hamletin his mothers residence his circle extended with his own growth and he began to give proofs of those powers of which in infancy there had been only encouraging indications thus it was nowise remarkable that a child of four years should not know his letters and should have had a great disinclination to learn them but when a young man of fifteen showed the same creditable ignorance the same undeviating dislike it was easy to see that he possessed much resolution and perseverance when it was remarked too that in case of any difference he not only beat the usher but by no means disdained to torment and bully the very smallest boys of the school it was easy to see that his mind was comprehensive and careful as well as courageous and grasping as it was said of the duke of wellington in the peninsula that he had a thought for everybodyfrom lord hill to the smallest drummer in the armyin like manner tom billings bestowed his attention on high and low but in the shape of blows he would fight the strongest and kick the smallest and was always at work with one or the other at thirteen when he was removed from the establishment whither he had been sent he was the cock of the school out of doors and the very last boy in he used to let the little boys and newcomers pass him by and laugh but he always belaboured them unmercifully afterwards and then it was he said his turn to laugh with such a pugnacious turn tom billings ought to have been made a soldier and might have died a marshal but by an unlucky ordinance of fate he was made a tailor and died anever mind what for the present suffice it to say that he was suddenly cut off at a very early period of his existence by a disease which has exercised considerable ravages among the british youth  by consulting the authority above mentioned we find that hayes did not confine himself to the profession of a carpenter or remain long established in the country but was induced by the eager spirit of mrs catherine most probably to try his fortune in the metropolis where he lived flourished and died oxford road saint giless and tottenham court were at various periods of his residence in town inhabited by him at one place he carried on the business of greengrocer and smallcoalman in another he was carpenter undertaker and lender of money to the poor finally he was a lodginghouse keeper in the oxford or tyburn road but continued to exercise the lastnamed charitable profession  lending as he did upon pledges and carrying on a pretty large trade it was not for him of course to inquire into the pedigree of all the pieces of plate the bales of cloth swords watches wigs shoebuckles etc that were confided by his friends to his keeping but it is clear that his friends had the requisite confidence in him and that he enjoyed the esteem of a class of characters who still live in history and are admired unto this very day the mind loves to think that perhaps in mr hayess back parlour the gallant turpin might have hobandnobbed with mrs catherine that here perhaps the noble sheppard might have cracked his joke or quaffed his pint of rum who knows but that macheath and paul clifford may have crossed legs under hayess dinnertable but why pause to speculate on things that might have been why desert reality for fond imagination or call up from their honoured graves the sacred dead i know not and yet in sooth i can never pass cumberland gate without a sigh as i think of the gallant cavaliers who traversed that road in old time pious priests accompanied their triumphs their chariots were surrounded by hosts of glittering javelinmen as the slave at the car of the roman conqueror shouted remember thou art mortal before the eyes of the british warrior rode the undertaker and his coffin telling him that he too must die mark well the spot a hundred years ago albion street where comic power dwelt milesias darling sonalbion street was a desert the square of connaught was without its penultimate and strictly speaking naught the edgware road was then a road tis true with tinkling waggons passing now and then and fragrant walls of snowy hawthorn blossoms the ploughman whistled over nutford place down the green solitudes of sovereign street the merry milkmaid led the lowing kine here then in the midst of green fields and sweet airbefore ever omnibuses were and when pineapple turnpike and terrace were alike unknownhere stood tyburn and on the road towards it perhaps to enjoy the prospect stood in the year 1725 the habitation of mr john hayes  one fine morning in the year 1725 mrs hayes who had been abroad in her best hat and ridinghood mr hayes who for a wonder had accompanied her and mrs springatt a lodger who for a remuneration had the honour of sharing mrs hayess friendship and table all returned smiling and rosy at about halfpast ten oclock from a walk which they had taken to bayswater many thousands of people were likewise seen flocking down the oxford road and you would rather have thought from the smartness of their appearance and the pleasure depicted in their countenances that they were just issuing from a sermon than quitting the ceremony which they had been to attend  the fact is that they had just been to see a gentleman hangeda cheap pleasure which the hayes family never denied themselves and they returned home with a good appetite to breakfast braced by the walk and tickled into hunger as it were by the spectacle i can recollect when i was a gyp at cambridge that the men used to have breakfastparties for the very same purpose and the exhibition of the morning acted infallibly upon the stomach and caused the young students to eat with much voracity  well mrs catherine a handsome welldressed plump rosy woman of three or four and thirty and when my dear is a woman handsomer than at that age came in quite merrily from her walk and entered the backparlour which looked into a pleasant yard or garden whereon the sun was shining very gaily and where at a table covered with a nice white cloth laid out with some silver mugs too and knives all with different crests and patterns sat an old gentleman reading in an old book  here we are at last doctor said mrs hayes and heres his speech she produced the little halfpenny tract which to this day is sold at the gallowsfoot upon the death of every offender ive seen a many men turned off to be sure but i never did see one who bore it more like a man than he did  my dear said the gentleman addressed as doctor he was as cool and as brave as steel and no more minded hanging than toothdrawing  it was the drink that ruined him said mrs cat  drink and bad company i warned him my deari warned him years ago and directly he got into wilds gang i knew that he had not a year to run ah why my love will men continue such dangerous courses continued the doctor with a sigh and jeopardy their lives for a miserable watch or a snuffbox of which mr wild takes threefourths of the produce but here comes the breakfast and egad i am as hungry as a lad of twenty  indeed at this moment mrs hayess servant appeared with a smoking dish of bacon and greens and mr hayes himself ascended from the cellar of which he kept the key bearing with him a tolerably large jug of smallbeer to this repast the doctor mrs springatt the other lodger and mr and mrs hayes proceeded with great alacrity a fifth cover was laid but not used the company remarking that tom had very likely found some acquaintances at tyburn with whom he might choose to pass the morning  tom was master thomas billings now of the age of sixteen slim smart five feet ten inches in height handsome sallow in complexion blackeyed and blackhaired mr billings was apprentice to a tailor of tolerable practice who was to take him into partnership at the end of his term it was supposed and with reason that tom would not fail to make a fortune in this business of which the present head was one beinkleider a german beinkleider was skilful in his trade after the manner of his nation which in breeches and metaphysicsin inexpressibles and incomprehensiblesmay instruct all europe but too fond of his pleasure some promissory notes of his had found their way into hayess hands and had given him the means not only of providing master billings with a cheap apprenticeship and a cheap partnership afterwards but would empower him in one or two years after the young partner had joined the firm to eject the old one altogether so that there was every prospect that when mr billings was twentyone years of age poor beinkleider would have to act not as his master but his journeyman  tom was a very precocious youth was supplied by a doting mother with plenty of pocketmoney and spent it with a number of lively companions of both sexes at plays bullbaitings fairs jolly parties on the river and suchlike innocent amusements he could throw a main too as well as his elders had pinked his man in a row at madam kings in the piazza and was much respected at the roundhouse  mr hayes was not very fond of this promising young gentleman indeed he had the baseness to bear malice because in a quarrel which occurred about two years previously he hayes being desirous to chastise mr billings had found himself not only quite incompetent but actually at the mercy of the boy who struck him over the head with a jointstool felled him to the ground and swore he would have his life the doctor who was then also a lodger at mr hayess interposed and restored the combatants not to friendship but to peace hayes never afterwards attempted to lift his hand to the young man but contented himself with hating him profoundly in this sentiment mr billings participated cordially and quite unlike mr hayes who never dared to show his dislike used on every occasion when they met by actions looks words sneers and curses to let his stepfather know the opinion which he had of him why did not hayes discard the boy altogether because if he did so he was really afraid of his life and because he trembled before mrs hayes his lady as the leaf trembles before the tempest in october his breath was not his own but hers his money too had been chiefly of her gettingfor though he was as stingy and mean as mortal man can be and so likely to save much he had not the genius for getting which mrs hayes possessed she kept his books for she had learned to read and write by this time she made his bargains and she directed the operations of the poorspirited little capitalist when bills became due and debtors pressed for time then she brought hayess own professional merits into play the man was as deaf and cold as a rock never did poor tradesmen gain a penny from him never were the bailiffs delayed one single minute from their prey the beinkleider business for instance showed pretty well the genius of the two hayes was for closing with him at once but his wife saw the vast profits which might be drawn out of him and arranged the apprenticeship and the partnership before alluded to the woman heartily scorned and spit upon her husband who fawned upon her like a spaniel she loved good cheer she did not want for a certain kind of generosity the only feeling that hayes had for anyone except himself was for his wife whom he held in a cowardly awe and attachment he liked drink too which made him chirping and merry and accepted willingly any treats that his acquaintances might offer him but he would suffer agonies when his wife brought or ordered from the cellar a bottle of wine  and now for the doctor he was about seventy years of age he had been much abroad he was of a sober cheerful aspect he dressed handsomely and quietly in a broad hat and cassock but saw no company except the few friends whom he met at the coffeehouse he had an income of about one hundred pounds which he promised to leave to young billings he was amused with the lad and fond of his mother and had boarded with them for some years past the doctor in fact was our old friend corporal brock the reverend doctor wood now as he had been major wood fifteen years back  anyone who has read the former part of this history must have seen that we have spoken throughout with invariable respect of mr brock and that in every circumstance in which he has appeared he has acted not only with prudence but often with genius the early obstacle to mr brocks success was want of conduct simply drink women playhow many a brave fellow have they ruinedhad pulled brock down as often as his merit had carried him up when a mans passion for play has brought him to be a scoundrel it at once ceases to be hurtful to him in a worldly point of view he cheats and wins it is only for the idle and luxurious that women retain their fascinations to a very late period and brocks passions had been whipped out of him in virginia where much illhealth illtreatment hard labour and hard food speedily put an end to them he forgot there even how to drink rum or wine made this poor declining gentleman so ill that he could indulge in them no longer and so his three vices were cured  had he been ambitious there is little doubt but that mr brock on his return from transportation might have risen in the world but he was old and a philosopher he did not care about rising living was cheaper in those days and interest for money higher when he had amassed about six hundred pounds he purchased an annuity of seventytwo pounds and gave outwhy should he notthat he had the capital as well as the interest after leaving the hayes family in the country he found them again in london he took up his abode with them and was attached to the mother and the son do you suppose that rascals have not affections like other people hearts madamay heartsand family ties which they cherish as the doctor lived on with this charming family he began to regret that he had sunk all his money in annuities and could not as he repeatedly vowed he would leave his savings to his adopted children  he felt an indescribable pleasure suave mari magno etc in watching the storms and tempests of the hayes menage he used to encourage mrs catherine into anger when haply that ladys fits of calm would last too long he used to warm up the disputes between wife and husband mother and son and enjoy them beyond expression they served him for daily amusement and he used to laugh until the tears ran down his venerable cheeks at the accounts which young tom continually brought him of his pranks abroad among watchmen and constables at taverns or elsewhere  when therefore as the party were discussing their bacon and cabbage before which the reverend doctor with much gravity said grace master tom entered doctor wood who had before been rather gloomy immediately brightened up and made a place for billings between himself and mrs catherine  how do old cock said that young gentleman familiarly how goes it mother and so saying he seized eagerly upon the jug of beer which mr hayes had drawn and from which the latter was about to help himself and poured down his throat exactly one quart  ah said mr billings drawing breath after a draught which he had learned accurately to gauge from the habit of drinking out of pewter measures which held precisely that quantityah said mr billings drawing breath and wiping his mouth with his sleeves this is very thin stuff old squaretoes but my coppers have been redhot since last night and they wanted a sluicing  should you like some ale dear said mrs hayes that fond and judicious parent  a quart of brandy tom said doctor wood your papa will run down to the cellar for it in a minute  ill see him hanged first cried mr hayes quite frightened  oh fie now you unnatural father said the doctor  the very name of father used to put mr hayes in a fury im not his father thank heaven said he  no nor nobody elses said tom  mr hayes only muttered baseborn brat  his father was a gentlemanthats more than you ever were screamed mrs hayes his father was a man of spirit no cowardly sneak of a carpenter mr hayes tom has noble blood in his veins for all he has a tailors appearance and if his mother had had her right she would be now in a coachandsix  i wish i could find my father said tom for i think polly briggs and i would look mighty well in a coachandsix tom fancied that if his father was a count at the time of his birth he must be a prince now and indeed went among his companions by the latter august title  ay tom that you would cried his mother looking at him fondly  with a sword by my side and a hat and feather theres never a lord at st jamess would cut a finer figure  after a little more of this talk in which mrs hayes let the company know her high opinion of her sonwho as usual took care to show his extreme contempt for his stepfatherthe latter retired to his occupations the lodger mrs springatt who had never said a word all this time retired to her apartment on the second floor and pulling out their pipes and tobacco the old gentleman and the young one solaced themselves with halfanhours more talk and smoking while the thrifty mrs hayes opposite to them was busy with her books  whats in the confessions said mr billings to doctor wood there were six of em besides mac two for sheep four housebreakers but nothing of consequence i fancy  theres the paper said wood archly read for yourself tom  mr tom looked at the same time very fierce and very foolish for though he could drink swear and fight as well as any lad of his inches in england reading was not among his accomplishments i tell you what doctor said he  you have no bantering with mefor im not the man that will bear it  me and he threw a tremendous swaggering look across the table  i want you to learn to read tommy dear look at your mother there over her books she keeps them as neat as a scrivener now and at twenty she could make never a stroke  your godfather speaks for your good child and for me thou knowest that i have promised thee a goldheaded cane and periwig on the first day that thou canst read me a column of the flying post  hang the periwig said mr tom testily let my godfather read the paper himself if he has a liking for it  whereupon the old gentleman put on his spectacles and glanced over the sheet of whitybrown paper which ornamented with a picture of a gallows at the top contained the biographies of the seven unlucky individuals who had that morning suffered the penalty of the law with the six heroes who came first in the list we have nothing to do but have before us a copy of the paper containing the life of no 7 and which the doctor read in an audible voice                       captain macshane  the seventh victim to his own crimes was the famous highwayman captain macshane so well known as the irish fireeater  the captain came to the ground in a fine white lawn shirt and nightcap and being a papist in his religion was attended by father oflaherty popish priest and chaplain to the bavarian envoy  captain macshane was born of respectable parents in the town of clonakilty in ireland being descended from most of the kings in that country he had the honour of serving their majesties king william and queen mary and her majesty queen anne in flanders and spain and obtained much credit from my lords marlborough and peterborough for his valour  but being placed on halfpay at the end of the war ensign macshane took to evil courses and frequenting the bagnios and dicehouses was speedily brought to ruin  being at this pass he fell in with the notorious captain wood and they two together committed many atrocious robberies in the inland counties but these being too hot to hold them they went into the west where they were unknown here however the day of retribution arrived for having stolen three pewterpots from a publichouse they under false names were tried at exeter and transported for seven years beyond the sea thus it is seen that justice never sleeps but sooner or latter is sure to overtake the criminal  on their return from virginia a quarrel about booty arose between these two and macshane killed wood in a combat that took place between them near to the town of bristol but a waggon coming up macshane was obliged to fly without the illgotten wealth so true is it that wickedness never prospers  two days afterwards macshane met the coach of miss macraw a scotch lady and heiress going for lumbago and gout to the bath he at first would have robbed this lady but such were his arts that he induced her to marry him and they lived together for seven years in the town of eddenboro in scotlandhe passing under the name of colonel geraldine the lady dying and macshane having expended all her wealth he was obliged to resume his former evil courses in order to save himself from starvation whereupon he robbed a scotch lord by name the lord of whistlebinkie of a mull of snuff for which crime he was condemned to the tolbooth prison at eddenboro in scotland and whipped many times in publick  these deserved punishments did not at all alter captain macshanes disposition and on the 17th of february last he stopped the bavarian envoys coach on blackheath coming from dover and robbed his excellency and his chaplain taking from the former his money watches star a furcloak his sword a very valuable one and from the latter a romish missal out of which he was then reading and a casebottle  the bavarian envoy said tom parenthetically my master beinkleider was his lordships regimental tailor in germany and is now making a court suit for him it will be a matter of a hundred pounds to him i warrant  doctor wood resumed his reading humhum a romish missal out of which he was reading and a casebottle  by means of the famous mr wild this notorious criminal was brought to justice and the casebottle and missal have been restored to father oflaherty  during his confinement in newgate mr macshane could not be brought to express any contrition for his crimes except that of having killed his commanding officer for this wood he pretended an excessive sorrow and vowed that usquebaugh had been the cause of his deathindeed in prison he partook of no other liquor and drunk a bottle of it on the day before his death  he was visited by several of the clergy and gentry in his cell among others by the popish priest whom he had robbed father oflaherty before mentioned who attended him likewise in his last moments if that idolatrous worship may be called attention and likewise by the fathers patron the bavarian ambassador his excellency count maximilian de galgenstein  as old wood came to these words he paused to give them utterance  what max screamed mrs hayes letting her inkbottle fall over her ledgers  why be hanged if it bent my father said mr billings  your father sure enough unless there be others of his name and unless the scoundrel is hanged said the doctorsinking his voice however at the end of the sentence  mr billings broke his pipe in an agony of joy i think well have the coach now mother says he and im blessed if polly briggs shall not look as fine as a duchess  polly briggs is a low slut tom and not fit for the likes of you his excellencys son oh fie you must be a gentleman now sirrah and i doubt whether i shant take you away from that odious tailors shop altogether  to this proposition mr billings objected altogether for besides mrs briggs before alluded to the young gentleman was much attached to his masters daughter mrs margaret gretel or gretchen beinkleider  no says he there will be time to think of that hereafter maam if my pa makes a man of me why of course the shop may go to the deuce for what i care but we had better wait look you for something certain before we give up such a pretty bird in the hand as this  he speaks like solomon said the doctor  i always said he would be a credit to his old mother didnt i brock cried mrs cat embracing her son very affectionately a credit to her ay i warrant a real blessing and dost thou want any money tom for a lords son must not go about without a few pieces in his pocket and i tell thee tommy thou must go and see his lordship and thou shalt have a piece of brocade for a waistcoat thou shalt ay and the silverhilted sword i told thee of but oh tommy tommy have a care and dont be adrawing of it in naughty company at the gaminghouses or at the  a drawing of fiddlesticks mother if i go to see my father i must have a reason for it and instead of going with a sword in my hand i shall take something else in it  the lad is a lad of nous cried doctor wood although his mother does spoil him so cruelly look you madam cat did you not hear what he said about beinkleider and the clothes tommy will just wait on the count with his lordships breeches a man may learn a deal of news in the trying on of a pair of breeches  and so it was agreed that in this manner the son should at first make his appearance before his father mrs cat gave him the piece of brocade which in the course of the day was fashioned into a smart waistcoat for beinkleiders shop was close by in cavendish square mrs gretel with many blushes tied a fine blue riband round his neck and in a pair of silk stockings with gold buckles to his shoes master billings looked a very proper young gentleman  and tommy said his mother blushing and hesitating should maxshould his lordship ask after yourwant to know if your mother is alive you can say she is and well and often talks of old times and tommy after another pause you neednt say anything about mr hayes only say im quite well  mrs hayes looked at him as he marched down the street a long long way tom was proud and gay in his new costume and was not unlike his father as she looked lo oxford street disappeared and she saw a green common and a village and a little inn there was a soldier leading a pair of horses about on the green common and in the inn sat a cavalier so young so merry so beautiful oh what slim white hands he had and winning words and tender gentle blue eyes was it not an honour to a country lass that such a noble gentleman should look at her for a moment had he not some charm about him that she must needs obey when he whispered in her ear come follow me as she walked towards the lane that morning how well she remembered each spot as she passed it and the look it wore for the last time how the smoke was rising from the pastures how the fish were jumping and plashing in the millstream there was the church with all its windows lighted up with gold and yonder were the reapers sweeping down the brown corn she tried to sing as she went up the hillwhat was it she could not remember but oh how well she remembered the sound of the horses hoofs as they came quicker quickernearer nearer how noble he looked on his great horse was he thinking of her or were they all silly words which he spoke last night merely to pass away the time and deceive poor girls with would he remember themwould he  cat my dear here cried mr brock alias captain alias doctor wood heres the meat agetting cold and i am longing for my breakfast  as they went in he looked her hard in the face what still at it you silly girl ive been watching you these five minutes cat and be hanged but i think a word from galgenstein and you would follow him as a fly does a treaclepot  they went in to breakfast but though there was a hot shoulder of mutton and onionsaucemrs catherines favourite dishshe never touched a morsel of it  in the meanwhile mr thomas billings in his new clothes which his mamma had given him in his new riband which the fair miss beinkleider had tied round his neck and having his excellencys breeches wrapped in a silk handkerchief in his right hand turned down in the direction of whitehall where the bavarian envoy lodged but before he waited on him mr billings being excessively pleased with his personal appearance made an early visit to mrs briggs who lived in the neighbourhood of swallow street and who after expressing herself with much enthusiasm regarding her tommys good looks immediately asked him what he would stand to drink raspberry gin being suggested a pint of that liquor was sent for and so great was the confidence and intimacy subsisting between these two young people that the reader will be glad to hear that mrs polly accepted every shilling of the money which tom billings had received from his mamma the day before nay could with difficulty be prevented from seizing upon the cutvelvet breeches which he was carrying to the nobleman for whom they were made having paid his adieux to mrs polly mr billings departed to visit his father    chapter ix interview between count galgenstein and master thomas billings when he informs the count of his parentage   i dont know in all this miserable world a more miserable spectacle than that of a young fellow of five or six and forty the british army that nursery of valour turns out many of the young fellows i mean who having flaunted in dragoon uniforms from seventeen to sixandthirty having bought sold or swapped during that period some two hundred horses having played say fifteen thousand games at billiards having drunk some six thousand bottles of wine having consumed a reasonable number of nugee coats split many dozen pairs of highheeled hoby boots and read the newspaper and the armylist duly retire from the service when they have attained their eighth lustre and saunter through the world trailing from london to cheltenham and from boulogne to paris and from paris to baden their idleness their illhealth and their ennui in the morning of youth and when seen along with whole troops of their companions these flowers look gaudy and brilliant enough but there is no object more dismal than one of them alone and in its autumnal or seedy state my friend captain popjoy is one who has arrived at this condition and whom everybody knows by his title of father pop a kinder simpler more emptyheaded fellow does not exist he is fortyseven years old and appears a young goodlooking man of sixty at the time of the army of occupation he really was as goodlooking a man as any in the dragoons he now uses all sorts of stratagems to cover the bald place on his head by combing certain thin grey sidelocks over it he has in revenge a pair of enormous moustaches which he dyes of the richest blueblack his nose is a good deal larger and redder than it used to be his eyelids have grown flat and heavy and a little pair of red watery eyeballs float in the midst of them it seems as if the light which was once in those sickly green pupils had extravasated into the white part of the eye if pops legs are not so firm and muscular as they used to be in those days when he took such leaps into whites buckskins in revenge his waist is much larger he wears a very good coat however and a waistband which he lets out after dinner before ladies he blushes and is as silent as a schoolboy he calls them modest women his society is chiefly among young lads belonging to his former profession he knows the best wine to be had at each tavern or cafe and the waiters treat him with much respectful familiarity he knows the names of every one of them and shouts out send markwell here or tell cuttriss to give us a bottle of the yellow seal or dizzy voo monsure borrel noo donny shampang frappy etc he always makes the salad or the punch and dines out three hundred days in the year the other days you see him in a twofranc eatinghouse at paris or prowling about rupert street or st martins court where you get a capital cut of meat for eightpence he has decent lodgings and scrupulously clean linen his animal functions are still tolerably well preserved his spiritual have evaporated long since he sleeps well has no conscience believes himself to be a respectable fellow and is tolerably happy on the days when he is asked out to dinner  poor pop is not very high in the scale of created beings but if you fancy there is none lower you are in egregious error there was once a man who had a mysterious exhibition of an animal quite unknown to naturalists called the wusser those curious individuals who desired to see the wusser were introduced into an apartment where appeared before them nothing more than a little lean shrivelled hideous bleareyed mangy pig everyone cried out swindle and shame patience gentlemen be heasy said the showman look at that there hanimal its a perfect phenomaly of hugliness i engage you never see such a pig nobody ever had seen now gentlemen said he ill keep my promise has per bill and bad as that there pig is look at this here he showed another look at this here and youll see at once that its a wusser in like manner the popjoy breed is bad enough but it serves only to show off the galgenstein race which is wusser  galgenstein had led a very gay life as the saying is for the last fifteen years such a gay one that he had lost all capacity of enjoyment by this time and only possessed inclinations without powers of gratifying them he had grown to be exquisitely curious and fastidious about meat and drink for instance and all that he wanted was an appetite he carried about with him a french cook who could not make him eat a doctor who could not make him well a mistress of whom he was heartily sick after two days a priest who had been a favourite of the exemplary dubois and by turns used to tickle him by the imposition of penance or by the repetition of a tale from the recueil of noce or la fare all his appetites were wasted and worn only some monstrosity would galvanise them into momentary action he was in that effete state to which many noblemen of his time had arrived who were ready to believe in ghostraising or in goldmaking or to retire into monasteries and wear hairshirts or to dabble in conspiracies or to die in love with little cookmaids of fifteen or to pine for the smiles or at the frowns of a prince of the blood or to go mad at the refusal of a chamberlains key the last gratification he remembered to have enjoyed was that of riding bareheaded in a soaking rain for three hours by the side of his grand dukes mistresss coach taking the pas of count krahwinkel who challenged him and was run through the body for this very dispute galgenstein gained a rheumatic gout by it which put him to tortures for many months and was further gratified with the post of english envoy he had a fortune he asked no salary and could look the envoy very well father oflaherty did all the duties and furthermore acted as a spy over the ambassadora sinecure post for the man had no feelings wishes or opinionsabsolutely none  upon my life father said this worthy man i care for nothing you have been talking for an hour about the regents death and the duchess of phalaris and sly old fleury and what not and i care just as much as if you told me that one of my bauers at galgenstein had killed a pig or as if my lacquey la rose yonder had made love to my mistress  he does said the reverend gentleman  ah monsieur labbe said la rose who was arranging his masters enormous court periwig you are helas wrong monsieur le comte will not be angry at my saying that i wish the accusation were true  the count did not take the slightest notice of la roses wit but continued his own complaints  i tell you abbe i care for nothing i lost a thousand guineas tother night at basset i wish to my heart i could have been vexed about it egad i remember the day when to lose a hundred made me half mad for a month well next day i had my revenge at dice and threw thirteen mains there was some delay a call for fresh bones i think and would you believe iti fell asleep with the box in my hand  a desperate case indeed said the abbe  if it had not been for krahwinkel i should have been a dead man thats positive that pinking him saved me  i make no doubt of it said the abbe had your excellency not run him through he without a doubt would have done the same for you  psha you mistake my words monsieur labbe yawning i meanwhat cursed chocolatethat i was dying for want of excitement not that i cared for dying no d me if i do  when you do your excellency means said the abbe a fat greyhaired irishman from the irlandois college at paris  his excellency did not laugh nor understand jokes of any kind he was of an undeviating stupidity and only replied sir i mean what i say i dont care for living no nor for dying either but i can speak as well as another and ill thank you not to be correcting my phrases as if i were one of your cursed schoolboys and not a gentleman of fortune and blood  herewith the count who had uttered four sentences about himself he never spoke of anything else sunk back on his pillows again quite exhausted by his eloquence the abbe who had a seat and a table by the bedside resumed the labours which had brought him into the room in the morning and busied himself with papers which occasionally he handed over to his superior for approval  presently monsieur la rose appeared  here is a person with clothes from mr beinkleiders will your excellency see him or shall i bid him leave the clothes  the count was very much fatigued by this time he had signed three papers and read the first halfadozen lines of a pair of them  bid the fellow come in la rose and hark ye give me my wig one must show ones self to be a gentleman before these scoundrels and he therefore mounted a large chestnutcoloured orangescented pyramid of horsehair which was to awe the newcomer  he was a lad of about seventeen in a smart waistcoat and a blue riband our friend tom billings indeed he carried under his arm the counts destined breeches he did not seem in the least awed however by his excellencys appearance but looked at him with a great degree of curiosity and boldness in the same manner he surveyed the chaplain and then nodded to him with a kind look of recognition  where have i seen the lad said the father oh i have it my good friend you were at the hanging yesterday i think  mr billings gave a very significant nod with his head i never miss said he  what a young turk and pray sir do you go for pleasure or for business  business what do you mean by business  oh i did not know whether you might be brought up to the trade or your relations be undergoing the operation  my relations said mr billings proudly and staring the count full in the face was not made for no such thing im a tailor now but im a gentlemans son as good a man ay as his lordship there for you ant his lordshipyoure the popish priest you are and we were very near giving you a touch of a few protestant stones master  the count began to be a little amused he was pleased to see the abbe look alarmed or even foolish  egad abbe said he you turn as white as a sheet  i dont fancy being murdered my lord said the abbe hastily and murdered for a good work it was but to be useful to yonder poor irishman who saved me as a prisoner in flanders when marlborough would have hung me up like poor macshane himself was yesterday  ah said the count bursting out with some energy i was thinking who the fellow could be ever since he robbed me on the heath i recollect the scoundrel now he was a second in a duel i had here in the year six  along with major wood behind montague house said mr billings ive heard on it and here he looked more knowing than ever  you cried the count more and more surprised and pray who the devil are you  my names billings  billings said the count  i come out of warwickshire said mr billings  indeed  i was born at birmingham town  were you really  my mothers name was hayes continued billings in a solemn voice i was put out to a nurse along with john billings a blacksmith and my father run away now do you know who i am  why upon honour now said the count who was amusedupon honour mr billings i have not that advantage  well then my lord youre my father  mr billings when he said this came forward to the count with a theatrical air and flinging down the breeches of which he was the bearer held out his arms and stared having very little doubt but that his lordship would forthwith spring out of bed and hug him to his heart a similar piece of naivete many fathers of families have i have no doubt remarked in their children who not caring for their parents a single doit conceive nevertheless that the latter are bound to show all sorts of affection for them his lordship did move but backwards towards the wall and began pulling at the bellrope with an expression of the most intense alarm  keep back sirrahkeep back suppose i am your father do you want to murder me good heavens how the boy smells of gin and tobacco dont turn away my lad sit down there at a proper distance and la rose give him some eaudecologne and get a cup of coffee well now go on with your story egad my dear abbe i think it is very likely that what the lad says is true  if it is a family conversation said the abbe i had better leave you  oh for heavens sake no i could not stand the boy alone now mister ahwhatsyourname have the goodness to tell your story  mr billings was woefully disconcerted for his mother and he had agreed that as soon as his father saw him he would be recognised at once and mayhap made heir to the estates and title in which being disappointed he very sulkily went on with his narrative and detailed many of those events with which the reader has already been made acquainted the count asked the boys mothers christian name and being told it his memory at once returned to him  what are you little cats son said his excellency by heavens mon cher abbe a charming creature but a tigresspositively a tigress i recollect the whole affair now shes a little fresh blackhaired woman ant she with a sharp nose and thick eyebrows ay ah yes yes went on my lord i recollect her i recollect her it was at birmingham i first met her she was my lady trippets woman wasnt she  she was no such thing said mr billings hotly her aunt kept the bugle inn on waltham green and your lordship seduced her  seduced her oh gad so i did stap me now i did yes i made her jump on my black horse and bore her off likelike aeneas bore his wife away from the siege of rome hey labbe  the events were precisely similar said the abbe it is wonderful what a memory you have  i was always remarkable for it continued his excellency well where was iat the black horse yes at the black horse well i mounted her on the black horse and rode her en croupe egadha hato birmingham and there we billed and cooed together like a pair of turtledoves yeshathat we did  and this i suppose is the end of some of the billings said the abbe pointing to mr tom  billings what do you mean yesohaha pun a calembourg fi donc m labbe and then after the wont of very stupid people m de galgenstein went on to explain to the abbe his own pun well but to proceed cries he we lived together at birmingham and i was going to be married to a rich heiress egad when what do you think this little cat does she murders me egad and makes me manquer the marriage twenty thousand i think it was and i wanted the money in those days now wasnt she an abominable monster that mother of yours hey mr awhatsyourname  she served you right said mr billings with a great oath starting up out of all patience  fellow said his excellency quite aghast do you know to whom you speakto a nobleman of seventyeight descents a count of the holy roman empire a representative of a sovereign ha egad dont stamp fellow if you hope for my protection  dn your protection said mr billings in a fury curse you and your protection too im a freeborn briton and no  french papist and any man who insults my motheray or calls me fellerhad better look to himself and the two eyes in his head i can tell him and with this mr billings put himself into the most approved attitude of the cockpit and invited his father the reverend gentleman and monsieur la rose the valet to engage with him in a pugilistic encounter the two latter the abbe especially seemed dreadfully frightened but the count now looked on with much interest and giving utterance to a feeble kind of chuckle which lasted for about half a minute said  paws off pompey you young hangdog youegad yes aha pon honour youre a lad of spirit some of your fathers spunk in you hey i know him by that oath why sir when i was sixteen i used to swearto swear egad like a thames waterman and exactly in this fellows way buss me my lad no kiss my hand that will doand he held out a very lean yellow hand peering from a pair of yellow ruffles it shook very much and the shaking made all the rings upon it shine only the more  well says mr billings if you wasnt agoing to abuse me nor mother i dont care if i shake hands with you i aint proud  the abbe laughed with great glee and that very evening sent off to his court a most ludicrous spicy description of the whole scene of meeting between this amiable father and child in which he said that young billings was the eleve favori of m kitch ecuyer le bourreau de londres and which made the dukes mistress laugh so much that she vowed that the abbe should have a bishopric on his return for with such store of wisdom look you my son was the world governed in those days  the count and his offspring meanwhile conversed with some cordiality the former informed the latter of all the diseases to which he was subject his manner of curing them his great consideration as chamberlain to the duke of bavaria how he wore his court suits and of a particular powder which he had invented for the hair how when he was seventeen he had run away with a canoness egad who was afterwards locked up in a convent and grew to be sixteen stone in weight how he remembered the time when ladies did not wear patches and how the duchess of marlborough boxed his ears when he was so high because he wanted to kiss her  all these important anecdotes took some time in the telling and were accompanied by many profound moral remarks such as i cant abide garlic nor whitewine stap me nor sauerkraut though his highness eats half a bushel per day i ate it the first time at court but when they brought it me a second time i refusedrefused split me and grill me if i didnt everybody stared his highness looked as fierce as a turk and that infernal krahwinkel my dear i did for him afterwardsthat cursed krahwinkel i say looked as pleased as possible and whispered to countess fritsch blitzchen frau grafinn says he its all over with galgenstein what did i do i had the entree and demanded it altesse says i falling on one knee i ate no kraut at dinner today you remarked it i saw your highness remark it  i did m le comte said his highness gravely  i had almost tears in my eyes but it was necessary to come to a resolution you know sir said i i speak with deep grief to your highness who are my benefactor my friend my father but of this i am resolved i will never eat sauerkraut more it dont agree with me after being laid up for four weeks by the last dish of sauerkraut of which i partook i may say with confidenceit dont agree with me by impairing my health it impairs my intellect and weakens my strength and both i would keep for your highnesss service  tut tut said his highness tut tut tut those were his very words  give me my sword or my pen said i give me my sword or my pen and with these maximilian de galgenstein is ready to serve you but suresure a great prince will pity the weak health of a faithful subject who does not know how to eat sauerkraut his highness was walking about the room i was still on my knees and stretched forward my hand to seize his coat  geht zum teufel sir said he in a loud voice it means go to the deuce my deargeht zum teufel and eat what you like with this he went out of the room abruptly leaving in my hand one of his buttons which i keep to this day as soon as i was alone amazed by his great goodness and bounty i sobbed aloudcried like a child the counts eyes filled and winked at the very recollection and when i went back into the cardroom stepping up to krahwinkel count says i who looks foolish nowhey there la rose give me the diamondyes that was the very pun i made and very good it was thought krahwinkel says i who looks foolish now and from that day to this i was never at a courtday asked to eat sauerkrautnever  hey there la rose bring me that diamond snuffbox in the drawer of my secretaire and the snuffbox was brought look at it my dear said the count for i saw you seemed to doubt there is the buttonthe very one that came off his graces coat  mr billings received it and twisted it about with a stupid air the story had quite mystified him for he did not dare yet to think his father was a foolhis respect for the aristocracy prevented him  when the counts communications had ceased which they did as soon as the story of the sauerkraut was finished a silence of some minutes ensued mr billings was trying to comprehend the circumstances above narrated his lordship was exhausted the chaplain had quitted the room directly the word sauerkraut was mentionedhe knew what was coming his lordship looked for some time at his son who returned the gaze with his mouth wide open well said the countwell sir what are you sitting there for if you have nothing to say sir you had better go i had you here to amuse mesplit meand not to sit there staring  mr billings rose in a fury  hark ye my lad said the count tell la rose to give thee five guineas and ahcome again some morning a nice wellgrown young lad mused the count as master tommy walked wondering out of the apartment a pretty fellow enough and intelligent too  well he is an odd fellow my father thought mr billings as he walked out having received the sum offered to him and he immediately went to call upon his friend polly briggs from whom he had separated in the morning  what was the result of their interview is not at all necessary to the progress of this history having made her however acquainted with the particulars of his visit to his father he went to his mothers and related to her all that had occurred  poor thing she was very differently interested in the issue of it    chapter x showing how galgenstein and mrs cat recognise each other in marylebone gardensand how the count drives her home in his carriage   about a month after the touching conversation above related there was given at marylebone gardens a grand concert and entertainment at which the celebrated madame amenaide a dancer of the theatre at paris was to perform under the patronage of several english and foreign noblemen among whom was his excellency the bavarian envoy madame amenaide was in fact no other than the maitresse en titre of the monsieur de galgenstein who had her a great bargain from the duke de rohanchabot at paris  it is not our purpose to make a great and learned display here otherwise the costumes of the company assembled at this fete might afford scope for at least halfadozen pages of fine writing and we might give if need were specimens of the very songs and music sung on the occasion does not the burney collection of music at the british museum afford one an ample store of songs from which to choose are there not the memoirs of colley cibber those of mrs clark the daughter of colley is there not congreve and farquharnay and at a pinch the dramatic biography or even the spectator from which the observant genius might borrow passages and construct pretty antiquarian figments leave we these trifles to meaner souls our business is not with the breeches and periwigs with the hoops and patches but with the divine hearts of men and the passions which agitate them what need therefore have we to say that on this evening after the dancing the music and the fireworks monsieur de galgenstein felt the strange and welcome pangs of appetite and was picking a cold chicken along with some other friends in an arboura cold chicken with an accompaniment of a bottle of champagnewhen he was led to remark that a very handsome plump little person in a gorgeous stiff damask gown and petticoat was sauntering up and down the walk running opposite his suppingplace and bestowing continual glances towards his excellency the lady whoever she was was in a mask such as ladies of high and low fashion wore at public places in those days and had a male companion he was a lad of only seventeen marvellously well dressedindeed no other than the counts own son mr thomas billings who had at length received from his mother the silverhilted sword and the wig which that affectionate parent had promised to him  in the course of the month which had elapsed since the interview that has been described in the former chapter mr billings had several times had occasion to wait on his father but though he had according to her wishes frequently alluded to the existence of his mother the count had never at any time expressed the slightest wish to renew his acquaintance with that lady who if she had seen him had only seen him by stealth  the fact is that after billings had related to her the particulars of his first meeting with his excellency which ended like many of the latter visits in nothing at all mrs hayes had found some pressing business which continually took her to whitehall and had been prowling from day to day about monsieur de galgensteins lodgings four or five times in the week as his excellency stepped into his coach he might have remarked had he chosen a woman in a black hood who was looking most eagerly into his eyes but those eyes had long since left off the practice of observing and madam catherines visits had so far gone for nothing  on this night however inspired by gaiety and drink the count had been amazingly stricken by the gait and ogling of the lady in the mask the reverend oflaherty who was with him and had observed the figure in the black cloak recognised or thought he recognised her it is the woman who dogs your excellency every day said he she is with that tailor lad who loves to see people hangedyour excellencys son i mean and he was just about to warn the count of a conspiracy evidently made against him and that the son had brought most likely the mother to play her arts upon himhe was just about i say to show to the count the folly and danger of renewing an old liaison with a woman such as he had described mrs cat to be when his excellency starting up and interrupting his ghostly adviser at the very beginning of his sentence said egad labbe you are rightit is my son and a mighty smartlooking creature with him hey mr whatsyournametom you rogue dont you know your own father and so saying and cocking his beaver on one side monsieur de galgenstein strutted jauntily after mr billings and the lady  it was the first time that the count had formally recognised his son  tom you rogue stopped at this and the count came up he had a white velvet suit covered over with stars and orders a neat modest wig and bag and peachcoloured silkstockings with silver clasps the lady in the mask gave a start as his excellency came forward law mother dont squeege so said tom the poor woman was trembling in every limb but she had presence of mind to squeege tom a great deal harder and the latter took the hint i suppose and was silent  the splendid count came up ye gods how his embroidery glittered in the lamps what a royal exhalation of musk and bergamot came from his wig his handkerchief and his grand lace ruffles and frills a broad yellow riband passed across his breast and ended at his hip in a shining diamond crossa diamond cross and a diamond swordhilt was anything ever seen so beautiful and might not a poor woman tremble when such a noble creature drew near to her and deigned from the height of his rank and splendour to look down upon her as jove came down to semele in state in his habits of ceremony with all the grand cordons of his orders blazing about his imperial personthus dazzling magnificent triumphant the great galgenstein descended towards mrs catherine her cheeks glowed redhot under her coy velvet mask her heart thumped against the whalebone prison of her stays what a delicious storm of vanity was raging in her bosom what a rush of longpent recollections burst forth at the sound of that enchanting voice  as you wind up a hundredguinea chronometer with a twopenny watchkeyas by means of a dirty wooden plug you set all the waters of versailles araging and splashing and stormingin like manner and by like humble agents were mrs catherines tumultuous passions set going the count we have said slipped up to his son and merely saying how do tom cut the young gentleman altogether and passing round to the ladys side said madam tis a charming eveningegad it is she almost fainted it was the old voice there he was after seventeen years once more at her side  now i know what i could have done i can turn out a quotation from sophocles by looking to the index as well as another i can throw off a bit of fine writing too with passion similes and a moral at the end what pray is the last sentence but one but the very finest writing suppose for example i had made maximilian as he stood by the side of catherine look up towards the clouds and exclaim in the words of the voluptuous cornelius nepos       aenaoi nephelai      arthoomen phanerai       droseran phusin euageetoi ktl         anglicised version of the authors original greek text  or suppose again i had said in a style still more popular  the count advanced towards the maiden they both were mute for a while and only the beating of her heart interrupted that thrilling and passionate silence ah what years of buried joys and fears hopes and disappointments arose from their graves in the far past and in those brief moments flitted before the united ones how sad was that delicious retrospect and oh how sweet the tears that rolled down the cheek of each were bubbles from the choked and mossgrown wells of youth the sigh that heaved each bosom had some lurking odours in itmemories of the fragrance of boyhood echoes of the hymns of the young heart thus is it everfor these blessed recollections the soul always has a place and while crime perishes and sorrow is forgotten the beautiful alone is eternal  o golden legends written in the skies mused de galgenstein ye shine as ye did in the olden days we change but ye speak ever the same language gazing in your abysmal depths the feeble ratioci                               there now are six columns of the best writing to be found in this or any other book galgenstein has quoted euripides thrice plato once lycophron nine times besides extracts from the latin syntax and the minor greek poets catherines passionate embreathings are of the most fashionable order and i call upon the ingenious critic of the x newspaper to say whether they do not possess the real impress of the giants of the olden timethe real platonic smack in a word not that i want in the least to show off but it is as well every now and then to show the public what one can do        there were six columns as mentioned by the accurate mr      solomons but we have withdrawn two pages and three      quarters because although our correspondent has been      excessively eloquent according to custom we were anxious      to come to the facts of the story       mr solomons by sending to our office may have the      cancelled passagesoy  instead however of all this rant and nonsense how much finer is the speech that the count really did make it is a very fine eveningegad it is the egad did the whole business mrs cat was as much in love with him now as ever she had been and gathering up all her energies she said it is dreadful hot too i think and with this she made a curtsey  stifling split me added his excellency what do you say madam to a rest in an arbour and a drink of something cool  sir said the lady drawing back  oh a drinka drink by all means exclaimed mr billings who was troubled with a perpetual thirst come mo mrs jones i mean youre fond of a glass of cold punch you know and the rum here is prime i can tell you  the lady in the mask consented with some difficulty to the proposal of mr billings and was led by the two gentlemen into an arbour where she was seated between them and some waxcandles being lighted punch was brought  she drank one or two glasses very eagerly and so did her two companions although it was evident to see from the flushed looks of both of them that they had little need of any such stimulus the count in the midst of his champagne it must be said had been amazingly stricken and scandalised by the appearance of such a youth as billings in a public place with a lady under his arm he was the reader will therefore understand in the moral stage of liquor and when he issued out it was not merely with the intention of examining mr billingss female companion but of administering to him some sound correction for venturing at his early period of life to form any such acquaintances on joining billings his excellencys first step was naturally to examine the lady after they had been sitting for a while over their punch he bethought him of his original purpose and began to address a number of moral remarks to his son  we have already given some specimens of monsieur de galgensteins sober conversation and it is hardly necessary to trouble the reader with any further reports of his speeches they were intolerably stupid and dull as egotistical as his morning lecture had been and a hundred times more rambling and prosy if cat had been in the possession of her sober senses she would have seen in five minutes that her ancient lover was a ninny and have left him with scorn but she was under the charm of old recollections and the sound of that silly voice was to her magical as for mr billings he allowed his excellency to continue his prattle only frowning yawning cursing occasionally but drinking continually  so the count descanted at length upon the enormity of young billingss early liaisons and then he told his own in the year four with a burgomasters daughter at ratisbon when he was in the elector of bavarias servicethen after blenheim when he had come over to the duke of marlborough when a physicians wife at bonn poisoned herself for him etc etc of a piece with the story of the canoness which has been recorded before all the tales were true a clever ugly man every now and then is successful with the ladies but a handsome fool is irresistible mrs cat listened and listened good heavens she had heard all these tales before and recollected the place and the timehow she was hemming a handkerchief for max who came round and kissed her vowing that the physicians wife was nothing compared to herhow he was tired and lying on the sofa just come home from shooting how handsome he looked cat thought he was only the handsomer now and looked more grave and thoughtful the dear fellow  the garden was filled with a vast deal of company of all kinds and parties were passing every moment before the arbour where our trio sat about halfanhour after his excellency had quitted his own box and party the rev mr oflaherty came discreetly round to examine the proceedings of his diplomatical chef the lady in the mask was listening with all her might mr billings was drawing figures on the table with punch and the count talking incessantly the father confessor listened for a moment and then with something resembling an oath walked away to the entry of the gardens where his excellencys gilt coach with three footmen was waiting to carry him back to london get me a chair joseph said his reverence who infinitely preferred a seat gratis in the coach that fool muttered he will not move for this hour the reverend gentleman knew that when the count was on the subject of the physicians wife his discourses were intolerably long and took upon himself therefore to disappear along with the rest of the counts party who procured other conveyances and returned to their homes  after this quiet shadow had passed before the counts box many groups of persons passed and repassed and among them was no other than mrs polly briggs to whom we have been already introduced mrs polly was in company with one or two other ladies and leaning on the arm of a gentleman with large shoulders and calves a fierce cock to his hat and a shabby genteel air his name was mr moffat and his present occupation was that of doorkeeper at a gamblinghouse in covent garden where though he saw many thousands pass daily under his eyes his own salary amounted to no more than fourandsixpence weeklya sum quite insufficient to maintain him in the rank which he held  mr moffat had however received some fundsamounting indeed to a matter of twelve guineaswithin the last month and was treating mrs briggs very generously to the concert it may be as well to say that every one of the twelve guineas had come out of mrs pollys own pocket who in return had received them from mr billings and as the reader may remember that on the day of tommys first interview with his father he had previously paid a visit to mrs briggs having under his arm a pair of breeches which mrs briggs covetedhe should now be informed that she desired these breeches not for pincushions but for mr moffat who had long been in want of a pair  having thus episodically narrated mr moffats history let us state that he his lady and their friends passed before the counts arbour joining in a melodious chorus to a song which one of the society an actor of bettertons was singing       tis my will when im dead that no tear shall be shed         no hic jacet be graved on my stone       but pour oer my ashes a bottle of red         and say a good fellow is gone             my brave boys         and say a good fellow is gone  my brave boys was given with vast emphasis by the party mr moffat growling it in a rich bass and mrs briggs in a soaring treble as to the notes when quavering up to the skies they excited various emotions among the people in the gardens silence them blackguards shouted a barber who was taking a pint of small beer along with his lady stop that there infernal screeching said a couple of ladies who were sipping ratafia in company with two pretty fellows  dang it its polly said mr tom billings bolting out of the box and rushing towards the sweetvoiced mrs briggs when he reached her which he did quickly and made his arrival known by tipping mrs briggs slightly on the waist and suddenly bouncing down before her and her friend both of the latter drew back somewhat startled  law mr billings says mrs polly rather coolly is it you who thought of seeing you here  whos this here young feller says towering mr moffat with his bass voice  its mr billings cousin a friend of mine said mrs polly beseechingly  oh cousin if its a friend of yours he should know better how to conduct himself thats all har you a dancingmaster young feller that you cut them there capers before gentlemen growled mr moffat who hated mr billings for the excellent reason that he lived upon him  dancingmaster be hanged said mr billings with becoming spirit if you call me dancingmaster ill pull your nose  what roared mr moffat pull my nose my nose ill tell you what my lad if you durst move me ill cut your throat curse me  oh moffycousin i meantis a shame to treat the poor boy so go away tommy do go away my cousins in liquor whimpered madam briggs who really thought that the great doorkeeper would put his threat into execution  tommy said mr moffat frowning horribly tommy to me too dog get out of my ssss sight was the word which mr moffat intended to utter but he was interrupted for to the astonishment of his friends and himself mr billings did actually make a spring at the monsters nose and caught it so firmly that the latter could not finish his sentence  the operation was performed with amazing celerity and having concluded it mr billings sprang back and whisked from out its sheath that new silverhilted sword which his mamma had given him now said he with a fierce kind of calmness now for the throatcutting cousin im your man  how the brawl might have ended no one can say had the two gentlemen actually crossed swords but mrs polly with a wonderful presence of mind restored peace by exclaiming hush hush the beaks the beaks upon which with one common instinct the whole party made a rush for the garden gates and disappeared into the fields mrs briggs knew her company there was something in the very name of a constable which sent them all aflying  after running a reasonable time mr billings stopped but the great moffat was nowhere to be seen and polly briggs had likewise vanished then tom bethought him that he would go back to his mother but arriving at the gate of the gardens was refused admittance as he had not a shilling in his pocket ive left says tommy giving himself the airs of a gentleman some friends in the gardens im with his excellency the bavarian henvy  then you had better go away with him said the gate people  but i tell you i left him there in the grand circle with a lady and whats more in the dark walk i have left a silverhilted sword  oh my lord ill go and tell him then cried one of the porters if you will wait  mr billings seated himself on a post near the gate and there consented to remain until the return of his messenger the latter went straight to the dark walk and found the sword sure enough but instead of returning it to its owner this discourteous knight broke the trenchant blade at the hilt and flinging the steel away pocketed the baser silver metal and lurked off by the private door consecrated to the waiters and fiddlers  in the meantime mr billings waited and waited and what was the conversation of his worthy parents inside the garden i cannot say but one of the waiters declared that he had served the great foreign count with two bowls of rackpunch and some biscuits in no 3 that in the box with him were first a young gentleman who went away and a lady splendidly dressed and masked that when the lady and his lordship were alone she edged away to the further end of the table and they had much talk that at last when his grace had pressed her very much she took off her mask and said dont you know me now max that he cried out my own catherine thou art more beautiful than ever and wanted to kneel down and vow eternal love to her but she begged him not to do so in a place where all the world would see that then his highness paid and they left the gardens the lady putting on her mask again  when they issued from the gardens ho joseph la rose my coach shouted his excellency in rather a husky voice and the men who had been waiting came up with the carriage a young gentleman who was dosing on one of the posts at the entry woke up suddenly at the blaze of the torches and the noise of the footmen the count gave his arm to the lady in the mask who slipped in and he was whispering la rose when the lad who had been sleeping hit his excellency on the shoulder and said i say count you can give me a cast home too and jumped into the coach  when catherine saw her son she threw herself into his arms and kissed him with a burst of hysterical tears of which mr billings was at a loss to understand the meaning the count joined them looking not a little disconcerted and the pair were landed at their own door where stood mr hayes in his nightcap ready to receive them and astounded at the splendour of the equipage in which his wife returned to him    chapter xi of some domestic quarrels and the consequence thereof   an ingenious magazinewriter who lived in the time of mr brock and the duke of marlborough compared the latter gentlemans conduct in battle when he        in peaceful thought the field of death surveyed        to fainting squadrons lent the timely aid        inspired repulsed battalions to engage        and taught the doubtful battle where to rage  mr joseph addison i say compared the duke of marlborough to an angel who is sent by divine command to chastise a guilty people        and pleased his masters orders to perform        rides on the whirlwind and directs the storm  the first four of these novel lines touch off the dukes disposition and genius to a tittle he had a love for such scenes of strife in the midst of them his spirit rose calm and supreme soaring like an angel or not but anyway the compliment is a very pretty one on the battleclouds majestic and causing to ebb or to flow the mighty tide of war  but as this famous simile might apply with equal proprietyto a bad angel as to a good one it may in like manner be employed to illustrate small quarrels as well as greata little family squabble in which two or three people are engaged as well as a vast national dispute argued on each side by the roaring throats of five hundred angry cannon the poet means in fact that the duke of marlborough had an immense genius for mischief  our friend brock or wood whose actions we love to illustrate by the very handsomest similes possessed this genius in common with his grace and was never so happy or seen to so much advantage as when he was employed in setting people by the ears his spirits usually dull then rose into the utmost gaiety and goodhumour when the doubtful battle flagged he by his art would instantly restore it when for instance toms repulsed battalions of rhetoric fled from his mammas fire a few words of apt sneer or encouragement on woods part would bring the fight round again or when mr hayess fainting squadrons of abuse broke upon the stubborn squares of toms bristling obstinacy it was woods delight to rally the former and bring him once more to the charge a great share had this man in making those bad people worse many fierce words and bad passions many falsehoods and knaveries on toms part much bitterness scorn and jealousy on the part of hayes and catherine might be attributed to this hoary old tempter whose joy and occupation it was to raise and direct the domestic storms and whirlwinds of the family of which he was a member and do not let us be accused of an undue propensity to use sounding words because we compare three scoundrels in the tyburn road to so many armies and mr wood to a mighty fieldmarshal my dear sir when you have well studied the worldhow supremely great the meanest thing in this world is and how infinitely mean the greatesti am mistaken if you do not make a strange and proper jumble of the sublime and the ridiculous the lofty and the low i have looked at the world for my part and come to the conclusion that i know not which is which  well then on the night when mrs hayes as recorded by us had been to the marylebone gardens mr wood had found the sincerest enjoyment in plying her husband with drink so that when catherine arrived at home mr hayes came forward to meet her in a manner which showed he was not only surly but drunk tom stepped out of the coach first and hayes asked him with an oath where he had been the oath mr billings sternly flung back again with another in its company and at the same time refused to give his stepfather any sort of answer to his query  the old man is drunk mother said he to mrs hayes as he handed that lady out of the coach before leaving which she had to withdraw her hand rather violently from the grasp of the count who was inside hayes instantly showed the correctness of his surmise by slamming the door courageously in toms face when he attempted to enter the house with his mother and when mrs catherine remonstrated according to her wont in a very angry and supercilious tone mr hayes replied with equal haughtiness and a regular quarrel ensued  people were accustomed in those days to use much more simple and expressive terms of language than are now thought polite and it would be dangerous to give in this present year 1840 the exact words of reproach which passed between hayes and his wife in 1726 mr wood sat near laughing his sides out mr hayes swore that his wife should not go abroad to teagardens in search of vile popish noblemen to which mrs hayes replied that mr hayes was a pitiful lying sneaking cur and that she would go where she pleased mr hayes rejoined that if she said much more he would take a stick to her mr wood whispered and serve her right mrs hayes thereupon swore she had stood his cowardly blows once or twice before but that if ever he did so again as sure as she was born she would stab him mr wood said curse me but i like her spirit  mr hayes took another line of argument and said the neighbours would talk madam  ay that they will no doubt said mr wood  then let them said catherine what do we care about the neighbours didnt the neighbours talk when you sent widow wilkins to gaol didnt the neighbours talk when you levied on poor old thomson you didnt mind then mr hayes  business maam is business and if i did distrain on thomson and lock up wilkins i think you knew about it as much as i  ifaith i believe youre a pair said mr wood  pray sir keep your tongue to yourself your opinion isnt asked anyhowno nor your company wanted neither cried mrs catherine with proper spirit  at which remark mr wood only whistled  i have asked this here gentleman to pass this evening along with me weve been drinking together maam  that we have said mr wood looking at mrs cat with the most perfect goodhumour  i say maam that weve been adrinking together and when weve been adrinking together i say that a man is my friend doctor wood is my friend madamthe reverend doctor wood weve passed the evening in company talking about politics madampolitics and riddleiddleigion weve not been flaunting in teagardens and ogling the men  its a lie shrieked mrs hayes i went with tomyou know i did the boy wouldnt let me rest till i promised to go  hang him i hate him said mr hayes hes always in my way  hes the only friend i have in the world and the only being i care a pin for said catherine  hes an impudent idle goodfornothing scoundrel and i hope to see him hanged shouted mr hayes and pray madam whose carriage was that as you came home in i warrant you paid something for the rideha ha  another lie screamed cat and clutched hold of a supperknife say it again john hayes and by  ill do for you  do for me hang me said mr hayes flourishing a stick and perfectly potvaliant do you think i care for a bastard and a  he did not finish the sentence for the woman ran at him like a savage knife in hand he bounded back flinging his arms about wildly and struck her with his staff sharply across the forehead the woman went down instantly a lucky blow was it for hayes and her it saved him from death perhaps and her from murder  all this scenea very important one of our dramamight have been described at much greater length but in truth the author has a natural horror of dwelling too long upon such hideous spectacles nor would the reader be much edified by a full and accurate knowledge of what took place the quarrel however though not more violent than many that had previously taken place between hayes and his wife was about to cause vast changes in the condition of this unhappy pair  hayes was at the first moment of his victory very much alarmed he feared that he had killed the woman and wood started up rather anxiously too with the same fancy but she soon began to recover water was brought her head was raised and bound up and in a short time mrs catherine gave vent to a copious fit of tears which relieved her somewhat these did not affect hayes muchthey rather pleased him for he saw he had got the better and although cat fiercely turned upon him when he made some small attempt towards reconciliation he did not heed her anger but smiled and winked in a selfsatisfied way at wood the coward was quite proud of his victory and finding catherine asleep or apparently so when he followed her to bed speedily gave himself up to slumber too and had some pleasant dreams to his portion  mr wood also went sniggering and happy upstairs to his chamber the quarrel had been a real treat to him it excited the old mantickled him into goodhumour and he promised himself a rare continuation of the fun when tom should be made acquainted with the circumstances of the dispute as for his excellency the count the ride from marylebone gardens and a tender squeeze of the hand which catherine permitted to him on parting had so inflamed the passions of the nobleman that after sleeping for nine hours and taking his chocolate as usual the next morning he actually delayed to read the newspaper and kept waiting a toyshop lady from cornhill with the sweetest bargain of mechlin lace in order to discourse to his chaplain on the charms of mrs hayes  she poor thing never closed her lids except when she would have had mr hayes imagine that she slumbered but lay beside him tossing and tumbling with hot eyes wide open and heart thumping and pulse of a hundred and ten and heard the heavy hours tolling and at last the day came peering haggard through the windowcurtains and found her still wakeful and wretched  mrs hayes had never been as we have seen especially fond of her lord but now as the day made visible to her the sleeping figure and countenance of that gentleman she looked at him with a contempt and loathing such as she had never felt even in all the years of her wedded life mr hayes was snoring profoundly by his bedside on his ledger stood a large greasy tin candlestick containing a lank tallowcandle turned down in the shaft and in the lower part his keys purse and tobaccopipe his feet were huddled up in his greasy threadbare clothes his head and half his sallow face muffled up in a red woollen nightcap his beard was of several days growth his mouth was wide open and he was snoring profoundly on a more despicable little creature the sun never shone and to this sordid wretch was catherine united for ever what a pretty rascal history might be read in yonder greasy daybook which never left the miserhe never read in any other of what a treasure were yonder keys and purse the keepers not a shilling they guarded but was picked from the pocket of necessity plundered from needy wantonness or pitilessly squeezed from starvation a fool a miser and a coward why was i bound to this wretch thought catherine i who am highspirited and beautiful did not he tell me so i who born a beggar have raised myself to competence and might have mountedwho knows whitherif cursed fortune had not baulked me  as mrs cat did not utter these sentiments but only thought them we have a right to clothe her thoughts in the genteelest possible language and to the best of our power have done so if the reader examines mrs hayess train of reasoning he will not we should think fail to perceive how ingeniously she managed to fix all the wrong upon her husband and yet to twist out some consolatory arguments for her own vanity this perverse argumentation we have all of us no doubt employed in our time how often have wewe poets politicians philosophers familymenfound charming excuses for our own rascalities in the monstrous wickedness of the world about us how loudly have we abused the times and our neighbours all this devils logic did mrs catherine lying wakeful in her bed on the night of the marylebone fete exert in gloomy triumph  it must however be confessed that nothing could be more just than mrs hayess sense of her husbands scoundrelism and meanness for if we have not proved these in the course of this history we have proved nothing mrs cat had a shrewd observing mind and if she wanted for proofs against hayes she had but to look before and about her to find them this amiable pair were lying in a large walnutbed with faded silk furniture which had been taken from under a respectable old invalid widow who had become security for a prodigal son the room was hung round with an antique tapestry representing rebecca at the well bathsheba bathing judith and holofernes and other subjects from holy writ which had been many score times sold for fifty pounds and bought back by mr hayes for two in those accommodating bargains which he made with young gentlemen who received fifty pounds of money and fifty of tapestry in consideration of their hundredpound bills against this tapestry and just cutting off holoferness head stood an enormous ominous black clock the spoil of some other usurious transaction some chairs and a dismal old black cabinet completed the furniture of this apartment it wanted but a ghost to render its gloom complete  mrs hayes sat up in the bed sternly regarding her husband there is be sure a strong magnetic influence in wakeful eyes so examining a sleeping person do not you as a boy remember waking of bright summer mornings and finding your mother looking over you had not the gaze of her tender eyes stolen into your senses long before you woke and cast over your slumbering spirit a sweet spell of peace and love and fresh springing joy some such influence had catherines looks upon her husband for as he slept under them the man began to writhe about uneasily and to burrow his head in the pillow and to utter quick strange moans and cries such as have often jarred ones ear while watching at the bed of the feverish sleeper it was just upon six and presently the clock began to utter those dismal grinding sounds which issue from clocks at such periods and which sound like the deathrattle of the departing hour then the bell struck the knell of it and with this mr hayes awoke and looked up and saw catherine gazing at him  their eyes met for an instant and catherine turned away burning red and looking as if she had been caught in the commission of a crime  a kind of blank terror seized upon old hayess soul a horrible icy fear and presentiment of coming evil and yet the woman had but looked at him he thought rapidly over the occurrences of the last night the quarrel and the end of it he had often struck her before when angry and heaped all kinds of bitter words upon her but in the morning she bore no malice and the previous quarrel was forgotten or at least passed over why should the last nights dispute not have the same end hayes calculated all this and tried to smile  i hope were friends cat said he you know i was in liquor last night and sadly put out by the loss of that fifty pound theyll ruin me deari know they will  mrs hayes did not answer  i should like to see the country again dear said he in his most wheedling way ive a mind do you know to call in all our money its you whove made every farthing of it thats sure and its a matter of two thousand pound by this time suppose we go into warwickshire cat and buy a farm and live genteel shouldnt you like to live a lady in your own county again how theyd stare at birmingham hey cat  and with this mr hayes made a motion as if he would seize his wifes hand but she flung his back again  coward said she you want liquor to give you courage and then youve only heart enough to strike women  it was only in selfdefence my dear said hayes whose courage had all gone you tried you know toto  to stab you and i wish i had said mrs hayes setting her teeth and glaring at him like a demon and so saying she sprung out of bed there was a great stain of blood on her pillow look at it said she that bloods of your shedding and at this hayes fairly began to weep so utterly downcast and frightened was the miserable man the wretchs tears only inspired his wife with a still greater rage and loathing she cared not so much for the blow but she hated the man the man to whom she was tied for everfor ever the bar between her and wealth happiness love rank perhaps if i were free thought mrs hayes the thought had been sitting at her pillow all night and whispering ceaselessly into her ear if i were free max would marry me i know he wouldhe said so yesterday                        as if by a kind of intuition old wood seemed to read all this womans thoughts for he said that day with a sneer that he would wager she was thinking how much better it would be to be a counts lady than a poor misers wife and faith said he a count and a chariotandsix is better than an old skinflint with a cudgel and then he asked her if her head was better and supposed that she was used to beating and cut sundry other jokes which made the poor wretchs wounds of mind and body feel a thousand times sorer  tom too was made acquainted with the dispute and swore his accustomed vengeance against his stepfather such feelings wood with a dexterous malice would never let rest it was his joy at first quite a disinterested one to goad catherine and to frighten hayes though in truth that unfortunate creature had no occasion for incitements from without to keep up the dreadful state of terror and depression into which he had fallen  for from the morning after the quarrel the horrible words and looks of catherine never left hayess memory but a cold fear followed hima dreadful prescience he strove to overcome this fate as a coward wouldto kneel to it for compassionto coax and wheedle it into forgiveness he was slavishly gentle to catherine and bore her fierce taunts with mean resignation he trembled before young billings who was now established in the house his mother said to protect her against the violence of her husband and suffered his brutal language and conduct without venturing to resist  the young man and his mother lorded over the house hayes hardly dared to speak in their presence seldom sat with the family except at meals but slipped away to his chamber he slept apart now from his wife or passed the evening at the publichouse where he was constrained to drinkto spend some of his beloved sixpences for drink  and of course the neighbours began to say john hayes neglects his wife he tyrannises over her and beats her always at the publichouse leaving an honest woman alone at home  the unfortunate wretch did not hate his wife he was used to herfond of her as much as he could be fondsighed to be friends with her againrepeatedly would creep whimpering to woods room when the latter was alone and begged him to bring about a reconciliation they were reconciled as much as ever they could be the woman looked at him thought what she might be but for him and scorned and loathed him with a feeling that almost amounted to insanity what nights she lay awake weeping and cursing herself and him his humility and beseeching looks only made him more despicable and hateful to her  if hayes did not hate the mother however he hated the boyhated and feared him dreadfully he would have poisoned him if he had had the courage but he dared not he dared not even look at him as he sat there the master of the house in insolent triumph o god how the lads brutal laughter rung in hayess ears and how the stare of his fierce bold black eyes pursued him of a truth if mr wood loved mischief as he did honestly and purely for mischiefs sake he had enough here there was mean malice and fierce scorn and black revenge and sinful desire boiling up in the hearts of these wretched people enough to content mr woods great master himself  hayess business as we have said was nominally that of a carpenter but since for the last few years he had added to it that of a lender of money the carpenters trade had been neglected altogether for one so much more profitable mrs hayes had exerted herself with much benefit to her husband in his usurious business she was a resolute clearsighted keen woman that did not love money but loved to be rich and push her way in the world she would have nothing to do with the trade now however and told her husband to manage it himself she felt that she was separated from him for ever and could no more be brought to consider her interests as connected with his own  the man was well fitted for the creeping and niggling of his dastardly trade and gathered his moneys and busied himself with his lawyer and acted as his own bookkeeper and clerk not without satisfaction his wifes speculations when they worked in concert used often to frighten him he never sent out his capital without a pang and only because he dared not question her superior judgment and will he began now to lend no more he could not let the money out of his sight his sole pleasure was to creep up into his room and count and recount it when billings came into the house hayes had taken a room next to that of wood it was a protection to him for wood would often rebuke the lad for using hayes ill and both catherine and tom treated the old man with deference  at lastit was after he had collected a good deal of his moneyhayes began to reason with himself why should i staystay to be insulted by that boy or murdered by him he is ready for any crime he determined to fly he would send catherine money every year noshe had the furniture let her let lodgingsthat would support her he would go and live away abroad in some cheap placeaway from that boy and his horrible threats the idea of freedom was agreeable to the poor wretch and he began to wind up his affairs as quickly as he could  hayes would now allow no one to make his bed or enter his room and wood could hear him through the panels fidgeting perpetually to and fro opening and shutting of chests and clinking of coin at the least sound he would start up and would go to billingss door and listen wood used to hear him creeping through the passages and returning stealthily to his own chamber  one day the woman and her son had been angrily taunting him in the presence of a neighbour the neighbour retired soon and hayes who had gone with him to the door heard on returning the voice of wood in the parlour the old man laughed in his usual saturnine way and said have a care mrs cat for if hayes were to die suddenly by the laws the neighbours would accuse thee of his death  hayes started as if he had been shot he too is in the plot thought he they are all leagued against me they will kill me they are only biding their time fear seized him and he thought of flying that instant and leaving all and he stole into his room and gathered his money together but only a half of it was there in a few weeks all would have come in he had not the heart to go but that night wood heard hayes pause at his door before he went to listen at mrs catherines what is the man thinking of said wood he is gathering his money together has he a hoard yonder unknown to us all  wood thought he would watch him there was a closet between the two rooms wood bored a hole in the panel and peeped through hayes had a brace of pistols and four or five little bags before him on the table one of these he opened and placed one by one fiveandtwenty guineas into it such a sum had been due that daycatherine spoke of it only in the morning for the debtors name had by chance been mentioned in the conversation hayes commonly kept but a few guineas in the house for what was he amassing all these the next day wood asked for change for a twentypound bill hayes said he had but three guineas and when asked by catherine where the money was that was paid the day before said that it was at the bankers the man is going to fly said wood that is sure if he does i know himhe will leave his wife without a shilling  he watched him for several days regularly two or three more bags were added to the former number they are pretty things guineas thought wood and tell no tales like bankbills and he thought over the days when he and macshane used to ride abroad in search of them  i dont know what thoughts entered into mr woods brain but the next day after seeing young billings to whom he actually made a present of a guinea that young man in conversing with his mother said do you know mother that if you were free and married the count i should be a lord its the german law mr wood says and you know he was in them countries with marlborough  ay that he would said mr wood in germany but germany isnt england and its no use talking of such things  hush child said mrs hayes quite eagerly how can i marry the count besides ant i married and isnt he too great a lord for me  too great a lordnot a whit mother if it wasnt for hayes i might be a lord now he gave me five guineas only last week but curse the skinflint who never will part with a shilling  its not so bad as his striking your mother tom i had my stick up and was ready to fell him tother night added mr wood and herewith he smiled and looked steadily in mrs catherines face she dared not look again but she felt that the old man knew a secret that she had been trying to hide from herself fool he knew it and hayes knew it dimly and never never since that day of the gala had it left her sleeping or waking when hayes in his fear had proposed to sleep away from her she started with joy she had been afraid that she might talk in her sleep and so let slip her horrible confession  old wood knew all her history since the period of the marylebone fete he had wormed it out of her day by day he had counselled her how to act warned her not to yield to procure at least a certain provision for her son and a handsome settlement for herself if she determined on quitting her husband the old man looked on the business in a proper philosophical light told her bluntly that he saw she was bent upon going off with the count and bade her take precautions else she might be left as she had been before  catherine denied all these charges but she saw the count daily notwithstanding and took all the measures which wood had recommended to her they were very prudent ones galgenstein grew hourly more in love never had he felt such a flame not in the best days of his youth not for the fairest princess countess or actress from vienna to paris  at lengthit was the night after he had seen hayes counting his moneybagsold wood spoke to mrs hayes very seriously that husband of yours cat said he meditates some treason ay and fancies we are about such he listens nightly at your door and at mine he is going to leave you be sure ont and if he leaves you he leaves you to starve  i can be rich elsewhere said mrs cat  what with max  ay with max and why not said mrs hayes  why not fool do you recollect birmingham do you think that galgenstein who is so tender now because he hasnt won you will be faithful because he has psha woman men are not made so dont go to him until you are sure if you were a widow now he would marry you but never leave yourself at his mercy if you were to leave your husband to go to him he would desert you in a fortnight  she might have been a countess she knew she might but for this cursed barrier between her and her fortune wood knew what she was thinking of and smiled grimly  besides he continued remember tom as sure as you leave hayes without some security from max the boys ruined he who might be a lord if his mother had butpsha never mind that boy will go on the road as sure as my names wood hes a turpin cock in his eye my deara regular tyburn look he knows too many of that sort already and is too fond of a bottle and a girl to resist and be honest when it comes to the pinch  its all true said mrs hayes toms a high mettlesome fellow and would no more mind a ride on hounslow heath than he does a walk now in the mall  do you want him hanged my dear said wood  ah doctor  it is a pity and thats sure concluded mr wood knocking the ashes out of his pipe and closing this interesting conversation it is a pity that that old skinflint should be in the way of both your fortunes and he about to fling you over too  mrs catherine retired musing as mr billings had previously done a sweet smile of contentment lighted up the venerable features of doctor wood and he walked abroad into the streets as happy a fellow as any in london    chapter xii treats of love and prepares for death   and to begin this chapter we cannot do better than quote a part of a letter from m labbe oflaherty to madame la comtesse de xat paris  madamthe little arouet de voltaire who hath come hither to take a turn in england as i see by the post of this morning hath brought me a charming pacquet from your ladyships hands which ought to render a reasonable man happy but alas makes your slave miserable i think of dear paris and something more dear than all paris of which madam i may not venture to speak furtheri think of dear paris and find myself in this dismal vitehall where when the fog clears up i can catch a glimpse of muddy thames and of that fatal palace which the kings of england have been obliged to exchange for your noble castle of saint germains that stands so stately by silver seine truly no bad bargain for my part i would give my grand ambassadorial saloons hangings gildings feasts valets ambassadors and all for a bicoque in sight of the thuilleries towers or my little cell in the irlandois  my last sheets have given you a pretty notion of our ambassadors public doings now for a pretty piece of private scandal respecting that great man figure to yourself madam his excellency is in love actually in love talking day and night about a certain fair one whom he hath picked out of a gutter who is well nigh forty years old who was his mistress when he was in england a captain of dragoons some sixty seventy or a hundred years since who hath had a son by him moreover a sprightly lad apprentice to a tailor of eminence that has the honour of making his excellencys breeches  since one fatal night when he met this fair creature at a certain place of publique resort called marylebone gardens our cyrus hath been an altered creature love hath mastered this brainless ambassador and his antics afford me food for perpetual mirth he sits now opposite to me at a table inditing a letter to his catherine and copying it fromwhat do you thinkfrom the grand cyrus i swear madam that my happiness would be to offer you this hand as i have my heart long ago and i beg you to bear in mind this declaration i have just dictated to him the above tender words for our envoy i need not tell you is not strong at writing or thinking  the fair catherine i must tell you is no less than a carpenters wife a welltodo bourgeois living at the tyburn or gallows road she found out her ancient lover very soon after our arrival and hath a marvellous hankering to be a counts lady a pretty little creature is this madam catherine billets breakfasts pretty walks presents of silks and satins pass daily between the pair but strange to say the lady is as virtuous as diana and hath resisted all my counts cajoleries hitherto the poor fellow told me with tears in his eyes that he believed he should have carried her by storm on the very first night of their meeting but that her son stepped into the way and he or somebody else hath been in the way ever since madam will never appear alone i believe it is this wondrous chastity of the lady that has elicited this wondrous constancy of the gentleman she is holding out for a settlement who knows if not for a marriage her husband she says is ailing her lover is fool enough and she herself conducts her negotiations as i must honestly own with a pretty notion of diplomacy                        this is the only part of the reverend gentlemans letter that directly affects this history the rest contains some scandal concerning greater personages about the court a great share of abuse of the elector of hanover and a pretty description of a boxingmatch at mr figgs amphitheatre in oxford road where john wells of edmund bury as by the papers may be seen master of the noble science of selfdefence did engage with edward sutton of gravesend master of the said science and the issue of the combat  n badds the father in a postscriptmonsieur figue gives a hat to be cudgelled for before the master mount and the whole of this fashionable information hath been given me by monseigneurs son monsieur billings garcontailleur chevalier de galgenstein  mr billings was in fact a frequent visitor at the ambassadors house to whose presence he by a general order was always admitted as for the connection between mrs catherine and her former admirer the abbes history of it is perfectly correct nor can it be said that this wretched woman whose tale now begins to wear a darker hue was in anything but soul faithless to her husband but she hated him longed to leave him and loved another the end was coming quickly and every one of our unknowing actors and actresses were to be implicated more or less in the catastrophe  it will be seen that mrs cat had followed pretty closely the injunctions of mr wood in regard to her dealings with the count who grew more heartstricken and tender daily as the completion of his wishes was delayed and his desires goaded by contradiction the abbe has quoted one portion of a letter written by him here is the entire performance extracted as the holy father said chiefly from the romance of the grand cyrus             unhappy maximilian unto unjust catherina  madamit must needs be that i love you better than any ever did since notwithstanding your injustice in calling me perfidious i love you no less than i did before on the contrary my passion is so violent and your unjust accusation makes me so sensible of it that if you did but know the resentments of my soule you would confess your selfe the most cruell and unjust woman in the world you shall ere long madam see me at your feete and as you were my first passion so you will be my last  on my knees i will tell you at the first handsom opportunity that the grandure of my passion can only be equalled by your beauty it hath driven me to such a fatall necessity as that i cannot hide the misery which you have caused sure the hostil goddes have to plague me ordayned that fatal marridge by which you are bound to one so infinitly below you in degree were that bond of illomind hymen cut in twayn witch binds you i swear madam that my happiniss woulde be to offer you this hande as i have my harte long agoe and i praye you to beare in minde this declaracion which i here sign with my hande and witch i pray you may one day be called upon to prove the truth on beleave me madam that there is none in the world who doth more honor to your vertue than myselfe nor who wishes your happinesse with more zeal thanmaximilian  from my lodgings in whitehall this 25th of february  to the incomparable catherina these with a scarlet satten petticoat  the count had debated about the sentence promising marriage in event of hayess death but the honest abbe cut these scruples very short by saying justly that because he wrote in that manner there was no need for him to act so that he had better not sign and address the note in full and that he presumed his excellency was not quite so timid as to fancy that the woman would follow him all the way to germany when his diplomatic duties would be ended as they would soon  the receipt of this billet caused such a flush of joy and exultation to unhappy happy mrs catherine that wood did not fail to remark it and speedily learned the contents of the letter wood had no need to bid the poor wretch guard it very carefully it never from that day forth left her it was her title of nobilityher pass to rank wealth happiness she began to look down on her neighbours her manner to her husband grew more than ordinarily scornful the poor vain wretch longed to tell her secret and to take her place openly in the world she a countess and tom a counts son she felt that she should royally become the title  about this timeand hayes was very much frightened at the prevalence of the rumourit suddenly began to be about in his quarter that he was going to quit the country the story was in everybodys mouth people used to sneer when he turned pale and wept and passionately denied it  it was said too that mrs hayes was not his wife but his mistresseverybody had this storyhis mistress whom he treated most cruelly and was about to desert the tale of the blow which had felled her to the ground was known in all quarters when he declared that the woman tried to stab him nobody believed him the women said he would have been served right if she had done so how had these stories gone abroad three days more and i will fly thought hayes and the world may say what it pleases  ay fool flyaway so swiftly that fate cannot overtake thee hide so cunningly that death shall not find thy place of refuge    chapter xiii being a preparation for the end   the reader doubtless doth now partly understand what dark acts of conspiracy are beginning to gather around mr hayes and possibly hath comprehended  1 that if the rumour was universally credited which declared that mrs catherine was only hayess mistress and not his wife  she might if she so inclined marry another person and thereby not injure her fame and excite wonderment but actually add to her reputation  2 that if all the world did steadfastly believe that mr hayes intended to desert this woman after having cruelly maltreated her  the direction which his journey might take would be of no consequence and he might go to highgate to edinburgh to constantinople nay down a well and no soul would care to ask whither he had gone  these points mr hayes had not considered duly the latter case had been put to him and annoyed him as we have seen the former had actually been pressed upon him by mrs hayes herself who in almost the only communication she had had with him since their last quarrel had asked him angrily in the presence of wood and her son whether he had dared to utter such lies and how it came to pass that the neighbours looked scornfully at her and avoided her  to this charge mr hayes pleaded very meekly that he was not guilty and young billings taking him by the collar and clinching his fist in his face swore a dreadful oath that he would have the life of him if he dared abuse his mother mrs hayes then spoke of the general report abroad that he was going to desert her which if he attempted to do mr billings vowed that he would follow him to jerusalem and have his blood these threats and the insolent language of young billings rather calmed hayes than agitated him he longed to be on his journey but he began to hope that no obstacle would be placed in the way of it for the first time since many days he began to enjoy a feeling something akin to security and could look with tolerable confidence towards a comfortable completion of his own schemes of treason  these points being duly settled we are now arrived o public at a point for which the authors soul hath been yearning ever since this history commenced we are now come o critic to a stage of the work when this tale begins to assume an appearance so interestingly horrific that you must have a heart of stone if you are not interested by it o candid and discerning reader who art sick of the hideous scenes of brutal bloodshed which have of late come forth from pens of certain eminent wits if you turn away disgusted from the book remember that this passage hath not been written for you or such as you who have taste to know and hate the style in which it hath been composed but for the public which hath no such tastefor the public which can patronise four different representations of jack sheppardfor the public whom its literary providers have gorged with blood and foul newgate garbageand to whom we poor creatures humbly following at the tail of our great highpriests and prophets of the press may as in duty bound offer some small gift of our own a little mite truly but given with goodwill come up then fair catherine and brave countappear gallant brock and faultless billingshasten hither honest john hayes the former chapters are but flowers in which we have been decking you for the sacrifice ascend to the altar ye innocent lambs and prepare for the final act lo the knife is sharpened and the sacrificer ready stretch your throats sweet onesfor the public is thirsty and must have blood        this was written in 1840    chapter the last   that mr hayes had some notion of the attachment of monsieur de galgenstein for his wife is very certain the man could not but perceive that she was more gaily dressed and more frequently absent than usual and must have been quite aware that from the day of the quarrel until the present period catherine had never asked him for a shilling for the house expenses he had not the heart to offer however nor in truth did she seem to remember that money was due  she received in fact many sums from the tender count tom was likewise liberally provided by the same personage who was moreover continually sending presents of various kinds to the person on whom his affections were centred  one of these gifts was a hamper of choice mountainwine which had been some weeks in the house and excited the longing of mr hayes who loved wine very much this liquor was generally drunk by wood and billings who applauded it greatly and many times in passing through the backparlourwhich he had to traverse in order to reach the stair hayes had cast a tender eye towards the drink of which had he dared he would have partaken  on the 1st of march in the year 1726 mr hayes had gathered together almost the whole sum with which he intended to decamp and having on that very day recovered the amount of a bill which he thought almost hopeless he returned home in tolerable goodhumour and feeling so near was his period of departure something like security nobody had attempted the least violence on him besides he was armed with pistols had his money in bills in a belt about his person and really reasoned with himself that there was no danger for him to apprehend  he entered the house about dusk at five oclock mrs hayes was absent with mr billings only mr wood was smoking according to his wont in the little backparlour and as mr hayes passed the old gentleman addressed him in a friendly voice and wondering that he had been such a stranger invited him to sit and take a glass of wine there was a light and a foreman in the shop mr hayes gave his injunctions to that person and saw no objection to mr woods invitation  the conversation at first a little stiff between the two gentlemen began speedily to grow more easy and confidential and so particularly bland and goodhumoured was mr or doctor wood that his companion was quite caught and softened by the charm of his manner and the pair became as good friends as in the former days of their intercourse  i wish you would come down sometimes of evenings quoth doctor wood for though no booklearned man mr hayes look you you are a man of the world and i cant abide the society of boys theres tom now since this tiff with mrs cat the scoundrel plays the grank turk here the pair of em betwixt them have completely gotten the upper hand of you confess that you are beaten master hayes and dont like the boy  no more i do said hayes and thats the truth ont a man doth not like to have his wifes sins flung in his face nor to be perpetually bullied in his own house by such a fiery sprig as that  mischief sirmischief only said wood tis the fun of youth sir and will go off as age comes to the lad bad as you may think himand he is as skittish and fierce sure enough as a young coltthere is good stuff in him and though he hath or fancies he hath the right to abuse every one by the lord he will let none others do so last week now didnt he tell mrs cat that you served her right in the last beating matter and werent they coming to knives just as in your case by my faith they were ay and at the braunds head when some fellow said that you were a bloody bluebeard and would murder your wife stab me if tom wasnt up in an instant and knocked the fellow down for abusing of you  the first of these stories was quite true the second was only a charitable invention of mr wood and employed doubtless for the amiable purpose of bringing the old and young men together the scheme partially succeeded for though hayes was not so far mollified towards tom as to entertain any affection for a young man whom he had cordially detested ever since he knew him yet he felt more at ease and cheerful regarding himself and surely not without reason while indulging in these benevolent sentiments mrs catherine and her son arrived and found somewhat to their astonishment mr hayes seated in the backparlour as in former times and they were invited by mr wood to sit down and drink  we have said that certain bottles of mountainwine were presented by the count to mrs catherine these were at mr woods suggestion produced and hayes who had long been coveting them was charmed to have an opportunity to drink his fill he forthwith began bragging of his great powers as a drinker and vowed that he could manage eight bottles without becoming intoxicated  mr wood grinned strangely and looked in a peculiar way at tom billings who grinned too mrs cats eyes were turned towards the ground but her face was deadly pale  the party began drinking hayes kept up his reputation as a toper and swallowed one two three bottles without wincing he grew talkative and merry and began to sing songs and to cut jokes at which wood laughed hugely and billings after him mrs cat could not laugh but sat silent  what ailed her was she thinking of the count she had been with max that day and had promised him for the next night at ten an interview near his lodgings at whitehall it was the first time that she would see him alone they were to meet not a very cheerful place for a lovetryst at st margarets churchyard near westminster abbey of this no doubt cat was thinking but what could she mean by whispering to wood no no for gods sake not tonight  she means we are to have no more liquor said wood to mr hayes who heard this sentence and seemed rather alarmed  thats itno more liquor said catherine eagerly you have had enough tonight go to bed and lock your door and sleep mr hayes  but i say ive not had enough drink screamed hayes im good for five bottles more and wager i will drink them too  done for a guinea said wood  done and done said billings  be you quiet growled hayes scowling at the lad i will drink what i please and ask no counsel of yours and he muttered some more curses against young billings which showed what his feelings were towards his wifes son and which the latter for a wonder only received with a scornful smile and a knowing look at wood  well the five extra bottles were brought and drunk by mr hayes and seasoned by many songs from the recueil of mr thomas durfey and others the chief part of the talk and merriment was on hayess part as indeed was naturalfor while he drank bottle after bottle of wine the other two gentlemen confined themselves to small beerboth pleading illness as an excuse for their sobriety  and now might we depict with much accuracy the course of mr hayess intoxication as it rose from the merriment of the threebottle point to the madness of the fourfrom the uproarious quarrelsomeness of the sixth bottle to the sickly stupidity of the seventh but we are desirous of bringing this tale to a conclusion and must pretermit all consideration of a subject so curious so instructive and so delightful suffice it to say as a matter of history that mr hayes did actually drink seven bottles of mountainwine and that mr thomas billings went to the braunds head in bond street and purchased another which hayes likewise drank  thatll do said mr wood to young billings and they led hayes up to bed whither in truth he was unable to walk himself                        mrs springatt the lodger came down to ask what the noise was tis only tom billings making merry with some friends from the country answered mrs hayes whereupon springatt retired and the house was quiet                        some scuffling and stamping was heard about eleven oclock                        after they had seen mr hayes to bed billings remembered that he had a parcel to carry to some person in the neighbourhood of the strand and as the night was remarkably fine he and mr wood agreed to walk together and set forth accordingly  here follows a description of the thames at midnight in a fine historical style with an account of lambeth westminster the savoy baynards castle arundel house the temple of old london bridge with its twenty arches on which be houses builded so that it seemeth rather a continuall street than a bridgeof bankside and the globe and the fortune theatres of the ferries across the river and of the pirates who infest the samenamely tinklermen petermen hebbermen trawlermen of the fleet of barges that lay at the savoy steps and of the long lines of slim wherries sleeping on the river banks and basking and shining in the moonbeams a combat on the river is described that takes place between the crews of a tinklermans boat and the waterbailiffs shouting his warcry st mary overy a la rescousse the waterbailiff sprung at the throat of the tinklerman captain the crews of both vessels as if aware that the struggle of their chiefs would decide the contest ceased hostilities and awaited on their respective poops the issue of the deathshock it was not long coming yield dog said the waterbailiff the tinklerman could not answerfor his throat was grasped too tight in the iron clench of the city champion but drawing his snickersnee he plunged it seven times in the bailiffs chest still the latter fell not the deathrattle gurgled in the throat of his opponent his arms fell heavily to his side foot to foot each standing at the side of his boat stood the brave menthey were both dead in the name of st clement danes said the master give way my men and thrusting forward his halberd seven feet long richly decorated with velvet and brass nails and having the city arms argent a cross gules and in the first quarter a dagger displayed of the second he thrust the tinklermans boat away from his own and at once the bodies of the captains plunged down down down down in the unfathomable waters  after this follows another episode two masked ladies quarrel at the door of a tavern overlooking the thames they turn out to be stella and vanessa who have followed swift thither who is in the act of reading gullivers travels to gay arbuthnot bolingbroke and pope two fellows are sitting shuddering under a doorway to one of them tom billings flung a sixpence he little knew that the names of those two young men weresamuel johnson and richard savage     another last chapter   mr hayes did not join the family the next day and it appears that the previous nights reconciliation was not very durable for when mrs springatt asked wood for hayes mr wood stated that hayes had gone away without saying whither he was bound or how long he might be absent he only said in rather a sulky tone that he should probably pass the night at a friends house for my part i know of no friend he hath added mr wood and pray heaven that he may not think of deserting his poor wife whom he hath beaten and illused so already in this prayer mrs springatt joined and so these two worthy people parted  what business billings was about cannot be said but he was this night bound towards marylebone fields as he was the night before for the strand and westminster and although the night was very stormy and rainy as the previous evening had been fine old wood goodnaturedly resolved upon accompanying him and forth they sallied together  mrs catherine too had her business as we have seen but this was of a very delicate nature at nine oclock she had an appointment with the count and faithfully by that hour had found her way to saint margarets churchyard near westminster abbey where she awaited monsieur de galgenstein  the spot was convenient being very lonely and at the same time close to the counts lodgings at whitehall his excellency came but somewhat after the hour for to say the truth being a freethinker he had the most firm belief in ghosts and demons and did not care to pace a churchyard alone he was comforted therefore when he saw a woman muffled in a cloak who held out her hand to him at the gate and said is that you he took her handit was very clammy and cold and at her desire he bade his confidential footman who had attended him with a torch to retire and leave him to himself  the torchbearer retired and left them quite in darkness and the pair entered the little cemetery cautiously threading their way among the tombs they sat down on one underneath a tree it seemed to be the wind was very cold and its piteous howling was the only noise that broke the silence of the place catherines teeth were chattering for all her wraps and when max drew her close to him and encircled her waist with one arm and pressed her hand she did not repulse him but rather came close to him and with her own damp fingers feebly returned his pressure  the poor thing was very wretched and weeping she confided to max the cause of her grief she was alone in the worldalone and penniless her husband had left her she had that very day received a letter from him which confirmed all that she had suspected so long he had left her carried away all his property and would not return  if we say that a selfish joy filled the breast of monsieur de galgenstein the reader will not be astonished a heartless libertine he felt glad at the prospect of catherines ruin for he hoped that necessity would make her his own he clasped the poor thing to his heart and vowed that he would replace the husband she had lost and that his fortune should be hers  will you replace him said she  yes truly in everything but the name dear catherine and when he dies i swear you shall be countess of galgenstein  will you swear she cried eagerly  by everything that is most sacred were you free now i would and here he swore a terrific oath at once make you mine  we have seen before that it cost monsieur de galgenstein nothing to make these vows hayes was likely too to live as long as catherineas long at least as the counts connection with her but he was caught in his own snare  she took his hand and kissed it repeatedly and bathed it in her tears and pressed it to her bosom max she said i am free be mine and i will love you as i have done for years and years  max started back what is he dead he said  no no not dead but he never was my husband  he let go her hand and interrupting her said sharply indeed madam if this carpenter never was your husband i see no cause why i should be if a lady who hath been for twenty years the mistress of a miserable country boor cannot find it in her heart to put up with the protection of a noblemana sovereigns representativeshe may seek a husband elsewhere  i was no mans mistress except yours sobbed catherine wringing her hands and sobbing wildly but o heaven i deserved this because i was a child and you saw and ruined and left mebecause in my sorrow and repentance i wished to repair my crime and was touched by that mans love and married himbecause he too deceives and leaves mebecause after loving youmadly loving you for twenty yearsi will not now forfeit your respect and degrade myself by yielding to your will you too must scorn me it is too muchtoo mucho heaven and the wretched woman fell back almost fainting  max was almost frightened by this burst of sorrow on her part and was coming forward to support her but she motioned him away and taking from her bosom a letter said if it were light you could see max how cruelly i have been betrayed by that man who called himself my husband long before he married me he was married to another this woman is still living he says and he says he leaves me for ever  at this moment the moon which had been hidden behind westminster abbey rose above the vast black mass of that edifice and poured a flood of silver light upon the little church of st margarets and the spot where the lovers stood max was at a little distance from catherine pacing gloomily up and down the flags she remained at her old position at the tombstone under the tree or pillar as it seemed to be as the moon got up she was leaning against the pillar and holding out to max with an arm beautifully white and rounded the letter she had received from her husband read it max she said i asked for light and here is heavens own by which you may read  but max did not come forward to receive it on a sudden his face assumed a look of the most dreadful surprise and agony he stood still and stared with wild eyes starting from their sockets he stared upwards at a point seemingly above catherines head at last he raised up his finger slowly and said look catthe headthe head then uttering a horrible laugh he fell down grovelling among the stones gibbering and writhing in a fit of epilepsy  catherine started forward and looked up she had been standing against a post not a treethe moon was shining full on it now and on the summit strangely distinct and smiling ghastly was a livid human head  the wretched woman fledshe dared look no more and some hours afterwards when alarmed by the counts continued absence his confidential servant came back to seek for him in the churchyard he was found sitting on the flags staring full at the head and laughing and talking to it wildly and nodding at it he was taken up a hopeless idiot and so lived for years and years clanking the chain and moaning under the lash and howling through long nights when the moon peered through the bars of his solitary cell and he buried his face in the straw                        therethe murder is out and having indulged himself in a chapter of the very finest writing the author begs the attention of the british public towards it humbly conceiving that it possesses some of those peculiar merits which have rendered the fine writing in other chapters of the works of other authors so famous  without bragging at all let us just point out the chief claims of the above pleasing piece of composition in the first place it is perfectly stilted and unnatural the dialogue and the sentiments being artfully arranged so as to be as strong and majestic as possible our dear cat is but a poor illiterate country wench who has come from cutting her husbands throat and yet see she talks and looks like a tragedy princess who is suffering in the most virtuous blank verse this is the proper end of fiction and one of the greatest triumphs that a novelist can achieve for to make people sympathise with virtue is a vulgar trick that any common fellow can do but it is not everybody who can take a scoundrel and cause us to weep and whimper over him as though he were a very saint give a young lady of five years old a skein of silk and a brace of nettingneedles and she will in a short time turn you out a decent silk purseanybody can but try her with a sows ear and see whether she can make a silk purse out of that that is the work for your real great artist and pleasant it is to see how many have succeeded in these latter days  the subject is strictly historical as anyone may see by referring to the daily post of march 3 1726 which contains the following paragraph  yesterday morning early a mans head that by the freshness of it seemed to have been newly cut off from the body having its own hair on was found by the rivers side near millbank westminster and was afterwards exposed to public view in st margarets churchyard where thousands of people have seen it but none could tell who the unhappy person was much less who committed such a horrid and barbarous action there are various conjectures relating to the deceased but there being nothing certain we omit them the head was much hacked and mangled in the cutting off  the head which caused such an impression upon monsieur de galgenstein was indeed once on the shoulders of mr john hayes who lost it under the following circumstances we have seen how mr hayes was induced to drink mr hayes having been encouraged in drinking the wine and growing very merry therewith he sang and danced about the room but his wife fearing the quantity he had drunk would not have the wishedfor effect on him she sent away for another bottle of which he drank also this effectually answered their expectations and mr hayes became thereby intoxicated and deprived of his understanding  he however made shift to get into the other room and throwing himself upon the bed fell asleep upon which mrs hayes reminded them of the affair in hand and told them that was the most proper juncture to finish the business                               the description of the murder and the execution of the      culprits which here follows in the original was taken from      the newspapers of the day  coming from such a source they      have as may be imagined no literary merit whatever  the      details of the crime are simply horrible without one touch      of even that sort of romance which sometimes gives a little      dignity to murder  as such they precisely suited mr      thackerays purpose at the timewhich was to show the real      manners and customs of the sheppards and turpins who were      then the popular heroes of fiction  but nowadays there is      no such purpose to serve and therefore these too literal      details are omitted                         ring ding ding the gloomy green curtain drops the dramatis personae are duly disposed of the nimble candle snuffers put out the lights and the audience goeth pondering home if the critic take the pains to ask why the author who hath been so diffuse in describing the early and fabulous acts of mrs catherines existence should so hurry off the catastrophe where a deal of the very finest writing might have been employed solomons replies that the ordinary narrative is far more emphatic than any composition of his own could be with all the rhetorical graces which he might employ mr arams trial as taken by the pennyaliners of those days had always interested him more than the lengthened and poetical report which an eminent novelist has given of the same mr turpins adventures are more instructive and agreeable to him in the account of the newgate plutarch than in the learned ainsworths biographical dictionary and as he believes that the professional gentlemen who are employed to invest such heroes with the rewards that their great actions merit will go through the ceremony of the grand cordon with much more accuracy and despatch than can be shown by the most distinguished amateur in like manner he thinks that the history of such investitures should be written by people directly concerned and not by admiring persons without who must be ignorant of many of the secrets of ketchcraft we very much doubt if milton himself could make a description of an execution half so horrible as the simple lines in the daily post of a hundred and ten years since that now lies before usherrlich wie am ersten tagas bright and clean as on the day of publication think of it it has been read by belinda at her toilet scanned at buttons and wills sneered at by wits talked of in palaces and cottages by a busy race in wigs red heels hoops patches and rags of all varietya busy race that hath long since plunged and vanished in the unfathomable gulf towards which we march so briskly  where are they afflavit deusand they are gone hark is not the same wind roaring still that shall sweep us down and yonder stands the compositor at his types who shall put up a pretty paragraph some day to say how yesterday at his house in grosvenor square or at botany bay universally regretted died soandso into what profound moralities is the paragraph concerning mrs catherines burning leading us  ay truly and to that very point have we wished to come for having finished our delectable meal it behoves us to say a word or two by way of grace at its conclusion and be heartily thankful that it is over it has been the writers object carefully to exclude from his drama except in two very insignificant instancesmere walkinggentlemen parts any characters but those of scoundrels of the very highest degree that he has not altogether failed in the object he had in view is evident from some newspaper critiques which he has had the good fortune to see and which abuse the tale of catherine as one of the dullest most vulgar and immoral works extant it is highly gratifying to the author to find that such opinions are abroad as they convince him that the taste for newgate literature is on the wane and that when the public critic has right down undisguised immorality set before him the honest creature is shocked at it as he should be and can declare his indignation in good round terms of abuse the characters of the tale are immoral and no doubt of it but the writer humbly hopes the end is not so the public was in our notion dosed and poisoned by the prevailing style of literary practice and it was necessary to administer some medicine that would produce a wholesome nausea and afterwards bring about a more healthy habit  and thank heaven this effect has been produced in very many instances and that the catherine cathartic has acted most efficaciously the author has been pleased at the disgust which his work has excited and has watched with benevolent carefulness the wry faces that have been made by many of the patients who have swallowed the dose solomons remembers at the establishment in birchin lane where he had the honour of receiving his education there used to be administered to the boys a certain coughmedicine which was so excessively agreeable that all the lads longed to have colds in order to partake of the remedy some of our popular novelists have compounded their drugs in a similar way and made them so palatable that a public once healthy and honest has been wellnigh poisoned by their wares solomons defies anyone to say the like of himselfthat his doses have been as pleasant as champagne and his pills as sweet as barleysugarit has been his attempt to make vice to appear entirely vicious and in those instances where he hath occasionally introduced something like virtue to make the sham as evident as possible and not allow the meanest capacity a single chance to mistake it  and what has been the consequence that wholesome nausea which it has been his good fortune to create wherever he has been allowed to practise in his humble circle  has anyone thrown away a halfpennyworth of sympathy upon any person mentioned in this history surely no but abler and more famous men than solomons have taken a different plan and it becomes every man in his vocation to cry out against such and expose their errors as best he may  labouring under such ideas mr isaac solomons junior produced the romance of mrs cat and confesses himself completely happy to have brought it to a conclusion his poem may be dullay and probably is the great blackmore the great dennis the great sprat the great pomfret not to mention great men of our own timehave they not also been dull and had pretty reputations too be it granted solomons is dull but dont attack his morality he humbly submits that in his poem no man shall mistake virtue for vice no man shall allow a single sentiment of pity or admiration to enter his bosom for any character of the piece it being from beginning to end a scene of unmixed rascality performed by persons who never deviate into good feeling and although he doth not pretend to equal the great modern authors whom he hath mentioned in wit or descriptive power yet in the point of moral he meekly believes that he has been their superior feeling the greatest disgust for the characters he describes and using his humble endeavour to cause the public also to hate them  horsemonger lane january 1840
