xx dies irae     i a discussion somewhat in the air  the flying ship of professor lucifer sang through the skies like a silver arrow the bleak white steel of it gleaming in the bleak blue emptiness of the evening that it was far above the earth was no expression for it to the two men in it it seemed to be far above the stars the professor had himself invented the flying machine and had also invented nearly everything in it every sort of tool or apparatus had in consequence to the full that fantastic and distorted look which belongs to the miracles of science for the world of science and evolution is far more nameless and elusive and like a dream than the world of poetry and religion since in the latter images and ideas remain themselves eternally while it is the whole idea of evolution that identities melt into each other as they do in a nightmare  all the tools of professor lucifer were the ancient human tools gone mad grown into unrecognizable shapes forgetful of their origin forgetful of their names that thing which looked like an enormous key with three wheels was really a patent and very deadly revolver that object which seemed to be created by the entanglement of two corkscrews was really the key the thing which might have been mistaken for a tricycle turned upsidedown was the inexpressibly important instrument to which the corkscrew was the key all these things as i say the professor had invented he had invented everything in the flying ship with the exception perhaps of himself this he had been born too late actually to inaugurate but he believed at least that he had considerably improved it  there was however another man on board so to speak at the time him also by a curious coincidence the professor had not invented and him he had not even very greatly improved though he had fished him up with a lasso out of his own back garden in western bulgaria with the pure object of improving him he was an exceedingly holy man almost entirely covered with white hair you could see nothing but his eyes and he seemed to talk with them a monk of immense learning and acute intellect he had made himself happy in a little stone hut and a little stony garden in the balkans chiefly by writing the most crushing refutations of exposures of certain heresies the last professors of which had been burnt generally by each other precisely 1119 years previously they were really very plausible and thoughtful heresies and it was really a creditable or even glorious circumstance that the old monk had been intellectual enough to detect their fallacy the only misfortune was that nobody in the modern world was intellectual enough even to understand their argument the old monk one of whose names was michael and the other a name quite impossible to remember or repeat in our western civilization had however as i have said made himself quite happy while he was in a mountain hermitage in the society of wild animals and now that his luck had lifted him above all the mountains in the society of a wild physicist he made himself happy still  i have no intention my good michael said professor lucifer of endeavouring to convert you by argument the imbecility of your traditions can be quite finally exhibited to anybody with mere ordinary knowledge of the world the same kind of knowledge which teaches us not to sit in draughts or not to encourage friendliness in impecunious people it is folly to talk of this or that demonstrating the rationalist philosophy everything demonstrates it rubbing shoulders with men of all kinds  you will forgive me said the monk meekly from under loads of white beard but i fear i do not understand was it in order that i might rub my shoulder against men of all kinds that you put me inside this thing  an entertaining retort in the narrow and deductive manner of the middle ages replied the professor calmly but even upon your own basis i will illustrate my point we are up in the sky in your religion and all the religions as far as i know and i know everything the sky is made the symbol of everything that is sacred and merciful well now you are in the sky you know better phrase it how you like twist it how you like you know that you know better you know what are a mans real feelings about the heavens when he finds himself alone in the heavens surrounded by the heavens you know the truth and the truth is this the heavens are evil the sky is evil the stars are evil this mere space this mere quantity terrifies a man more than tigers or the terrible plague you know that since our science has spoken the bottom has fallen out of the universe now heaven is the hopeless thing more hopeless than any hell now if there be any comfort for all your miserable progeny of morbid apes it must be in the earth underneath you under the roots of the grass in the place where hell was of old the fiery crypts the lurid cellars of the underworld to which you once condemned the wicked are hideous enough but at least they are more homely than the heaven in which we ride and the time will come when you will all hide in them to escape the horror of the stars  i hope you will excuse my interrupting you said michael with a slight cough but i have always noticed  go on pray go on said professor lucifer radiantly i really like to draw out your simple ideas  well the fact is said the other that much as i admire your rhetoric and the rhetoric of your school from a purely verbal point of view such little study of you and your school in human history as i have been enabled to make has led me toerrather singular conclusion which i find great difficulty in expressing especially in a foreign language  come come said the professor encouragingly ill help you out how did my view strike you  well the truth is i know i dont express it properly but somehow it seemed to me that you always convey ideas of that kind with most eloquence whenerwhen  oh get on cried lucifer boisterously  well in point of fact when your flying ship is just going to run into something i thought you wouldnt mind my mentioning it but its running into something now  lucifer exploded with an oath and leapt erect leaning hard upon the handle that acted as a helm to the vessel for the last ten minutes they had been shooting downwards into great cracks and caverns of cloud now through a sort of purple haze could be seen comparatively near to them what seemed to be the upper part of a huge dark orb or sphere islanded in a sea of cloud the professors eyes were blazing like a maniacs  it is a new world he cried with a dreadful mirth it is a new planet and it shall bear my name this star and not that other vulgar one shall be lucifer sun of the morning here we will have no chartered lunacies here we will have no gods here man shall be as innocent as the daisies as innocent and as cruelhere the intellect  there seems said michael timidly to be something sticking up in the middle of it  so there is said the professor leaning over the side of the ship his spectacles shining with intellectual excitement what can it be it might of course be merely a  then a shriek indescribable broke out of him of a sudden and he flung up his arms like a lost spirit the monk took the helm in a tired way he did not seem much astonished for he came from an ignorant part of the world in which it is not uncommon for lost spirits to shriek when they see the curious shape which the professor had just seen on the top of the mysterious ball but he took the helm only just in time and by driving it hard to the left he prevented the flying ship from smashing into st pauls cathedral  a plain of sadcoloured cloud lay along the level of the top of the cathedral dome so that the ball and the cross looked like a buoy riding on a leaden sea as the flying ship swept towards it this plain of cloud looked as dry and definite and rocky as any grey desert hence it gave to the mind and body a sharp and unearthly sensation when the ship cut and sank into the cloud as into any common mist a thing without resistance there was as it were a deadly shock in the fact that there was no shock it was as if they had cloven into ancient cliffs like so much butter but sensations awaited them which were much stranger than those of sinking through the solid earth for a moment their eyes and nostrils were stopped with darkness and opaque cloud then the darkness warmed into a kind of brown fog and far far below them the brown fog fell until it warmed into fire through the dense london atmosphere they could see below them the flaming london lights lights which lay beneath them in squares and oblongs of fire the fog and fire were mixed in a passionate vapour you might say that the fog was drowning the flames or you might say that the flames had set the fog on fire beside the ship and beneath it for it swung just under the ball the immeasurable dome itself shot out and down into the dark like a combination of voiceless cataracts or it was like some cyclopean seabeast sitting above london and letting down its tentacles bewilderingly on every side a monstrosity in that starless heaven for the clouds that belonged to london had closed over the heads of the voyagers sealing up the entrance of the upper air they had broken through a roof and come into a temple of twilight  they were so near to the ball that lucifer leaned his hand against it holding the vessel away as men push a boat off from a bank above it the cross already draped in the dark mists of the borderland was shadowy and more awful in shape and size  professor lucifer slapped his hand twice upon the surface of the great orb as if he were caressing some enormous animal this is the fellow he said this is the one for my money  may i with all respect inquire asked the old monk what on earth you are talking about  why this cried lucifer smiting the ball again here is the only symbol my boy so fat so satisfied not like that scraggy individual stretching his arms in stark weariness and he pointed up to the cross his face dark with a grin i was telling you just now michael that i can prove the best part of the rationalist case and the christian humbug from any symbol you liked to give me from any instance i came across here is an instance with a vengeance what could possibly express your philosophy and my philosophy better than the shape of that cross and the shape of this ball this globe is reasonable that cross is unreasonable it is a fourlegged animal with one leg longer than the others the globe is inevitable the cross is arbitrary above all the globe is at unity with itself the cross is primarily and above all things at enmity with itself the cross is the conflict of two hostile lines of irreconcilable direction that silent thing up there is essentially a collision a crash a struggle in stone pah that sacred symbol of yours has actually given its name to a description of desperation and muddle when we speak of men at once ignorant of each other and frustrated by each other we say they are at crosspurposes away with the thing the very shape of it is a contradiction in terms  what you say is perfectly true said michael with serenity but we like contradictions in terms man is a contradiction in terms he is a beast whose superiority to other beasts consists in having fallen that cross is as you say an eternal collision so am i that is a struggle in stone every form of life is a struggle in flesh the shape of the cross is irrational just as the shape of the human animal is irrational you say the cross is a quadruped with one limb longer than the rest i say man is a quadruped who only uses two of his legs  the professor frowned thoughtfully for an instant and said of course everything is relative and i would not deny that the element of struggle and selfcontradiction represented by that cross has a necessary place at a certain evolutionary stage but surely the cross is the lower development and the sphere the higher after all it is easy enough to see what is really wrong with wrens architectural arrangement  and what is that pray inquired michael meekly  the cross is on top of the ball said professor lucifer simply that is surely wrong the ball should be on top of the cross the cross is a mere barbaric prop the ball is perfection the cross at its best is but the bitter tree of mans history the ball is the rounded the ripe and final fruit and the fruit should be at the top of the tree not at the bottom of it  oh said the monk a wrinkle coming into his forehead so you think that in a rationalistic scheme of symbolism the ball should be on top of the cross  it sums up my whole allegory said the professor  well that is really very interesting resumed michael slowly because i think in that case you would see a most singular effect an effect that has generally been achieved by all those able and powerful systems which rationalism or the religion of the ball has produced to lead or teach mankind you would see i think that thing happen which is always the ultimate embodiment and logical outcome of your logical scheme  what are you talking about asked lucifer what would happen  i mean it would fall down said the monk looking wistfully into the void  lucifer made an angry movement and opened his mouth to speak but michael with all his air of deliberation was proceeding before he could bring out a word  i once knew a man like you lucifer he said with a maddening monotony and slowness of articulation he took this  there is no man like me cried lucifer with a violence that shook the ship  as i was observing continued michael this man also took the view that the symbol of christianity was a symbol of savagery and all unreason his history is rather amusing it is also a perfect allegory of what happens to rationalists like yourself he began of course by refusing to allow a crucifix in his house or round his wifes neck or even in a picture he said as you say that it was an arbitrary and fantastic shape that it was a monstrosity loved because it was paradoxical then he began to grow fiercer and more eccentric he would batter the crosses by the roadside for he lived in a roman catholic country finally in a height of frenzy he climbed the steeple of the parish church and tore down the cross waving it in the air and uttering wild soliloquies up there under the stars then one still summer evening as he was wending his way homewards along a lane the devil of his madness came upon him with a violence and transfiguration which changes the world he was standing smoking for a moment in the front of an interminable line of palings when his eyes were opened not a light shifted not a leaf stirred but he saw as if by a sudden change in the eyesight that this paling was an army of innumerable crosses linked together over hill and dale and he whirled up his heavy stick and went at it as if at an army mile after mile along his homeward path he broke it down and tore it up for he hated the cross and every paling is a wall of crosses when he returned to his house he was a literal madman he sat upon a chair and then started up from it for the crossbars of the carpentry repeated the intolerable image he flung himself upon a bed only to remember that this too like all workmanlike things was constructed on the accursed plan he broke his furniture because it was made of crosses he burnt his house because it was made of crosses he was found in the river  lucifer was looking at him with a bitten lip  is that story really true he asked  oh no said michael airily it is a parable it is a parable of you and all your rationalists you begin by breaking up the cross but you end by breaking up the habitable world we leave you saying that nobody ought to join the church against his will when we meet you again you are saying that no one has any will to join it with we leave you saying that there is no such place as eden we find you saying that there is no such place as ireland you start by hating the irrational and you come to hate everything for everything is irrational and so  lucifer leapt upon him with a cry like a wild beasts ah he screamed to every man his madness you are mad on the cross let it save you  and with a herculean energy he forced the monk backwards out of the reeling car on to the upper part of the stone ball michael with as abrupt an agility caught one of the beams of the cross and saved himself from falling at the same instant lucifer drove down a lever and the ship shot up with him in it alone  ha ha he yelled what sort of a support do you find it old fellow  for practical purposes of support replied michael grimly it is at any rate a great deal better than the ball may i ask if you are going to leave me here  yes yes i mount i mount cried the professor in ungovernable excitement altiora peto my path is upward  how often have you told me professor that there is really no up or down in space said the monk i shall mount up as much as you will  indeed said lucifer leering over the side of the flying ship may i ask what you are going to do  the monk pointed downward at ludgate hill i am going he said to climb up into a star  those who look at the matter most superficially regard paradox as something which belongs to jesting and light journalism paradox of this kind is to be found in the saying of the dandy in the decadent comedy life is much too important to be taken seriously those who look at the matter a little more deeply or delicately see that paradox is a thing which especially belongs to all religions paradox of this kind is to be found in such a saying as the meek shall inherit the earth but those who see and feel the fundamental fact of the matter know that paradox is a thing which belongs not to religion only but to all vivid and violent practical crises of human living this kind of paradox may be clearly perceived by anybody who happens to be hanging in midspace clinging to one arm of the cross of st pauls  father michael in spite of his years and in spite of his asceticism or because of it for all i know was a very healthy and happy old gentleman and as he swung on a bar above the sickening emptiness of air he realized with that sort of dead detachment which belongs to the brains of those in peril the deathless and hopeless contradiction which is involved in the mere idea of courage he was a happy and healthy old gentleman and therefore he was quite careless about it and he felt as every man feels in the taut moment of such terror that his chief danger was terror itself his only possible strength would be a coolness amounting to carelessness a carelessness amounting almost to a suicidal swagger his one wild chance of coming out safely would be in not too desperately desiring to be safe there might be footholds down that awful facade if only he could not care whether they were footholds or no if he were foolhardy he might escape if he were wise he would stop where he was till he dropped from the cross like a stone and this antinomy kept on repeating itself in his mind a contradiction as large and staring as the immense contradiction of the cross he remembered having often heard the words whosoever shall lose his life the same shall save it he remembered with a sort of strange pity that this had always been made to mean that whoever lost his physical life should save his spiritual life now he knew the truth that is known to all fighters and hunters and climbers of cliffs he knew that even his animal life could only be saved by a considerable readiness to lose it  some will think it improbable that a human soul swinging desperately in midair should think about philosophical inconsistencies but such extreme states are dangerous things to dogmatize about frequently they produce a certain useless and joyless activity of the mere intellect thought not only divorced from hope but even from desire and if it is impossible to dogmatize about such states it is still more impossible to describe them to this spasm of sanity and clarity in michaels mind succeeded a spasm of the elemental terror the terror of the animal in us which regards the whole universe as its enemy which when it is victorious has no pity and so when it is defeated has no imaginable hope of that ten minutes of terror it is not possible to speak in human words but then again in that damnable darkness there began to grow a strange dawn as of grey and pale silver and of this ultimate resignation or certainty it is even less possible to write it is something stranger than hell itself it is perhaps the last of the secrets of god at the highest crisis of some incurable anguish there will suddenly fall upon the man the stillness of an insane contentment it is not hope for hope is broken and romantic and concerned with the future this is complete and of the present it is not faith for faith by its very nature is fierce and as it were at once doubtful and defiant but this is simply a satisfaction it is not knowledge for the intellect seems to have no particular part in it nor is it as the modern idiots would certainly say it is a mere numbness or negative paralysis of the powers of grief it is not negative in the least it is as positive as good news in some sense indeed it is good news it seems almost as if there were some equality among things some balance in all possible contingencies which we are not permitted to know lest we should learn indifference to good and evil but which is sometimes shown to us for an instant as a last aid in our last agony  michael certainly could not have given any sort of rational account of this vast unmeaning satisfaction which soaked through him and filled him to the brim he felt with a sort of halfwitted lucidity that the cross was there and the ball was there and the dome was there that he was going to climb down from them and that he did not mind in the least whether he was killed or not this mysterious mood lasted long enough to start him on his dreadful descent and to force him to continue it but six times before he reached the highest of the outer galleries terror had returned on him like a flying storm of darkness and thunder by the time he had reached that place of safety he almost felt as in some impossible fit of drunkenness that he had two heads one was calm careless and efficient the other saw the danger like a deadly map was wise careful and useless he had fancied that he would have to let himself vertically down the face of the whole building when he dropped into the upper gallery he still felt as far from the terrestrial globe as if he had only dropped from the sun to the moon he paused a little panting in the gallery under the ball and idly kicked his heels moving a few yards along it and as he did so a thunderbolt struck his soul a man a heavy ordinary man with a composed indifferent face and a prosaic sort of uniform with a row of buttons blocked his way michael had no mind to wonder whether this solid astonished man with the brown moustache and the nickel buttons had also come on a flying ship he merely let his mind float in an endless felicity about the man he thought how nice it would be if he had to live up in that gallery with that one man for ever he thought how he would luxuriate in the nameless shades of this mans soul and then hear with an endless excitement about the nameless shades of the souls of all his aunts and uncles a moment before he had been dying alone now he was living in the same world with a man an inexhaustible ecstasy in the gallery below the ball father michael had found that man who is the noblest and most divine and most lovable of all men better than all the saints greater than all the heroesman friday  in the confused colour and music of his new paradise michael heard only in a faint and distant fashion some remarks that this beautiful solid man seemed to be making to him remarks about something or other being after hours and against orders he also seemed to be asking how michael got up there this beautiful man evidently felt as michael did that the earth was a star and was set in heaven  at length michael sated himself with the mere sensual music of the voice of the man in buttons he began to listen to what he said and even to make some attempt at answering a question which appeared to have been put several times and was now put with some excess of emphasis michael realized that the image of god in nickel buttons was asking him how he had come there he said that he had come in lucifers ship on his giving this answer the demeanour of the image of god underwent a remarkable change from addressing michael gruffly as if he were a malefactor he began suddenly to speak to him with a sort of eager and feverish amiability as if he were a child he seemed particularly anxious to coax him away from the balustrade he led him by the arm towards a door leading into the building itself soothing him all the time he gave what even michael slight as was his knowledge of the world felt to be an improbable account of the sumptuous pleasures and varied advantages awaiting him downstairs michael followed him however if only out of politeness down an apparently interminable spiral of staircase at one point a door opened michael stepped through it and the unaccountable man in buttons leapt after him and pinioned him where he stood but he only wished to stand to stand and stare he had stepped as it were into another infinity out under the dome of another heaven but this was a dome of heaven made by man the gold and green and crimson of its sunset were not in the shapeless clouds but in shapes of cherubim and seraphim awful human shapes with a passionate plumage its stars were not above but far below like fallen stars still in unbroken constellations the dome itself was full of darkness and far below lower even than the lights could be seen creeping or motionless great black masses of men the tongue of a terrible organ seemed to shake the very air in the whole void and through it there came up to michael the sound of a tongue more terrible the dreadful everlasting voice of man calling to his gods from the beginning to the end of the world michael felt almost as if he were a god and all the voices were hurled at him  no the pretty things arent here said the demigod in buttons caressingly the pretty things are downstairs you come along with me theres something that will surprise you downstairs something you want very much to see  evidently the man in buttons did not feel like a god so michael made no attempt to explain his feelings to him but followed him meekly enough down the trail of the serpentine staircase he had no notion where or at what level he was he was still full of the cold splendour of space and of what a french writer has brilliantly named the vertigo of the infinite when another door opened and with a shock indescribable he found himself on the familiar level in a street full of faces with the houses and even the lampposts above his head he felt suddenly happy and suddenly indescribably small he fancied he had been changed into a child again his eyes sought the pavement seriously as childrens do as if it were a thing with which something satisfactory could be done he felt the full warmth of that pleasure from which the proud shut themselves out the pleasure which not only goes with humiliation but which almost is humiliation men who have escaped death by a hair have it and men whose love is returned by a woman unexpectedly and men whose sins are forgiven them everything his eye fell on it feasted on not aesthetically but with a plain jolly appetite as of a boy eating buns he relished the squareness of the houses he liked their clean angles as if he had just cut them with a knife the lit squares of the shop windows excited him as the young are excited by the lit stage of some promising pantomime he happened to see in one shop which projected with a bulging bravery on to the pavement some square tins of potted meat and it seemed like a hint of a hundred hilarious high teas in a hundred streets of the world he was perhaps the happiest of all the children of men for in that unendurable instant when he hung half slipping to the ball of st pauls the whole universe had been destroyed and recreated  suddenly through all the din of the dark streets came a crash of glass with that mysterious suddenness of the cockney mob a rush was made in the right direction a dingy office next to the shop of the potted meat the pane of glass was lying in splinters about the pavement and the police already had their hands on a very tall young man with dark lank hair and dark dazed eyes with a grey plaid over his shoulder who had just smashed the shop window with a single blow of his stick  id do it again said the young man with a furious white face anybody would have done it did you see what it said i swear id do it again then his eyes encountered the monkish habit of michael and he pulled off his grey tamoshanter with the gesture of a catholic  father did you see what they said he cried trembling did you see what they dared to say i didnt understand it at first i read it half through before i broke the window  michael felt he knew not how the whole peace of the world was pent up painfully in his heart the new and childlike world which he had seen so suddenly men had not seen at all here they were still at their old bewildering pardonable useless quarrels with so much to be said on both sides and so little that need be said at all a fierce inspiration fell on him suddenly he would strike them where they stood with the love of god they should not move till they saw their own sweet and startling existence they should not go from that place till they went home embracing like brothers and shouting like men delivered from the cross from which he had fallen fell the shadow of its fantastic mercy and the first three words he spoke in a voice like a silver trumpet held men as still as stones perhaps if he had spoken there for an hour in his illumination he might have founded a religion on ludgate hill but the heavy hand of his guide fell suddenly on his shoulder  this poor fellow is dotty he said goodhumouredly to the crowd i found him wandering in the cathedral says he came in a flying ship is there a constable to spare to take care of him  there was a constable to spare two other constables attended to the tall young man in grey a fourth concerned himself with the owner of the shop who showed some tendency to be turbulent they took the tall young man away to a magistrate whither we shall follow him in an ensuing chapter and they took the happiest man in the world away to an asylum     ii the religion of the stipendiary magistrate  the editorial office of the atheist had for some years past become less and less prominently interesting as a feature of ludgate hill the paper was unsuited to the atmosphere it showed an interest in the bible unknown in the district and a knowledge of that volume to which nobody else on ludgate hill could make any conspicuous claim it was in vain that the editor of the atheist filled his front window with fierce and final demands as to what noah in the ark did with the neck of the giraffe it was in vain that he asked violently as for the last time how the statement god is spirit could be reconciled with the statement the earth is his footstool it was in vain that he cried with an accusing energy that the bishop of london was paid l12000 a year for pretending to believe that the whale swallowed jonah it was in vain that he hung in conspicuous places the most thrilling scientific calculations about the width of the throat of a whale was it nothing to them all they that passed by did his sudden and splendid and truly sincere indignation never stir any of the people pouring down ludgate hill never the little man who edited the atheist would rush from his shop on starlit evenings and shake his fist at st pauls in the passion of his holy war upon the holy place he might have spared his emotion the cross at the top of st pauls and the atheist shop at the foot of it were alike remote from the world the shop and the cross were equally uplifted and alone in the empty heavens  to the little man who edited the atheist a fiery little scotchman with fiery red hair and beard going by the name of turnbull all this decline in public importance seemed not so much sad or even mad but merely bewildering and unaccountable he had said the worst thing that could be said and it seemed accepted and ignored like the ordinary second best of the politicians every day his blasphemies looked more glaring and every day the dust lay thicker upon them it made him feel as if he were moving in a world of idiots he seemed among a race of men who smiled when told of their own death or looked vacantly at the day of judgement year after year went by and year after year the death of god in a shop in ludgate became a less and less important occurrence all the forward men of his age discouraged turnbull the socialists said he was cursing priests when he should be cursing capitalists the artists said that the soul was most spiritual not when freed from religion but when freed from morality year after year went by and at least a man came by who treated mr turnbulls secularist shop with a real respect and seriousness he was a young man in a grey plaid and he smashed the window  he was a young man born in the bay of arisaig opposite rum and the isle of skye his high hawklike features and snaky black hair bore the mark of that unknown historic thing which is crudely called celtic but which is probably far older than the celts whoever they were he was in name and stock a highlander of the macdonalds but his family took as was common in such cases the name of a subordinate sept as a surname and for all the purposes which could be answered in london he called himself evan macian he had been brought up in some loneliness and seclusion as a strict roman catholic in the midst of that little wedge of roman catholics which is driven into the western highlands and he had found his way as far as fleet street seeking some halfpromised employment without having properly realized that there were in the world any people who were not roman catholics he had uncovered himself for a few moments before the statue of queen anne in front of st pauls cathedral under the firm impression that it was a figure of the virgin mary he was somewhat surprised at the lack of deference shown to the figure by the people bustling by he did not understand that their one essential historical principle the one law truly graven on their hearts was the great and comforting statement that queen anne is dead this faith was as fundamental as his faith that our lady was alive any persons he had talked to since he had touched the fringe of our fashion or civilization had been by a coincidence sympathetic or hypocritical or if they had spoken some established blasphemies he had been unable to understand them merely owing to the preoccupied satisfaction of his mind  on that fantastic fringe of the gaelic land where he walked as a boy the cliffs were as fantastic as the clouds heaven seemed to humble itself and come closer to the earth the common paths of his little village began to climb quite suddenly and seemed resolved to go to heaven the sky seemed to fall down towards the hills the hills took hold upon the sky in the sumptuous sunset of gold and purple and peacock green cloudlets and islets were the same evan lived like a man walking on a borderland the borderland between this world and another like so many men and nations who grow up with nature and the common things he understood the supernatural before he understood the natural he had looked at dim angels standing kneedeep in the grass before he had looked at the grass he knew that our ladys robes were blue before he knew the wild roses round her feet were red the deeper his memory plunged into the dark house of childhood the nearer and nearer he came to the things that cannot be named all through his life he thought of the daylight world as a sort of divine debris the broken remainder of his first vision the skies and mountains were the splendid offscourings of another place the stars were lost jewels of the queen our lady had gone and left the stars by accident  his private tradition was equally wild and unworldly his greatgrandfather had been cut down at culloden certain in his last instant that god would restore the king his grandfather then a boy of ten had taken the terrible claymore from the hand of the dead and hung it up in his house burnishing it and sharpening it for sixty years to be ready for the next rebellion his father the youngest son and the last left alive had refused to attend on queen victoria in scotland and evan himself had been of one piece with his progenitors and was not dead with them but alive in the twentieth century he was not in the least the pathetic jacobite of whom we read left behind by a final advance of all things he was in his own fancy a conspirator fierce and up to date in the long dark afternoons of the highland winter he plotted and fumed in the dark he drew plans of the capture of london on the desolate sand of arisaig  when he came up to capture london it was not with an army of white cockades but with a stick and a satchel london overawed him a little not because he thought it grand or even terrible but because it bewildered him it was not the golden city or even hell it was limbo he had one shock of sentiment when he turned that wonderful corner of fleet street and saw st pauls sitting in the sky  ah he said after a long pause that sort of thing was built under the stuarts then with a sour grin he asked himself what was the corresponding monument of the brunswicks and the protestant constitution after some warning he selected a skysign of some pill  half an hour afterwards his emotions left him with an emptied mind on the same spot and it was in a mood of mere idle investigation that he happened to come to a standstill opposite the office of the atheist he did not see the word atheist or if he did it is quite possible that he did not know the meaning of the word even as it was the document would not have shocked even the innocent highlander but for the troublesome and quite unforeseen fact that the innocent highlander read it stolidly to the end a thing unknown among the most enthusiastic subscribers to the paper and calculated in any case to create a new situation  with a smart journalistic instinct characteristic of all his school the editor of the atheist had put first in his paper and most prominently in his window an article called the mesopotamian mythology and its effects on syriac folk lore mr evan macian began to read this quite idly as he would have read a public statement beginning with a young girl dying in brighton and ending with bile beans he received the very considerable amount of information accumulated by the author with that tired clearness of the mind which children have on heavy summer afternoonsthat tired clearness which leads them to go on asking questions long after they have lost interest in the subject and are as bored as their nurse the streets were full of people and empty of adventures he might as well know about the gods of mesopotamia as not so he flattened his long lean face against the dim bleak pane of the window and read all there was to read about mesopotamian gods he read how the mesopotamians had a god named sho sometimes pronounced ji and that he was described as being very powerful a striking similarity to some expressions about jahveh who is also described as having power evan had never heard of jahveh in his life and imagining him to be some other mesopotamian idol read on with a dull curiosity he learnt that the name sho under its third form of psa occurs in an early legend which describes how the deity after the manner of jupiter on so many occasions seduced a virgin and begat a hero this hero whose name is not essential to our existence was it was said the chief hero and saviour of the mesopotamian ethical scheme then followed a paragraph giving other examples of such heroes and saviours being born of some profligate intercourse between god and mortal then followed a paragraphbut evan did not understand it he read it again and then again then he did understand it the glass fell in ringing fragments on to the pavement and evan sprang over the barrier into the shop brandishing his stick  what is this cried little mr turnbull starting up with hair aflame how dare you break my window  because it was the quickest cut to you cried evan stamping stand up and fight you crapulous coward you dirty lunatic stand up will you have you any weapons here  are you mad asked turnbull glaring  are you cried evan can you be anything else when you plaster your own house with that goddefying filth stand up and fight i say  a great light like dawn came into mr turnbulls face behind his red hair and beard he turned deadly pale with pleasure here after twenty lone years of useless toil he had his reward someone was angry with the paper he bounded to his feet like a boy he saw a new youth opening before him and as not unfrequently happens to middleaged gentlemen when they see a new youth opening before them he found himself in the presence of the police  the policemen after some ponderous questionings collared both the two enthusiasts they were more respectful however to the young man who had smashed the window than to the miscreant who had had his window smashed there was an air of refined mystery about evan macian which did not exist in the irate little shopkeeper an air of refined mystery which appealed to the policemen for policemen like most other english types are at once snobs and poets macian might possibly be a gentleman they felt the editor manifestly was not and the editors fine rational republican appeals to his respect for law and his ardour to be tried by his fellow citizens seemed to the police quite as much gibberish as evans mysticism could have done the police were not used to hearing principles even the principles of their own existence  the police magistrate before whom they were hurried and tried was a mr cumberland vane a cheerful middleaged gentleman honourably celebrated for the lightness of his sentences and the lightness of his conversation he occasionally worked himself up into a sort of theoretic rage about certain particular offenders such as the men who took pokers to their wives talked in a loose sentimental way about the desirability of flogging them and was hopelessly bewildered by the fact that the wives seemed even more angry with him than with their husbands he was a tall spruce man with a twist of black moustache and incomparable morning dress he looked like a gentleman and yet somehow like a stage gentleman  he had often treated serious crimes against mere order or property with a humane flippancy hence about the mere breaking of an editors window he was almost uproarious  come mr macian come he said leaning back in his chair do you generally enter you friends houses by walking through the glass laughter  he is not my friend said evan with the stolidity of a dull child  not your friend eh said the magistrate sparkling is he your brotherinlaw loud and prolonged laughter  he is my enemy said evan simply he is the enemy of god  mr vane shifted sharply in his seat dropping the eyeglass out of his eye in a momentary and not unmanly embarrassment  you mustnt talk like that here he said roughly and in a kind of hurry that has nothing to do with us  evan opened his great blue eyes god he began  be quiet said the magistrate angrily it is most undesirable that things of that sort should be spoken aboutain public and in an ordinary court of justice religion isatoo personal a matter to be mentioned in such a place  is it answered the highlander then what did those policemen swear by just now  that is no parallel answered vane rather irritably of course there is a form of oathto be taken reverentlyreverently and theres an end of it but to talk in a public place about ones most sacred and private sentimentswell i call it bad taste slight applause i call it irreverent i call it irreverent and im not specially orthodox either  i see you are not said evan but i am  we are wondering from the point said the police magistrate pulling himself together  may i ask why you smashed this worthy citizens window  evan turned a little pale at the mere memory but he answered with the same cold and deadly literalism that he showed throughout  because he blasphemed our lady  i tell you once and for all cried mr cumberland vane rapping his knuckles angrily on the table i tell you once and for all my man that i will not have you turning on any religious rant or cant here dont imagine that it will impress me the most religious people are not those who talk about it applause you answer the questions and do nothing else  i did nothing else said evan with a slight smile  eh cried vane glaring through his eyeglass  you asked me why i broke his window said macian with a face of wood i answered because he blasphemed our lady i had no other reason so i have no other answer vane continued to gaze at him with a sternness not habitual to him  you are not going the right way to work sir he said with severity you are not going the right way to work toahave your case treated with special consideration if you had simply expressed regret for what you had done i should have been strongly inclined to dismiss the matter as an outbreak of temper even now if you say that you are sorry i shall only  but i am not in the least sorry said evan i am very pleased  i really believe you are insane said the stipendiary indignantly for he had really been doing his best as a goodnatured man to compose the dispute what conceivable right have you to break other peoples windows because their opinions do not agree with yours this man only gave expression to his sincere belief  so did i said the highlander  and who are you exploded vane are your views necessarily the right ones are you necessarily in possession of the truth  yes said macian  the magistrate broke into a contemptuous laugh  oh you want a nurse to look after you he said you must pay l10  evan macian plunged his hands into his loose grey garment and drew out a queer looking leather purse it contained exactly twelve sovereigns he paid down the ten coin by coin in silence and equally silently returned the remaining two to the receptacle then he said may i say a word your worship  cumberland vane seemed half hypnotized with the silence and automatic movements of the stranger he made a movement with his head which might have been either yes or no i only wished to say your worship said macian putting back the purse in his trouser pocket that smashing that shop window was i confess a useless and rather irregular business it may be excused however as a mere preliminary to further proceedings a sort of preface wherever and whenever i meet that man and he pointed to the editor of the atheist whether it be outside this door in ten minutes from now or twenty years hence in some distant country wherever and whenever i meet that man i will fight him do not be afraid i will not rush at him like a bully or bear him down with any brute superiority i will fight him like a gentleman i will fight him as our fathers fought he shall choose how sword or pistol horse or foot but if he refuses i will write his cowardice on every wall in the world if he had said of my mother what he said of the mother of god there is not a club of clean men in europe that would deny my right to call him out if he had said it of my wife you english would yourselves have pardoned me for beating him like a dog in the market place your worship i have no mother i have no wife i have only that which the poor have equally with the rich which the lonely have equally with the man of many friends to me this whole strange world is homely because in the heart of it there is a home to me this cruel world is kindly because higher than the heavens there is something more human than humanity if a man must not fight for this may he fight for anything i would fight for my friend but if i lost my friend i should still be there i would fight for my country but if i lost my country i should still exist but if what that devil dreams were true i should not bei should burst like a bubble and be gone i could not live in that imbecile universe shall i not fight for my own existence  the magistrate recovered his voice and his presence of mind the first part of the speech the bombastic and brutally practical challenge stunned him with surprise but the rest of evans remarks branching off as they did into theoretic phrases gave his vague and very english mind full of memories of the hedging and compromise in english public speaking an indistinct sensation of relief as if the man though mad were not so dangerous as he had thought he went into a sort of weary laughter  for heavens sake man he said dont talk so much let other people have a chance laughter i trust all that you said about asking mr turnbull to fight may be regarded as rubbish in case of accidents however i must bind you over to keep the peace  to keep the peace repeated evan with whom  with mr turnbull said vane  certainly not answered macian what has he to do with peace  do you mean to say began the magistrate that you refuse to the voice of turnbull himself clove in for the first time  might i suggest he said that i your worship can settle to some extent this absurd matter myself this rather wild gentleman promises that he will not attack me with any ordinary assaultand if he does you may be sure the police shall hear of it but he says he will not he says he will challenge me to a duel and i cannot say anything stronger about his mental state than to say that i think that it is highly probable that he will laughter but it takes two to make a duel your worship renewed laughter i do not in the least mind being described on every wall in the world as the coward who would not fight a man in fleet street about whether the virgin mary had a parallel in mesopotamian mythology no your worship you need not trouble to bind him over to keep the peace i bind myself over to keep the peace and you may rest quite satisfied that there will be no duel with me in it  mr cumberland vane rolled about laughing in a sort of relief  youre like a breath of april sir he cried youre ozone after that fellow youre perfectly right perhaps i have taken the thing too seriously i should love to see him sending you challenges and to see you smiling well well  evan went out of the court of justice free but strangely shaken like a sick man any punishment of suppression he would have felt as natural but the sudden juncture between the laughter of his judge and the laughter of the man he had wronged made him feel suddenly small or at least defeated it was really true that the whole modern world regarded his world as a bubble no cruelty could have shown it but their kindness showed it with a ghastly clearness as he was brooding he suddenly became conscious of a small stern figure fronting him in silence its eyes were grey and awful and its beard red it was turnbull  well sir said the editor of the atheist where is the fight to be name the field sir  evan stood thunderstruck he stammered out something he knew not what he only guessed it by the answer of the other  do i want to fight do i want to fight cried the furious freethinker why you moonstruck scarecrow of superstition do you think your dirty saints are the only people who can die havent you hung atheists and burned them and boiled them and did they ever deny their faith do you think we dont want to fight night and day i have prayedi have longedfor an atheist revolutioni have longed to see your blood and ours on the streets let it be yours or mine  but you said began macian  i know said turnbull scornfully and what did you say you damned fool you said things that might have got us locked up for a year and shadowed by the coppers for half a decade if you wanted to fight why did you tell that ass you wanted to i got you out to fight if you want to now fight if you dare  i swear to you then said macian after a pause i swear to you that nothing shall come between us i swear to you that nothing shall be in my heart or in my head till our swords clash together i swear it by the god you have denied by the blessed lady you have blasphemed i swear it by the seven swords in her heart i swear it by the holy island where my fathers are by the honour of my mother by the secret of my people and by the chalice of the blood of god  the atheist drew up his head and i he said give my word     iii some old curiosities  the evening sky a dome of solid gold unflaked even by a single sunset cloud steeped the meanest sights of london in a strange and mellow light it made a little greasy street of st martins lane look as if it were paved with gold it made the pawnbrokers halfway down it shine as if it were really that mountain of piety that the french poetic instinct has named it it made the mean pseudofrench bookshop next but one to it a shop packed with dreary indecency show for a moment a kind of parisian colour and the shop that stood between the pawnshop and the shop of dreary indecency showed with quite a blaze of old world beauty for it was by accident a shop not unbeautiful in itself the front window had a glimmer of bronze and blue steel lit as by a few stars by the sparks of what were alleged to be jewels for it was in brief a shop of bricabrac and old curiosities a row of halfburnished seventeenthcentury swords ran like an ornate railing along the front of the window behind was a darker glimmer of old oak and old armour and higher up hung the most extraordinary looking south sea tools or utensils whether designed for killing enemies or merely for cooking them no mere white man could possibly conjecture but the romance of the eye which really on this rich evening clung about the shop had its main source in the accident of two doors standing open the front door that opened on the street and a back door that opened on an odd green square of garden that the sun turned to a square of gold there is nothing more beautiful than thus to look as it were through the archway of a house as if the open sky were an interior chamber and the sun a secret lamp of the place  i have suggested that the sunset light made everything lovely to say that it made the keeper of the curiosity shop lovely would be a tribute to it perhaps too extreme it would easily have made him beautiful if he had been merely squalid if he had been a jew of the fagin type but he was a jew of another and much less admirable type a jew with a very wellsounding name for though there are no hard tests for separating the tares and the wheat of any people one rude but efficient guide is that the nice jew is called moses solomon and the nasty jew is called thornton percy the keeper of the curiosity shop was of the thornton percy branch of the chosen people he belonged to those lost ten tribes whose industrious object is to lose themselves he was a man still young but already corpulent with sleek dark hair heavy handsome clothes and a full fat permanent smile which looked at the first glance kindly and at the second cowardly the name over his shop was henry gordon but two scotchmen who were in his shop that evening could come upon no trace of a scotch accent  these two scotchmen in this shop were careful purchasers but freehanded payers one of them who seemed to be the principal and the authority whom indeed mr henry gordon fancied he had seen somewhere before was a small sturdy fellow with fine grey eyes a square red tie and a square red beard that he carried aggressively forward as if he defied anyone to pull it the other kept so much in the background in comparison that he looked almost ghostly in his grey cloak or plaid a tall sallow silent young man  the two scotchmen were interested in seventeenthcentury swords they were fastidious about them they had a whole armoury of these weapons brought out and rolled clattering about the counter until they found two of precisely the same length presumably they desired the exact symmetry for some decorative trophy even then they felt the points poised the swords for balance and bent them in a circle to see that they sprang straight again which for decorative purposes seems carrying realism rather far  these will do said the strange person with the red beard and perhaps i had better pay for them at once and as you are the challenger mr macian perhaps you had better explain the situation  the tall scotchman in grey took a step forward and spoke in a voice quite clear and bold and yet somehow lifeless like a man going through an ancient formality  the fact is mr gordon we have to place our honour in your hands words have passed between mr turnbull and myself on a grave and invaluable matter which can only be atoned for by fighting unfortunately as the police are in some sense pursuing us we are hurried and must fight now and without seconds but if you will be so kind as to take us into your little garden and see far play we shall feel how  the shopman recovered himself from a stunning surprise and burst out  gentlemen are you drunk a duel a duel in my garden go home gentlemen go home why what did you quarrel about  we quarrelled said evan in the same dead voice about religion the fat shopkeeper rolled about in his chair with enjoyment  well this is a funny game he said so you want to commit murder on behalf of religion well well my religion is a little respect for humanity and  excuse me cut in turnbull suddenly and fiercely pointing towards the pawnbrokers next door dont you own that shop  whyeryes said gordon  and dont you own that shop repeated the secularist pointing backward to the pornographic bookseller  what if i do  why then cried turnbull with grating contempt i will leave the religion of humanity confidently in your hands but i am sorry i troubled you about such a thing as honour look here my man i do believe in humanity i do believe in liberty my father died for it under the swords of the yeomanry i am going to die for it if need be under that sword on your counter but if there is one sight that makes me doubt it it is your foul fat face it is hard to believe you were not meant to be ruled like a dog or killed like a cockroach dont try your slaves philosophy on me we are going to fight and we are going to fight in your garden with your swords be still raise your voice above a whisper and i run you through the body  turnbull put the bright point of the sword against the gay waistcoat of the dealer who stood choking with rage and fear and an astonishment so crushing as to be greater than either  macian said turnbull falling almost into the familiar tone of a business partner macian tie up this fellow and put a gag in his mouth be still i say or i kill you where you stand  the man was too frightened to scream but he struggled wildly while evan macian whose long lean hands were unusually powerful tightened some old curtain cords round him strapped a rope gag in his mouth and rolled him on his back on the floor  theres nothing very strong here said evan looking about him im afraid hell work through that gag in half an hour or so  yes said turnbull but one of us will be killed by that time  well lets hope so said the highlander glancing doubtfully at the squirming thing on the floor  and now said turnbull twirling his fiery moustache and fingering his sword let us go into the garden what an exquisite summer evening  macian said nothing but lifting his sword from the counter went out into the sun  the brilliant light ran along the blades filling the channels of them with white fire the combatants stuck their swords in the turf and took off their hats coats waistcoats and boots evan said a short latin prayer to himself during which turnbull made something of a parade of lighting a cigarette which he flung away the instant after when he saw macian apparently standing ready yet macian was not exactly ready he stood staring like a man stricken with a trance  what are you staring at asked turnbull do you see the bobbies  i see jerusalem said evan all covered with the shields and standards of the saracens  jerusalem said turnbull laughing well weve taken the only inhabitant into captivity  and he picked up his sword and made it whistle like a boys wand  i beg your pardon said macian dryly let us begin  macian made a military salute with his weapon which turnbull copied or parodied with an impatient contempt and in the stillness of the garden the swords came together with a clear sound like a bell the instant the blades touched each felt them tingle to their very points with a personal vitality as if they were two naked nerves of steel evan had worn throughout an air of apathy which might have been the stale apathy of one who wants nothing but it was indeed the more dreadful apathy of one who wants something and will care for nothing else and this was seen suddenly for the instant evan engaged he disengaged and lunged with an infernal violence his opponent with a desperate promptitude parried and riposted the parry only just succeeded the riposte failed something big and unbearable seemed to have broken finally out of evan in that first murderous lunge leaving him lighter and cooler and quicker upon his feet he fell to again fiercely still but now with a fierce caution the next moment turnbull lunged macian seemed to catch the point and throw it away from him and was thrusting back like a thunderbolt when a sound paralysed him another sound beside their ringing weapons turnbull perhaps from an equal astonishment perhaps from chivalry stopped also and forebore to send his sword through his exposed enemy  whats that asked evan hoarsely  a heavy scraping sound as of a trunk being dragged along a littered floor came from the dark shop behind them  the old jew has broken one of his strings and hes crawling about said turnbull be quick we must finish before he gets his gag out  yes yes quick on guard cried the highlander the blades crossed again with the same sound like song and the men went to work again with the same white and watchful faces evan in his impatience went back a little to his wildness he made windmills as the french duellists say and though he was probably a shade the better fencer of the two he found the others point pass his face twice so close as almost to graze his cheek the second time he realized the actual possibility of defeat and pulled himself together under a shock of the sanity of anger he narrowed and so to speak tightened his operations he fenced as the swordsmans boast goes in a wedding ring he turned turnbulls thrusts with a maddening and almost mechanical click like that of a machine whenever turnbulls sword sought to go over that other mere white streak it seemed to be caught in a complex network of steel he turned one thrust turned another turned another then suddenly he went forward at the lunge with his whole living weight turnbull leaped back but evan lunged and lunged and lunged again like a devilish piston rod or battering ram and high above all the sound of the struggle there broke into the silent evening a bellowing human voice nasal raucous at the highest pitch of pain help help police murder murder the gag was broken and the tongue of terror was loose  keep on gasped turnbull one may be killed before they come  the voice of the screaming shopkeeper was loud enough to drown not only the noise of the swords but all other noises around it but even through its rending din there seemed to be some other stir or scurry and evan in the very act of thrusting at turnbull saw something in his eyes that made him drop his sword the atheist with his grey eyes at their widest and wildest was staring straight over his shoulder at the little archway of shop that opened on the street beyond and he saw the archway blocked and blackened with strange figures  we must bolt macian he said abruptly and there isnt a damned second to lose either do as i do  with a bound he was beside the little cluster of his clothes and boots that lay on the lawn he snatched them up without waiting to put any of them on and tucking his sword under his other arm went wildly at the wall at the bottom of the garden and swung himself over it three seconds after he had alighted in his socks on the other side macian alighted beside him also in his socks and also carrying clothes and sword in a desperate bundle  they were in a bystreet very lean and lonely itself but so close to a crowded thoroughfare that they could see the vague masses of vehicles going by and could even see an individual hansom cab passing the corner at the instant turnbull put his fingers to his mouth like a guttersnipe and whistled twice even as he did so he could hear the loud voices of the neighbours and the police coming down the garden  the hansom swung sharply and came tearing down the little lane at his call when the cabman saw his fares however two wildhaired men in their shirts and socks with naked swords under their arms he not unnaturally brought his readiness to a rigid stop and stared suspiciously  you talk to him a minute whispered turnbull and stepped back into the shadow of the wall  we want you said macian to the cabman with a superb scotch drawl of indifference and assurance to drive us to st pancras stationverra quick  very sorry sir said the cabman but id like to know it was all right might i arst where you come from sir  a second after he spoke macian heard a heavy voice on the other side of the wall saying i suppose id better get over and look for them give me a back  cabby said macian again assuming the most deliberate and lingering lowland scotch intonation if yere really verra anxious to ken whar a come fra ill tell ye as a verra great secret a come from scotland and am gaein to st pancras station open the doors cabby  the cabman stared but laughed the heavy voice behind the wall said now then a better back this time mr price and from the shadow of the wall turnbull crept out he had struggled wildly into his coat leaving his waistcoat on the pavement and he was with a fierce pale face climbing up the cab behind the cabman macian had no glimmering notion of what he was up to but an instinct of discipline inherited from a hundred men of war made him stick to his own part and trust the other mans  open the doors cabby he repeated with something of the obstinate solemnity of a drunkard open the doors did ye no hear me say st pancras station  the top of a policemans helmet appeared above the garden wall the cabman did not see it but he was still suspicious and began  very sorry sir but and with that the catlike turnbull tore him out of his seat and hurled him into the street below where he lay suddenly stunned  give me his hat said turnbull in a silver voice that the other obeyed like a bugle and get inside with the swords  and just as the red and raging face of a policeman appeared above the wall turnbull struck the horse with a terrible cut of the whip and the two went whirling away like a boomerang  they had spun through seven streets and three or four squares before anything further happened then in the neighbourhood of maida vale the driver opened the trap and talked through it in a manner not wholly common in conversations through that aperture  mr macian he said shortly and civilly  mr turnbull replied his motionless fare  under circumstances such as those in which we were both recently placed there was no time for anything but very abrupt action i trust therefore that you have no cause to complain of me if i have deferred until this moment a consultation with you on our present position or future action our present position mr macian i imagine that i am under no special necessity of describing we have broken the law and we are fleeing from its officers our future action is a thing about which i myself entertain sufficiently strong views but i have no right to assume or to anticipate yours though i may have formed a decided conception of your character and a decided notion of what they will probably be still by every principle of intellectual justice i am bound to ask you now and seriously whether you wish to continue our interrupted relations  macian leant his white and rather weary face back upon the cushions in order to speak up through the open door  mr turnbull he said i have nothing to add to what i have said before it is strongly borne in upon me that you and i the sole occupants of this runaway cab are at this moment the two most important people in london possibly in europe i have been looking at all the streets as we went past i have been looking at all the shops as we went past i have been looking at all the churches as we went past at first i felt a little dazed with the vastness of it all i could not understand what it all meant but now i know exactly what it all means it means us this whole civilization is only a dream you and i are the realities  religious symbolism said mr turnbull through the trap does not as you are probably aware appeal ordinarily to thinkers of the school to which i belong but in symbolism as you use it in this instance i must i think concede a certain truth we must fight this thing out somewhere because as you truly say we have found each others reality we must kill each otheror convert each other i used to think all christians were hypocrites and i felt quite mildly towards them really but i know you are sincereand my soul is mad against you in the same way you used i suppose to think that all atheists thought atheism would leave them free for immoralityand yet in your heart you tolerated them entirely now you know that i am an honest man and you are mad against me as i am against you yes thats it you cant be angry with bad men but a good man in the wrongwhy one thirsts for his blood yes you open for me a vista of thought  dont run into anything said evan immovably  theres something in that view of yours too said turnbull and shut down the trap  they sped on through shining streets that shot by them like arrows mr turnbull had evidently a great deal of unused practical talent which was unrolling itself in this ridiculous adventure they had got away with such stunning promptitude that the police chase had in all probability not even properly begun but in case it had the amateur cabman chose his dizzy course through london with a strange dexterity he did not do what would have first occurred to any ordinary outsider desiring to destroy his tracks he did not cut into byways or twist his way through mean streets his amateur common sense told him that it was precisely the poor street the side street that would be likely to remember and report the passing of a hansom cab like the passing of a royal procession he kept chiefly to the great roads so full of hansoms that a wilder pair than they might easily have passed in the press in one of the quieter streets evan put on his boots  towards the top of albany street the singular cabman again opened the trap  mr macian he said i understand that we have now definitely settled that in the conventional language honour is not satisfied our action must at least go further than it has gone under recent interrupted conditions that i believe is understood  perfectly replied the other with his bootlace in his teeth  under those conditions continued turnbull his voice coming through the hole with a slight note of trepidation very unusual with him i have a suggestion to make if that can be called a suggestion which has probably occurred to you as readily as to me until the actual event comes off we are practically in the position if not of comrades at least of business partners until the event comes off therefore i should suggest that quarrelling would be inconvenient and rather inartistic while the ordinary exchange of politeness between man and man would be not only elegant but uncommonly practical  you are perfectly right answered macian with his melancholy voice in saying that all this has occurred to me all duellists should behave like gentlemen to each other but we by the queerness of our position are something much more than either duellists or gentlemen we are in the oddest and most exact sense of the term brothersin arms  mr macian replied turnbull calmly no more need be said and he closed the trap once more  they had reached finchley road before he opened it again  then he said mr macian may i offer you a cigar it will be a touch of realism  thank you answered evan you are very kind and he began to smoke in the cab     iv a discussion at dawn  the duellists had from their own point of view escaped or conquered the chief powers of the modern world they had satisfied the magistrate they had tied the tradesman neck and heels and they had left the police behind as far as their own feelings went they had melted into a monstrous sea they were but the fare and driver of one of the million hansoms that fill london streets but they had forgotten something they had forgotten journalism they had forgotten that there exists in the modern world perhaps for the first time in history a class of people whose interest is not that things should happen well or happen badly should happen successfully or happen unsuccessfully should happen to the advantage of this party or the advantage of that part but whose interest simply is that things should happen  it is the one great weakness of journalism as a picture of our modern existence that it must be a picture made up entirely of exceptions we announce on flaring posters that a man has fallen off a scaffolding we do not announce on flaring posters that a man has not fallen off a scaffolding yet this latter fact is fundamentally more exciting as indicating that that moving tower of terror and mystery a man is still abroad upon the earth that the man has not fallen off a scaffolding is really more sensational and it is also some thousand times more common but journalism cannot reasonably be expected thus to insist upon the permanent miracles busy editors cannot be expected to put on their posters mr wilkinson still safe or mr jones of worthing not dead yet they cannot announce the happiness of mankind at all they cannot describe all the forks that are not stolen or all the marriages that are not judiciously dissolved hence the complete picture they give of life is of necessity fallacious they can only represent what is unusual however democratic they may be they are only concerned with the minority  the incident of the religious fanatic who broke a window on ludgate hill was alone enough to set them up in good copy for the night but when the same man was brought before a magistrate and defied his enemy to mortal combat in the open court then the columns would hardly hold the excruciating information and the headlines were so large that there was hardly room for any of the text the daily telegraph headed a column a duel on divinity and there was a correspondence afterwards which lasted for months about whether police magistrates ought to mention religion the daily mail in its dull sensible way headed the events wanted to fight for the virgin mr james douglas in the star presuming on his knowledge of philosophical and theological terms described the christians outbreak under the title of dualist and duellist the daily news inserted a colourless account of the matter but was pursued and eaten up for some weeks with letters from outlying ministers headed murder and mariolatry but the journalistic temperature was steadily and consistently heated by all these influences the journalists had tasted blood prospectively and were in the mood for more everything in the matter prepared them for further outbursts of moral indignation and when a gasping reporter rushed in in the last hours of the evening with the announcement that the two heroes of the police court had literally been found fighting in a london back garden with a shopkeeper bound and gagged in the front of the house the editors and subeditors were stricken still as men are by great beatitudes  the next morning five or six of the great london dailies burst out simultaneously into great blossoms of eloquent leaderwriting towards the end all the leaders tended to be the same but they all began differently the daily telegraph for instance began there will be little difference among our readers or among all truly english and lawabiding men touching the etc etc the daily mail said people must learn in the modern world to keep their theological differences to themselves the fracas etc etc the daily news started nothing could be more inimical to the cause of true religion than etc etc the times began with something about celtic disturbances of the equilibrium of empire and the daily express distinguished itself splendidly by omitting altogether so controversial a matter and substituting a leader about goloshes  and the morning after that the editors and the newspapers were in such a state that as the phrase is there was no holding them whatever secret and elvish thing it is that broods over editors and suddenly turns their brains that thing had seized on the story of the broken glass and the duel in the garden it became monstrous and omnipresent as do in our time the unimportant doings of the sect of the agapemonites or as did at an earlier time the dreary dishonesties of the rhodesian financiers questions were asked about it and even answered in the house of commons the government was solemnly denounced in the papers for not having done something nobody knew what to prevent the window being broken an enormous subscription was started to reimburse mr gordon the man who had been gagged in the shop mr macian one of the combatants became for some mysterious reason singly and hugely popular as a comic figure in the comic papers and on the stage of the music hall he was always represented in defiance of fact with red whiskers and a very red nose and in full highland costume and a song consisting of an unimaginable number of verses in which his name was rhymed with flat iron the british lion sly un dandelion spion with kop in the next line was sung to crowded houses every night the papers developed a devouring thirst for the capture of the fugitives and when they had not been caught for fortyeight hours they suddenly turned the whole matter into a detective mystery letters under the heading where are they poured in to every paper with every conceivable kind of explanation running them to earth in the monument the twopenny tube epping forest westminster abbey rolled up in carpets at shoolbreds locked up in safes in chancery lane yes the papers were very interesting and mr turnbull unrolled a whole bundle of them for the amusement of mr macian as they sat on a high common to the north of london in the coming of the white dawn  the darkness in the east had been broken with a bar of grey the bar of grey was split with a sword of silver and morning lifted itself laboriously over london from the spot where turnbull and macian were sitting on one of the barren steeps behind hampstead they could see the whole of london shaping itself vaguely and largely in the grey and growing light until the white sun stood over it and it lay at their feet the splendid monstrosity that it is its bewildering squares and parallelograms were compact and perfect as a chinese puzzle an enormous hieroglyphic which man must decipher or die there fell upon both of them but upon turnbull more than the other because he know more what the scene signified that quite indescribable sense as of a sublime and passionate and heartmoving futility which is never evoked by deserts or dead men or men neglected and barbarous which can only be invoked by the sight of the enormous genius of man applied to anything other than the best turnbull the old idealistic democrat had so often reviled the democracy and reviled them justly for their supineness their snobbishness their evil reverence for idle things he was right enough for our democracy has only one great fault it is not democratic and after denouncing so justly average modern men for so many years as sophists and as slaves he looked down from an empty slope in hampstead and saw what gods they are their achievement seemed all the more heroic and divine because it seemed doubtful whether it was worth doing at all there seemed to be something greater than mere accuracy in making such a mistake as london and what was to be the end of it all what was to be the ultimate transformation of this common and incredible london man this workman on a tram in battersea his clerk on an omnibus in cheapside turnbull as he stared drearily murmured to himself the words of the old atheistic and revolutionary swinburne who had intoxicated his youth          and still we ask if god or man         can loosen thee lazarus         bid thee rise up republican         and save thyself and all of us         but no disciples tongue can say         if thou canst take our sins away  turnbull shivered slightly as if behind the earthly morning he felt the evening of the world the sunset of so many hopes those words were from songs before sunrise but turnbulls songs at their best were songs after sunrise and sunrise had been no such great thing after all turnbull shivered again in the sharp morning air macian was also gazing with his face towards the city but there was that about his blind and mystical stare that told one so to speak that his eyes were turned inwards when turnbull said something to him about london they seemed to move as at a summons and come out like two householders coming out into their doorways  yes he said with a sort of stupidity its a very big place  there was a somewhat unmeaning silence and then macian said again  its a very big place when i first came into it i was frightened of it frightened exactly as one would be frightened at the sight of a man forty feet high i am used to big things where i come from big mountains that seem to fill gods infinity and the big sea that goes to the end of the world but then these things are all shapeless and confused things not made in any familiar form but to see the plain square human things as large as that houses so large and streets so large and the town itself so large was like having screwed some devils magnifying glass into ones eye it was like seeing a porridge bowl as big as a house or a mousetrap made to catch elephants  like the land of the brobdingnagians said turnbull smiling  oh where is that said macian  turnbull said bitterly in a book and the silence fell suddenly between them again  they were sitting in a sort of litter on the hillside all the things they had hurriedly collected in various places for their flight were strewn indiscriminately round them the two swords with which they had lately sought each others lives were flung down on the grass at random like two idle walkingsticks some provisions they had bought last night at a low public house in case of undefined contingencies were tossed about like the materials of an ordinary picnic here a basket of chocolate and there a bottle of wine and to add to the disorder finally there were strewn on top of everything the most disorderly of modern things newspapers and more newspapers and yet again newspapers the ministers of the modern anarchy turnbull picked up one of them drearily and took out a pipe  theres a lot about us he said do you mind if i light up  why should i mind asked macian  turnbull eyed with a certain studious interest the man who did not understand any of the verbal courtesies he lit his pipe and blew great clouds out of it  yes he resumed the matter on which you and i are engaged is at this moment really the best copy in england i am a journalist and i know for the first time perhaps for many generations the english are really more angry about a wrong thing done in england than they are about a wrong thing done in france  it is not a wrong thing said macian  turnbull laughed you seem unable to understand the ordinary use of the human language if i did not suspect that you were a genius i should certainly know you were a blockhead i fancy we had better be getting along and collecting our baggage  and he jumped up and began shoving the luggage into his pockets or strapping it on to his back as he thrust a tin of canned meat anyhow into his bursting side pocket he said casually  i only meant that you and i are the most prominent people in the english papers  well what did you expect asked macian opening his great grave blue eyes  the papers are full of us said turnbull stooping to pick up one of the swords  macian stooped and picked up the other  yes he said in his simple way i have read what they have to say but they dont seem to understand the point  the point of what asked turnbull  the point of the sword said macian violently and planted the steel point in the soil like a man planting a tree  that is a point said turnbull grimly that we will discuss later come along  turnbull tied the last tin of biscuits desperately to himself with string and then spoke like a diver girt for plunging short and sharp  now mr macian you must listen to me you must listen to me not merely because i know the country which you might learn by looking at a map but because i know the people of the country whom you could not know by living here thirty years that infernal city down there is awake and it is awake against us all those endless rows of windows and windows are all eyes staring at us all those forests of chimneys are fingers pointing at us as we stand here on the hillside this thing has caught on for the next six mortal months they will think of nothing but us as for six mortal months they thought of nothing but the dreyfus case oh i know its funny they let starving children who dont want to die drop by the score without looking round but because two gentlemen from private feelings of delicacy do want to die they will mobilize the army and navy to prevent them for half a year or more you and i mr macian will be an obstacle to every reform in the british empire we shall prevent the chinese being sent out of the transvaal and the blocks being stopped in the strand we shall be the conversational substitute when anyone recommends home rule or complains of sky signs therefore do not imagine in your innocence that we have only to melt away among those english hills as a highland cateran might into your godforsaken highland mountains we must be eternally on our guard we must live the hunted life of two distinguished criminals we must expect to be recognized as much as if we were napoleon escaping from elba we must be prepared for our descriptions being sent to every tiny village and for our faces being recognized by every ambitious policeman we must often sleep under the stars as if we were in africa last and most important we must not dream of effecting ourour final settlement which will be a thing as famous as the phoenix park murders unless we have made real and precise arrangements for our isolationi will not say our safety we must not in short fight until we have thrown them off our scent if only for a moment for take my word for it mr macian if the british public once catches us up the british public will prevent the duel if it is only by locking us both up in asylums for the rest of our days  macian was looking at the horizon with a rather misty look  i am not at all surprised he said at the world being against us it makes me feel i was right to  yes said turnbull  to smash your window said macian i have woken up the world  very well then said turnbull stolidly let us look at a few final facts beyond that hill there is comparatively clear country fortunately i know the part well and if you will follow me exactly and when necessary on your stomach we may be able to get ten miles out of london literally without meeting anyone at all which will be the best possible beginning at any rate we have provisions for at least two days and two nights three days if we do it carefully we may be able to get fifty or sixty miles away without even walking into an inn door i have the biscuits and the tinned meat and the milk you have the chocolate i think and the brandy  yes said macian like a soldier taking orders  very well then come on march we turn under that third bush and so down into the valley and he set off ahead at a swinging walk  then he stopped suddenly for he realized that the other was not following evan macian was leaning on his sword with a lowering face like a man suddenly smitten still with doubt  what on earth is the matter asked turnbull staring in some anger  evan made no reply  what the deuce is the matter with you demanded the leader again his face slowly growing as red as his beard then he said suddenly and in a more human voice are you in pain macian  yes replied the highlander without lifting his face  take some brandy cried turnbull walking forward hurriedly towards him youve got it  its not in the body said macian in his dull strange way the pain has come into my mind a very dreadful thing has just come into my thoughts  what the devil are you talking about asked turnbull  macian broke out with a queer and living voice  we must fight now turnbull we must fight now a frightful thing has come upon me and i know it must be now and here i must kill you here he cried with a sort of tearful rage impossible to describe here here upon this blessed grass  why you idiot began turnbull  the hour has comethe black hour god meant for it quick it will soon be gone quick  and he flung the scabbard from him furiously and stood with the sunlight sparkling along his sword  you confounded fool repeated turnbull put that thing up again you ass people will come out of that house at the first clash of the steel  one of us will be dead before they come said the other hoarsely for this is the hour god meant  well i never thought much of god said the editor of the atheist losing all patience and i think less now never mind what god meant kindly enlighten my pagan darkness as to what the devil you mean  the hour will soon be gone in a moment it will be gone said the madman it is now now now that i must nail your blaspheming body to the earthnow now that i must avenge our lady on her vile slanderer now or never for the dreadful thought is in my mind  and what thought asked turnbull with frantic composure occupies what you call your mind  i must kill you now said the fanatic because  well because said turnbull patiently  because i have begun to like you  turnbulls face had a sudden spasm in the sunlight a change so instantaneous that it left no trace behind it and his features seemed still carved into a cold stare but when he spoke again he seemed like a man who was placidly pretending to misunderstand something that he understood perfectly well  your affection expresses itself in an abrupt form he began but macian broke the brittle and frivolous speech to pieces with a violent voice do not trouble to talk like that he said you know what i mean as well as i know it come on and fight i say perhaps you are feeling just as i do  turnbulls face flinched again in the fierce sunlight but his attitude kept its contemptuous ease  your celtic mind really goes too fast for me he said let me be permitted in my heavy lowland way to understand this new development my dear mr macian what do you really mean  macian still kept the shining swordpoint towards the others breast  you know what i mean you mean the same yourself we must fight now or else  or else repeated turnbull staring at him with an almost blinding gravity  or else we may not want to fight at all answered evan and the end of his speech was like a despairing cry  turnbull took out his own sword suddenly as if to engage then planting it point downwards for a moment he said before we begin may i ask you a question  macian bowed patiently but with burning eyes  you said just now continued turnbull presently that if we did not fight now we might not want to fight at all how would you feel about the matter if we came not to want to fight at all  i should feel answered the other just as i should feel if you had drawn your sword and i had run away from it i should feel that because i had been weak justice had not been done  justice answered turnbull with a thoughtful smile but we are talking about your feelings and what do you mean by justice apart from your feelings  macian made a gesture of weary recognition oh nominalism he said with a sort of sigh we had all that out in the twelfth century  i wish we could have it out now replied the other firmly do you really mean that if you came to think me right you would be certainly wrong  if i had a blow on the back of my head i might come to think you a green elephant answered macian but have i not the right to say now that if i thought that i should think wrong  then you are quite certain that it would be wrong to like me asked turnbull with a slight smile  no said evan thoughtfully i do not say that it may not be the devil it may be some part of god i am not meant to know but i had a work to do and it is making the work difficult  and i suppose said the atheist quite gently that you and i know all about which part of god we ought to know  macian burst out like a man driven back and explaining everything  the church is not a thing like the athenaeum club he cried if the athenaeum club lost all its members the athenaeum club would dissolve and cease to exist but when we belong to the church we belong to something which is outside all of us which is outside everything you talk about outside the cardinals and the pope they belong to it but it does not belong to them if we all fell dead suddenly the church would still somehow exist in god confound it all dont you see that i am more sure of its existence than i am of my own existence and yet you ask me to trust my temperament my own temperament which can be turned upside down by two bottles of claret or an attack of the jaundice you ask me to trust that when it softens towards you and not to trust the thing which i believe to be outside myself and more real than the blood in my body  stop a moment said turnbull in the same easy tone even in the very act of saying that you believe this or that you imply that there is a part of yourself that you trust even if there are many parts which you mistrust if it is only you that like me surely also it is only you that believe in the catholic church  evan remained in an unmoved and grave attitude there is a part of me which is divine he answered a part that can be trusted but there are also affections which are entirely animal and idle  and you are quite certain i suppose continued turnbull that if even you esteem me the esteem would be wholly animal and idle for the first time macian started as if he had not expected the thing that was said to him at last he said  whatever in earth or heaven it is that has joined us two together it seems to be something which makes it impossible to lie no i do not think that the movement in me towards you waswas that surface sort of thing it may have been something deepersomething strange i cannot understand the thing at all but understand this and understand it thoroughly if i loved you my love might be divine no it is not some trifle that we are fighting about it is not some superstition or some symbol when you wrote those words about our lady you were in that act a wicked man doing a wicked thing if i hate you it is because you have hated goodness and if i like youit is because you are good  turnbulls face wore an indecipherable expression  well shall we fight now he said  yes said macian with a sudden contraction of his black brows yes it must be now  the bright swords crossed and the first touch of them travelling down blade and arm told each combatant that the heart of the other was awakened it was not in that way that the swords rang together when they had rushed on each other in the little garden behind the dealers shop  there was a pause and then macian made a movement as if to thrust and almost at the same moment turnbull suddenly and calmly dropped his sword evan stared round in an unusual bewilderment and then realized that a large man in pale clothes and a panama hat was strolling serenely towards them     v the peacemaker  when the combatants with crossed swords became suddenly conscious of a third party they each made the same movement it was as quick as the snap of a pistol and they altered it instantaneously and recovered their original pose but they had both made it they had both seen it and they both knew what it was it was not a movement of anger at being interrupted say or think what they would it was a movement of relief a force within them and yet quite beyond them seemed slowly and pitilessly washing away the adamant of their oath as mistaken lovers might watch the inevitable sunset of first love these men watched the sunset of their first hatred  their hearts were growing weaker and weaker against each other when their weapons rang and riposted in the little london garden they could have been very certain that if a third party had interrupted them something at least would have happened they would have killed each other or they would have killed him but now nothing could undo or deny that flash of fact that for a second they had been glad to be interrupted some new and strange thing was rising higher and higher in their hearts like a high sea at night it was something that seemed all the more merciless because it might turn out an enormous mercy was there perhaps some such fatalism in friendship as all lovers talk about in love did god make men love each other against their will  im sure youll excuse my speaking to you said the stranger in a voice at once eager and deprecating  the voice was too polite for good manners it was incongruous with the eccentric spectacle of the duellists which ought to have startled a sane and free man it was also incongruous with the full and healthy though rather loose physique of the man who spoke at the first glance he looked a fine animal with curling gold beard and hair and blue eyes unusually bright it was only at the second glance that the mind felt a sudden and perhaps unmeaning irritation at the way in which the gold beard retreated backwards into the waistcoat and the way in which the finely shaped nose went forward as if smelling its way and it was only perhaps at the hundredth glance that the bright blue eyes which normally before and after the instant seemed brilliant with intelligence seemed as it were to be brilliant with idiocy he was a heavy healthylooking man who looked all the larger because of the loose light coloured clothes that he wore and that had in their extreme lightness and looseness almost a touch of the tropics but a closer examination of his attire would have shown that even in the tropics it would have been unique but it was all woven according to some hygienic texture which no human being had ever heard of before and which was absolutely necessary even for a days health he wore a huge broadbrimmed hat equally hygienic very much at the back of his head and his voice coming out of so heavy and hearty a type of man was as i have said startlingly shrill and deferential  im sure youll excuse my speaking to you he said now i wonder if you are in some little difficulty which after all we could settle very comfortably together now you dont mind my saying this do you  the face of both combatants remained somewhat solid under this appeal but the stranger probably taking their silence for a gathering shame continued with a kind of gaiety  so you are the young men i have read about in the papers well of course when one is young one is rather romantic do you know what i always say to young people  a blank silence followed this gay inquiry then turnbull said in a colourless voice  as i was fortyseven last birthday i probably came into the world too soon for the experience  very good very good said the friendly person dry scotch humour dry scotch humour well now i understand that you two people want to fight a duel i suppose you arent much up in the modern world weve quite outgrown duelling you know in fact tolstoy tells us that we shall soon outgrow war which he says is simply a duel between nations a duel between nations but there is no doubt about our having outgrown duelling  waiting for some effect upon his wooden auditors the stranger stood beaming for a moment and then resumed  now they tell me in the newspapers that you are really wanting to fight about something connected with roman catholicism now do you know what i always say to roman catholics  no said turnbull heavily do they it seemed to be a characteristic of the hearty hygienic gentleman that he always forgot the speech he had made the moment before without enlarging further on the fixed form of his appeal to the church of rome he laughed cordially at turnbulls answer then his wandering blue eyes caught the sunlight on the swords and he assumed a goodhumoured gravity  but you know this is a serious matter he said eyeing turnbull and macian as if they had just been keeping the table in a roar with their frivolities i am sure that if i appealed to your higher naturesyour higher natures every man has a higher nature and a lower nature now let us put the matter very plainly and without any romantic nonsense about honour or anything of that sort is not bloodshed a great sin  no said macian speaking for the first time  well really really said the peacemaker  murder is a sin said the immovable highlander there is no sin of bloodshed  well we wont quarrel about a word said the other pleasantly  why on earth not said macian with a sudden asperity why shouldnt we quarrel about a word what is the good of words if they arent important enough to quarrel over why do we choose one word more than another if there isnt any difference between them if you called a woman a chimpanzee instead of an angel wouldnt there be a quarrel about a word if youre not going to argue about words what are you going to argue about are you going to convey your meaning to me by moving your ears the church and the heresies always used to fight about words because they are the only things worth fighting about i say that murder is a sin and bloodshed is not and that there is as much difference between those words as there is between the word yes and the word no or rather more difference for yes and no at least belong to the same category murder is a spiritual incident bloodshed is a physical incident a surgeon commits bloodshed  ah youre a casuist said the large man wagging his head now do you know what i always say to casuists  macian made a violent gesture and turnbull broke into open laughter the peacemaker did not seem to be in the least annoyed but continued in unabated enjoyment  well well he said let us get back to the point now tolstoy has shown that force is no remedy so you see the position in which i am placed i am doing my best to stop what im sure you wont mind my calling this really useless violence this really quite wrong violence of yours but its against my principles to call in the police against you because the police are still on a lower moral plane so to speak because in short the police undoubtedly sometimes employ force tolstoy has shown that violence merely breeds violence in the person towards whom it is used whereas love on the other hand breeds love so you see how i am placed i am reduced to use love in order to stop you i am obliged to use love  he gave to the word an indescribable sound of something hard and heavy as if he were saying boots turnbull suddenly gripped his sword and said shortly i see how you are placed quite well sir you will not call the police mr macian shall we engage macian plucked his sword out of the grass  i must and will stop this shocking crime cried the tolstoian crimson in the face it is against all modern ideas it is against the principle of love how you sir who pretend to be a christian  macian turned upon him with a white face and bitter lip sir he said talk about the principle of love as much as you like you seem to me colder than a lump of stone but i am willing to believe that you may at some time have loved a cat or a dog or a child when you were a baby i suppose you loved your mother talk about love then till the world is sick of the word but dont you talk about christianity dont you dare to say one word white or black about it christianity is as far as you are concerned a horrible mystery keep clear of it keep silent upon it as you would upon an abomination it is a thing that has made men slay and torture each other and you will never know why it is a thing that has made men do evil that good might come and you will never understand the evil let alone the good christianity is a thing that could only make you vomit till you are other than you are i would not justify it to you even if i could hate it in gods name as turnbull does who is a man it is a monstrous thing for which men die and if you will stand here and talk about love for another ten minutes it is very probable that you will see a man die for it  and he fell on guard turnbull was busy settling something loose in his elaborate hilt and the pause was broken by the stranger  suppose i call the police he said with a heated face  and deny your most sacred dogma said macian  dogma cried the man in a sort of dismay oh we have no dogmas you know  there was another silence and he said again airily  you know i think theres something in what shaw teaches about no moral principles being quite fixed have you ever read the quintessence of ibsenism of course he went very wrong over the war  turnbull with a bent flushed face was tying up the loose piece of the pommel with string with the string in his teeth he said oh make up your damned mind and clear out  its a serious thing said the philosopher shaking his head i must be alone and consider which is the higher point of view i rather feel that in a case so extreme as this and he went slowly away as he disappeared among the trees they heard him murmuring in a singsong voice new occasions teach new duties out of a poem by james russell lowell  ah said macian drawing a deep breath dont you believe in prayer now i prayed for an angel  an hour ago said the highlander in his heavy meditative voice i felt the devil weakening my heart and my oath against you and i prayed that god would send an angel to my aid  well inquired the other finishing his mending and wrapping the rest of the string round his hand to get a firmer grip  well  well that man was an angel said macian  i didnt know they were as bad as that answered turnbull  we know that devils sometimes quote scripture and counterfeit good replied the mystic why should not angels sometimes come to show us the black abyss of evil on whose brink we stand if that man had not tried to stop usi mighti might have stopped  i know what you mean said turnbull grimly  but then he came broke out macian and my soul said to me give up fighting and you will become like that give up vows and dogmas and fixed things and you may grow like that you may learn also that fog of false philosophy you may grow fond of that mire of crawling cowardly morals and you may come to think a blow bad because it hurts and not because it humiliates you may come to think murder wrong because it is violent and not because it is unjust oh you blasphemer of the good an hour ago i almost loved you but do not fear for me now i have heard the word love pronounced in his intonation and i know exactly what it means on guard  the swords caught on each other with a dreadful clang and jar full of the old energy and hate and at once plunged and replunged once more each mans heart had become the magnet of a mad sword suddenly furious as they were they were frozen for a moment motionless  what noise is that asked the highlander hoarsely  i think i know replied turnbull  what what cried the other  the student of shaw and tolstoy has made up his remarkable mind said turnbull quietly the police are coming up the hill     vi the other philosopher  between high hedges in hertfordshire hedges so high as to create a kind of grove two men were running they did not run in a scampering or feverish manner but in the steady swing of the pendulum across the great plains and uplands to the right and left of the lane a long tide of sunset light rolled like a sea of ruby lighting up the long terraces of the hills and picking out the few windows of the scattered hamlets in startling bloodred sparks but the lane was cut deep in the hill and remained in an abrupt shadow the two men running in it had an impression not uncommonly experienced between those wild green english walls a sense of being led between the walls of a maze  though their pace was steady it was vigorous their faces were heated and their eyes fixed and bright there was indeed something a little mad in the contrast between the evenings stillness over the empty countryside and these two figures fleeing wildly from nothing they had the look of two lunatics possibly they were  are you all right said turnbull with civility can you keep this up  quite easily thank you replied macian i run very well  is that a qualification in a family of warriors asked turnbull  undoubtedly rapid movement is essential answered macian who never saw a joke in his life  turnbull broke out into a short laugh and silence fell between them the panting silence of runners  then macian said we run better than any of those policemen they are too fat why do you make your policemen so fat  i didnt do much towards making them fat myself replied turnbull genially but i flatter myself that i am now doing something towards making them thin youll see they will be as lean as rakes by the time they catch us they will look like your friend cardinal manning  but they wont catch us said macian in his literal way  no we beat them in the great military art of running away returned the other they wont catch us unless  macian turned his long equine face inquiringly unless what he said for turnbull had gone silent suddenly and seemed to be listening intently as he ran as a horse does with his ears turned back  unless what repeated the highlander  unless they dowhat they have done listen macian slackened his trot and turned his head to the trail they had left behind them across two or three billows of the up and down lane came along the ground the unmistakable throbbing of horses hoofs  they have put the mounted police on us said turnbull shortly good lord one would think we were a revolution  so we are said macian calmly what shall we do shall we turn on them with our points  it may come to that answered turnbull though if it does i reckon that will be the last act we must put it off if we can and he stared and peered about him between the bushes if we could hide somewhere the beasts might go by us he said the police have their faults but thank god theyre inefficient why heres the very thing be quick and quiet follow me  he suddenly swung himself up the high bank on one side of the lane it was almost as high and smooth as a wall and on the top of it the black hedge stood out over them as an angle almost like a thatched roof of the lane and the burning evening sky looked down at them through the tangle with red eyes as of an army of goblins  turnbull hoisted himself up and broke the hedge with his body as his head and shoulders rose above it they turned to flame in the full glow as if lit up by an immense firelight his red hair and beard looked almost scarlet and his pale face as bright as a boys something violent something that was at once love and hatred surged in the strange heart of the gael below him he had an unutterable sense of epic importance as if he were somehow lifting all humanity into a prouder and more passionate region of the air as he swung himself up also into the evening light he felt as if he were rising on enormous wings  legends of the morning of the world which he had heard in childhood or read in youth came back upon him in a cloudy splendour purple tales of wrath and friendship like roland and oliver or balin and balan reminding him of emotional entanglements men who had loved each other and then fought each other men who had fought each other and then loved each other together made a mixed but monstrous sense of momentousness the crimson seas of the sunset seemed to him like a bursting out of some sacred blood as if the heart of the world had broken  turnbull was wholly unaffected by any written or spoken poetry his was a powerful and prosaic mind but even upon him there came for the moment something out of the earth and the passionate ends of the sky the only evidence was in his voice which was still practical but a shade more quiet  do you see that summerhouselooking thing over there he asked shortly that will do for us very well  keeping himself free from the tangle of the hedge he strolled across a triangle of obscure kitchen garden and approached a dismal shed or lodge a yard or two beyond it it was a weatherstained hut of grey wood which with all its desolation retained a tag or two of trivial ornament which suggested that the thing had once been a sort of summerhouse and the place probably a sort of garden  that is quite invisible from the road said turnbull as he entered it and it will cover us up for the night  macian looked at him gravely for a few moments sir he said i ought to say something to you i ought to say  hush said turnbull suddenly lifting his hand be still man  in the sudden silence the drumming of the distant horses grew louder and louder with inconceivable rapidity and the cavalcade of police rushed by below them in the lane almost with the roar and rattle of an express train  i ought to tell you continued macian still staring stolidly at the other that you are a great chief and it is good to go to war behind you  turnbull said nothing but turned and looked out of the foolish lattice of the little windows then he said we must have food and sleep first  when the last echo of their eluded pursuers had died in the distant uplands turnbull began to unpack the provisions with the easy air of a man at a picnic he had just laid out the last items put a bottle of wine on the floor and a tin of salmon on the windowledge when the bottomless silence of that forgotten place was broken and it was broken by three heavy blows of a stick delivered upon the door  turnbull looked up in the act of opening a tin and stared silently at his companion macians long lean mouth had shut hard  who the devil can that be said turnbull  god knows said the other it might be god  again the sound of the wooden stick reverberated on the wooden door it was a curious sound and on consideration did not resemble the ordinary effects of knocking on a door for admittance it was rather as if the point of a stick were plunged again and again at the panels in an absurd attempt to make a hole in them  a wild look sprang into macians eyes and he got up half stupidly with a kind of stagger put his hand out and caught one of the swords let us fight at once he cried it is the end of the world  youre overdone macian said turnbull putting him on one side its only someone playing the goat let me open the door  but he also picked up a sword as he stepped to open it  he paused one moment with his hand on the handle and then flung the door open almost as he did so the ferrule of an ordinary bamboo cane came at his eyes so that he had actually to parry it with the naked weapon in his hands as the two touched the point of the stick was dropped very abruptly and the man with the stick stepped hurriedly back  against the heraldic background of sprawling crimson and gold offered him by the expiring sunset the figure of the man with the stick showed at first merely black and fantastic he was a small man with two wisps of long hair that curled up on each side and seen in silhouette looked like horns he had a bow tie so big that the two ends showed on each side of his neck like unnatural stunted wings he had his long black cane still tilted in his hand like a fencing foil and half presented at the open door his large straw hat had fallen behind him as he leapt backwards  with reference to your suggestion macian said turnbull placidly i think it looks more like the devil  who on earth are you cried the stranger in a high shrill voice brandishing his cane defensively  let me see said turnbull looking round to macian with the same blandness who are we  come out screamed the little man with the stick  certainly said turnbull and went outside with the sword macian following  seen more fully with the evening light on his face the strange man looked a little less like a goblin he wore a square palegrey jacket suit on which the grey butterfly tie was the only indisputable touch of affectation against the great sunset his figure had looked merely small seen in a more equal light it looked tolerably compact and shapely his reddishbrown hair combed into two great curls looked like the long slow curling hair of the women in some preraphaelite pictures but within this feminine frame of hair his face was unexpectedly impudent like a monkeys  what are you doing here he said in a sharp small voice  well said macian in his grave childish way what are you doing here  i said the man indignantly im in my own garden  oh said macian simply i apologize  turnbull was coolly curling his red moustache and the stranger stared from one to the other temporarily stunned by their innocent assurance  but may i ask he said at last what the devil you are doing in my summerhouse  certainly said macian we were just going to fight  to fight repeated the man  we had better tell this gentleman the whole business broke in turnbull then turning to the stranger he said firmly i am sorry sir but we have something to do that must be done and i may as well tell you at the beginning and to avoid waste of time or language that we cannot admit any interference  we were just going to take some slight refreshment when you interrupted us  the little man had a dawning expression of understanding and stooped and picked up the unused bottle of wine eyeing it curiously  turnbull continued  but that refreshment was preparatory to something which i fear you will find less comprehensible but on which our minds are entirely fixed sir we are forced to fight a duel we are forced by honour and an internal intellectual need do not for your own sake attempt to stop us i know all the excellent and ethical things that you will want to say to us i know all about the essential requirements of civil order i have written leading articles about them all my life i know all about the sacredness of human life i have bored all my friends with it try and understand our position this man and i are alone in the modern world in that we think that god is essentially important i think he does not exist that is where the importance comes in for me but this man thinks that he does exist and thinking that very properly thinks him more important than anything else now we wish to make a great demonstration and assertionsomething that will set the world on fire like the first christian persecutions if you like we are attempting a mutual martyrdom the papers have posted up every town against us scotland yard has fortified every police station with our enemies we are driven therefore to the edge of a lonely lane and indirectly to taking liberties with your summerhouse in order to arrange our  stop roared the little man in the butterfly necktie put me out of my intellectual misery are you really the two tomfools i have read of in all the papers are you the two people who wanted to spit each other in the police court are you are you  yes said macian it began in a police court  the little man slung the bottle of wine twenty yards away like a stone  come up to my place he said ive got better stuff than that ive got the best beaune within fifty miles of here come up youre the very men i wanted to see  even turnbull with his typical invulnerability was a little taken aback by this boisterous and almost brutal hospitality  whysir he began  come up come in howled the little man dancing with delight ill give you a dinner ill give you a bed ill give you a green smooth lawn and your choice of swords and pistols why you fools i adore fighting its the only good thing in gods world ive walked about these damned fields and longed to see somebody cut up and killed and the blood running ha ha  and he made sudden lunges with his stick at the trunk of a neighbouring tree so that the ferrule made fierce prints and punctures in the bark  excuse me said macian suddenly with the wideeyed curiosity of a child excuse me but  well said the small fighter brandishing his wooden weapon  excuse me repeated macian but was that what you were doing at the door  the little man stared an instant and then said yes and turnbull broke into a guffaw  come on cried the little man tucking his stick under his arm and taking quite suddenly to his heels come on confound me ill see both of you eat and then ill see one of you die lord bless me the gods must exist after allthey have sent me one of my daydreams lord a duel  he had gone flying along a winding path between the borders of the kitchen garden and in the increasing twilight he was as hard to follow as a flying hare but at length the path after many twists betrayed its purpose and led abruptly up two or three steps to the door of a tiny but very clean cottage there was nothing about the outside to distinguish it from other cottages except indeed its ominous cleanliness and one thing that was out of all the custom and tradition of all cottages under the sun in the middle of the little garden among the stocks and marigolds there surged up in shapeless stone a south sea island idol there was something gross and even evil in that eyeless and alien god among the most innocent of the english flowers  come in cried the creature again come in its better inside  whether or no it was better inside it was at least a surprise the moment the two duellists had pushed open the door of that inoffensive whitewashed cottage they found that its interior was lined with fiery gold it was like stepping into a chamber in the arabian nights the door that closed behind them shut out england and all the energies of the west the ornaments that shone and shimmered on every side of them were subtly mixed from many periods and lands but were all oriental cruel assyrian basreliefs ran along the sides of the passage cruel turkish swords and daggers glinted above and below them the two were separated by ages and fallen civilizations yet they seemed to sympathize since they were both harmonious and both merciless the house seemed to consist of chamber within chamber and created that impression as of a dream which belongs also to the arabian nights themselves the innermost room of all was like the inside of a jewel the little man who owned it all threw himself on a heap of scarlet and golden cushions and struck his hands together a negro in a white robe and turban appeared suddenly and silently behind them  selim said the host these two gentlemen are staying with me tonight send up the very best wine and dinner at once and selim one of these gentlemen will probably die tomorrow make arrangements please  the negro bowed and withdrew  evan macian came out the next morning into the little garden to a fresh silver day his long face looking more austere than ever in that cold light his eyelids a little heavy he carried one of the swords turnbull was in the little house behind him demolishing the end of an early breakfast and humming a tune to himself which could be heard through the open window a moment or two later he leapt to his feet and came out into the sunlight still munching toast his own sword stuck under his arm like a walkingstick  their eccentric host had vanished from sight with a polite gesture some twenty minutes before they imagined him to be occupied on some concerns in the interior of the house and they waited for his emergence stamping the garden in silencethe garden of tall fresh country flowers in the midst of which the monstrous south sea idol lifted itself as abruptly as the prow of a ship riding on a sea of red and white and gold  it was with a start therefore that they came upon the man himself already in the garden they were all the more startled because of the still posture in which they found him he was on his knees in front of the stone idol rigid and motionless like a saint in a trance or ecstasy yet when turnbulls tread broke a twig he was on his feet in a flash  excuse me he said with an irradiation of smiles but yet with a kind of bewilderment so sorryfamily prayersold fashionedmothers knee let us go on to the lawn behind  and he ducked rapidly round the statue to an open space of grass on the other side of it  this will do us best mr macian said he then he made a gesture towards the heavy stone figure on the pedestal which had now its blank and shapeless back turned towards them dont you be afraid he added he can still see us  macian turned his blue blinking eyes which seemed still misty with sleep or sleeplessness towards the idol but his brows drew together  the little man with the long hair also had his eyes on the back view of the god his eyes were at once liquid and burning and he rubbed his hands slowly against each other  do you know he said i think he can see us better this way i often think that this blank thing is his real face watching though it cannot be watched he he yes i think he looks nice from behind he looks more cruel from behind dont you think  what the devil is the thing asked turnbull gruffly  it is the only thing there is answered the other it is force  oh said turnbull shortly  yes my friends said the little man with an animated countenance fluttering his fingers in the air it was no chance that led you to this garden surely it was the caprice of some old god some happy pitiless god perhaps it was his will for he loves blood and on that stone in front of him men have been butchered by hundreds in the fierce feasting islands of the south in this cursed craven place i have not been permitted to kill men on his altar only rabbits and cats sometimes  in the stillness macian made a sudden movement unmeaning apparently and then remained rigid  but today today continued the small man in a shrill voice today his hour is come today his will is done on earth as it is in heaven men men men will bleed before him today and he bit his forefinger in a kind of fever  still the two duellists stood with their swords as heavily as statues and the silence seemed to cool the eccentric and call him back to more rational speech  perhaps i express myself a little too lyrically he said with an amicable abruptness my philosophy has its higher ecstasies but perhaps you are hardly worked up to them yet let us confine ourselves to the unquestioned you have found your way gentlemen by a beautiful accident to the house of the only man in england probably who will favour and encourage your most reasonable project from cornwall to cape wrath this county is one horrible solid block of humanitarianism you will find men who will defend this or that war in a distant continent they will defend it on the contemptible ground of commerce or the more contemptible ground of social good but do not fancy that you will find one other person who will comprehend a strong man taking the sword in his hand and wiping out his enemy my name is wimpey morrice wimpey i had a fellowship at magdalen but i assure you i had to drop it owing to my having said something in a public lecture infringing the popular prejudice against those great gentlemen the assassins of the italian renaissance they let me say it at dinner and so on and seemed to like it but in a public lectureso inconsistent well as i say here is your only refuge and temple of honour here you can fall back on that naked and awful arbitration which is the only thing that balances the starsa still continuous violence vae victis down down down with the defeated victory is the only ultimate fact carthage was destroyed the red indians are being exterminated that is the single certainty in an hour from now that sun will still be shining and that grass growing and one of you will be conquered one of you will be the conqueror when it has been done nothing will alter it heroes i give you the hospitality fit for heroes and i salute the survivor fall on  the two men took their swords then macian said steadily mr turnbull lend me your sword a moment  turnbull with a questioning glance handed him the weapon macian took the second sword in his left hand and with a violent gesture hurled it at the feet of little mr wimpey  fight he said in a loud harsh voice fight me now  wimpey took a step backward and bewildered words bubbled on his lips  pick up that sword and fight me repeated macian with brows as black as thunder  the little man turned to turnbull with a gesture demanding judgement or protection  really sir he began this gentleman confuses  you stinking little coward roared turnbull suddenly releasing his wrath fight if youre so fond of fighting fight if youre so fond of all that filthy philosophy if winning is everything go in and win if the weak must go to the wall go to the wall fight you rat fight or if you wont fightrun  and he ran at wimpey with blazing eyes  wimpey staggered back a few paces like a man struggling with his own limbs then he felt the furious scotchman coming at him like an express train doubling his size every second with eyes as big as windows and a sword as bright as the sun something broke inside him and he found himself running away tumbling over his own feet in terror and crying out as he ran  chase him shouted turnbull as macian snatched up the sword and joined in the scamper chase him over a county chase him into the sea shoo shoo shoo  the little man plunged like a rabbit among the tall flowers the two duellists after him turnbull kept at his tail with savage ecstasy still shooing him like a cat but macian as he ran past the south sea idol paused an instant to spring upon its pedestal for five seconds he strained against the inert mass then it stirred and he sent it over with a great crash among the flowers that engulfed it altogether then he went bounding after the runaway  in the energy of his alarm the exfellow of magdalen managed to leap the paling of his garden the two pursuers went over it after him like flying birds he fled frantically down a long lane with his two terrors on his trail till he came to a gap in the hedge and went across a steep meadow like the wind the two scotchmen as they ran kept up a cheery bellowing and waved their swords up three slanting meadows down four slanting meadows on the other side across another road across a heath of snapping bracken through a wood across another road and to the brink of a big pool they pursued the flying philosopher but when he came to the pool his pace was so precipitate that he could not stop it and with a kind of lurching stagger he fell splash into the greasy water getting dripping to his feet with the water up to his knees the worshipper of force and victory waded disconsolately to the other side and drew himself on to the bank and turnbull sat down on the grass and went off into reverberations of laughter a second afterwards the most extraordinary grimaces were seen to distort the stiff face of macian and unholy sounds came from within he had never practised laughing and it hurt him very much     vii the village of grassleyinthehole  at about half past one under a strong blue sky turnbull got up out of the grass and fern in which he had been lying and his still intermittent laughter ended in a kind of yawn  im hungry he said shortly are you  i have not noticed answered macian what are you going to do  theres a village down the road past the pool answered turnbull i can see it from here i can see the whitewashed walls of some cottages and a kind of corner of the church how jolly it all looks it looks soi dont know what the word isso sensible dont fancy im under any illusions about arcadian virtue and the innocent villagers men make beasts of themselves there with drink but they dont deliberately make devils of themselves with mere talking they kill wild animals in the wild woods but they dont kill cats to the god of victory they dont he broke off and suddenly spat on the ground  excuse me he said it was ceremonial one has to get the taste out of ones mouth  the taste of what asked macian  i dont know the exact name for it replied turnbull perhaps it is the south sea islands or it may be magdalen college  there was a long pause and macian also lifted his large limbs off the groundhis eyes particularly dreamy  i know what you mean turnbull he said but i always thought you people agreed with all that  with all that about doing as one likes and the individual and nature loving the strongest and all the things which that cockroach talked about  turnbulls big bluegrey eyes stood open with a grave astonishment  do you really mean to say macian he said that you fancied that we the freethinkers that bradlaugh or holyoake or ingersoll believe all that dirty immoral mysticism about nature damn nature  i supposed you did said macian calmly it seems to me your most conclusive position  and you mean to tell me rejoined the other that you broke my window and challenged me to mortal combat and tied a tradesman up with ropes and chased an oxford fellow across five meadowsall under the impression that i am such an illiterate idiot as to believe in nature  i supposed you did repeated macian with his usual mildness but i admit that i know little of the details of your beliefor disbelief  turnbull swung round quite suddenly and set off towards the village  come along he cried come down to the village come down to the nearest decent inhabitable pub this is a case for beer  i do not quite follow you said the highlander  yes you do answered turnbull you follow me slap into the innparlour i repeat this is a case for beer we must have the whole of this matter out thoroughly before we go a step farther do you know that an idea has just struck me of great simplicity and of some cogency do not by any means let us drop our intentions of settling our differences with two steel swords but do you not think that with two pewter pots we might do what we really have never thought of doing yetdiscover what our difference is  it never occurred to me before answered macian with tranquillity it is a good suggestion  and they set out at an easy swing down the steep road to the village of grassleyinthehole  grassleyinthehole was a rude parallelogram of buildings with two thoroughfares which might have been called two high streets if it had been possible to call them streets one of these ways was higher on the slope than the other the whole parallelogram lying aslant so to speak on the side of the hill the upper of these two roads was decorated with a big public house a butchers shop a small public house a sweetstuff shop a very small public house and an illegible signpost the lower of the two roads boasted a horsepond a post office a gentlemans garden with very high hedges a microscopically small public house and two cottages where all the people lived who supported all the public houses was in this as in many other english villages a silent and smiling mystery the church lay a little above and beyond the village with a square grey tower dominating it decisively  but even the church was scarcely so central and solemn an institution as the large public house the valencourt arms it was named after some splendid family that had long gone bankrupt and whose seat was occupied by a man who had invented a hygienic bootjack but the unfathomable sentimentalism of the english people insisted in regarding the inn the seat and the sitter in it as alike parts of a pure and marmoreal antiquity and in the valencourt arms festivity itself had some solemnity and decorum and beer was drunk with reverence as it ought to be into the principal parlour of this place entered two strangers who found themselves as is always the case in such hostels the object not of fluttered curiosity or pert inquiry but of steady ceaseless devouring ocular study they had long coats down to their heels and carried under each coat something that looked like a stick one was tall and dark the other short and redhaired they ordered a pot of ale each  macian said turnbull lifting his tankard the fool who wanted us to be friends made us want to go on fighting it is only natural that the fool who wanted us to fight should make us friendly macian your health  dusk was already dropping the rustics in the tavern were already lurching and lumbering out of it by twos and threes crying clamorous good nights to a solitary old toper that remained before macian and turnbull had reached the really important part of their discussion  macian wore an expression of sad bewilderment not uncommon with him i am to understand then he said that you dont believe in nature  you may say so in a very special and emphatic sense said turnbull i do not believe in nature just as i do not believe in odin she is a myth it is not merely that i do not believe that nature can guide us it is that i do not believe that nature exists  exists said macian in his monotonous way settling his pewter pot on the table  yes in a real sense nature does not exist i mean that nobody can discover what the original nature of things would have been if things had not interfered with it the first blade of grass began to tear up the earth and eat it it was interfering with nature if there is any nature the first wild ox began to tear up the grass and eat it he was interfering with nature if there is any nature in the same way continued turnbull the human when it asserts its dominance over nature is just as natural as the thing which it destroys  and in the same way said macian almost dreamily the superhuman the supernatural is just as natural as the nature which it destroys  turnbull took his head out of his pewter pot in some anger  the supernatural of course he said is quite another thing the case of the supernatural is simple the supernatural does not exist  quite so said macian in a rather dull voice you said the same about the natural if the natural does not exist the supernatural obviously cant and he yawned a little over his ale  turnbull turned for some reason a little red and remarked quickly that may be jolly clever for all i know but everyone does know that there is a division between the things that as a matter of fact do commonly happen and the things that dont things that break the evident laws of nature  which does not exist put in macian sleepily turnbull struck the table with a sudden hand  good lord in heaven he cried  who does not exist murmured macian  good lord in heaven thundered turnbull without regarding the interruption do you really mean to sit there and say that you like anybody else would not recognize the difference between a natural occurrence and a supernatural oneif there could be such a thing if i flew up to the ceiling  you would bump your head badly cried macian suddenly starting up one cant talk of this kind of thing under a ceiling at all come outside come outside and ascend into heaven  he burst the door open on a blue abyss of evening and they stepped out into it it was suddenly and strangely cool  turnbull said macian you have said some things so true and some so false that i want to talk and i will try to talk so that you understand for at present you do not understand at all we dont seem to mean the same things by the same words  he stood silent for a second or two and then resumed  a minute or two ago i caught you out in a real contradiction at that moment logically i was right and at that moment i knew i was wrong yes there is a real difference between the natural and the supernatural if you flew up into that blue sky this instant i should think that you were moved by godor the devil but if you want to know what i really thinki must explain  he stopped again abstractedly boring the point of his sword into the earth and went on  i was born and bred and taught in a complete universe the supernatural was not natural but it was perfectly reasonable nay the supernatural to me is more reasonable than the natural for the supernatural is a direct message from god who is reason i was taught that some things are natural and some things divine i mean that some things are mechanical and some things divine but there is the great difficulty turnbull the great difficulty is that according to my teaching you are divine  me divine said turnbull truculently what do you mean  that is just the difficulty continued macian thoughtfully i was told that there was a difference between the grass and a mans will and the difference was that a mans will was special and divine a mans free will i heard was supernatural  rubbish said turnbull  oh said macian patiently then if a mans free will isnt supernatural why do your materialists deny that it exists  turnbull was silent for a moment then he began to speak but macian continued with the same steady voice and sad eyes  so what i feel is this here is the great divine creation i was taught to believe in i can understand your disbelieving in it but why disbelieve in a part of it it was all one thing to me god had authority because he was god man had authority because he was man you cannot prove that god is better than a man nor can you prove that a man is better than a horse why permit any ordinary thing why do you let a horse be saddled  some modern thinkers disapprove of it said turnbull a little doubtfully  i know said macian grimly that man who talked about love for instance  turnbull made a humorous grimace then he said we seem to be talking in a kind of shorthand but i wont pretend not to understand you what you mean is this that you learnt about all your saints and angels at the same time as you learnt about common morality from the same people in the same way and you mean to say that if one may be disputed so may the other well let that pass for the moment but let me ask you a question in turn did not this system of yours which you swallowed whole contain all sorts of things that were merely local the respect for the chief of your clan or such things the village ghost the family feud or what not did you not take in those things too along with your theology  macian stared along the dim village road down which the last straggler from the inn was trailing his way  what you say is not unreasonable he said but it is not quite true the distinction between the chief and us did exist but it was never anything like the distinction between the human and the divine or the human and the animal it was more like the distinction between one animal and another but  well said turnbull  macian was silent  go on repeated turnbull whats the matter with you what are you staring at  i am staring said macian at last at that which shall judge us both  oh yes said turnbull in a tired way i suppose you mean god  no i dont said macian shaking his head i mean him  and he pointed to the halftipsy yokel who was ploughing down the road  what do you mean asked the atheist  i mean him repeated macian with emphasis he goes out in the early dawn he digs or he ploughs a field then he comes back and drinks ale and then he sings a song all your philosophies and political systems are young compared to him all your hoary cathedrals yes even the eternal church on earth is new compared to him the most mouldering gods in the british museum are new facts beside him it is he who in the end shall judge us all  and macian rose to his feet with a vague excitement  what are you going to do  i am going to ask him cried macian which of us is right  turnbull broke into a kind of laugh ask that intoxicated turnipeater he began  yeswhich of us is right cried macian violently oh you have long words and i have long words and i talk of every man being the image of god and you talk of every man being a citizen and enlightened enough to govern but if every man typifies god there is god if every man is an enlightened citizen there is your enlightened citizen the first man one meets is always man let us catch him up  and in gigantic strides the long lean highlander whirled away into the grey twilight turnbull following with a goodhumoured oath  the track of the rustic was easy to follow even in the faltering dark for he was enlivening his wavering walk with song it was an interminable poem beginning with some unspecified king william who it appeared lived in london town and who after the second rise vanished rather abruptly from the train of thought the rest was almost entirely about beer and was thick with local topography of a quite unrecognizable kind the singers step was neither very rapid nor indeed exceptionally secure so the song grew louder and louder and the two soon overtook him  he was a man elderly or rather of any age with lean grey hair and a lean red face but with that remarkable rustic physiognomy in which it seems that all the features stand out independently from the face the rugged red nose going out like a limb the bleared blue eyes standing out like signals  he gave them greeting with the elaborate urbanity of the slightly intoxicated macian who was vibrating with one of his silent violent decisions opened the question without delay he explained the philosophic position in words as short and simple as possible but the singular old man with the lank red face seemed to think uncommonly little of the short words he fixed with a fierce affection upon one or two of the long ones  atheists he repeated with luxurious scorn atheists i know their sort master atheists dont talk to me about un atheists  the grounds of his disdain seemed a little dark and confused but they were evidently sufficient macian resumed in some encouragement  you think as i do i hope you think that a man should be connected with the church with the common christian  the old man extended a quivering stick in the direction of a distant hill  theres the church he said thickly grassley old church that is pulled down it was in the old squires time and  i mean explained macian elaborately that you think that there should be someone typifying religion a priest  priests said the old man with sudden passion priests i know un what they want in england thats what i say what they want in england  they want you said macian  quite so said turnbull and me but they wont get us macian your attempt on the primitive innocence does not seem very successful let me try what you want my friend is your rights you dont want any priests or churches a vote a right to speak is what you  who says i ant got a right to speak said the old man facing round in an irrational frenzy i got a right to speak im a man i am i dont want no votin nor priests i say a mans a man thats what i say if a man ant a man what is he thats what i say if a man ant a man what is he when i sees a man i sez es a man  quite so said turnbull a citizen  i say hes a man said the rustic furiously stopping and striking his stick on the ground not a city or owt else hes a man  youre perfectly right said the sudden voice of macian falling like a sword and you have kept close to something the whole world of today tries to forget  good night  and the old man went on wildly singing into the night  a jolly old creature said turnbull he didnt seem able to get much beyond that fact that a man is a man  has anybody got beyond it asked macian  turnbull looked at him curiously are you turning an agnostic he asked  oh you do not understand cried out macian we catholics are all agnostics we catholics have only in that sense got as far as realizing that man is a man but your ibsens and your zolas and your shaws and your tolstoys have not even got so far     viii an interlude of argument  morning broke in bitter silver along the grey and level plain and almost as it did so turnbull and macian came out of a low scrubby wood on to the empty and desolate flats they had walked all night  they had walked all night and talked all night also and if the subject had been capable of being exhausted they would have exhausted it their long and changing argument had taken them through districts and landscapes equally changing they had discussed haeckel upon hills so high and steep that in spite of the coldness of the night it seemed as if the stars might burn them they had explained and reexplained the massacre of st bartholomew in little white lanes walled in with standing corn as with walls of gold they had talked about mr kensit in dim and twinkling pine woods amid the bewildering monotony of the pines and it was with the end of a long speech from macian passionately defending the practical achievements and the solid prosperity of the catholic tradition that they came out upon the open land  macian had learnt much and thought more since he came out of the cloudy hills of arisaig he had met many typical modern figures under circumstances which were sharply symbolic and moreover he had absorbed the main modern atmosphere from the mere presence and chance phrases of turnbull as such atmospheres can always be absorbed from the presence and the phrases of any man of great mental vitality he had at last begun thoroughly to understand what are the grounds upon which the mass of the modern world solidly disapprove of her creed and he threw himself into replying to them with a hot intellectual enjoyment  i begin to understand one or two of your dogmas mr turnbull he had said emphatically as they ploughed heavily up a wooded hill and every one that i understand i deny take any one of them you like you hold that your heretics and sceptics have helped the world forward and handed on a lamp of progress i deny it nothing is plainer from real history than that each of your heretics invented a complete cosmos of his own which the next heretic smashed entirely to pieces who knows now exactly what nestorius taught who cares there are only two things that we know for certain about it the first is that nestorius as a heretic taught something quite opposite to the teaching of arius the heretic who came before him and something quite useless to james turnbull the heretic who comes after i defy you to go back to the freethinkers of the past and find any habitation for yourself at all i defy you to read godwin or shelley or the deists of the eighteenth century of the natureworshipping humanists of the renaissance without discovering that you differ from them twice as much as you differ from the pope you are a nineteenthcentury sceptic and you are always telling me that i ignore the cruelty of nature if you had been an eighteenthcentury sceptic you would have told me that i ignore the kindness and benevolence of nature you are an atheist and you praise the deists of the eighteenth century read them instead of praising them and you will find that their whole universe stands or falls with the deity you are a materialist and you think bruno a scientific hero see what he said and you will think him an insane mystic no the great freethinker with his genuine ability and honesty does not in practice destroy christianity what he does destroy is the freethinker who went before freethought may be suggestive it may be inspiriting it may have as much as you please of the merits that come from vivacity and variety but there is one thing freethought can never be by any possibilityfreethought can never be progressive it can never be progressive because it will accept nothing from the past it begins every time again from the beginning and it goes every time in a different direction all the rational philosophers have gone along different roads so it is impossible to say which has gone farthest who can discuss whether emerson was a better optimist than schopenhauer was pessimist it is like asking if this corn is as yellow as that hill is steep no there are only two things that really progress and they both accept accumulations of authority they may be progressing uphill and down they may be growing steadily better or steadily worse but they have steadily increased in certain definable matters they have steadily advanced in a certain definable direction they are the only two things it seems that ever can progress the first is strictly physical science the second is the catholic church  physical science and the catholic church said turnbull sarcastically and no doubt the first owes a great deal to the second  if you pressed that point i might reply that it was very probable answered macian calmly i often fancy that your historical generalizations rest frequently on random instances i should not be surprised if your vague notions of the church as the persecutor of science was a generalization from galileo i should not be at all surprised if when you counted the scientific investigations and discoveries since the fall of rome you found that a great mass of them had been made by monks but the matter is irrelevant to my meaning i say that if you want an example of anything which has progressed in the moral world by the same method as science in the material world by continually adding to without unsettling what was there before then i say that there is only one example of it and that is us  with this enormous difference said turnbull that however elaborate be the calculations of physical science their net result can be tested granted that it took millions of books i never read and millions of men i never heard of to discover the electric light still i can see the electric light but i cannot see the supreme virtue which is the result of all your theologies and sacraments  catholic virtue is often invisible because it is the normal answered macian christianity is always out of fashion because it is always sane and all fashions are mild insanities when italy is mad on art the church seems too puritanical when england is mad on puritanism the church seems too artistic when you quarrel with us now you class us with kingship and despotism but when you quarrelled with us first it was because we would not accept the divine despotism of henry viii the church always seems to be behind the times when it is really beyond the times it is waiting till the last fad shall have seen its last summer it keeps the key of a permanent virtue  oh i have heard all that said turnbull with genial contempt i have heard that christianity keeps the key of virtue and that if you read tom paine you will cut your throat at monte carlo it is such rubbish that i am not even angry at it you say that christianity is the prop of morals but what more do you do when a doctor attends you and could poison you with a pinch of salt do you ask whether he is a christian you ask whether he is a gentleman whether he is an mdanything but that when a soldier enlists to die for his country or disgrace it do you ask whether he is a christian you are more likely to ask whether he is oxford or cambridge at the boat race if you think your creed essential to morals why do you not make it a test for these things  we once did make it a test for these things said macian smiling and then you told us that we were imposing by force a faith unsupported by argument it seems rather hard that having first been told that our creed must be false because we did use tests we should now be told that it must be false because we dont but i notice that most antichristian arguments are in the same inconsistent style  that is all very well as a debatingclub answer replied turnbull goodhumouredly but the question still remains why dont you confine yourself more to christians if christians are the only really good men  who talked of such folly asked macian disdainfully do you suppose that the catholic church ever held that christians were the only good men why the catholics of the catholic middle ages talked about the virtues of all the virtuous pagans until humanity was sick of the subject no if you really want to know what we mean when we say that christianity has a special power of virtue i will tell you the church is the only thing on earth that can perpetuate a type of virtue and make it something more than a fashion the thing is so plain and historical that i hardly think you will ever deny it you cannot deny that it is perfectly possible that tomorrow morning in ireland or in italy there might appear a man not only as good but good in exactly the same way as st francis of assisi very well now take the other types of human virtue many of them splendid the english gentleman of elizabeth was chivalrous and idealistic but can you stand still here in this meadow and be an english gentleman of elizabeth the austere republican of the eighteenth century with his stern patriotism and his simple life was a fine fellow but have you ever seen him have you ever seen an austere republican only a hundred years have passed and that volcano of revolutionary truth and valour is as cold as the mountains of the moon and so it is and so it will be with the ethics which are buzzing down fleet street at this instant as i speak what phrase would inspire the london clerk or workman just now perhaps that he is a son of the british empire on which the sun never sets perhaps that he is a prop of his trades union or a classconscious proletarian something or other perhaps merely that he is a gentleman when he obviously is not those names and notions are all honourable but how long will they last empires break industrial conditions change the suburbs will not last for ever what will remain i will tell you the catholic saint will remain  and suppose i dont like him said turnbull  on my theory the question is rather whether he will like you or more probably whether he will ever have heard of you but i grant the reasonableness of your query you have a right if you speak as the ordinary man to ask if you will like the saint but as the ordinary man you do like him you revel in him if you dislike him it is not because you are a nice ordinary man but because you are if you will excuse me a sophisticated prig of a fleet street editor that is just the funny part of it the human race has always admired the catholic virtues however little it can practise them and oddly enough it has admired most those of them that the modern world most sharply disputes you complain of catholicism for setting up an ideal of virginity it did nothing of the kind the whole human race set up an ideal of virginity the greeks in athene the romans in the vestal fire set up an ideal of virginity what then is your real quarrel with catholicism your quarrel can only be your quarrel really only is that catholicism has achieved an ideal of virginity that it is no longer a mere piece of floating poetry but if you and a few feverish men in top hats running about in a street in london choose to differ as to the ideal itself not only from the church but from the parthenon whose name means virginity from the roman empire which went outwards from the virgin flame from the whole legend and tradition of europe from the lion who will not touch virgins from the unicorn who respects them and who make up together the bearers of your own national shield from the most living and lawless of your own poets from massinger who wrote the virgin martyr from shakespeare who wrote measure for measureif you in fleet street differ from all this human experience does it never strike you that it may be fleet street that is wrong  no answered turnbull i trust that i am sufficiently fairminded to canvass and consider the idea but having considered it i think fleet street is right yeseven if the parthenon is wrong i think that as the world goes on new psychological atmospheres are generated and in these atmospheres it is possible to find delicacies and combinations which in other times would have to be represented by some ruder symbol every man feels the need of some element of purity in sex perhaps they can only typify purity as the absence of sex you will laugh if i suggest that we may have made in fleet street an atmosphere in which a man can be so passionate as sir lancelot and as pure as sir galahad but after all we have in the modern world erected many such atmospheres we have for instance a new and imaginative appreciation of children  quite so replied macian with a singular smile it has been very well put by one of the brightest of your young authors who said unless you become as little children ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven but you are quite right there is a modern worship of children and what i ask you is this modern worship of children what in the name of all the angels and devils is it except a worship of virginity why should anyone worship a thing merely because it is small or immature no you have tried to escape from this thing and the very thing you point to as the goal of your escape is only the thing again am i wrong in saying that these things seem to be eternal  and it was with these words that they came in sight of the great plains they went a little way in silence and then james turnbull said suddenly but i cannot believe in the thing macian answered nothing to the speech perhaps it is unanswerable and indeed they scarcely spoke another word to each other all that day     ix the strange lady  moonrise with a great and growing moon opened over all those flats making them seem flatter and larger than they were turning them to a lake of blue light the two companions trudged across the moonlit plain for half an hour in full silence then macian stopped suddenly and planted his swordpoint in the ground like one who plants his tentpole for the night leaving it standing there he clutched his blackhaired skull with his great claws of hands as was his custom when forcing the pace of his brain then his hands dropped again and he spoke  im sure youre thinking the same as i am he said how long are we to be on this damned seesaw  the other did not answer but his silence seemed somehow solid as assent and macian went on conversationally neither noticed that both had instinctively stood still before the sign of the fixed and standing sword  it is hard to guess what god means in this business but he means somethingor the other thing or both whenever we have tried to fight each other something has stopped us whenever we have tried to be reconciled to each other something has stopped us again by the run of our luck we have never had time to be either friends or enemies something always jumped out of the bushes  turnbull nodded gravely and glanced round at the huge and hedgeless meadow which fell away towards the horizon into a glimmering high road  nothing will jump out of bushes here anyhow he said  that is what i meant said macian and stared steadily at the heavy hilt of his standing sword which in the slight wind swayed on its tempered steel like some huge thistle on its stalk  that is what i meant we are quite alone here i have not heard a horsehoof or a footstep or the hoot of a train for miles so i think we might stop here and ask for a miracle  oh might we said the atheistic editor with a sort of gusto of disgust  i beg your pardon said macian meekly i forgot your prejudices he eyed the windswung swordhilt in sad meditation and resumed what i mean is we might find out in this quiet place whether there really is any fate or any commandment against our enterprise i will engage on my side like elijah to accept a test from heaven turnbull let us draw swords here in this moonlight and this monstrous solitude and if here in this moonlight and solitude there happens anything to interrupt usif it be lightning striking our swordblades or a rabbit running under our legsi will take it as a sign from god and we will shake hands for ever  turnbulls mouth twitched in angry humour under his red moustache he said i will wait for signs from god until i have any signs of his existence but godor fateforbid that a man of scientific culture should refuse any kind of experiment  very well then said macian shortly we are more quiet here than anywhere else let us engage and he plucked his swordpoint out of the turf  turnbull regarded him for a second and a half with a baffling visage almost black against the moonrise then his hand made a sharp movement to his hip and his sword shone in the moon  as old chessplayers open every game with established gambits they opened with a thrust and parry orthodox and even frankly ineffectual but in macians soul more formless storms were gathering and he made a lunge or two so savage as first to surprise and then to enrage his opponent turnbull ground his teeth kept his temper and waiting for the third lunge and the worst had almost spitted the lunger when a shrill small cry came from behind him a cry such as is not made by any of the beasts that perish  turnbull must have been more superstitious than he knew for he stopped in the act of going forward macian was brazenly superstitious and he dropped his sword after all he had challenged the universe to send an interruption and this was an interruption whatever else it was an instant afterwards the sharp weak cry was repeated this time it was certain that it was human and that it was female  macian stood rolling those great blue gaelic eyes that contrasted with his dark hair it is the voice of god he said again and again  god hasnt got much of a voice said turnbull who snatched at every chance of cheap profanity as a matter of fact macian it isnt the voice of god but its something a jolly sight more importantit is the voice of manor rather of woman so i think wed better scoot in its direction  macian snatched up his fallen weapon without a word and the two raced away towards that part of the distant road from which the cry was now constantly renewed  they had to run over a curve of country that looked smooth but was very rough a neglected field which they soon found to be full of the tallest grasses and the deepest rabbitholes moreover that great curve of the countryside which looked so slow and gentle when you glanced over it proved to be highly precipitous when you scampered over it and turnbull was twice nearly flung on his face macian though much heavier avoided such an overthrow only by having the quick and incalculable feet of the mountaineer but both of them may be said to have leapt off a low cliff when they leapt into the road  the moonlight lay on the white road with a more naked and electric glare than on the greygreen upland and though the scene which it revealed was complicated it was not difficult to get its first features at a glance  a small but very neat blackandyellow motorcar was standing stolidly slightly to the left of the road a somewhat larger lightgreen motorcar was tipped halfway into a ditch on the same side and four flushed and staggering men in evening dress were tipped out of it three of them were standing about the road giving their opinions to the moon with vague but echoing violence the fourth however had already advanced on the chauffeur of the blackandyellow car and was threatening him with a stick the chauffeur had risen to defend himself by his side sat a young lady  she was sitting bolt upright a slender and rigid figure gripping the sides of her seat and her first few cries had ceased she was clad in closefitting dark costume a mass of warm brown hair went out in two wings or waves on each side of her forehead and even at that distance it could be seen that her profile was of the aquiline and eager sort like a young falcon hardly free of the nest  turnbull had concealed in him somewhere a fund of common sense and knowledge of the world of which he himself and his best friends were hardly aware he was one of those who take in much of the shows of things absentmindedly and in an irrelevant reverie as he stood at the door of his editorial shop on ludgate hill and meditated on the nonexistence of god he silently absorbed a good deal of varied knowledge about the existence of men he had come to know types by instinct and dilemmas with a glance he saw the crux of the situation in the road and what he saw made him redouble his pace  he knew that the men were rich he knew that they were drunk and he knew what was worst of all that they were fundamentally frightened and he knew this also that no common ruffian such as attacks ladies in novels is ever so savage and ruthless as a coarse kind of gentleman when he is really alarmed the reason is not recondite it is simply because the policecourt is not such a menacing novelty to the poor ruffian as it is to the rich when they came within hail and heard the voices they confirmed all turnbulls anticipations the man in the middle of the road was shouting in a hoarse and groggy voice that the chauffeur had smashed their car on purpose that they must get to the cri that evening and that he would jolly well have to take them there the chauffeur had mildly objected that he was driving a lady oh well take care of the lady said the redfaced young man and went off into gurgling and almost senile laughter  by the time the two champions came up things had grown more serious the intoxication of the man talking to the chauffeur had taken one of its perverse and catlike jumps into mere screaming spite and rage he lifted his stick and struck at the chauffeur who caught hold of it and the drunkard fell backwards dragging him out of his seat on the car another of the rowdies rushed forward booing in idiot excitement fell over the chauffeur and either by accident or design kicked him as he lay the drunkard got to his feet again but the chauffeur did not  the man who had kicked kept a kind of halfwitted conscience or cowardice for he stood staring at the senseless body and murmuring words of inconsequent selfjustification making gestures with his hands as if he were arguing with somebody but the other three with a mere whoop and howl of victory were boarding the car on three sides at once it was exactly at this moment that turnbull fell among them like one fallen from the sky he tore one of the climbers backward by the collar and with a hearty push sent him staggering over into the ditch upon his nose one of the remaining two who was too far gone to notice anything continued to clamber ineffectually over the high back of the car kicking and pouring forth a rivulet of soliloquy but the other dropped at the interruption turned upon turnbull and began a battering bout of fisticuffs at the same moment the man crawled out of the ditch in a masquerade of mud and rushed at his old enemy from behind the whole had not taken a second and an instant after macian was in the midst of them  turnbull had tossed away his sheathed sword greatly preferring his hands except in the avowed etiquette of the duel for he had learnt to use his hands in the old streetbattles of bradlaugh but to macian the sword even sheathed was a more natural weapon and he laid about him on all sides with it as with a stick the man who had the walkingstick found his blows parried with promptitude and a second after to his great astonishment found his own stick fly up in the air as by a conjuring trick with a turn of the swordsmans wrist another of the revellers picked the stick out of the ditch and ran in upon macian calling to his companion to assist him  i havent got a stick grumbled the disarmed man and looked vaguely about the ditch  perhaps said macian politely you would like this one with the word the drunkard found his hand that had grasped the stick suddenly twisted and empty and the stick lay at the feet of his companion on the other side of the road macian felt a faint stir behind him the girl had risen to her feet and was leaning forward to stare at the fighters turnbull was still engaged in countering and pommelling with the third young man the fourth young man was still engaged with himself kicking his legs in helpless rotation on the back of the car and talking with melodious rationality  at length turnbulls opponent began to back before the battery of his heavy hands still fighting for he was the soberest and boldest of the four if these are annals of military glory it is due to him to say that he need not have abandoned the conflict only that as he backed to the edge of the ditch his foot caught in a loop of grass and he went over in a flat and comfortable position from which it took him a considerable time to rise by the time he had risen turnbull had come to the rescue of macian who was at bay but belabouring his two enemies handsomely the sight of the liberated reserve was to them like that of blucher at waterloo the two set off at a sullen trot down the road leaving even the walkingstick lying behind them in the moonlight macian plucked the struggling and aspiring idiot off the back of the car like a stray cat and left him swaying unsteadily in the moon then he approached the front part of the car in a somewhat embarrassed manner and pulled off his cap  for some solid seconds the lady and he merely looked at each other and macian had an irrational feeling of being in a picture hung on a wall that is he was motionless even lifeless and yet staringly significant like a picture the white moonlight on the road when he was not looking at it gave him a vision of the road being white with snow the motorcar when he was not looking at it gave him a rude impression of a captured coach in the old days of highwaymen and he whose whole soul was with the swords and stately manners of the eighteenth century he who was a jacobite risen from the dead had an overwhelming sense of being once more in the picture when he had so long been out of the picture  in that short and strong silence he absorbed the lady from head to foot he had never really looked at a human being before in his life he saw her face and hair first then that she had long suede gloves then that there was a fur cap at the back of her brown hair he might perhaps be excused for this hungry attention he had prayed that some sign might come from heaven and after an almost savage scrutiny he came to the conclusion that his one did the ladys instantaneous arrest of speech might need more explaining but she may well have been stunned with the squalid attack and the abrupt rescue yet it was she who remembered herself first and suddenly called out with selfaccusing horror  oh that poor poor man  they both swung round abruptly and saw that turnbull with his recovered sword under his armpit was already lifting the fallen chauffeur into the car he was only stunned and was slowly awakening feebly waving his left arm  the lady in long gloves and the fur cap leapt out and ran rapidly towards them only to be reassured by turnbull who unlike many of his school really knew a little science when he invoked it to redeem the world hes all right said he hes quite safe but im afraid he wont be able to drive the car for half an hour or so  i can drive the car said the young woman in the fur cap with stony practicability  oh in that case began macian uneasily and that paralysing shyness which is a part of romance induced him to make a backward movement as if leaving her to herself but turnbull was more rational than he being more indifferent  i dont think you ought to drive home alone maam he said gruffly there seem to be a lot of rowdy parties along this road and the man will be no use for an hour if you will tell us where you are going we will see you safely there and say good night  the young lady exhibited all the abrupt disturbance of a person who is not commonly disturbed she said almost sharply and yet with evident sincerity of course i am awfully grateful to you for all youve doneand theres plenty of room if youll come in  turnbull with the complete innocence of an absolutely sound motive immediately jumped into the car but the girl cast an eye at macian who stood in the road for an instant as if rooted like a tree then he also tumbled his long legs into the tonneau having that sense of degradedly diving into heaven which so many have known in so many human houses when they consented to stop to tea or were allowed to stop to supper the slowly reviving chauffeur was set in the back seat turnbull and macian had fallen into the middle one the lady with a steely coolness had taken the drivers seat and all the handles of that headlong machine a moment afterwards the engine started with a throb and leap unfamiliar to turnbull who had only once been in a motor during a general election and utterly unknown to macian who in his present mood thought it was the end of the world almost at the same instant that the car plucked itself out of the mud and whipped away up the road the man who had been flung into the ditch rose waveringly to his feet when he saw the car escaping he ran after it and shouted something which owing to the increasing distance could not be heard it is awful to reflect that if his remark was valuable it is quite lost to the world  the car shot on up and down the shining moonlit lanes and there was no sound in it except the occasional click or catch of its machinery for through some cause or other no soul inside it could think of a word to say the lady symbolized her feelings whatever they were by urging the machine faster and faster until scattered woodlands went by them in one black blotch and heavy hills and valleys seemed to ripple under the wheels like mere waves a little while afterwards this mood seemed to slacken and she fell into a more ordinary pace but still she did not speak turnbull who kept a more common and sensible view of the case than anyone else made some remark about the moonlight but something indescribable made him also relapse into silence  all this time macian had been in a sort of monstrous delirium like some fabulous hero snatched up into the moon the difference between this experience and common experiences was analogous to that between waking life and a dream yet he did not feel in the least as if he were dreaming rather the other way as waking was more actual than dreaming so this seemed by another degree more actual than waking itself but it was another life altogether like a cosmos with a new dimension  he felt he had been hurled into some new incarnation into the midst of new relations wrongs and rights with towering responsibilities and almost tragic joys which he had as yet had no time to examine heaven had not merely sent him a message heaven itself had opened around him and given him an hour of its own ancient and starshattering energy he had never felt so much alive before and yet he was like a man in a trance and if you had asked him on what his throbbing happiness hung he could only have told you that it hung on four or five visible facts as a curtain hangs on four of five fixed nails the fact that the lady had a little fur at her throat the fact that the curve of her cheek was a low and lean curve and that the moonlight caught the height of her cheekbone the fact that her hands were small but heavily gloved as they gripped the steeringwheel the fact that a white witch light was on the road the fact that the brisk breeze of their passage stirred and fluttered a little not only the brown hair of her head but the black fur on her cap all these facts were to him certain and incredible like sacraments  when they had driven half a mile farther a big shadow was flung across the path followed by its bulky owner who eyed the car critically but let it pass the silver moonlight picked out a piece or two of pewter ornament on his blue uniform and as they went by they knew it was a sergeant of police three hundred yards farther on another policeman stepped out into the road as if to stop them then seemed to doubt his own authority and stepped back again the girl was a daughter of the rich and this police suspicion under which all the poor live day and night stung her for the first time into speech  what can they mean she cried out in a kind of temper this cars going like a snail  there was a short silence and then turnbull said it is certainly very odd you are driving quietly enough  you are driving nobly said macian and his words which had no meaning whatever sounded hoarse and ungainly even in his own ears  they passed the next mile and a half swiftly and smoothly yet among the many things which they passed in the course of it was a clump of eager policemen standing at a crossroad as they passed one of the policemen shouted something to the others but nothing else happened eight hundred yards farther on turnbull stood up suddenly in the swaying car  my god macian he called out showing his first emotion of that night i dont believe its the pace it couldnt be the pace i believe its us  macian sat motionless for a few moments and then turned up at his companion a face that was as white as the moon above it  you may be right he said at last if you are i must tell her  i will tell the lady if you like said turnbull with his unconquered good temper  you said macian with a sort of sincere and instinctive astonishment why should youno i must tell her of course  and he leant forward and spoke to the lady in the fur cap  i am afraid madam that we may have got you into some trouble he said and even as he said it it sounded wrong like everything he said to this particular person in the long gloves the fact is he resumed desperately the fact is we are being chased by the police then the last flattening hammer fell upon poor evans embarrassment for the fluffy brown head with the furry black cap did not turn by a section of the compass  we are chased by the police repeated macian vigorously then he added as if beginning an explanation you see i am a catholic  the wind whipped back a curl of the brown hair so as to necessitate a new theory of aesthetics touching the line of the cheekbone but the head did not turn  you see began macian again blunderingly this gentleman wrote in his newspaper that our lady was a common woman a bad woman and so we agreed to fight and we were fighting quite a little time agobut that was before we saw you  the young lady driving her car had half turned her face to listen and it was not a reverent or a patient face that she showed him her norman nose was tilted a trifle too high upon the slim stalk of her neck and body  when macian saw that arrogant and uplifted profile pencilled plainly against the moonshine he accepted an ultimate defeat he had expected the angels to despise him if he were wrong but not to despise him so much as this  you see said the stumbling spokesman i was angry with him when he insulted the mother of god and i asked him to fight a duel with me but the police are all trying to stop it  nothing seemed to waver or flicker in the fair young falcon profile and it only opened its lips to say after a silence i thought people in our time were supposed to respect each others religion  under the shadow of that arrogant face macian could only fall back on the obvious answer but what about a mans irreligion the face only answered well you ought to be more broadminded  if anyone else in the world had said the words macian would have snorted with his equine neigh of scorn but in this case he seemed knocked down by a superior simplicity as if his eccentric attitude were rebuked by the innocence of a child he could not dissociate anything that this woman said or did or wore from an idea of spiritual rarity and virtue like most others under the same elemental passion his soul was at present soaked in ethics he could have applied moral terms to the material objects of her environment if someone had spoken of her generous ribbon or her chivalrous gloves or her merciful shoebuckle it would not have seemed to him nonsense  he was silent and the girl went on in a lower key as if she were momentarily softened and a little saddened also it wont do you know she said you cant find out the truth in that way there are such heaps of churches and people thinking different things nowadays and they all think they are right my uncle was a swedenborgian  macian sat with bowed head listening hungrily to her voice but hardly to her words and seeing his great world drama grow smaller and smaller before his eyes till it was no bigger than a childs toy theatre  the times gone by for all that she went on you cant find out the real thing like thatif there is really anything to find and she sighed rather drearily for like many of the women of our wealthy class she was old and broken in thought though young and clean enough in her emotions  our object said turnbull shortly is to make an effective demonstration and after that word macian looked at his vision again and found it smaller than ever  it would be in the newspapers of course said the girl people read the newspapers but they dont believe them or anything else i think and she sighed again  she drove in silence a third of a mile before she added as if completing the sentence anyhow the whole things quite absurd  i dont think began turnbull that you quite realizehullo hullohullowhats this  the amateur chauffeur had been forced to bring the car to a staggering stoppage for a file of fat blue policemen made a wall across the way a sergeant came to the side and touched his peaked cap to the lady  beg your pardon miss he said with some embarrassment for he knew her for a daughter of a dominant house but we have reason to believe that the gentlemen in your car are and he hesitated for a polite phrase  i am evan macian said that gentleman and stood up in a sort of gloomy pomp not wholly without a touch of the sulks of a schoolboy  yes we will get out sergeant said turnbull more easily my name is james turnbull we must not incommode the lady  what are you taking them up for asked the young woman looking straight in front of her along the road  its under the new act said the sergeant almost apologetically incurable disturbers of the peace  what will happen to them she asked with the same frigid clearness  westgate adult reformatory he replied briefly  until when  until they are cured said the official  very well sergeant said the young lady with a sort of tired common sense i am sure i dont want to protect criminals or go against the law but i must tell you that these gentlemen have done me a considerable service you wont mind drawing your men a little farther off while i say good night to them men like that always misunderstand  the sergeant was profoundly disquieted from the beginning at the mere idea of arresting anyone in the company of a great lady to refuse one of her minor requests was quite beyond his courage the police fell back to a few yards behind the car turnbull took up the two swords that were their only luggage the swords that after so many half duels they were now to surrender at last macian the blood thundering in his brain at the thought of that instant of farewell bent over fumbled at the handle and flung open the door to get out  but he did not get out he did not get out because it is dangerous to jump out of a car when it is going at full speed and the car was going at full speed because the young lady without turning her head or so much as saying a syllable had driven down a handle that made the machine plunge forward like a buffalo and then fly over the landscape like a greyhound the police made one rush to follow and then dropped so grotesque and hopeless a chase away in the vanishing distance they could see the sergeant furiously making notes  the open door still left loose on its hinges swung and banged quite crazily as they went whizzing up one road and down another nor did macian sit down he stood up stunned and yet staring as he would have stood up at the trumpet of the last day a black dot in the distance sprang up a tall black forest swallowed them and spat them out again at the other end a railway bridge grew larger and larger till it leapt upon their backs bellowing and was in its turn left behind avenues of poplars on both sides of the road chased each other like the figures in a zoetrope now and then with a shock and rattle they went through sleeping moonlit villages which must have stirred an instant in their sleep as at the passing of a fugitive earthquake sometimes in an outlying house a light in one erratic unexpected window would give them a nameless hint of the hundred human secrets which they left behind them with their dust sometimes even a slouching rustic would be afoot on the road and would look after them as after a flying phantom but still macian stood up staring at earth and heaven and still the door he had flung open flapped loose like a flag turnbull after a few minutes of dumb amazement had yielded to the healthiest element in his nature and gone off into uncontrollable fits of laughter the girl had not stirred an inch  after another half mile that seemed a mere flash turnbull leant over and locked the door evan staggered at last into his seat and hid his throbbing head in his hands and still the car flew on and its driver sat inflexible and silent the moon had already gone down and the whole darkness was faintly troubled with twilight and the first movement of beasts and fowls it was that mysterious moment when light is coming as if it were something unknown whose nature one could not guessa mere alteration in everything they looked at the sky and it seemed as dark as ever then they saw the black shape of a tower or tree against it and knew that it was already grey save that they were driving southward and had certainly passed the longitude of london they knew nothing of their direction but turnbull who had spent a year on the hampshire coast in his youth began to recognize the unmistakable but quite indescribable villages of the english south then a white witch fire began to burn between the black stems of the firtrees and like so many things in nature though not in books on evolution the daybreak when it did come came much quicker than one would think the gloomy heavens were ripped up and rolled away like a scroll revealing splendours as the car went roaring up the curve of a great hill and above them and black against the broadening light there stood one of those crouching and fantastic trees that are first signals of the sea     x the swords rejoined  as they came over the hill and down on the other side of it it is not too much to say that the whole universe of god opened over them and under them like a thing unfolding to five times its size almost under their feet opened the enormous sea at the bottom of a steep valley which fell down into a bay and the sea under their feet blazed at them almost as lustrous and almost as empty as the sky the sunrise opened above them like some cosmic explosion shining and shattering and yet silent as if the world were blown to pieces without a sound round the rays of the victorious sun swept a sort of rainbow of confused and conquered coloursbrown and blue and green and flaming rosecolour as though gold were driving before it all the colours of the world the lines of the landscape down which they sped were the simple strict yet swerving lines of a rushing river so that it was almost as if they were being sucked down in a huge still whirlpool turnbull had some such feeling for he spoke for the first time for many hours  if we go down at this rate we shall be over the sea cliff he said  how glorious said macian  when however they had come into the wide hollow at the bottom of that landslide the car took a calm and graceful curve along the side of the sea melted into the fringe of a few trees and quietly yet astonishingly stopped a belated light was burning in the broad morning in the window of a sort of lodge or gatekeepers cottage and the girl stood up in the car and turned her splendid face to the sun  evan seemed startled by the stillness like one who had been born amid sound and speed he wavered on his long legs as he stood up he pulled himself together and the only consequence was that he trembled from head to foot turnbull had already opened the door on his side and jumped out  the moment he had done so the strange young woman had one more mad movement and deliberately drove the car a few yards farther then she got out with an almost cruel coolness and began pulling off her long gloves and almost whistling  you can leave me here she said quite casually as if they had met five minutes before that is the lodge of my fathers place please come in if you likebut i understood that you had some business  evan looked at that lifted face and found it merely lovely he was far too much of a fool to see that it was working with a final fatigue and that its austerity was agony he was even fool enough to ask it a question why did you save us he said quite humbly  the girl tore off one of her gloves as if she were tearing off her hand oh i dont know she said bitterly now i come to think of it i cant imagine  evans thoughts that had been piled up to the morning star abruptly let him down with a crash into the very cellars of the emotional universe he remained in a stunned silence for a long time and that if he had only known was the wisest thing that he could possibly do at the moment  indeed the silence and the sunrise had their healing effect for when the extraordinary lady spoke again her tone was more friendly and apologetic im not really ungrateful she said it was very good of you to save me from those men  but why repeated the obstinate and dazed macian why did you save us from the other men i mean the policemen  the girls great brown eyes were lit up with a flash that was at once final desperation and the loosening of some private and passionate reserve  oh god knows she cried god knows that if there is a god he has turned his big back on everything god knows i have had no pleasure in my life though i am pretty and young and father has plenty of money and then people come and tell me that i ought to do things and i do them and its all drivel they want you to do work among the poor which means reading ruskin and feeling selfrighteous in the best room in a poor tenement or to help some cause or other which always means bundling people out of crooked houses in which theyve always lived into straight houses in which they often die and all the time you have inside only the horrid irony of your own empty head and empty heart i am to give to the unfortunate when my whole misfortune is that i have nothing to give i am to teach when i believe nothing at all that i was taught i am to save the children from death and i am not even certain that i should not be better dead i suppose if i actually saw a child drowning i should save it but that would be from the same motive from which i have saved you or destroyed you whichever it is that i have done  what was the motive asked evan in a low voice  my motive is too big for my mind answered the girl  then after a pause as she stared with a rising colour at the glittering sea she said it cant be described and yet i am trying to describe it it seems to me not only that i am unhappy but that there is no way of being happy father is not happy though he is a member of parliament she paused a moment and added with a ghost of a smile nor aunt mabel though a man from india has told her the secret of all creeds but i may be wrong there may be a way out and for one stark insane second i felt that after all you had got the way out and that was why the world hated you you see if there were a way out it would be sure to be something that looked very queer  evan put his hand to his forehead and began stumblingly yes i suppose we do seem  oh yes you look queer enough she said with ringing sincerity youll be all the better for a wash and brush up  you forget our business madam said evan in a shaking voice we have no concern but to kill each other  well i shouldnt be killed looking like that if i were you she replied with inhuman honesty  evan stood and rolled his eyes in masculine bewilderment then came the final change in this proteus and she put out both her hands for an instant and said in a low tone on which he lived for days and nights  dont you understand that i did not dare to stop you what you are doing is so mad that it may be quite true somehow one can never really manage to be an atheist  turnbull stood staring at the sea but his shoulders showed that he heard and after one minute he turned his head but the girl had only brushed evans hand with hers and had fled up the dark alley by the lodge gate  evan stood rooted upon the road literally like some heavy statue hewn there in the age of the druids it seemed impossible that he should ever move turnbull grew restless with this rigidity and at last after calling his companion twice or thrice went up and clapped him impatiently on one of his big shoulders evan winced and leapt away from him with a repulsion which was not the hate of an unclean thing nor the dread of a dangerous one but was a spasm of awe and separation from something from which he was now sundered as by the sword of god he did not hate the atheist it is possible that he loved him but turnbull was now something more dreadful than an enemy he was a thing sealed and devoteda thing now hopelessly doomed to be either a corpse or an executioner  what is the matter with you asked turnbull with his hearty hand still in the air and yet he knew more about it than his innocent action would allow  james said evan speaking like one under strong bodily pain i asked for gods answer and i have got itgot it in my vitals he knows how weak i am and that i might forget the peril of the faith forget the face of our ladyyes even with your blow upon her cheek but the honour of this earth has just this about it that it can make a mans heart like iron i am from the lords of the isles and i dare not be a mere deserter therefore god has tied me by the chain of my worldly place and word and there is nothing but fighting now  i think i understand you said turnbull but you say everything tail foremost  she wants us to do it said evan in a voice crushed with passion she has hurt herself so that we might do it she has left her good name and her good sleep and all her habits and dignity flung away on the other side of england in the hope that she may hear of us and that we have broken some hole into heaven  i thought i knew what you mean said turnbull biting his beard it does seem as if we ought to do something after all she has done this night  i never liked you so much before said macian in bitter sorrow  as he spoke three solemn footmen came out of the lodge gate and assembled to assist the chauffeur to his room the mere sight of them made the two wanderers flee as from a too frightful incongruity and before they knew where they were they were well upon the grassy ledge of england that overlooks the channel evan said suddenly will they let me see her in heaven once in a thousand ages and addressed the remark to the editor of the atheist as on which he would be likely or qualified to answer but no answer came a silence sank between the two  turnbull strode sturdily to the edge of the cliff and looked out his companion following somewhat more shaken by his recent agitation  if thats the view you take said turnbull and i dont say you are wrong i think i know where we shall be best off for the business as it happens i know this part of the south coast pretty well and unless i am mistaken theres a way down the cliff just here which will land us on a stretch of firm sand where no one is likely to follow us  the highlander made a gesture of assent and came also almost to the edge of the precipice the sunrise which was broadening over sea and shore was one of those rare and splendid ones in which there seems to be no mist or doubt and nothing but a universal clarification more and more complete all the colours were transparent it seemed like a triumphant prophecy of some perfect world where everything being innocent will be intelligible a world where even our bodies so to speak may be as of burning glass such a world is faintly though fiercely figured in the coloured windows of christian architecture the sea that lay before them was like a pavement of emerald bright and almost brittle the sky against which its strict horizon hung was almost absolutely white except that close to the sky line like scarlet braids on the hem of a garment lay strings of flaky cloud of so gleaming and gorgeous a red that they seemed cut out of some strange bloodred celestial metal of which the mere gold of this earth is but a drab yellow imitation  the hand of heaven is still pointing muttered the man of superstition to himself and now it is a bloodred hand  the cool voice of his companion cut in upon his monologue calling to him from a little farther along the cliff to tell him that he had found the ladder of descent it began as a steep and somewhat greasy path which then tumbled down twenty or thirty feet in the form of a fall of rough stone steps after that there was a rather awkward drop on to a ledge of stone and then the journey was undertaken easily and even elegantly by the remains of an ornamental staircase such as might have belonged to some longdisused wateringplace all the time that the two travellers sank from stage to stage of this downward journey there closed over their heads living bridges and caverns of the most varied foliage all of which grew greener redder or more golden in the growing sunlight of the morning life too of the more moving sort rose at the sun on every side of them birds whirred and fluttered in the undergrowth as if imprisoned in green cages other birds were shaken up in great clouds from the treetops as if they were blossoms detached and scattered up to heaven animals which turnbull was too much of a londoner and macian too much of a northerner to know slipped by among the tangle or ran pattering up the treetrunks both the men according to their several creeds felt the full thunder of the psalm of life as they had never heard it before macian felt god the father benignant in all his energies and turnbull that ultimate anonymous energy that natura naturans which is the whole theme of lucretius it was down this clamorous ladder of life that they went down to die  they broke out upon a brown semicircle of sand so free from human imprint as to justify turnbulls profession they strode out upon it stuck their swords in the sand and had a pause too important for speech turnbull eyed the coast curiously for a moment like one awakening memories of childhood then he said abruptly like a man remembering somebodys name but of course we shall be better off still round the corner of cragness point nobody ever comes there at all and picking up his sword again he began striding towards a big bluff of the rocks which stood out upon their left macian followed him round the corner and found himself in what was certainly an even finer fencing court of flat firm sand enclosed on three sides by white walls of rock and on the fourth by the green wall of the advancing sea  we are quite safe here said turnbull and to the others surprise flung himself down sitting on the brown beach  you see i was brought up near here he explained i was sent from scotland to stop with my aunt it is highly probable that i may die here do you mind if i light a pipe  of course do whatever you like said macian with a choking voice and he went and walked alone by himself along the wet glistening sands  ten minutes afterwards he came back again white with his own whirlwind of emotions turnbull was quite cheerful and was knocking out the end of his pipe  you see we have to do it said macian she tied us to it  of course my dear fellow said the other and leapt up as lightly as a monkey  they took their places gravely in the very centre of the great square of sand as if they had thousands of spectators before saluting macian who being a mystic was one inch nearer to nature cast his eye round the huge framework of their heroic folly the three walls of rock all leant a little outward though at various angles but this impression was exaggerated in the direction of the incredible by the heavy load of living trees and thickets which each wall wore on its top like a huge shock of hair on all that luxurious crest of life the risen and victorious sun was beating burnishing it all like gold and every bird that rose with that sunrise caught a light like a star upon it like the dove of the holy spirit imaginative life had never so much crowded upon macian he felt that he could write whole books about the feelings of a single bird he felt that for two centuries he would not tire of being a rabbit he was in the palace of life of which the very tapestries and curtains were alive then he recovered himself and remembered his affairs both men saluted and iron rang upon iron it was exactly at the same moment that he realized that his enemys left ankle was encircled with a ring of salt water that had crept up to his feet  what is the matter said turnbull stopping an instant for he had grown used to every movement of his extraordinary fellowtravellers face  macian glanced again at that silver anklet of seawater and then looked beyond at the next promontory round which a deep sea was boiling and leaping then he turned and looked back and saw heavy foam being shaken up to heaven about the base of cragness point  the sea has cut us off he said curtly  i have noticed it said turnbull with equal sobriety what view do you take of the development  evan threw away his weapon and as his custom was imprisoned his big head in his hands then he let them fall and said yes i know what it means and i think it is the fairest thing it is the finger of godred as bloodstill pointing but now it points to two graves  there was a space filled with the sound of the sea and then macian spoke again in a voice pathetically reasonable you see we both saved herand she told us both to fightand it would not be just that either should fail and fall alone while the other  you mean said turnbull in a voice surprisingly soft and gentle that there is something fine about fighting in a place where even the conqueror must die  oh you have got it right you have got it right cried out evan in an extraordinary childish ecstasy oh im sure that you really believe in god  turnbull answered not a word but only took up his fallen sword  for the third time evan macian looked at those three sides of english cliff hung with their noisy load of life he had been at a loss to understand the almost ironical magnificence of all those teeming creatures and tropical colours and smells that smoked happily to heaven but now he knew that he was in the closed court of death and that all the gates were sealed  he drank in the last green and the last red and the last gold those unique and indescribable things of god as a man drains good wine at the bottom of his glass then he turned and saluted his enemy once more and the two stood up and fought till the foam flowed over their knees  then macian stepped backward suddenly with a splash and held up his hand turnbull he cried i cant help itfair fighting is more even than promises and this is not fair fighting  what the deuce do you mean asked the other staring  ive only just thought of it cried evan brokenly were very well matchedit may go on a good timethe tide is coming up fastand im a foot and a half taller youll be washed away like seaweed before its above my breeches ill not fight foul for all the girls and angels in the universe  will you oblige me said turnbull with staring grey eyes and a voice of distinct and violent politeness will you oblige me by jolly well minding your own business just you stand up and fight and well see who will be washed away like seaweed you wanted to finish this fight and you shall finish it or ill denounce you as a coward to the whole of that assembled company  evan looked very doubtful and offered a somewhat wavering weapon but he was quickly brought back to his senses by his opponents swordpoint which shot past him shaving his shoulder by a hair by this time the waves were well up turnbulls thigh and what was worse they were beginning to roll and break heavily around them  macian parried this first lunge perfectly the next less perfectly the third in all human probability he would not have parried at all the christian champion would have been pinned like a butterfly and the atheistic champion left to drown like a rat with such consolation as his view of the cosmos afforded him but just as turnbull launched his heaviest stroke the sea in which he stood up to his hips launched a yet heavier one a wave breaking beyond the others smote him heavily like a hammer of water one leg gave way he was swung round and sucked into the retreating sea still gripping his sword  macian put his sword between his teeth and plunged after his disappearing enemy he had the sense of having the whole universe on top of him as crest after crest struck him down it seemed to him quite a cosmic collapse as if all the seven heavens were falling on him one after the other but he got hold of the atheists left leg and he did not let it go  after some ten minutes of foam and frenzy in which all the senses at once seemed blasted by the sea evan found himself laboriously swimming on a low green swell with the sword still in his teeth and the editor of the atheist still under his arm what he was going to do he had not even the most glimmering idea so he merely kept his grip and swam somehow with one hand  he ducked instinctively as there bulked above him a big black wave much higher than any that he had seen then he saw that it was hardly the shape of any possible wave then he saw that it was a fishermans boat and leaping upward caught hold of the bow the boat pitched forward with its stern in the air for just as much time as was needed to see that there was nobody in it after a moment or two of desperate clambering however there were two people in it mr evan macian panting and sweating and mr james turnbull uncommonly close to being drowned after ten minutes aimless tossing in the empty fishingboat he recovered however stirred stretched himself and looked round on the rolling waters then while taking no notice of the streams of salt water that were pouring from his hair beard coat boots and trousers he carefully wiped the wet off his swordblade to preserve it from the possibilities of rust  macian found two oars in the bottom of the deserted boat and began somewhat drearily to row                                                      a rainy twilight was clearing to cold silver over the moaning sea when the battered boat that had rolled and drifted almost aimlessly all night came within sight of land though of land which looked almost as lost and savage as the waves all night there had been but little lifting in the leaden sea only now and then the boat had been heaved up as on a huge shoulder which slipped from under it such occasional seaquakes came probably from the swell of some steamer that had passed it in the dark otherwise the waves were harmless though restless but it was piercingly cold and there was from time to time a splutter of rain like the splutter of the spray which seemed almost to freeze as it fell macian more at home than his companion in this quite barbarous and elemental sort of adventure had rowed toilsomely with the heavy oars whenever he saw anything that looked like land but for the most part had trusted with grim transcendentalism to wind and tide among the implements of their first outfit the brandy alone had remained to him and he gave it to his freezing companion in quantities which greatly alarmed that temperate londoner but macian came from the cold seas and mists where a man can drink a tumbler of raw whisky in a boat without it making him wink  when the highlander began to pull really hard upon the oars turnbull craned his dripping red head out of the boat to see the goal of his exertions it was a sufficiently uninviting one nothing so far as could be seen but a steep and shelving bank of shingle made of loose little pebbles such as children like but slanting up higher than a house on the top of the mound against the sky line stood up the brown skeleton of some broken fence or breakwater with the grey and watery dawn crawling up behind it the fence really seemed to say to our philosophic adventurers that they had come at last to the other end of nowhere  bent by necessity to his labour macian managed the heavy boat with real power and skill and when at length he ran it up on a smoother part of the slope it caught and held so that they could clamber out not sinking farther than their knees into the water and the shingle a foot or two farther up their feet found the beach firmer and a few moments afterwards they were leaning on the ragged breakwater and looking back at the sea they had escaped  they had a dreary walk across wastes of grey shingle in the grey dawn before they began to come within hail of human fields or roads nor had they any notion of what fields or roads they would be their boots were beginning to break up and the confusion of stones tried them severely so that they were glad to lean on their swords as if they were the staves of pilgrims macian thought vaguely of a weird ballad of his own country which describes the soul in purgatory as walking on a plain full of sharp stones and only saved by its own charities upon earth          if ever thou gavest hosen and shoon             every night and all         sit thee down and put them on             and christ receive thy soul  turnbull had no such lyrical meditations but he was in an even worse temper  at length they came to a pale ribbon of road edged by a shelf of rough and almost colourless turf and a few feet up the slope there stood grey and weatherstained one of those big wayside crucifixes which are seldom seen except in catholic countries  macian put his hand to his head and found that his bonnet was not there turnbull gave one glance at the crucifixa glance at once sympathetic and bitter in which was concentrated the whole of swinburnes poem on the same occasion          o hidden face of man whereover             the years have woven a viewless veil         if thou wert verily mans lover             what did thy love or blood avail         thy blood the priests mix poison of         and in gold shekels coin thy love  then leaving macian in his attitude of prayer turnbull began to look right and left very sharply like one looking for something suddenly with a little cry he saw it and ran forward a few yards from them along the road a lean and starved sort of hedge came pitifully to an end caught upon its prickly angle however there was a very small and very dirty scrap of paper that might have hung there for months since it escaped from someone tearing up a letter or making a spill out of a newspaper turnbull snatched at it and found it was the corner of a printed page very coarsely printed like a cheap novelette and just large enough to contain the words et cest elle qui  hurrah cried turnbull waving his fragment we are safe at last we are free at last we are somewhere better than england or eden or paradise macian we are in the land of the duel  where do you say said the other looking at him heavily and with knitted brows like one almost dazed with the grey doubts of desolate twilight and drifting sea  we are in france cried turnbull with a voice like a trumpet in the land where things really happentout arrive en france we arrive in france look at this little message and he held out the scrap of paper theres an omen for you superstitious hill folk cest elle quimais oui mais oui cest elle qui sauvera encore le monde  france repeated macian and his eyes awoke again in his head like large lamps lighted  yes france said turnbull and all the rhetorical part of him came to the top his face growing as red as his hair france that has always been in rebellion for liberty and reason france that has always assailed superstition with the club of rabelais or the rapier of voltaire france at whose first council table sits the sublime figure of julian the apostate france where a man said only the other day those splendid unanswerable wordswith a superb gesturewe have extinguished in heaven those lights that men shall never light again  no said macian in a voice that shook with a controlled passion but france which was taught by st bernard and led to war by joan of arc france that made the crusades france that saved the church and scattered the heresies by the mouths of bossuet and massillon france which shows today the conquering march of catholicism as brain after brain surrenders to it brunetière coppée hauptmann barrès bourget lemaître  france asserted turnbull with a sort of rollicking selfexaggeration very unusual with him france which is one torrent of splendid scepticism from abelard to anatole france  france said macian which is one cataract of clear faith from st louis to our lady of lourdes  france at least cried turnbull throwing up his sword in schoolboy triumph in which these things are thought about and fought about france where reason and religion clash in one continual tournament france above all where men understand the pride and passion which have plucked our blades from their scabbards here at least we shall not be chased and spied on by sickly parsons and greasy policemen because we wish to put our lives on the game courage my friend we have come to the country of honour  macian did not even notice the incongruous phrase my friend but nodding again and again drew his sword and flung the scabbard far behind him in the road  yes he cried in a voice of thunder we will fight here and he shall look on at it  turnbull glanced at the crucifix with a sort of scowling goodhumour and then said he may look and see his cross defeated  the cross cannot be defeated said macian for it is defeat  a second afterwards the two bright bloodthirsty weapons made the sign of the cross in horrible parody upon each other  they had not touched each other twice however when upon the hill above the crucifix there appeared another horrible parody of its shape the figure of a man who appeared for an instant waving his outspread arms he had vanished in an instant but macian whose fighting face was set that way had seen the shape momentarily but quite photographically and while it was like a comic repetition of the cross it was also in that place and hour something more incredible it had been only instantaneously on the retina of his eye but unless his eye and mind were going mad together the figure was that of an ordinary london policeman  he tried to concentrate his senses on the swordplay but one half of his brain was wrestling with the puzzle the apocalyptic and almost seraphic apparition of a stout constable out of clapham on top of a dreary and deserted hill in france he did not however have to puzzle long before the duellists had exchanged half a dozen passes the big blue policeman appeared once more on the top of the hill a palpable monstrosity in the eye of heaven he was waving only one arm now and seemed to be shouting directions at the same moment a mass of blue blocked the corner of the road behind the small smart figure of turnbull and a small company of policemen in the english uniform came up at a kind of halfmilitary double  turnbull saw the stare of consternation in his enemys face and swung round to share its cause when he saw it cool as he was he staggered back  what the devil are you doing here he called out in a high shrill voice of authority like one who finds a tramp in his own larder  well sir said the sergeant in command with that sort of heavy civility shown only to the evidently guilty seems to me we might ask what are you doing here  we are having an affair of honour said turnbull as if it were the most rational thing in the world if the french police like to interfere let them interfere but why the blue blazes should you interfere you great blue blundering sausages  im afraid sir said the sergeant with restraint im afraid i dont quite follow you  i mean why dont the french police take this up if its got to be taken up i always heard that they were spry enough in their own way  well sir said the sergeant reflectively you see sir the french police dont take this upwell because you see sir this aint france this is his majestys dominions same as ampstead eath  not france repeated turnbull with a sort of dull incredulity  no sir said the sergeant though most of the people talk french this is the island called st loup sir an island in the channel weve been sent down specially from london as you were such specially distinguished criminals if youll allow me to say so which reminds me to warn you that anything you say may be used against you at your trial  quite so said turnbull and lurched suddenly against the sergeant so as to tip him over the edge of the road with a crash into the shingle below then leaving macian and the policemen equally and instantaneously nailed to the road he ran a little way along it leapt off on to a part of the beach which he had found in his journey to be firmer and went across it with a clatter of pebbles his sudden calculation was successful the police unacquainted with the various levels of the loose beach tried to overtake him by the shorter cut and found themselves being heavy men almost up to their knees in shoals of slippery shingle two who had been slower with their bodies were quicker with their minds and seeing turnbulls trick ran along the edge of the road after him then macian finally awoke and leaving half his sleeve in the grip of the only man who tried to hold him took the two policemen in the small of their backs with the impetus of a cannonball and sending them also flat among the stones went tearing after his twin defier of the law  as they were both good runners the start they had gained was decisive they dropped over a high breakwater farther on upon the beach turned sharply and scrambled up a line of ribbed rocks crowned with a thicket crawled through it scratching their hands and faces and dropped into another road and there found that they could slacken their speed into a steady trot in all this desperate dart and scramble they still kept hold of their drawn swords which now indeed in the vigorous phrase of bunyan seemed almost to grow out of their hands  they had run another half mile or so when it became apparent that they were entering a sort of scattered village one or two whitewashed cottages and even a shop had appeared along the side of the road then for the first time turnbull twisted round his red bear to get a glimpse of his companion who was a foot or two behind and remarked abruptly mr macian weve been going the wrong way to work all along were traced everywhere because everybody knows about us its as if one went about with krugers beard on mafeking night  what do you mean said macian innocently  i mean said turnbull with steady conviction that what we want is a little diplomacy and i am going to buy some in a shop     xi a scandal in the village  in the little hamlet of haroc in the isle of st loup there lived a man whothough living under the english flagwas absolutely untypical of the french tradition he was quite unnoticeable but that was exactly where he was quite himself he was not even extraordinarily french but then it is against the french tradition to be extraordinarily french ordinary englishmen would only have thought him a little oldfashioned imperialistic englishmen would really have mistaken him for the old john bull of the caricatures he was stout he was quite undistinguished and he had sidewhiskers worn just a little longer than john bulls he was by name pierre durand he was by trade a wine merchant he was by politics a conservative republican he had been brought up a catholic had always thought and acted as an agnostic and was very mildly returning to the church in his later years he had a genius if one can even use so wild a word in connexion with so tame a person a genius for saying the conventional thing on every conceivable subject or rather what we in england would call the conventional thing for it was not convention with him but solid and manly conviction convention implies cant or affectation and he had not the faintest smell of either he was simply an ordinary citizen with ordinary views and if you had told him so he would have taken it as an ordinary compliment if you had asked him about women he would have said that one must preserve their domesticity and decorum he would have used the stalest words but he would have in reserve the strongest arguments if you had asked him about government he would have said that all citizens were free and equal but he would have meant what he said if you had asked him about education he would have said that the young must be trained up in habits of industry and of respect for their parents still he would have set them the example of industry and he would have been one of the parents whom they could respect a state of mind so hopelessly central is depressing to the english instinct but then in england a man announcing these platitudes is generally a fool and a frightened fool announcing them out of mere social servility but durand was anything but a fool he had read all the eighteenth century and could have defended his platitudes round every angle of eighteenthcentury argument and certainly he was anything but a coward swollen and sedentary as he was he could have hit any man back who touched him with the instant violence of an automatic machine and dying in a uniform would have seemed to him only the sort of thing that sometimes happens i am afraid it is impossible to explain this monster amid the exaggerative sects and the eccentric clubs of my country he was merely a man  he lived in a little villa which was furnished well with comfortable chairs and tables and highly uncomfortable classical pictures and medallions the art in his home contained nothing between the two extremes of hard meagre designs of greek heads and roman togas and on the other side a few very vulgar catholic images in the crudest colours these were mostly in his daughters room he had recently lost his wife whom he had loved heartily and rather heavily in complete silence and upon whose grave he was constantly in the habit of placing hideous little wreaths made out of a sort of blackandwhite beads to his only daughter he was equally devoted though he restricted her a good deal under a sort of theoretic alarm about her innocence an alarm which was peculiarly unnecessary first because she was an exceptionally reticent and religious girl and secondly because there was hardly anybody else in the place  madeleine durand was physically a sleepy young woman and might easily have been supposed to be morally a lazy one it is however certain that the work of her house was done somehow and it is even more rapidly ascertainable that nobody else did it the logician is therefore driven back upon the assumption that she did it and that lends a sort of mysterious interest to her personality at the beginning she had very broad low and level brows which seemed even lower because her warm yellow hair clustered down to her eyebrows and she had a face just plump enough not to look as powerful as it was anything that was heavy in all this was abruptly lightened by two large light chinablue eyes lightened all of a sudden as if it had been lifted into the air by two big blue butterflies the rest of her was less than middlesized and was of a casual and comfortable sort and she had this difference from such girls as the girl in the motorcar that one did not incline to take in her figure at all but only her broad and leonine and innocent head  both the father and the daughter were of the sort that would normally have avoided all observation that is all observation in that extraordinary modern world which calls out everything except strength both of them had strength below the surface they were like quiet peasants owning enormous and unquarried mines the father with his square face and grey side whiskers the daughter with her square face and golden fringe of hair were both stronger than they know stronger than anyone knew the father believed in civilization in the storied tower we have erected to affront nature that is the father believed in man the daughter believed in god and was even stronger they neither of them believed in themselves for that is a decadent weakness  the daughter was called a devotee she left upon ordinary people the impressionthe somewhat irritating impressionproduced by such a person it can only be described as the sense of strong water being perpetually poured into some abyss she did her housework easily she achieved her social relations sweetly she was never neglectful and never unkind this accounted for all that was soft in her but not for all that was hard she trod firmly as if going somewhere she flung her face back as if defying something she hardly spoke a cross word yet there was often battle in her eyes the modern man asked doubtfully where all this silent energy went to he would have stared still more doubtfully if he had been told that it all went into her prayers  the conventions of the isle of st loup were necessarily a compromise or confusion between those of france and england and it was vaguely possible for a respectable young lady to have halfattached lovers in a way that would be impossible to the bourgeoisie of france one man in particular had made himself an unmistakable figure in the track of this girl as she went to church he was a short prosperouslooking man whose long bushy black beard and clumsy black umbrella made him seem both shorter and older than he really was but whose big bold eyes and step that spurned the ground gave him an instant character of youth  his name was camille bert and he was a commercial traveller who had only been in the island an idle week before he began to hover in the tracks of madeleine durand since everyone knows everyone in so small a place madeleine certainly knew him to speak to but it is not very evident that she ever spoke he haunted her however especially at church which was indeed one of the few certain places for finding her in her home she had a habit of being invisible sometimes through insatiable domesticity sometimes through an equally insatiable solitude m bert did not give the impression of a pious man though he did give especially with his eyes the impression of an honest one but he went to mass with a simple exactitude that could not be mistaken for a pose or even for a vulgar fascination it was perhaps this religious regularity which eventually drew madeleine into recognition of him at least it is certain that she twice spoke to him with her square and open smile in the porch of the church and there was human nature enough in the hamlet to turn even that into gossip  but the real interest arose suddenly as a squall arises with the extraordinary affair that occurred about five days after there was about a third of a mile beyond the village of haroc a large but lonely hotel upon the london or paris model but commonly almost entirely empty among the accidental group of guests who had come to it at this season was a man whose nationality no one could fix and who bore the noncommittal name of count gregory he treated everybody with complete civility and almost in complete silence on the few occasions when he spoke he spoke either french english or once to the priest latin and the general opinion was that he spoke them all wrong he was a large lean man with the stoop of an aged eagle and even the eagles nose to complete it he had oldfashioned military whiskers and moustache dyed with a garish and highly incredible yellow he had the dress of a showy gentleman and the manners of a decayed gentleman he seemed as with a sort of simplicity to be trying to be a dandy when he was too old even to know that he was old ye he was decidedly a handsome figure with his curled yellow hair and lean fastidious face and he wore a peculiar frockcoat of bright turquoise blue with an unknown order pinned to it and he carried a huge and heavy cane despite his silence and his dandified dress and whiskers the island might never have heard of him but for the extraordinary event of which i have spoken which fell about in the following way  in such casual atmospheres only the enthusiastic go to benediction and as the warm blue twilight closed over the little candlelit church and village the line of worshippers who went home from the former to the latter thinned out until it broke on one such evening at least no one was in church except the quiet unconquerable madeleine four old women one fisherman and of course the irrepressible m camille bert the others seemed to melt away afterwards into the peacock colours of the dim green grass and the dark blue sky even durand was invisible instead of being merely reverentially remote and madeleine set forth through the patch of black forest alone she was not in the least afraid of loneliness because she was not afraid of devils i think they were afraid of her  in a clearing of the wood however which was lit up with a last patch of the perishing sunlight there advanced upon her suddenly one who was more startling than a devil the incomprehensible count gregory with his yellow hair like flame and his face like the white ashes of the flame was advancing bareheaded towards her flinging out his arms and his long fingers with a frantic gesture  we are alone here he cried and you would be at my mercy only that i am at yours  then his frantic hands fell by his sides and he looked up under his brows with an expression that went well with his hard breathing madeleine durand had come to a halt at first in childish wonder and now with more than masculine selfcontrol i fancy i know your face sir she said as if to gain time  i know i shall not forget yours said the other and extended once more his ungainly arms in an unnatural gesture then of a sudden there came out of him a spout of wild and yet pompous phrases it is as well that you should know the worst and the best i am a man who knows no limit i am the most callous of criminals the most unrepentant of sinners there is no man in my dominions so vile as i but my dominions stretch from the olives of italy to the firwoods of denmark and there is no nook of all of them in which i have not done a sin but when i bear you away i shall be doing my first sacrilege and also my first act of virtue he seized her suddenly by the elbow and she did not scream but only pulled and tugged yet though she had not screamed someone astray in the woods seemed to have heard the struggle a short but nimble figure came along the woodland path like a humming bullet and had caught count gregory a crack across the face before his own could be recognized when it was recognized it was that of camille with the black elderly beard and the young ardent eyes  up to the moment when camille had hit the count madeleine had entertained no doubt that the count was merely a madman now she was startled with a new sanity for the tall man in the yellow whiskers and yellow moustache first returned the blow of bert as if it were a sort of duty and then stepped back with a slight bow and an easy smile  this need go no further here m bert he said i need not remind you how far it should go elsewhere  certainly you need remind me of nothing answered camille stolidly i am glad that you are just not too much of a scoundrel for a gentleman to fight  we are detaining the lady said count gregory with politeness and making a gesture suggesting that he would have taken off his hat if he had had one he strode away up the avenue of trees and eventually disappeared he was so complete an aristocrat that he could offer his back to them all the way up that avenue and his back never once looked uncomfortable  you must allow me to see you home said bert to the girl in a gruff and almost stifled voice i think we have only a little way to go  only a little way she said and smiled once more that night in spite of fatigue and fear and the world and the flesh and the devil the glowing and transparent blue of twilight had long been covered by the opaque and slatelike blue of night when he handed her into the lamplit interior of her home he went out himself into the darkness walking sturdily but tearing at his black beard  all the french or semifrench gentry of the district considered this a case in which a duel was natural and inevitable and neither party had any difficulty in finding seconds strangers as they were in the place two small landowners who were careful practising catholics willingly undertook to represent that strict churchgoer camille burt while the profligate but apparently powerful count gregory found friends in an energetic local doctor who was ready for social promotion and an accidental californian tourist who was ready for anything as no particular purpose could be served by delay it was arranged that the affair should fall out three days afterwards and when this was settled the whole community as it were turned over again in bed and thought no more about the matter at least there was only one member of it who seemed to be restless and that was she who was commonly most restful on the next night madeleine durand went to church as usual and as usual the stricken camille was there also what was not so usual was that when they were a bowshot from the church madeleine turned round and walked back to him sir she began it is not wrong of me to speak to you and the very words gave him a jar of unexpected truth for in all the novels he had ever read she would have begun it is wrong of me to speak to you she went on with wide and serious eyes like an animals it is not wrong of me to speak to you because your soul or anybodys soul matters so much more than what the world says about anybody i want to talk to you about what you are going to do  bert saw in front of him the inevitable heroine of the novels trying to prevent bloodshed and his pale firm face became implacable  i would do anything but that for you he said but no man can be called less than a man  she looked at him for a moment with a face openly puzzled and then broke into an odd and beautiful halfsmile  oh i dont mean that she said i dont talk about what i dont understand no one has ever hit me and if they had i should not feel as a man may i am sure it is not the best thing to fight it would be better to forgiveif one could really forgive but when people dine with my father and say that fighting a duel is mere murderof course i can see that is not just its all so differenthaving a reasonand letting the other man knowand using the same guns and thingsand doing it in front of your friends im awfully stupid but i know that men like you arent murderers but it wasnt that that i meant  what did you mean asked the other looking broodingly at the earth  dont you know she said there is only one more celebration i thought that as you always go to churchi thought you would communicate this morning  bert stepped backward with a sort of action she had never seen in him before it seemed to alter his whole body  you may be right or wrong to risk dying said the girl simply the poor women in our village risk it whenever they have a baby you men are the other half of the world i know nothing about when you ought to die but surely if you are daring to try and find god beyond the grave and appeal to himyou ought to let him find you when he comes and stands there every morning in our little church  and placid as she was she made a little gesture of argument of which the pathos wrung the heart  m camille bert was by no means placid before that incomplete gesture and frankly pleading face he retreated as if from the jaws of a dragon his dark black hair and beard looked utterly unnatural against the startling pallor of his face when at last he said something it was o god i cant stand this he did not say it in french nor did he strictly speaking say it in english the truth interesting only to anthropologists is that he said it in scotch  there will be another mass in a matter of eight hours said madeleine with a sort of business eagerness and energy and you can do it then before the fighting you must forgive me but i was so frightened that you would not do it at all  bert seemed to crush his teeth together until they broke and managed to say between them and why should you suppose that i shouldnt do as you sayi mean not to do it at all  you always go to mass answered the girl opening her wide blue eyes and the mass is very long and tiresome unless one loves god  then it was that bert exploded with a brutality which might have come from count gregory his criminal opponent he advanced upon madeleine with flaming eyes and almost took her by the two shoulders i do not love god he cried speaking french with the broadest scotch accent i do not want to find him i do not think he is there to be found i must burst up the show i must and will say everything you are the happiest and honestest thing i ever saw in this godless universe and i am the dirtiest and most dishonest  madeleine looked at him doubtfully for an instant and then said with a sudden simplicity and cheerfulness oh but if you are really sorry it is all right if you are horribly sorry it is all the better you have only to go and tell the priest so and he will give you god out of his own hands  i hate your priest and i deny your god cried the man and i tell you god is a lie and a fable and a mask and for the first time in my life i do not feel superior to god  what can it all mean said madeleine in massive wonder  because i am a fable also and a mask said the man he had been plucking fiercely at his black beard and hair all the time now he suddenly plucked them off and flung them like moulted feathers in the mire this extraordinary spoliation left in the sunlight the same face but a much younger heada head with close chestnut curls and a short chestnut beard  now you know the truth he answered with hard eyes i am a cad who has played a crooked trick on a quiet village and a decent woman for a private reason of his own i might have played it successfully on any other woman i have hit the one woman on whom it cannot be played its just like my damned luck the plain truth is and here when he came to the plain truth he boggled and blundered as evan had done in telling it to the girl in the motorcar  the plain truth is he said at last that i am james turnbull the atheist the police are after me not for atheism but for being ready to fight for it  i saw something about you in a newspaper said the girl with a simplicity which even surprise could never throw off its balance  evan macian said there was a god went on the other stubbornly and i say there isnt and i have come to fight for the fact that there is no god it is for that that i have seen this cursed island and your blessed face  you want me really to believe said madeleine with parted lips that you think  i want you to hate me cried turnbull in agony i want you to be sick when you think of my name i am sure there is no god  but there is said madeleine quite quietly and rather with the air of one telling children about an elephant why i touched his body only this morning  you touched a bit of bread said turnbull biting his knuckles oh i will say anything that can madden you  you think it is only a bit of bread said the girl and her lips tightened ever so little  i know it is only a bit of bread said turnbull with violence  she flung back her open face and smiled then why did you refuse to eat it she said  james turnbull made a little step backward and for the first time in his life there seemed to break out and blaze in his head thoughts that were not his own  why how silly of them cried out madeleine with quite a schoolgirl gaiety why how silly of them to call you a blasphemer why you have wrecked your whole business because you would not commit blasphemy  the man stood a somewhat comic figure in his tragic bewilderment with the honest red head of james turnbull sticking out of the rich and fictitious garments of camille bert but the startled pain of his face was strong enough to obliterate the oddity  you come down here continued the lady with that female emphasis which is so pulverizing in conversation and so feeble at a public meeting you and your macian come down here and put on false beards or noses in order to fight you pretend to be a catholic commercial traveller from france poor mr macian has to pretend to be a dissolute nobleman from nowhere your scheme succeeds you pick a quite convincing quarrel you arrange a quite respectable duel the duel you have planned so long will come off tomorrow with absolute certainty and safety and then you throw off your wig and throw up your scheme and throw over your colleague because i ask you to go into a building and eat a bit of bread and then you dare to tell me that you are sure there is nothing watching us then you say you know there is nothing on the very altar you run away from you know  i only know said turnbull that i must run away from you this has got beyond any talking and he plunged along into the village leaving his black wig and beard lying behind him on the road  as the marketplace opened before him he saw count gregory that distinguished foreigner standing and smoking in elegant meditation at the corner of the local café he immediately made his way rapidly towards him considering that a consultation was urgent but he had hardly crossed half of that stony quadrangle when a window burst open above him and a head was thrust out shouting the man was in his woollen undershirt but turnbull knew the energetic apologetic head of the sergeant of police he pointed furiously at turnbull and shouted his name a policeman ran excitedly from under an archway and tried to collar him two men selling vegetables dropped their baskets and joined in the chase turnbull dodged the constable upset one of the men into his own basket and bounding towards the distinguished foreign count called to him clamorously come on macian the hunt is up again  the prompt reply of count gregory was to pull off his large yellow whiskers and scatter them on the breeze with an air of considerable relief then he joined the flight of turnbull and even as he did so with one wrench of his powerful hands rent and split the strange thick stick that he carried inside it was a naked oldfashioned rapier the two got a good start up the road before the whole town was awakened behind them and halfway up it a similar transformation was seen to take place in mr turnbulls singular umbrella  the two had a long race for the harbour but the english police were heavy and the french inhabitants were indifferent in any case they got used to the notion of the road being clear and just as they had come to the cliffs macian banged into another gentleman with unmistakable surprise how he knew he was another gentleman merely by banging into him must remain a mystery macian was a very poor and very sober scotch gentleman the other was a very drunk and very wealthy english gentleman but there was something in the staggered and openly embarrassed apologies that made them understand each other as readily and as quickly and as much as two men talking french in the middle of china the nearest expression of the type is that it either hits or apologizes and in this case both apologized  you seem to be in a hurry said the unknown englishman falling back a step or two in order to laugh with an unnatural heartiness whats it all about eh then before macian could get past his sprawling and staggering figure he ran forward again and said with a sort of shouting and earshattering whisper i say my name is wilkinson you knowwilkinsons entire was my grandfather cant drink beer myself liver and he shook his head with extraordinary sagacity  we really are in a hurry as you say said macian summoning a sufficiently pleasant smile so if you will let us pass  ill tell you what you fellows said the sprawling gentleman confidentially while evans agonized ears heard behind him the first paces of the pursuit if you really are as you say in a hurry i know what it is to be in a hurrylord what a hurry i was in when we all came out of cartwrights roomsif you really are in a hurryand he seemed to steady his voice into a sort of solemnityif you are in a hurry theres nothing like a good yacht for a man in a hurry  no doubt youre right said macian and dashed past him in despair the head of the pursuing host was just showing over the top of the hill behind him turnbull had already ducked under the intoxicated gentlemans elbow and fled far in front  no but look here said mr wilkinson enthusiastically running after macian and catching him by the sleeve of his coat if you want to hurry you should take a yacht and ifhe said with a burst of rationality like one leaping to a further point in logicif you want a yachtyou can have mine  evan pulled up abruptly and looked back at him we are really in the devil of a hurry he said and if you really have a yacht the truth is that we would give our ears for it  youll find it in harbour said wilkinson struggling with his speech left side of harbourcalled gibson girlcant think why old fellow i never lent it you before  with these words the benevolent mr wilkinson fell flat on his face in the road but continued to laugh softly and turned towards his flying companion a face of peculiar peace and benignity evans mind went through a crisis of instantaneous casuistry in which it may be that he decided wrongly but about how he decided his biographer can profess no doubt two minutes afterwards he had overtaken turnbull and told the tale ten minutes afterwards he and turnbull had somehow tumbled into the yacht called the gibson girl and had somehow pushed off from the isle of st loup     xii the desert island  those who happen to hold the view and mr evan macian now alive and comfortable is among the number that something supernatural some eccentric kindness from god or fairy had guided our adventurers through all their absurd perils might have found his strongest argument perhaps in their management or mismanagement of mr wilkinsons yacht neither of them had the smallest qualification for managing such a vessel but macian had a practical knowledge of the sea in much smaller and quite different boats while turnbull had an abstract knowledge of science and some of its applications to navigation which was worse the presence of the god or fairy can only be deduced from the fact that they never definitely ran into anything either a boat a rock a quicksand or a manofwar apart from this negative description their voyage would be difficult to describe it took at least a fortnight and macian who was certainly the shrewder sailor of the two realized that they were sailing west into the atlantic and were probably by this time past the scilly isles how much farther they stood out into the western sea it was impossible to conjecture but they felt certain at least that they were far enough into that awful gulf between us and america to make it unlikely that they would soon see land again it was therefore with legitimate excitement that one rainy morning after daybreak they saw that distinct shape of a solitary island standing up against the encircling strip of silver which ran round the skyline and separated the grey and green of the billows from the grey and mauve of the morning clouds  what can it be cried macian in a drythroated excitement i didnt know there were any atlantic islands so far beyond the scilliesgood lord it cant be madeira yet  i thought you were fond of legends and lies and fables said turnbull grimly perhaps its atlantis  of course it might be answered the other quite innocently and gravely but i never thought the story about atlantis was very solidly established  whatever it is we are running on to it said turnbull equably and we shall be shipwrecked twice at any rate  the nakedlooking nose of land projecting from the unknown island was indeed growing larger and larger like the trunk of some terrible and advancing elephant there seemed to be nothing in particular at least on this side of the island except shoals of shellfish lying so thick as almost to make it look like one of those toy grottos that the children make in one place however the coast offered a soft smooth bay of sand and even the rudimentary ingenuity of the two amateur mariners managed to run up the little ship with her prow well on shore and her bowsprit pointing upward as in a sort of idiotic triumph  they tumbled on shore and began to unload the vessel setting the stores out in rows upon the sand with something of the solemnity of boys playing at pirates there were mr wilkinsons cigarboxes and mr wilkinsons dozen of champagne and mr wilkinsons tinned salmon and mr wilkinsons tinned tongue and mr wilkinsons tinned sardines and every sort of preserved thing that could be seen at the army and navy stores then macian stopped with a jar of pickles in his hand and said abruptly  i dont know why were doing all this i suppose we ought really to fall to and get it over  then he added more thoughtfully of course this island seems rather bare and the survivor  the question is said turnbull with cheerful speculation whether the survivor will be in a proper frame of mind for potted prawns  macian looked down at the rows of tins and bottles and the cloud of doubt still lowered upon his face  you will permit me two liberties my dear sir said turnbull at last the first is to break open this box and light one of mr wilkinsons excellent cigars which will i am sure assist my meditations the second is to offer a penny for your thoughts or rather to convulse the already complex finances of this island by betting a penny that i know them  what on earth are you talking about asked macian listlessly in the manner of an inattentive child  i know what you are really thinking macian repeated turnbull laughing i know what i am thinking anyhow and i rather fancy its the same  what are you thinking asked evan  i am thinking and you are thinking said turnbull that it is damned silly to waste all that champagne  something like the spectre of a smile appeared on the unsmiling visage of the gael and he made at least no movement of dissent  we could drink all the wine and smoke all the cigars easily in a week said turnbull and that would be to die feasting like heroes  yes and there is something else said macian with slight hesitation you see we are on an almost unknown rock lost in the atlantic the police will never catch us but then neither may the public ever hear of us and that was one of the things we wanted then after a pause he said drawing in the sand with his swordpoint she may never hear of it at all  well inquired the other puffing at his cigar  well said macian we might occupy a day or two in drawing up a thorough and complete statement of what we did and why we did it and all about both our points of view then we could leave one copy on the island whatever happens to us and put another in an empty bottle and send it out to sea as they do in the books  a good idea said turnbull and now let us finish unpacking  as macian a tall almost ghostly figure paced along the edge of sand that ran round the islet the purple but cloudy poetry which was his native element was piled up at its thickest upon his soul the unique island and the endless sea emphasized the thing solely as an epic there were no ladies or policemen here to give him a hint either of its farce or its tragedy  perhaps when the morning stars were made he said to himself god built this island up from the bottom of the world to be a tower and a theatre for the fight between yea and nay  then he wandered up to the highest level of the rock where there was a roof or plateau of level stone half an hour afterwards turnbull found him clearing away the loose sand from this tableland and making it smooth and even  we will fight up here turnbull said macian when the time comes and till the time comes this place shall be sacred  i thought of having lunch up here said turnbull who had a bottle of champagne in his hand  no nonot up here said macian and came down from the height quite hastily before he descended however he fixed the two swords upright one at each end of the platform as if they were human sentinels to guard it under the stars  then they came down and lunched plentifully in a nest of loose rocks in the same place that night they supped more plentifully still the smoke of mr wilkinsons cigars went up ceaseless and strong smelling like a pagan sacrifice the golden glories of mr wilkinsons champagne rose to their heads and poured out of them in fancies and philosophies and occasionally they would look up at the starlight and the rock and see the space guarded by the two crosshilted swords which looked like two black crosses at either end of a grave  in this primitive and homeric truce the week passed by it consisted almost entirely of eating drinking smoking talking and occasionally singing they wrote their records and cast loose their bottle they never ascended to the ominous plateau they had never stood there save for that single embarrassed minute when they had had no time to take stock of the seascape or the shape of the land they did not even explore the island for macian was partly concerned in prayer and turnbull entirely concerned with tobacco and both these forms of inspiration can be enjoyed by the secluded and even the sedentary it was on a golden afternoon the sun sinking over the sea rayed like the very head of apollo when turnbull tossed off the last halfpint from the emptied wilkinsonian bottle hurled the bottle into the sea with objectless energy and went up to where his sword stood waiting for him on the hill macian was already standing heavily by his with bent head and eyes reading the ground he had not even troubled to throw a glance round the island or the horizon but turnbull being of a more active and birdlike type of mind did throw a glance round the scene the consequence of which was that he nearly fell off the rock  on three sides of this shelly and sandy islet the sea stretched blue and infinite without a speck of land or sail the same as turnbull had first seen it except that the tide being out it showed a few yards more of slanting sand under the roots of the rocks but on the fourth side the island exhibited a more extraordinary feature in fact it exhibited the extraordinary feature of not being an island at all a long curving neck of sand as smooth and wet as the neck of the sea serpent ran out into the sea and joined their rock to a line of low billowing and glistening sandhills which the sinking sea had just bared to the sun whether they were firm sand or quicksand it was difficult to guess but there was at least no doubt that they lay on the edge of some larger land for colourless hills appeared faintly behind them and no sea could be seen beyond  sakes alive cried turnbull with rolling eyes this aint an island in the atlantic weve butted the bally continent of america  macian turned his head and his face already pale grew a shade paler he was by this time walking in a world of omens and hieroglyphics and he could not read anything but what was baffling or menacing in this brown gigantic arm of the earth stretched out into the sea to seize him  macian said turnbull in his temperate way whatever our eternal interrupted teteatetes have taught us or not taught us at least we need not fear the charge of fear if it is essential to your emotions i will cheerfully finish the fight here and now but i must confess that if you kill me here i shall die with my curiosity highly excited and unsatisfied upon a minor point of geography  i do not want to stop now said the other in his elephantine simplicity but we must stop for a moment because it is a signperhaps it is a miracle we must see what is at the end of the road of sand it may be a bridge built across the gulf by god  so long as you gratify my query said turnbull laughing and letting back his blade into the sheath i do not care for what reason you choose to stop  they clambered down the rocky peninsula and trudged along the sandy isthmus with the plodding resolution of men who seemed almost to have made up their minds to be wanderers on the face of the earth despite turnbulls air of scientific eagerness he was really the less impatient of the two and the highlander went on well ahead of him with passionate strides by the time they had walked for about half an hour in the ups and downs of those dreary sands the distance between the two had lengthened and macian was only a tall figure silhouetted for an instant upon the crest of some sanddune and then disappearing behind it this rather increased the robinson crusoe feeling in mr turnbull and he looked about almost disconsolately for some sign of life what sort of life he expected it to be if it appeared he did not very clearly know he has since confessed that he thinks that in his subconsciousness he expected an alligator  the first sign of life that he did see however was something more extraordinary than the largest alligator it was nothing less than the notorious mr evan macian coming bounding back across the sandheaps breathless without his cap and keeping the sword in his hand only by a habit now quite hardened  take care turnbull he cried out from a good distance as he ran ive seen a native  a native repeated his companion whose scenery had of late been chiefly of shellfish what the deuce do you mean an oyster  no said macian stopping and breathing hard i mean a savage a black man  why where did you see him asked the staring editor  over therebehind that hill said the gasping macian he put up his black head and grinned at me  turnbull thrust his hands through his red hair like one who gives up the world as a bad riddle lord love a duck said he can it be jamaica  then glancing at his companion with a small frown as of one slightly suspicious he said i say dont think me rudebut youre a visionary kind of fellowand then we drank a great deal do you mind waiting here while i go and see for myself  shout if you get into trouble said the celt with composure you will find it as i say  turnbull ran off ahead with a rapidity now far greater than his rivals and soon vanished over the disputed sandhill then five minutes passed and then seven minutes and macian bit his lip and swung his sword and the other did not reappear finally with a gaelic oath evan started forward to the rescue and almost at the same moment the small figure of the missing man appeared on the ridge against the sky  even at that distance however there was something odd about his attitude so odd that macian continued to make his way in that direction it looked as if he were wounded or still more as if he were ill he wavered as he came down the slope and seemed flinging himself into peculiar postures but it was only when he came within three feet of macians face that that observer of mankind fully realized that mr james turnbull was roaring with laughter  you are quit right sobbed that wholly demoralized journalist hes black oh theres no doubt the blacks all rightas far as it goes and he went off again into convulsions of his humorous ailment  what ever is the matter with you asked macian with stern impatience did you see the nigger  i saw the nigger gasped turnbull i saw the splendid barbarian chief i saw the emperor of ethiopiaoh i saw him all right the niggers hands and face are a lovely colourand the nigger and he was overtaken once more  well well well said evan stamping each monosyllable on the sand what about the nigger  well the truth is said turnbull suddenly and startlingly becoming quite grave and precise the truth is the nigger is a margate nigger and we are now on the edge of the isle of thanet a few miles from margate  then he had a momentary return of his hysteria and said i say old boy i should like to see a chart of our fortnights cruise in wilkinsons yacht  macian had no smile in answer but his eager lips opened as if parched for the truth you mean to say he began  yes i mean to say said turnbull and i mean to say something funnier still i have learnt everything i wanted to know from the partially black musician over there who has taken a run in his warpaint to meet a friend in a quiet pub along the coastthe noble savage has told me all about it the bottle containing our declaration doctrines and dying sentiments was washed up on margate beach yesterday in the presence of one alderman two bathingmachine men three policemen seven doctors and a hundred and thirteen london clerks on a holiday to all of whom whether directly or indirectly our composition gave enormous literary pleasure buck up old man this story of ours is a switchback i have begun to understand the pulse and the time of it now we are up in a cathedral and then we are down in a theatre where they only play farces come i am quite reconciledlet us enjoy the farce  but macian said nothing and an instant afterwards turnbull himself called out in an entirely changed voice oh this is damnable this is not to be borne  macian followed his eye along the sandhills he saw what looked like the momentary and waving figure of the nigger minstrel and then he saw a heavy running policeman take the turn of the sandhill with the smooth solemnity of a railway train     xiii the garden of peace  up to this instant evan macian had really understood nothing but when he saw the policeman he saw everything he saw his enemies all the powers and princes of the earth he suddenly altered from a staring statue to a leaping man of the mountains  we must break away from him here he cried briefly and went like a whirlwind over the sand ridge in a straight line and at a particular angle when the policeman had finished his admirable railway curve he found a wall of failing sand between him and the pursued by the time he had scaled it thrice slid down twice and crested it in the third effort the two flying figures were far in front they found the sand harder farther on it began to be crusted with scraps of turf and in a few moments they were flying easily over an open common of rank seagrass they had no easy business however for the bottle which they had so innocently sent into the chief gate of thanet had called to life the police of half a county on their trail from every side across the greygreen common figures could be seen running and closing in and it was only when macian with his big body broke down the tangled barrier of a little wood as men break down a door with the shoulder it was only when they vanished crashing into the underworld of the black wood that their hunters were even instantaneously thrown off the scent  at the risk of struggling a little longer like flies in that black web of twigs and trunks evan who had an instinct of the hunter or the hunted took an incalculable course through the forest which let them out at last by a forest openingquite forgotten by the leaders of the chase they ran a mile or two farther along the edge of the wood until they reached another and somewhat similar opening then macian stood utterly still and listened as animals listen for every sound in the universe then he said we are quit of them and turnbull said where shall we go now  macian looked at the silver sunset that was closing in barred by plumy lines of purple cloud he looked at the high treetops that caught the last light and at the birds going heavily homeward just as if all these things were bits of written advice that he could read  then he said the best place we can go to is to bed if we can get some sleep in this wood now everyone has cleared out of it it will be worth a handicap of two hundred yards tomorrow  turnbull who was exceptionally lively and laughing in his demeanour kicked his legs about like a schoolboy and said he did not want to go to sleep he walked incessantly and talked very brilliantly and when at last he lay down on the hard earth sleep struck him senseless like a hammer  indeed he needed the strongest sleep he could get for the earth was still full of darkness and a kind of morning fog when his fellowfugitive shook him awake  no more sleep im afraid said evan in a heavy almost submissive voice of apology theyve gone on past us right enough for a good thirty miles but now theyve found out their mistake and theyre coming back  are you sure said turnbull sitting up and rubbing his red eyebrows with his hand  the next moment however he had jumped up alive and leaping like a man struck with a shock of cold water and he was plunging after macian along the woodland path the shape of their old friend the constable had appeared against the pearl and pink of the sunrise somehow it always looked a very funny shape when seen against the sunrise                                                      a wash of weary daylight was breaking over the countryside and the fields and roads were full of white mistthe kind of white mist that clings in corners like cotton wool the empty road along which the chase had taken its turn was overshadowed on one side by a very high discoloured wall stained and streaked green as with seaweedevidently the highshouldered sentinel of some great gentlemans estate a yard or two from the wall ran parallel to it a linked and tangled line of limetrees forming a kind of cloister along the side of the road it was under this branching colonnade that the two fugitives fled almost concealed from their pursuers by the twilight the mist and the leaping zoetrope of shadows their feet though beating the ground furiously made but a faint noise for they had kicked away their boots in the wood their long antiquated weapons made no jingle or clatter for they had strapped them across their backs like guitars they had all the advantages that invisibility and silence can add to speed  a hundred and fifty yards behind them down the centre of the empty road the first of their pursuers came pounding and pantinga fat but powerful policeman who had distanced all the rest he came on at a splendid pace for so portly a figure but like all heavy bodies in motion he gave the impression that it would be easier for him to increase his pace than to slacken it suddenly nothing short of a brick wall could have abruptly brought him up turnbull turned his head slightly and found breath to say something to macian macian nodded  pursuer and pursued were fixed in their distance as they fled for some quarter of a mile when they came to a place where two or three of the trees grew twistedly together making a special obscurity past this place the pursuing policeman went thundering without thought or hesitation but he was pursuing his shadow or the wind for turnbull had put one foot in a crack of the tree and gone up it as quickly and softly as a cat somewhat more laboriously but in equal silence the long legs of the highlander had followed and crouching in crucial silence in the cloud of leaves they saw the whole posse of their pursuers go by and die into the dust and mists of the distance  the white vapour lay as it often does in lean and palpable layers and even the head of the tree was above it in the halfdaylight like a green ship swinging on a sea of foam but higher yet behind them and readier to catch the first coming of the sun ran the rampart of the top of the wall which in their excitement of escape looked at once indispensable and unattainable like the wall of heaven here however it was macians turn to have the advantage for though less lightlimbed and feline he was longer and stronger in the arms in two seconds he had tugged up his chin over the wall like a horizontal bar the next he sat astride of it like a horse of stone with his assistance turnbull vaulted to the same perch and the two began cautiously to shift along the wall in the direction by which they had come doubling on their tracks to throw off the last pursuit macian could not rid himself of the fancy of bestriding a steed the long grey coping of the wall shot out in front of him like the long grey neck of some nightmare rosinante he had the quaint thought that he and turnbull were two knights on one steed on the old shield of the templars  the nightmare of the stone horse was increased by the white fog which seemed thicker inside the wall than outside they could make nothing of the enclosure upon which they were partial trespassers except that the green and crooked branches of a big appletree came crawling at them out of the mist like the tentacles of some green cuttlefish anything would serve however that was likely to confuse their trail so they both decided without need of words to use this tree also as a laddera ladder of descent when they dropped from the lowest branch to the ground their stockinged feet felt hard gravel beneath them  they had alighted in the middle of a very broad garden path and the clearing mist permitted them to see the edge of a wellclipped lawn though the white vapour was still a veil it was like the gauzy veil of a transformation scene in a pantomime for through it there glowed shapeless masses of colour masses which might be clouds of sunrise or mosaics of gold and crimson or ladies robed in ruby and emerald draperies as it thinned yet farther they saw that it was only flowers but flowers in such insolent mass and magnificence as can seldom be seen out of the tropics purple and crimson rhododendrons rose arrogantly like rampant heraldic animals against their burning background of laburnum gold the roses were red hot the clematis was so to speak blue hot and yet the mere whiteness of the syringa seemed the most violent colour of all as the golden sunlight gradually conquered the mists it had really something of the sensational sweetness of the slow opening of the gates of eden macian whose mind was always haunted with such seraphic or titanic parallels made some such remark to his companion but turnbull only cursed and said that it was the back garden of some damnable rich man  when the last haze had faded from the ordered paths the open lawns and the flaming flowerbeds the two realized not without an abrupt reexamination of their position that they were not alone in the garden  down the centre of the central garden path preceded by a blue cloud from a cigarette was walking a gentleman who evidently understood all the relish of a garden in the very early morning he was a slim yet satisfied figure clad in a suit of palegrey tweed so subdued that the pattern was imperceptiblea costume that was casual but not by any means careless his face which was reflective and somewhat overrefined was the face of a quite elderly man though his stringy hair and moustache were still quite yellow a double eyeglass with a broad black ribbon drooped from his aquiline nose and he smiled as he communed with himself with a selfcontent which was rare and almost irritating the straw panama on his head was many shades shabbier than his clothes as if he had caught it up by accident  it needed the full shock of the huge shadow of macian falling across his sunlit path to rouse him from his smiling reverie when this had fallen on him he lifted his head a little and blinked at the intruders with shortsighted benevolence but with far less surprise than might have been expected he was a gentleman that is he had social presence of mind whether for kindness or for insolence  can i do anything for you he said at last  macian bowed you can extend to us your pardon he said for he also came of a whole race of gentlemenof gentlemen without shirts to their backs i am afraid we are trespassing we have just come over the wall  over the wall repeated the smiling old gentleman still without letting his surprise come uppermost  i suppose i am not wrong sir continued macian in supposing that these grounds inside the wall belong to you  the man in the panama looked at the ground and smoked thoughtfully for a few moments after which he said with a sort of matured conviction  yes certainly the grounds inside the wall really belong to me and the grounds outside the wall too  a large proprietor i imagine said turnbull with a truculent eye  yes answered the old gentleman looking at him with a steady smile a large proprietor  turnbulls eye grew even more offensive and he began biting his red beard but macian seemed to recognize a type with which he could deal and continued quite easily  i am sure that a man like you will not need to be told that one sees and does a good many things that do not get into the newspapers things which on the whole had better not get into the newspapers  the smile of the large proprietor broadened for a moment under his loose light moustache and the other continued with increased confidence  one sometimes wants to have it out with another man the police wont allow it in the streetsand then theres the county counciland in the fields even nothings allowed but posters of pills but in a gentlemans garden now  the strange gentleman smiled again and said easily enough do you want to fight what do you want to fight about  macian had understood his man pretty well up to that point an instinct common to all men with the aristocratic tradition of europe had guided him he knew that the kind of man who in his own back garden wears good clothes and spoils them with a bad hat is not the kind of man who has an abstract horror of illegal actions of violence or the evasion of the police but a man may understand ragging and yet be very far from understanding religious ragging this seeming host of theirs might comprehend a quarrel of husband and lover or a difficulty at cards or even escape from a pursuing tailor but it still remained doubtful whether he would feel the earth fail under him in that earthquake instant when the virgin is compared to a goddess of mesopotamia even macian therefore whose tact was far from being his strong point felt the necessity for some compromise in the mode of approach at last he said and even then with hesitation  we are fighting about god there can be nothing so important as that  the tilted eyeglasses of the old gentleman fell abruptly from his nose and he thrust his aristocratic chin so far forward that his lean neck seemed to shoot out longer like a telescope  about god he queried in a key completely new  look here cried turnbull taking his turn roughly ill tell you what its all about i think that theres no god i take it that its nobodys business but mineor gods if there is one this young gentleman from the highlands happens to think that its his business in consequence he first takes a walkingstick and smashes my shop then he takes the same walkingstick and tries to smash me to this i naturally object i suggest that if it comes to that we should both have sticks he improves on the suggestion and proposes that we should both have steelpointed sticks the police with characteristic unreasonableness will not accept either of our proposals the result is that we run about dodging the police and have jumped over our garden wall into your magnificent garden to throw ourselves on your magnificent hospitality  the face of the old gentleman had grown redder and redder during this address but it was still smiling and when he broke out it was with a kind of guffaw  so you really want to fight with drawn swords in my garden he asked about whether there is really a god  why not said macian with his simple monstrosity of speech all mans worship began when the garden of eden was founded  yes by said turnbull with an oath and ended when the zoological gardens were founded  in this garden in my presence cried the stranger stamping up and down the gravel and choking with laughter whether there is a god and he went stamping up and down the garden making it echo with his unintelligible laughter then he came back to them more composed and wiping his eyes  why how small the world is he cried at last i can settle the whole matter why i am god  and he suddenly began to kick and wave his wellclad legs about the lawn  you are what repeated turnbull in a tone which is beyond description  why god of course answered the other thoroughly amused how funny it is to think that you have tumbled over a garden wall and fallen exactly on the right person you might have gone floundering about in all sorts of churches and chapels and colleges and schools of philosophy looking for some evidence of the existence of god why there is no evidence except seeing him and now youve seen him youve seen him dance  and the obliging old gentleman instantly stood on one leg without relaxing at all the grave and cultured benignity of his expression  i understood that this garden began the bewildered macian  quite so quite so said the man on one leg nodding gravely i said this garden belonged to me and the land outside it so they do so does the country beyond that and the sea beyond that and all the rest of the earth so does the moon so do the sun and stars and he added with a smile of apology you see im god  turnbull and macian looked at him for one moment with a sort of notion that perhaps he was not too old to be merely playing the fool but after staring steadily for an instant turnbull saw the hard and horrible earnestness in the mans eyes behind all his empty animation then turnbull looked very gravely at the strict gravel walls and the gay flowerbeds and the long rectangular redbrick building which the mist had left evident beyond them then he looked at macian  almost at the same moment another man came walking quickly round the regal clump of rhododendrons he had the look of a prosperous banker wore a good tall silk hat was almost stout enough to burst the buttons of a fine frockcoat but he was talking to himself and one of his elbows had a singular outward jerk as he went by     xiv a museum of souls  the man with the good hat and the jumping elbow went by very quickly yet the man with the bad hat who thought he was god overtook him he ran after him and jumped over a bed of geraniums to catch him  i beg your majestys pardon he said with mock humility but here is a quarrel which you ought really to judge  then as he led the heavy silkhatted man back towards the group he caught macians ear in order to whisper this poor gentleman is mad he thinks he is edward vii at this the selfappointed creator slightly winked of course you wont trust him much come to me for everything but in my position one has to meet so many people one has to be broadminded  the big banker in the black frockcoat and hat was standing quite grave and dignified on the lawn save for his slight twitch of one limb and he did not seem by any means unworthy of the part which the other promptly forced upon him  my dear fellow said the man in the straw hat these two gentlemen are going to fight a duel of the utmost importance your own royal position and my much humbler one surely indicate us as the proper seconds secondsyes seconds and here the speaker was once more shaken with his old malady of laughter  yes you and i are both secondsand these two gentlemen can obviously fight in front of us you hehe are the king i am god really they could hardly have better supporters they have come to the right place  then turnbull who had been staring with a frown at the fresh turf burst out with a rather bitter laugh and cried throwing his red head in the air  yes by god macian i think we have come to the right place and macian answered with an adamantine stupidity  any place is the right place where they will let us do it  there was a long stillness and their eyes involuntarily took in the landscape as they had taken in all the landscapes of their everlasting combat the bright square garden behind the shop the whole lift and leaning of the side of hampstead heath the little garden of the decadent choked with flowers the square of sand beside the sea at sunrise they both felt at the same moment all the breadth and blossoming beauty of that paradise the coloured trees the natural and restful nooks and also the great wall of stonemore awful than the wall of chinafrom which no flesh could flee  turnbull was moodily balancing his sword in his hand as the other spoke then he started for a mouth whispered quite close to his ear with a softness incredible in any cat the huge heavy man in the black hat and frockcoat had crept across the lawn from his own side and was saying in his ear dont trust that second of yours hes mad and not so mad either for he frightfully cunning and sharp dont believe the story he tells you about why i hate him i know the story hell tell i overheard it when the housekeeper was talking to the postman its too long to talk about now and i expect were watched but  something in turnbull made him want suddenly to be sick on the grass the mere healthy and heathen horror of the unclean the mere inhumane hatred of the inhuman state of madness he seemed to hear all round him the hateful whispers of that place innumerable as leaves whispering in the wind and each of them telling eagerly some evil that had not happened or some terrific secret which was not true all the rationalist and plain man revolted within him against bowing down for a moment in that forest of deception and egotistical darkness he wanted to blow up that palace of delusions with dynamite and in some wild way which i will not defend he tried to do it  he looked across at macian and said oh i cant stand this  cant stand what asked his opponent eyeing him doubtfully  shall we say the atmosphere replied turnbull one cant use uncivil expressions even to adeity the fact is i dont like having god for my second  sir said that being in a state of great offence in my position i am not used to having my favours refused do you know who i am  the editor of the atheist turned upon him like one who has lost all patience and exploded yes you are god arent you he said abruptly why do we have two sets of teeth  teeth spluttered the genteel lunatic teeth  yes cried turnbull advancing on him swiftly and with animated gestures why does teething hurt why do growing pains hurt why are measles catching why does a rose have thorns why do rhinoceroses have horns why is the horn on the top of the nose why havent i a horn on the top of my nose eh and he struck the bridge of his nose smartly with his forefinger to indicate the place of the omission and then wagged the finger menacingly at the creator  ive often wanted to meet you he resumed sternly after a pause to hold you accountable for all the idiocy and cruelty of this muddled and meaningless world of yours you make a hundred seeds and only one bears fruit you make a million worlds and only one seems inhabited what do you mean by it eh what do you mean by it  the unhappy lunatic had fallen back before this quite novel form of attack and lifted his burntout cigarette almost like one warding off a blow turnbull went on like a torrent  a man died yesterday in ealing you murdered him a girl had the toothache in croydon you gave it her fifty sailors were drowned off selsey bill you scuttled their ship what have you got to say for yourself eh  the representative of omnipotence looked as if he had left most of these things to his subordinates he passed a hand over his wrinkling brow and said in a voice much saner than any he had yet used  well if you dislike my assistance of courseperhaps the other gentleman  the other gentleman cried turnbull scornfully is a submissive and loyal and obedient gentleman he likes the people who wear crowns whether of diamonds or of stars he believes in the divine right of kings and it is appropriate enough that he should have the king for his second but it is not appropriate to me that i should have god for my second god is not good enough i dislike and i deny the divine right of kings but i dislike more and i deny more the divine right of divinity  then after a pause in which he swallowed his passion he said to macian you have got the right second anyhow  the highlander did not answer but stood as if thunderstruck with one long and heavy thought then at last he turned abruptly to his second in the silk hat and said who are you  the man in the silk hat blinked and bridled in affected surprise like one who was in truth accustomed to be doubted  i am king edward vii he said with shaky arrogance do you doubt my word  i do not doubt it in the least answered macian  then why said the large man in the silk hat trembling from head to foot why do you wear your hat before the king  why should i take it off retorted macian with equal heat before a usurper  turnbull swung round on his heel well really he said i thought at least you were a loyal subject  i am the only loyal subject answered the gael for nearly thirty years i have walked these islands and have not found another  you are always hard to follow remarked turnbull genially and sometimes so much so as to be hardly worth following  i alone am loyal insisted macian for i alone am in rebellion i am ready at any instant to restore the stuarts i am ready at any instant to defy the hanoverian broodand i defy it now even when face to face with the actual ruler of the enormous british empire  and folding his arms and throwing back his lean hawklike face he haughtily confronted the man with the formal frockcoat and the eccentric elbow  what right had you stunted german squires he cried to interfere in a quarrel between scotch and english and irish gentlemen who made you whose fathers could not splutter english while they walked in whitehall who made you the judge between the republic of sidney and the monarchy of montrose what had your sires to do with england that they should have the foul offering of the blood of derwentwater and the heart of jimmy dawson where are the corpses of culloden where is the blood of lochiel macian advanced upon his opponent with a bony and pointed finger as if indicating the exact pocket in which the blood of that cameron was probably kept and edward vii fell back a few paces in considerable confusion  what good have you ever done to us he continued in harsher and harsher accents forcing the other back towards the flowerbeds what good have you ever done you race of german sausages yards of barbarian etiquette to throttle the freedom of aristocracy gas of northern metaphysics to blow up broad church bishops like balloons bad pictures and bad manners and pantheism and the albert memorial go back to hanover you humbug go to  before the end of this tirade the arrogance of the monarch had entirely given way he had fairly turned tail and was trundling away down the path macian strode after him still preaching and flourishing his large lean hands the other two remained in the centre of the lawnturnbull in convulsions of laughter the lunatic in convulsions of disgust almost at the same moment a third figure came stepping swiftly across the lawn  the advancing figure walked with a stoop and yet somehow flung his forked and narrow beard forward that carefully cut and pointed yellow beard was indeed the most emphatic thing about him when he clasped his hands behind him under the tails of his coat he would wag his beard at a man like a big forefinger it performed almost all his gestures it was more important than the glittering eyeglasses through which he looked or the beautiful bleating voice in which he spoke his face and neck were of a lusty red but lean and stringy he always wore his expensive goldrim eyeglasses slightly askew upon his aquiline nose and he always showed two gleaming foreteeth under his moustache in a smile so perpetual as to earn the reputation of a sneer but for the crooked glasses his dress was always exquisite and but for the smile he was perfectly and perennially depressed  dont you think said the newcomer with a sort of supercilious entreaty that we had better all come into breakfast it is such a mistake to wait for breakfast it spoils ones temper so much  quite so replied turnbull seriously  there seems almost to have been a little quarrelling here said the man with the goatish beard  it is rather a long story said turnbull smiling originally it might be called a phase in the quarrel between science and religion  the newcomer started slightly and turnbull replied to the question on his face  oh yes he said i am science  i congratulate you heartily answered the other i am doctor quayle  turnbulls eyes did not move but he realized that the man in the panama hat had lost all his ease of a landed proprietor and had withdrawn to a distance of thirty yards where he stood glaring with all the contraction of fear and hatred that can stiffen a cat                                                      macian was sitting somewhat disconsolately on a stump of tree his large black head half buried in his large brown hands when turnbull strode up to him chewing a cigarette he did not look up but his comrade and enemy addressed him like one who must free himself of his feelings  well i hope at any rate he said that you like your precious religion now i hope you like the society of this poor devil whom your damned tracts and hymns and priests have driven out of his wits five men in this place they tell me five men in this place who might have been fathers of families and every one of them thinks he is god the father oh you may talk about the ugliness of science but there is no one here who thinks he is protoplasm  they naturally prefer a bright part said macian wearily protoplasm is not worth going mad about  at least said turnbull savagely it was your jesus christ who started all this bosh about being god  for one instant macian opened the eyes of battle then his tightened lips took a crooked smile and he said quite calmly  no the idea is older it was satan who first said that he was god  then what asked turnbull very slowly as he softly picked a flower what is the difference between christ and satan  it is quite simple replied the highlander christ descended into hell satan fell into it  does it make much odds asked the freethinker  it makes all the odds said the other one of them wanted to go up and went down the other wanted to go down and went up a god can be humble a devil can only be humbled  why are you always wanting to humble a man asked turnbull knitting his brows it affects me as ungenerous  why were you wanting to humble a god when you found him in this garden asked macian  that was an extreme case of impudence said turnbull  granting the man his almighty pretensions i think he was very modest said macian it is we who are arrogant who know we are only men the ordinary man in the street is more of a monster than that poor fellow for the man in the street treats himself as god almighty when he knows he isnt he expects the universe to turn round him though he knows he isnt the centre  well said turnbull sitting down on the grass this is a digression anyhow what i want to point out is that your faith does end in asylums and my science doesnt  doesnt it by george cried macian scornfully there are a few men here who are mad on god and a few who are mad on the bible but i bet there are many more who are simply mad on madness  do you really believe it asked the other  scores of them i should say answered macian fellows who have read medical books or fellows whose fathers and uncles had something hereditary in their headsthe whole air they breathe is mad  all the same said turnbull shrewdly i bet you havent found a madman of that sort  i bet i have cried evan with unusual animation ive been walking about the garden talking to a poor chap all the morning hes simply been broken down and driven raving by your damned science talk about believing one is godwhy its quite an old comfortable fireside fancy compared with the sort of things this fellow believes he believes that there is a god but that he is better than god he says god will be afraid to face him he says one is always progressing beyond the best he put his arm in mine and whispered in my ear as if it were the apocalypse never trust a god that you cant improve on  what can he have meant said the atheist with all his logic awake obviously one should not trust any god that one can improve on  it is the way he talks said macian almost indifferently but he says rummier things than that he says that a mans doctor ought to decide what woman he marries and he says that children ought not to be brought up by their parents because a physical partiality will then distort the judgement of the educator  oh dear said turnbull laughing you have certainly come across a pretty bad case and incidentally proved your own i suppose some men do lose their wits through science as through love and other good things  and he says went on macian monotonously that he cannot see why anyone should suppose that a triangle is a threesided figure he says that on some higher plane  turnbull leapt to his feet as by an electric shock i never could have believed he cried that you had humour enough to tell a lie youve gone a bit too far old man with your little joke even in a lunatic asylum there cant be anybody who having thought about the matter thinks that a triangle has not got three sides if he exists he must be a new era in human psychology but he doesnt exist  i will go and fetch him said macian calmly i left the poor fellow wandering about by the nasturtium bed  macian vanished and in a few moments returned trailing with him his own discovery among lunatics who was a slender man with a fixed smile and an unfixed and rolling head he had a goatlike beard just long enough to be shaken in a strong wind turnbull sprang to his feet and was like one who is speechless through choking a sudden shout of laughter  why you great donkey he shouted in an earshattering whisper thats not one of the patients at all thats one of the doctors  evan looked back at the leering head with the longpointed beard and repeated the word inquiringly one of the doctors  oh you know what i mean said turnbull impatiently the medical authorities of the place  evan was still staring back curiously at the beaming and bearded creature behind him  the mad doctors said turnbull shortly  quite so said macian  after a rather restless silence turnbull plucked macian by the elbow and pulled him aside  for goodness sake he said dont offend this fellow he may be as mad as ten hatters if you like but he has us between his finger and thumb this is the very time he appointed to talk with us about ourwell our exeat  but what can it matter asked the wondering macian he cant keep us in the asylum were not mad  jackass said turnbull heartily of course were not mad of course if we are medically examined and the thing is thrashed out they will find we are not mad but dont you see that if the thing is thrashed out it will mean letters to this reference and telegrams to that and at the first word of who we are we shall be taken out of a madhouse where we may smoke to a jail where we maynt no if we manage this very quietly he may merely let us out at the front door as stray revellers if theres half an hour of inquiry we are cooked  macian looked at the grass frowningly for a few seconds and then said in a new small and childish voice i am awfully stupid mr turnbull you must be patient with me  turnbull caught evans elbow again with quite another gesture come he cried with the harsh voice of one who hides emotion come and let us be tactful in chorus  the doctor with the pointed beard was already slanting it forward at a more than usually acute angle with the smile that expressed expectancy  i hope i do not hurry you gentlemen he said with the faintest suggestion of a sneer at their hurried consultation but i believe you wanted to see me at half past eleven  i am most awfully sorry doctor said turnbull with ready amiability i never meant to keep you waiting but the silly accident that has landed us in your garden may have some rather serious consequences to our friends elsewhere and my friend here was just drawing my attention to some of them  quite so quite so said the doctor hurriedly if you really want to put anything before me i can give you a few moments in my consultingroom  he led them rapidly into a small but imposing apartment which seemed to be built and furnished entirely in redvarnished wood there was one desk occupied with carefully docketed papers and there were several chairs of the redvarnished woodthough of different shape all along the wall ran something that might have been a bookcase only that it was not filled with books but with flat oblong slabs or cases of the same polished darkred consistency what those flat wooden cases were they could form no conception  the doctor sat down with a polite impatience on his professional perch macian remained standing but turnbull threw himself almost with luxury into a hard wooden armchair  this is a most absurd business doctor he said and i am ashamed to take up the time of busy professional men with such pranks from outside the plain fact is that he and i and a pack of silly men and girls have organized a game across this part of the countrya sort of combination of hare and hounds and hide and seeki dare say youve heard of it we are the hares and seeing your high wall look so inviting we tumbled over it and naturally were a little startled with what we found on the other side  quite so said the doctor mildly i can understand that you were startled  turnbull had expected him to ask what place was the headquarters of the new exhilarating game and who were the male and female enthusiasts who had brought it to such perfection in fact turnbull was busy making up these personal and topographical particulars as the doctor did not ask the question he grew slightly uneasy and risked the question i hope you will accept my assurance that the thing was an accident and that no intrusion was meant  oh yes sir replied the doctor smiling i accept everything that you say  in that case said turnbull rising genially we must not further interrupt your important duties i suppose there will be someone to let us out  no said the doctor still smiling steadily and pleasantly there will be no one to let you out  can we let ourselves out then asked turnbull in some surprise  why of course not said the beaming scientist think how dangerous that would be in a place like this  then how the devil are we to get out cried turnbull losing his manners for the first time  it is a question of time of receptivity and treatment said the doctor arching his eyebrows indifferently i do not regard either of your cases as incurable  and with that the man of the world was struck dumb and as in all intolerable moments the word was with the unworldly  macian took one stride to the table leant across it and said we cant stop here were not mad people  we dont use the crude phrase said the doctor smiling at his patentleather boots  but you cant think us mad thundered macian you never saw us before you know nothing about us you havent even examined us  the doctor threw back his head and beard oh yes he said very thoroughly  but you cant shut a man up on your mere impressions without documents or certificates or anything  the doctor got languidly to his feet quite so he said you certainly ought to see the documents  he went across to the curious mock bookshelves and took down one of the flat mahogany cases this he opened with a curious key at his watchchain and laying back a flap revealed a quire of foolscap covered with close but quite clear writing the first three words were in such large copybook hand that they caught the eye even at a distance they were macian evan stuart  evan bent his angry eagle face over it yet something blurred it and he could never swear he saw it distinctly he saw something that began prenatal influences predisposing to mania grandfather believed in return of the stuarts mother carried bone of st eulalia with which she touched children in sickness marked religious mania at early age  evan fell back and fought for his speech oh he burst out at last oh if all this world i have walked in had been as sane as my mother was  then he compressed his temples with his hands as if to crush them and then lifted suddenly a face that looked fresh and young as if he had dipped and washed it in some holy well  very well he cried i will take the sour with the sweet i will pay the penalty of having enjoyed god in this monstrous modern earth that cannot enjoy man or beast i will die happy in your madhouse only because i know what i know let it be granted thenmacian is a mystic macian is a maniac but this honest shopkeeper and editor whom i have dragged on my inhuman escapades you cannot keep him he will go free thank god he is not down in any damned document his ancestor i am certain did not die at culloden his mother i swear had no relics let my friend out of your front door and as for me  the doctor had already gone across to the laden shelves and after a few minutes shortsighted peering had pulled down another parallelogram of darkred wood  this also he unlocked on the table and with the same unerring egotistic eye on of the company saw the words written in large letters turnbull james  hitherto turnbull himself had somewhat scornfully surrendered his part in the whole business but he was too honest and unaffected not to start at his own name after the name the inscription appeared to run unique case of eleutheromania parentage as so often in such cases prosaic and healthy eleutheromaniac signs occurred early however leading him to attach himself to the individualist bradlaugh recent outbreak of pure anarchy  turnbull slammed the case to almost smashing it and said with a burst of savage laughter oh come along macian i dont care so much even about getting out of the madhouse if only we get out of this room you were right enough macian when you spoke aboutabout mad doctors  somehow they found themselves outside in the cool green garden and then after a stunned silence turnbull said there is one thing that was puzzling me all the time and i understand it now  what do you mean asked evan  no man by will or wit answered turnbull can get out of this garden and yet we got into it merely by jumping over a garden wall the whole thing explains itself easily enough that undefended wall was an open trap it was a trap laid for two celebrated lunatics they saw us get in right enough and they will see that we do not get out  evan gazed at the garden wall gravely for more than a minute and then he nodded without a word     xv the dream of macian  the system of espionage in the asylum was so effective and complete that in practice the patients could often enjoy a sense of almost complete solitude they could stray up so near to the wall in an apparently unwatched garden as to find it easy to jump over it they would only have found the error of their calculations if they had tried to jump  under this insulting liberty in this artificial loneliness evan macian was in the habit of creeping out into the garden after darkespecially upon moonlight nights the moon indeed was for him always a positive magnet in a manner somewhat hard to explain to those of a robuster attitude evidently apollo is to the full as poetical as diana but it is not a question of poetry in the matured and intellectual sense of the word it is a question of a certain solid and childish fancy the sun is in the strict and literal sense invisible that is to say that by our bodily eyes it cannot properly be seen but the moon is a much simpler thing a naked and nursery sort of thing it hangs in the sky quite solid and quite silver and quite useless it is one huge celestial snowball it was at least some such infantile facts and fancies which led evan again and again during his dehumanized imprisonment to go out as if to shoot the moon  he was out in the garden on one such luminous and ghostly night when the steady moonshine toned down all the colours of the garden until almost the strongest tints to be seen were the strong soft blue of the sky and the large lemon moon he was walking with his face turned up to it in that rather halfwitted fashion which might have excused the error of his keepers and as he gazed he became aware of something little and lustrous flying close to the lustrous orb like a bright chip knocked off the moon at first he thought it was a mere sparkle or refraction in his own eyesight he blinked and cleared his eyes then he thought it was a falling star only it did not fall it jerked awkwardly up and down in a way unknown among meteors and strangely reminiscent of the works of man the next moment the thing drove right across the moon and from being silver upon blue suddenly became black upon silver then although it passed the field of light in a flash its outline was unmistakable though eccentric it was a flying ship  the vessel took one long and sweeping curve across the sky and came nearer and nearer to macian like a steamengine coming round a bend it was of pure white steel and in the moon it gleamed like the armour of sir galahad the simile of such virginity is not inappropriate for as it grew larger and larger and lower and lower evan saw that the only figure in it was robed in white from head to foot and crowned with snowwhite hair on which the moonshine lay like a benediction the figure stood so still that he could easily have supposed it to be a statue indeed he thought it was until it spoke  evan said the voice and it spoke with the simple authority of some forgotten father revisiting his children you have remained here long enough and your sword is wanted elsewhere  wanted for what asked the young man accepting the monstrous event with a queer and clumsy naturalness what is my sword wanted for  for all that you hold dear said the man standing in the moonlight for the thrones of authority and for all ancient loyalty to law  evan looked up at the lunar orb again as if in irrational appeala moon calf bleating to his mother the moon but the face of luna seemed as witless as his own there is no help in nature against the supernatural and he looked again at the tall marble figure that might have been made out of solid moonlight  then he said in a loud voice who are you and the next moment was seized by a sort of choking terror lest his question should be answered but the unknown preserved an impenetrable silence for a long space and then only answered i must not say who i am until the end of the world but i may say what i am i am the law  and he lifted his head so that the moon smote full upon his beautiful and ancient face  the face was the face of a greek god grown old but not grown either weak or ugly there was nothing to break its regularity except a rather long chin with a cleft in it and this rather added distinction than lessened beauty his strong wellopened eyes were very brilliant but quite colourless like steel  macian was one of those to whom a reverence and selfsubmission in ritual come quite easy and are ordinary things it was not artificial in him to bend slightly to this solemn apparition or to lower his voice when he said do you bring me some message  i do bring you a message answered the man of moon and marble the king has returned  evan did not ask for or require any explanation i suppose you can take me to the war he said and the silent silver figure only bowed its head again macian clambered into the silver boat and it rose upward to the stars  to say that it rose to the stars is no mere metaphor for the sky had cleared to that occasional and astonishing transparency in which one can see plainly both stars and moon  as the whiterobed figure went upward in his white chariot he said quite quietly to evan there is an answer to all the folly talked about equality some stars are big and some small some stand still and some circle around them as they stand they can be orderly but they cannot be equal  they are all very beautiful said evan as if in doubt  they are all beautiful answered the other because each is in his place and owns his superior and now england will be beautiful after the same fashion the earth will be as beautiful as the heavens because our kings have come back to us  the stuart began evan earnestly  yes answered the old man that which has returned is stuart and yet older than stuart it is capet and plantagenet and pendragon it is all that good old time of which proverbs tell that golden reign of saturn against which gods and men were rebels it is all that was ever lost by insolence and overwhelmed in rebellion it is your own forefather macian with the broken sword bleeding without hope at culloden it is charles refusing to answer the questions of the rebel court it is mary of the magic face confronting the gloomy and grasping peers and the boorish moralities of knox it is richard the last plantagenet giving his crown to bolingbroke as to a common brigand it is arthur overwhelmed in lyonesse by heathen armies and dying in the mist doubtful if ever he shall return  but now said evan in a low voice  but now said the old man he has returned  is the war still raging asked macian  it rages like the pit itself beyond the sea whither i am taking you answered the other but in england the king enjoys his own again the people are once more taught and ruled as is best they are happy knights happy squires happy servants happy serfs if you will but free at last of that load of vexation and lonely vanity which was called being a citizen  is england indeed so secure asked evan  look out and see said the guide i fancy you have seen this place before  they were driving through the air towards one region of the sky where the hollow of night seemed darkest and which was quite without stars but against this black background there sprang up picked out in glittering silver a dome and a cross it seemed that it was really newly covered with silver which in the strong moonlight was like white flame but however covered or painted evan had no difficult in knowing the place again he saw the great thoroughfare that sloped upward to the base of its huge pedestal of steps and he wondered whether the little shop was still by the side of it and whether its window had been mended  as the flying ship swept round the dome he observed other alterations the dome had been redecorated so as to give it a more solemn and somewhat more ecclesiastical note the ball was draped or destroyed and round the gallery under the cross ran what looked like a ring of silver statues like the little leaden images that stood round the hat of louis xi round the second gallery at the base of the dome ran a second rank of such images and evan thought there was another round the steps below when they came closer he saw that they were figures in complete armour of steel or silver each with a naked sword point upward and then he saw one of the swords move these were not statues but an armed order of chivalry thrown in three circles round the cross macian drew in his breath as children do at anything they think utterly beautiful for he could imagine nothing that so echoed his own visions of pontifical or chivalric art as this white dome sitting like a vast silver tiara over london ringed with a triple crown of swords  as they went sailing down ludgate hill evan saw that the state of the streets fully answered his companions claim about the reintroduction of order all the old blackcoated bustle with its cockney vivacity and vulgarity had disappeared groups of labourers quietly but picturesquely clad were passing up and down in sufficiently large numbers but it required but a few mounted men to keep the streets in order the mounted men were not common policemen but knights with spurs and plume whose smooth and splendid armour glittered like diamond rather than steel only in one placeat the corner of bouverie streetdid there appear to be a moments confusion and that was due to hurry rather than resistance but one old grumbling man did not get out of the way quick enough and the man on horseback struck him not severely across the shoulders with the flat of his sword  the soldier had no business to do that said macian sharply the old man was moving as quickly as he could  we attach great importance to discipline in the streets said the man in white with a slight smile  discipline is not so important as justice said macian  the other did not answer  then after a swift silence that took them out across st jamess park he said the people must be taught to obey they must learn their own ignorance and i am not sure he continued turning his back on evan and looking out of the prow of the ship into the darkness i am not sure that i agree with your little maxim about justice discipline for the whole society is surely more important than justice to an individual  evan who was also leaning over the edge swung round with startling suddenness and stared at the others back  discipline for society he repeated very staccato more importantjustice to individual  then after a long silence he called out who and what are you  i am an angel said the whiterobed figure without turning round  you are not a catholic said macian  the other seemed to take no notice but reverted to the main topic  in our armies up in heaven we learn to put a wholesome fear into subordinates  macian sat craning his neck forward with an extraordinary and unaccountable eagerness  go on he cried twisting and untwisting his long bony fingers go on  besides continued he in the prow you must allow for a certain high spirit and haughtiness in the superior type  go on said evan with burning eyes  just as the sight of sin offends god said the unknown so does the sight of ugliness offend apollo the beautiful and princely must of necessity be impatient with the squalid and  why you great fool cried macian rising to the top of his tremendous stature did you think i would have doubted only for that rap with a sword i know that noble orders have bad knights that good knights have bad tempers that the church has rough priests and coarse cardinals i have known it ever since i was born you fool you had only to say yes it is rather a shame and i should have forgotten the affair but i saw on your mouth the twitch of your infernal sophistry i knew that something was wrong with you and your cathedrals something is wrong everything is wrong you are not an angel that is not a church it is not the rightful king who has come home  that is unfortunate said the other in a quiet but hard voice because you are going to see his majesty  no said macian i am going to jump over the side  do you desire death  no said evan quite composedly i desire a miracle  from whom do you ask it to whom do you appeal said his companion sternly you have betrayed the king renounced his cross on the cathedral and insulted an archangel  i appeal to god said evan and sprang up and stood upon the edge of the swaying ship  the being in the prow turned slowly round he looked at evan with eyes which were like two suns and put his hand to his mouth just too late to hide an awful smile  and how do you know he said how do you know that i am not god  macian screamed ah he cried now i know who you really are you are not god you are not one of gods angels but you were once  the beings hand dropped from his mouth and evan dropped out of the car     xvi the dream of turnbull  turnbull was walking rather rampantly up and down the garden on a gusty evening chewing his cigar and in that mood when every man suppresses an instinct to spit he was not as a rule a man much acquainted with moods and the storms and sunbursts of macians soul passed before him as an impressive but unmeaning panorama like the anarchy of highland scenery turnbull was one of those men in whom a continuous appetite and industry of the intellect leave the emotions very simple and steady his heart was in the right place but he was quite content to leave it there it was his head that was his hobby his mornings and evenings were marked not by impulses or thirsty desires not by hope or by heartbreak they were filled with the fallacies he had detected the problems he had made plain the adverse theories he had wrestled with and thrown the grand generalizations he had justified but even the cheerful inner life of a logician may be upset by a lunatic asylum to say nothing of whiffs of memory from a lady in jersey and the little redbearded man on this windy evening was in a dangerous frame of mind  plain and positive as he was the influence of earth and sky may have been greater on him than he imagined and the weather that walked the world at that moment was as red and angry as turnbull long strips and swirls of tattered and tawny cloud were dragged downward to the west exactly as torn red raiment would be dragged and so strong and pitiless was the wind that it whipped away fragments of redflowering bushes or of copper beech and drove them also across the garden a drift of red leaves like the leaves of autumn as in parody of the red and driven rags of cloud  there was a sense in earth and heaven as of everything breaking up and all the revolutionist in turnbull rejoiced that it was breaking up the trees were breaking up under the wind even in the tall strength of their bloom the clouds were breaking up and losing even their large heraldic shapes shards and shreds of copper cloud split off continually and floated by themselves and for some reason the truculent eye of turnbull was attracted to one of these careering cloudlets which seemed to him to career in an exaggerated manner also it kept its shape which is unusual with clouds shaken off also its shape was of an odd sort  turnbull continued to stare at it and in a little time occurred that crucial instant when a thing however incredible is accepted as a fact the copper cloud was tumbling down towards the earth like some gigantic leaf from the copper beeches and as it came nearer it was evident first that it was not a cloud and second that it was not itself of the colour of copper only being burnished like a mirror it had reflected the redbrown colours of the burning clouds as the thing whirled like a windswept leaf down towards the wall of the garden it was clear that it was some sort of airship made of metal and slapping the air with big broad fins of steel when it came about a hundred feet above the garden a shaggy lean figure leapt up in it almost black against the bronze and scarlet of the west and flinging out a kind of hook or anchor caught on to the green appletree just under the wall and from that fixed holding ground the ship swung in the red tempest like a captive balloon  while our friend stood frozen for an instant by his astonishment the queer figure in the airy car tipped the vehicle almost upside down by leaping over the side of it seemed to slide or drop down the rope like a monkey and alighted with impossible precision and placidity seated on the edge of the wall over which he kicked and dangled his legs as he grinned at turnbull the wind roared in the trees yet more ruinous and desolate the red tails of the sunset were dragged downward like red dragons sucked down to death and still on the top of the asylum wall sat the sinister figure with the grimace swinging his feet in tune with the tempest while above him at the end of its tossing or tightened cord the enormous iron airship floated as light and as little noticed as a babys balloon upon its string  turnbulls first movement after sixty motionless seconds was to turn round and look at the large luxuriant parallelogram of the garden and the long low rectangular building beyond there was not a soul or a stir of life within sight and he had a quite meaningless sensation as if there never really had been any one else there except he since the foundation of the world  stiffening in himself the masculine but mirthless courage of the atheist he drew a little nearer to the wall and catching the man at a slightly different angle of the evening light could see his face and figure quite plain two facts about him stood out in the picked colours of some piratical schoolboys story the first was that his lean brown body was bare to the belt of his loose white trousers the other that through hygiene affectation or whatever other cause he had a scarlet handkerchief tied tightly but somewhat aslant across his brow after these two facts had become emphatic others appeared sufficiently important one was that under the scarlet rag the hair was plentiful but white as with the last snows of mortality another was that under the mop of white and senile hair the face was strong handsome and smiling with a wellcut profile and a long cloven chin the length of this lower part of the face and the strange cleft in it which gave the man in quite another sense from the common one a double chin faintly spoilt the claim of the face to absolute regularity but it greatly assisted it in wearing the expression of halfsmiling and halfsneering arrogance with which it was staring at all the stones all the flowers but especially at the solitary man  what do you want shouted turnbull  i want you jimmy said the eccentric man on the wall and with the very word he had let himself down with a leap on to the centre of the lawn where he bounded once literally like an indiarubber ball and then stood grinning with his legs astride the only three facts that turnbull could now add to his inventory were that the man had an uglylooking knife swinging at his trousers belt that his brown feet were as bare as his bronzed trunk and arms and that his eyes had a singular bleak brilliancy which was of no particular colour  excuse my not being in evening dress said the newcomer with an urbane smile we scientific men you knowi have to work my own engineselectrical engineervery hot work  look here said turnbull sturdily clenching his fists in his trousers pockets i am bound to expect lunatics inside these four walls but i do bar their coming from outside bang out of the sunset clouds  and yet you came from the outside too jim said the stranger in a voice almost affectionate  what do you want asked turnbull with an explosion of temper as sudden as a pistol shot  i have already told you said the man lowering his voice and speaking with evident sincerity i want you  what do you want with me  i want exactly what you want said the newcomer with a new gravity i want the revolution  turnbull looked at the fireswept sky and the windstricken woodlands and kept on repeating the word voicelessly to himselfthe word that did indeed so thoroughly express his mood of rage as it had been among those red clouds and rocking treetops revolution he said to himself the revolutionyes that is what i want right enoughanything so long as it is a revolution  to some cause he could never explain he found himself completing the sentence on the top of the wall having automatically followed the stranger so far but when the stranger silently indicated the rope that led to the machine he found himself pausing and saying i cant leave macian behind in this den  we are going to destroy the pope and all the kings said the newcomer would it be wiser to take him with us  somehow the muttering turnbull found himself in the flying ship also and it swung up into the sunset  all the great rebels have been very little rebels said the man with the red scarf they have been like fourthform boys who sometimes venture to hit a fifthform boy that was all the worth of their french revolution and regicide the boys never really dared to defy the schoolmaster  whom do you mean by the schoolmaster asked turnbull  you know whom i mean answered the strange man as he lay back on cushions and looked up into the angry sky  they seemed rising into stronger and stronger sunlight as if it were sunrise rather than sunset but when they looked down at the earth they saw it growing darker and darker the lunatic asylum in its large rectangular grounds spread below them in a foreshortened and infantile plan and looked for the first time the grotesque thing that it was but the clear colours of the plan were growing darker every moment the masses of rose or rhododendron deepened from crimson to violet the maze of gravel pathways faded from gold to brown by the time they had risen a few hundred feet higher nothing could be seen of that darkening landscape except the lines of lighted windows each one of which at least was the light of one lost intelligence but on them as they swept upward better and braver winds seemed to blow and on them the ruby light of evening seemed struck and splashed like red spurts from the grapes of dionysus below them the fallen lights were literally the fallen stars of servitude and above them all the red and raging clouds were like the leaping flags of liberty  the man with the cloven chin seemed to have a singular power of understanding thoughts for as turnbull felt the whole universe tilt and turn over his head the stranger said exactly the right thing  doesnt it seem as if everything were being upset said he and if once everything is upset he will be upset on top of it  then as turnbull made no answer his host continued  that is the really fine thing about space it is topsyturvy you have only to climb far enough towards the morning star to feel that you are coming down to it you have only to dive deep enough into the abyss to feel that you are rising that is the only glory of this universeit is a giddy universe  then as turnbull was still silent he added  the heavens are full of revolutionof the real sort of revolution all the high things are sinking low and all the big things looking small all the people who think they are aspiring find they are falling head foremost and all the people who think they are condescending find they are climbing up a precipice that is the intoxication of space that is the only joy of eternitydoubt there is only one pleasure the angels can possibly have in flying and that is that they do not know whether they are on their head or their heels  then finding his companion still mute he fell himself into a smiling and motionless meditation at the end of which he said suddenly  so macian converted you  turnbull sprang up as if spurning the steel car from under his feet converted me he cried what the devil do you mean i have known him for a month and i have not retracted a single  this catholicism is a curious thing said the man of the cloven chin in uninterrupted reflectiveness leaning his elegant elbows over the edge of the vessel it soaks and weakens men without their knowing it just as i fear it has soaked and weakened you  turnbull stood in an attitude which might well have meant pitching the other man out of the flying ship  i am an atheist he said in a stifled voice i have always been an atheist i am still an atheist then addressing the others indolent and indifferent back he cried in gods name what do you mean  and the other answered without turning round  i mean nothing in gods name  turnbull spat over the edge of the car and fell back furiously into his seat  the other continued still unruffled and staring over the edge idly as an angler stares down at a stream  the truth is that we never thought that you could have been caught he said we counted on you as the one redhot revolutionary left in the world but of course these men like macian are awfully clever especially when they pretend to be stupid  turnbull leapt up again in a living fury and cried what have i got to do with macian i believe all i ever believed and disbelieve all i ever disbelieved what does all this mean and what do you want with me here  then for the first time the other lifted himself from the edge of the car and faced him  i have brought you here he answered to take part in the last war of the world  the last war repeated turnbull even in his dazed state a little touchy about such a dogma how do you know it will be the last  the man laid himself back in his reposeful attitude and said  it is the last war because if it does not cure the world for ever it will destroy it  what do you mean  i only mean what you mean answered the unknown in a temperate voice what was it that you always meant on those million and one nights when you walked outside your ludgate hill shop and shook your hand in the air  still i do not see said turnbull stubbornly  you will soon said the other and abruptly bent downward one iron handle of his huge machine the engine stopped stooped and dived almost as deliberately as a man bathing in their downward rush they swept within fifty yards of a big bulk of stone that turnbull knew only too well the last red anger of the sunset was ended the dome of heaven was dark the lanes of flaring light in the streets below hardly lit up the base of the building but he saw that it was st pauls cathedral and he saw that on the top of it the ball was still standing erect but the cross was stricken and had fallen sideways then only he cared to look down into the streets and saw that they were inflamed with uproar and tossing passions  we arrive at a happy moment said the man steering the ship the insurgents are bombarding the city and a cannonball has just hit the cross many of the insurgents are simple people and they naturally regard it as a happy omen  quite so said turnbull in a rather colourless voice  yes replied the other i thought you would be glad to see your prayer answered of course i apologize for the word prayer  dont mention it said turnbull  the flying ship had come down upon a sort of curve and was now rising again the higher and higher it rose the broader and broader became the scenes of flame and desolation underneath  ludgate hill indeed had been an uncaptured and comparatively quiet height altered only by the startling coincidence of the cross fallen awry all the other thoroughfares on all sides of that hill were full of the pulsation and the pain of battle full of shaking torches and shouting faces when at length they had risen high enough to have a birdseye view of the whole campaign turnbull was already intoxicated he had smelt gunpowder which was the incense of his own revolutionary religion  have the people really risen he asked breathlessly what are they fighting about  the programme is rather elaborate said his entertainer with some indifference i think dr hertz drew it up  turnbull wrinkled his forehead are all the poor people with the revolution he asked  the other shrugged his shoulders all the instructed and classconscious part of them without exception he replied there were certainly a few districts in fact we are passing over them just now  turnbull looked down and saw that the polished car was literally lit up from underneath by the farflung fires from below underneath whole squares and solid districts were in flames like prairies or forests on fire  dr hertz has convinced everybody said turnbulls cicerone in a smooth voice that nothing can really be done with the real slums his celebrated maxim has been quite adopted i mean the three celebrated sentences no man should be unemployed employ the employables destroy the unemployables  there was a silence and then turnbull said in a rather strained voice and do i understand that this good work is going on under here  going on splendidly replied his companion in the heartiest voice you see these people were much too tired and weak even to join the social war they were a definite hindrance to it  and so you are simply burning them out  it does seem absurdly simple said the man with a beaming smile when one thinks of all the worry and talk about helping a hopeless slave population when the future obviously was only crying to be rid of them there are happy babes unborn ready to burst the doors when these drivellers are swept away  will you permit me to say said turnbull after reflection that i dont like all this  and will you permit me to say said the other with a snap that i dont like mr evan macian  somewhat to the speakers surprise this did not inflame the sensitive sceptic he had the air of thinking thoroughly and then he said no i dont think its my friend macian that taught me that i think i should always have said that i dont like this these people have rights  rights repeated the unknown in a tone quite indescribable then he added with a more open sneer perhaps they also have souls  they have lives said turnbull sternly that is quite enough for me i understood you to say that you thought life sacred  yes indeed cried his mentor with a sort of idealistic animation yes indeed life is sacredbut lives are not sacred we are improving life by removing lives can you as a freethinker find any fault in that  yes said turnbull with brevity  yet you applaud tyrannicide said the stranger with rationalistic gaiety how inconsistent it really comes to this you approve of taking away life from those to whom it is a triumph and a pleasure but you will not take away life from those to whom it is a burden and a toil  turnbull rose to his feet in the car with considerable deliberation but his face seemed oddly pale the other went on with enthusiasm  life yes life is indeed sacred he cried but new lives for old good lives for bad on that very place where now there sprawls one drunken wastrel of a pavement artist more or less wishing he were deadon that very spot there shall in the future be living pictures there shall be golden girls and boys leaping in the sun  turnbull still standing up opened his lips will you put me down please he said quite calmly like on stopping an omnibus  put you downwhat do you mean cried his leader i am taking you to the front of the revolutionary war where you will be one of the first of the revolutionary leaders  thank you replied turnbull with the same painful constraint i have heard about your revolutionary war and i think on the whole that i would rather be anywhere else  do you want to be taken to a monastery snarled the other with macian and his winking madonnas  i want to be taken to a madhouse said turnbull distinctly giving the direction with a sort of precision i want to go back to exactly the same lunatic asylum from which i came  why asked the unknown  because i want a little sane and wholesome society answered turnbull  there was a long and peculiar silence and then the man driving the flying machine said quite coolly i wont take you back  and then turnbull said equally coolly then ill jump out of the car  the unknown rose to his full height and the expression in his eyes seemed to be made of ironies behind ironies as two mirrors infinitely reflect each other at last he said very gravely do you think i am the devil  yes said turnbull violently for i think the devil is a dream and so are you i dont believe in you or your flying ship or your last fight of the world it is all a nightmare i say as a fact of dogma and faith that it is all a nightmare and i will be a martyr for my faith as much as st catherine for i will jump out of this ship and risk waking up safe in bed  after swaying twice with the swaying vessel he dived over the side as one dives into the sea for some incredible moments stars and space and planets seemed to shoot up past him as the sparks fly upward and yet in that sickening descent he was full of some unnatural happiness he could connect it with no idea except one that half escaped himwhat evan had said of the difference between christ and satan that it was by christs own choice that he descended into hell  when he again realized anything he was lying on his elbow on the lawn of the lunatic asylum and the last red of the sunset had not yet disappeared     xvii the idiot  evan macian was standing a few yards off looking at him in absolute silence  he had not the moral courage to ask macian if there had been anything astounding in the manner of his coming there nor did macian seem to have any question to ask or perhaps any need to ask it the two men came slowly towards each other and found the same expression on each others faces then for the first time in all their acquaintance they shook hands  almost as if this were a kind of unconscious signal it brought dr quayle bounding out of a door and running across the lawn  oh there you are he exclaimed with a relieved giggle will you come inside please i want to speak to you both  they followed him into his shiny wooden office where their damning record was kept dr quayle sat down on a swivel chair and swung round to face them his carved smile had suddenly disappeared  i will be plain with you gentlemen he said abruptly you know quite well we do our best for everybody here your cases have been under special consideration and the master himself has decided that you ought to be treated specially anderunder somewhat simpler conditions  you mean treated worse i suppose said turnbull gruffly  the doctor did not reply and macian said i expected this his eyes had begun to glow  the doctor answered looking at his desk and playing with a key well in certain cases that give anxietyit is often better  give anxiety said turnbull fiercely confound your impudence what do you mean you imprison two perfectly sane men in a madhouse because you have made up a long word they take it in good temper walk and talk in your garden like monks who have found a vocation are civil even to you you damned druggists hack behave not only more sanely than any of your patients but more sanely than half the sane men outside and you have the soulstifling cheek to say that they give anxiety  the head of the asylum has settled it all said dr quayle still looking down  macian took one of his immense strides forward and stood over the doctor with flaming eyes  if the head has settled it let the head announce it he said i wont take it from you i believe you to be a low gibbering degenerate let us see the head of the asylum  see the head of the asylum repeated dr quayle certainly not  the tall highlander bending over him put one hand on his shoulder with fatherly interest  you dont seem to appreciate the peculiar advantages of my position as a lunatic he said i could kill you with my left hand before such a rat as you could so much as squeak and i wouldnt be hanged for it  i certainly agree with mr macian said turnbull with sobriety and perfect respectfulness that you had better let us see the head of the institution  dr quayle got to his feet in a mixture of sudden hysteria and clumsy presence of mind  oh certainly he said with a weak laugh you can see the head of the asylum if you particularly want to he almost ran out of the room and the two followed swiftly on his flying coat tails he knocked at an ordinary varnished door in the corridor when a voice said come in macians breath went hissing back through his teeth into his chest turnbull was more impetuous and opened the door  it was a neat and wellappointed room entirely lined with a medical library at the other end of it was a ponderous and polished desk with an incandescent lamp on it the light of which was just sufficient to show a slender wellbred figure in an ordinary medical black frockcoat whose head quite silvered with age was bent over neat piles of notes this gentleman looked up for an instant as they entered and the lamplight fell on his glittering spectacles and long cleanshaven facea face which would have been simply like an aristocrats but that a certain lion poise of the head and long cleft in the chin made it look more like a very handsome actors it was only for a flash that his face was thus lifted then he bent his silver head over his notes once more and said without looking up again  i told you dr quayle that these men were to go to cells b and c  turnbull and macian looked at each other and said more than they could ever say with tongues or swords among other things they said that to that particular head of the institution it was a waste of time to appeal and they followed dr quayle out of the room  the instant they stepped out into the corridor four sturdy figures stepped from four sides pinioned them and ran them along the galleries they might very likely have thrown their captors right and left had they been inclined to resist but for some nameless reason they were more inclined to laugh a mixture of mad irony with childish curiosity made them feel quite inclined to see what next twist would be taken by their imbecile luck they were dragged down countless cold avenues lined with glazed tiles different only in being of different lengths and set at different angles they were so many and so monotonous that to escape back by them would have been far harder than fleeing from the hampton court maze only the fact that windows grew fewer coming at longer intervals and the fact that when the windows did come they seemed shadowed and let in less light showed that they were winding into the core or belly of some enormous building after a little time the glazed corridors began to be lit by electricity  at last when they had walked nearly a mile in those white and polished tunnels they came with quite a shock to the futile finality of a culdesac all that white and weary journey ended suddenly in an oblong space and a blank white wall but in the white wall there were two iron doors painted white on which were written respectively in neat black capitals b and c  you go in here sir said the leader of the officials quite respectfully and you in here  but before the doors had clanged upon their dazed victims macian had been able to say to turnbull with a strange drawl of significance i wonder who a is  turnbull made an automatic struggle before he allowed himself to be thrown into the cell hence it happened that he was the last to enter and was still full of the exhilaration of the adventures for at least five minutes after the echo of the clanging door had died away  then when silence had sunk deep and nothing happened for two and a half hours it suddenly occurred to him that this was the end of his life he was hidden and sealed up in this little crack of stone until the flesh should fall off his bones he was dead and the world had won  his cell was of an oblong shape but very long in comparison with its width it was just wide enough to permit the arms to be fully extended with the dumbbells which were hung up on the left wall very dusty it was however long enough for a man to walk one thirtyfifth part of a mile if he traversed it entirely on the same principle a row of fixed holes quite close together let in to the cells by pipes what was alleged to be the freshest air for these great scientific organizers insisted that a man should be healthy even if he was miserable they provided a walk long enough to give him exercise and holes large enough to give him oxygen there their interest in human nature suddenly ceased it seemed never to have occurred to them that the benefit of exercise belongs partly to the benefit of liberty they had not entertained the suggestion that the open air is only one of the advantages of the open sky they administered air in secret but in sufficient doses as if it were a medicine they suggested walking as if no man had ever felt inclined to walk above all the asylum authorities insisted on their own extraordinary cleanliness every morning while turnbull was still half asleep on his iron bedstead which was lifted halfway up the wall and clamped to it with iron four sluices or metal mouths opened above him at the four corners of the chamber and washed it white of any defilement turnbulls solitary soul surged up against this sickening daily solemnity  i am buried alive he cried bitterly they have hidden me under mountains i shall be here till i rot why the blazes should it matter to them whether i am dirty or clean  every morning and evening an iron hatchway opened in his oblong cell and a brown hairy hand or two thrust in a plate of perfectly cooked lentils and a big bowl of cocoa he was not underfed any more than he was underexercised or asphyxiated he had ample walking space ample air ample and even filling food the only objection was that he had nothing to walk towards nothing to feast about and no reason whatever for drawing the breath of life  even the shape of his cell especially irritated him it was a long narrow parallelogram which had a flat wall at one end and ought to have had a flat wall at the other but that end was broken by a wedge or angle of space like the prow of a ship after three days of silence and cocoa this angle at the end began to infuriate turnbull it maddened him to think that two lines came together and pointed at nothing after the fifth day he was reckless and poked his head into the corner after twentyfive days he almost broke his head against it then he became quite cool and stupid again and began to examine it like a sort of robinson crusoe  almost unconsciously it was his instinct to examine outlets and he found himself paying particular attention to the row of holes which let in the air into his last house of life he soon discovered that these airholes were all the ends and mouths of long leaden tubes which doubtless carried air from some remote wateringplace near margate one evening while he was engaged in the fifth investigation he noticed something like twilight in one of these dumb mouths as compared with the darkness of the others thrusting his finger in as far as it would go he found a hole and flapping edge in the tube this he rent open and instantly saw a light behind it was at least certain that he had struck some other cell  it is a characteristic of all things now called efficient which means mechanical and calculated that if they go wrong at all they go entirely wrong there is no power of retrieving a defeat as in simpler and more living organisms a strong gun can conquer a strong elephant but a wounded elephant can easily conquer a broken gun thus the prussian monarchy in the eighteenth century or now can make a strong army merely by making the men afraid but it does it with the permanent possibility that the men may some day be more afraid of their enemies than of their officers thus the drainage in our cities so long as it is quite solid means a general safety but if there is one leak it means concentrated poisonan explosion of deathly germs like dynamite a spirit of stink thus indeed all that excellent machinery which is the swiftest thing on earth in saving human labour is also the slowest thing on earth in resisting human interference it may be easier to get chocolate for nothing out of a shopkeeper than out of an automatic machine but if you did manage to steal the chocolate the automatic machine would be much less likely to run after you  turnbull was not long in discovering this truth in connexion with the cold and colossal machinery of this great asylum he had been shaken by many spiritual states since the instant when he was pitched head foremost into that private cell which was to be his private room till death he had felt a high fit of pride and poetry which had ebbed away and left him deadly cold he had known a period of mere scientific curiosity in the course of which he examined all the tiles of his cell with the gratifying conclusion that they were all the same shape and size but was greatly puzzled about the angle in the wall at the end and also about an iron peg or spike that stood out from the wall the object of which he does not know to this day then he had a period of mere madness not to be written of by decent men but only by those few dirty novelists hallooed on by the infernal huntsman to hunt down and humiliate human nature this also passed but left behind it a feverish distaste for many of the mere objects around him long after he had returned to sanity and such hopeless cheerfulness as a man might have on a desert island he disliked the regular squares of the pattern of wall and floor and the triangle that terminated his corridor above all he had a hatred deep as the hell he did not believe in for the objectless iron peg in the wall  but in all his moods sane or insane intolerant or stoical he never really doubted this that the machine held him as light and as hopelessly as he had from his birth been held by the hopeless cosmos of his own creed he knew well the ruthless and inexhaustible resources of our scientific civilization he no more expected rescue from a medical certificate than rescue from the solar system in many of his robinson crusoe moods he thought kindly of macian as of some quarrelsome schoolfellow who had long been dead he thought of leaving in the cell when he died a rigid record of his opinions and when he began to write them down on scraps of envelope in his pocket he was startled to discover how much they had changed then he remembered the beauchamp tower and tried to write his blazing scepticism on the wall and discovered that it was all shiny tiles on which nothing could be either drawn or carved then for an instant there hung and broke above him like a high wave the whole horror of scientific imprisonment which manages to deny a man not only liberty but every accidental comfort of bondage in the old filthy dungeons men could carve their prayers or protests in the rock here the white and slippery walls escaped even from bearing witness the old prisoners could make a pet of a mouse or a beetle strayed out of a hole here the unpierceable walls were washed every morning by an automatic sluice there was no natural corruption and no merciful decay by which a living thing could enter in then james turnbull looked up and saw the high invincible hatefulness of the society in which he lived and saw the hatefulness of something else also which he told himself again and again was not the cosmos in which he believed but all the time he had never once doubted that the five sides of his cell were for him the wall of the world henceforward and it gave him a shock of surprise even to discover the faint light through the aperture in the ventilation tube but he had forgotten how close efficiency has to pack everything together and how easily therefore a pipe here or there may leak  turnbull thrust his first finger down the aperture and at last managed to make a slight further fissure in the piping the light that came up from beyond was very faint and apparently indirect it seemed to fall from some hole or window higher up as he was screwing his eye to peer at this grey and greasy twilight he was astonished to see another human finger very long and lean come down from above towards the broken pipe and hook it up to something higher the lighted aperture was abruptly blackened and blocked presumably by a face and mouth for something human spoke down the tube though the words were not clear  who is that asked turnbull trembling with excitement yet wary and quite resolved not to spoil any chance  after a few indistinct sounds the voice came down with a strong argyllshire accent  i say turnbull we couldnt fight through this tube could we  sentiments beyond speech surged up in turnbull and silenced him for a space just long enough to be painful then he said with his old gaiety i vote we talk a little first i dont want to murder the first man i have met for ten million years  i know what you mean answered the other it has been awful for a mortal month i have been alone with god  turnbull started and it was on the tip of his tongue to answer alone with god then you do not know what loneliness is  but he answered after all in his old defiant style alone with god were you and i suppose you found his majestys society rather monotonous  oh no said macian and his voice shuddered it was a great deal too exciting  after a very long silence the voice of macian said what do you really hate most in your place  youd think i was really mad if i told you answered turnbull bitterly  then i expect its the same as mine said the other voice  i am sure its not the same as anybodys said turnbull for it has no rhyme or reason perhaps my brain really has gone but i detest that iron spike in the left wall more than the damned desolation or the damned cocoa have you got one in your cell  not now replied macian with serenity ive pulled it out  his fellowprisoner could only repeat the words  i pulled it out the other day when i was off my head continued the tranquil highland voice it looked so unnecessary  you must be ghastly strong said turnbull  one is when one is mad was the careless reply and it had worn a little loose in the socket even now ive got it out i cant discover what it was for but ive found out something a long sight funnier  what do you mean asked turnbull  i have found out where a is said the other  three weeks afterwards macian had managed to open up communications which made his meaning plain by that time the two captives had fully discovered and demonstrated that weakness in the very nature of modern machinery to which we have already referred the very fact that they were isolated from all companions meant that they were free from all spies and as there were no gaolers to be bribed so there were none to be baffled machinery brought them their cocoa and cleaned their cells that machinery was as helpless as it was pitiless a little patient violence conducted day after day amid constant mutual suggestion opened an irregular hole in the wall large enough to let in a small man in the exact place where there had been before the tiny ventilation holes turnbull tumbled somehow into macians apartment and his first glance found out that the iron spike was indeed plucked from its socket and left moreover another ragged hole into some hollow place behind but for this macians cell was the duplicate of turnbullsa long oblong ending in a wedge and lined with cold and lustrous tiles the small hole from which the peg had been displaced was in that short oblique wall at the end nearest to turnbulls that individual looked at it with a puzzled face  what is in there he asked  macian answered briefly another cell  but where can the door of it be said his companion even more puzzled the doors of our cells are at the other end  it has no door said evan  in the pause of perplexity that followed an eerie and sinister feeling crept over turnbulls stubborn soul in spite of himself the notion of the doorless room chilled him with that sense of halfwitted curiosity which one has when something horrible is half understood  james turnbull said macian in a low and shaken voice these people hate us more than nero hated christians and fear us more than any man feared nero they have filled england with frenzy and galloping in order to capture us and wipe us outin order to kill us and they have killed us for you and i have only made a hole in our coffins but though this hatred that they felt for us is bigger than they felt for bonaparte and more plain and practical than they would feel for jack the ripper yet it is not we whom the people of this place hate most  a cold and quivering impatience continued to crawl up turnbulls spine he had never felt so near to superstition and supernaturalism and it was not a pretty sort of superstition either  there is another man more fearful and hateful went on macian in his low monotone voice and they have buried him even deeper god knows how they did it for he was let in by neither door nor window nor lowered through any opening above i expect these iron handles that we both hate have been part of some damned machinery for walling him up he is there i have looked through the hole at him but i cannot stand looking at him long because his face is turned away from me and he does not move  al turnbulls unnatural and uncompleted feelings found their outlet in rushing to the aperture and looking into the unknown room  it was a third oblong cell exactly like the other two except that it was doorless and except that on one of the walls was painted a large black a like the b and c outside their own doors the letter in this case was not painted outside because this prison had no outside  on the same kind of tiled floor of which the monotonous squares had maddened turnbulls eye and brain was sitting a figure which was startlingly short even for a child only that the enormous head was ringed with hair of a frosty grey the figure was draped both insecurely and insufficiently in what looked like the remains of a brown flannel dressinggown an emptied cup of cocoa stood on the floor beside it and the creature had his big grey head cocked at a particular angle of inquiry or attention which amid all that gathering gloom and mystery struck one as comic if not cocksure  after six still seconds turnbull could stand it no longer but called out to the dwarfish thingin what words heaven knows the thing got up with the promptitude of an animal and turning round offered the spectacle of two owlish eyes and a huge greyandwhite beard not unlike the plumage of an owl this extraordinary beard covered him literally to his feet not that that was very far and perhaps it was as well that it did for portions of his remaining clothing seemed to fall off whenever he moved one talks trivially of a face like parchment but this old mans face was so wrinkled that it was like a parchment loaded with hieroglyphics the lines of his face were so deep and complex that one could see five or ten different faces besides the real one as one can see them in an elaborate wallpaper and yet while his face seemed like a scripture older than the gods his eyes were quite bright blue and startled like those of a baby they looked as if they had only an instant before been fitted into his head  everything depended so obviously upon whether this buried monster spoke that turnbull did not know or care whether he himself had spoken he said something or nothing and then he waited for this dwarfish voice that had been hidden under the mountains of the world at last it did speak and spoke in english with a foreign accent that was neither latin nor teutonic he suddenly stretched out a long and very dirty forefinger and cried in a voice of clear recognition like a childs thats a hole  he digested the discovery for some seconds sucking his finger and then he cried with a crow of laughter and thats a head come through it  the hilarious energy in this idiot attitude gave turnbull another sick turn he had grown to tolerate those dreary and mumbling madmen who trailed themselves about the beautiful asylum gardens but there was something new and subversive of the universe in the combination of so much cheerful decision with a body without a brain  why did they put you in such a place he asked at last with embarrassment  good place yes said the old man nodding a great many times and beaming like a flattered landlord good shape long and narrow with a point like this and he made lovingly with his hands a map of the room in the air  but thats not the best he added confidentially squares very good i have a nice long holiday and can count them but thats not the best  what is the best asked turnbull in great distress  spike is the best said the old man opening his blue eyes blazing it sticks out  the words turnbull spoke broke out of him in pure pity cant we do anything for you he said  i am very happy said the other alphabetically you are a good man can i help you  no i dont think you can sir said turnbull with rough pathos i am glad you are contented at least  the weird old person opened his broad blue eyes and fixed turnbull with a stare extraordinarily severe you are quite sure he said i cannot help you  quite sure thank you said turnbull with broken brevity good day  then he turned to macian who was standing close behind him and whose face now familiar in all its moods told him easily that evan had heard the whole of the strange dialogue  curse those cruel beasts cried turnbull theyve turned him to an imbecile just by burying him alive his brains like a pinpoint now  you are sure he is a lunatic said evan slowly  not a lunatic said turnbull an idiot he just points to things and says that they stick out  he had a notion that he could help us said macian moodily and began to pace towards the other end of his cell  yes it was a bit pathetic assented turnbull such a thing offering help and besides hallo hallo whats the matter  god almighty guide us all said macian  he was standing heavy and still at the other end of the room and staring quietly at the door which for thirty days had sealed them up from the sun turnbull following the others eye stared at the door likewise and then he also uttered an exclamation the iron door was standing about an inch and a half open  he said began evan in a trembling voicehe offered  come along you fool shouted turnbull with a sudden and furious energy i see it all now and its the best stroke of luck in the world you pulled out that iron handle that had screwed up his cell and it somehow altered the machinery and opened all the doors  seizing macian by the elbow he bundled him bodily out into the open corridor and ran him on till they saw daylight through a halfdarkened window  all the same said evan like one answering in an ordinary conversation he did ask you whether he could help you  all this wilderness of windowless passages was so built into the heart of that fortress of fear that it seemed more than an hour before the fugitives had any good glimpse of the outer world they did not even know what hour of the day it was and when turning a corner they saw the bare tunnel of the corridor end abruptly in a shining square of garden the grass burning in that strong evening sunshine which makes it burnished gold rather than green the abrupt opening on to the earth seemed like a hole knocked in the wall of heaven only once or twice in life is it permitted to a man thus to see the very universe from outside and feel existence itself as an adorable adventure not yet begun as they found this shining escape out of that hellish labyrinth they both had simultaneously the sensation of being babes unborn of being asked by god if they would like to live upon the earth they were looking in at one of the seven gates of eden  turnbull was the first to leap into the garden with an earthspurning leap like that of one who could really spread his wings and fly macian who came an instant after was less full of mere animal gusto and fuller of a more fearful and quivering pleasure in the clear and innocent flower colours and the high and holy trees with one bound they were in that cool and cleared landscape and they found just outside the door the blackclad gentleman with the cloven chin smilingly regarding them and his chin seemed to grow longer and longer as he smiled     xviii a riddle of faces  just behind him stood two other doctors one the familiar dr quayle of the blinking eyes and bleating voice the other a more commonplace but much more forcible figure a stout young doctor with short wellbrushed hair and a round but resolute face at the sight of the escape these two subordinates uttered a cry and sprang forward but their superior remained motionless and smiling and somehow the lack of his support seemed to arrest and freeze them in the very gesture of pursuit  let them be he cried in a voice that cut like a blade of ice and not only of ice but of some awful primordial ice that had never been water  i want no devoted champions said the cutting voice even the folly of ones friends bores one at last you dont suppose i should have let these lunatics out of their cells without good reason i have the best and fullest reason they can be let out of their cell today because today the whole world has become their cell i will have no more medieval mummery of chains and doors let them wander about the earth as they wandered about this garden and i shall still be their easy master let them take the wings of the morning and abide in the uttermost parts of the seai am there whither shall they go from my presence and whither shall they flee from my spirit courage dr quayle and do not be downhearted the real days of tyranny are only beginning on this earth  and with that the master laughed and swung away from them almost as if his laugh was a bad thing for people to see  might i speak to you a moment said turnbull stepping forward with a respectful resolution but the shoulders of the master only seemed to take on a new and unexpected angle of mockery as he strode away  turnbull swung round with great abruptness to the other two doctors and said harshly what in snakes does he meanand who are you  my name is hutton said the short stout man and i amwell one of those whose business it is to uphold this establishment  my name is turnbull said the other i am one of those whose business it is to tear it to the ground  the small doctor smiled and turnbulls anger seemed suddenly to steady him  but i dont want to talk about that he said calmly i only want to know what the master of this asylum really means  dr huttons smile broke into a laugh which short as it was had the suspicion of a shake in it i suppose you think that quite a simple question he said  i think it a plain question said turnbull and one that deserves a plain answer why did the master lock us up in a couple of cupboards like jars of pickles for a mortal month and why does he now let us walk free in the garden again  i understand said hutton with arched eyebrows that your complaint is that you are now free to walk in the garden  my complaint is said turnbull stubbornly that if i am fit to walk freely now i have been as fit for the last month no one has examined me no one has come near me your chief says that i am only free because he has made other arrangements what are those arrangements  the young man with the round face looked down for a little while and smoked reflectively the other and elder doctor had gone pacing nervously by himself upon the lawn at length the round face was lifted again and showed two round blue eyes with a certain frankness in them  well i dont see that it can do any harm to tell you know he said you were shut up just then because it was just during that month that the master was bringing off his big scheme he was getting his bill through parliament and organizing the new medical police but of course you havent heard of all that in fact you werent meant to  heard of all what asked the impatient inquirer  theres a new law now and the asylum powers are greatly extended even if you did escape now any policeman would take you up in the next town if you couldnt show a certificate of sanity from us  well continued dr hutton the master described before both houses of parliament the real scientific objection to all existing legislation about lunacy as he very truly said the mistake was in supposing insanity to be merely an exception or an extreme insanity like forgetfulness is simply a quality which enters more or less into all human beings and for practical purposes it is more necessary to know whose mind is really trustworthy than whose has some accidental taint we have therefore reversed the existing method and people now have to prove that they are sane in the first village you entered the village constable would notice that you were not wearing on the left lapel of your coat the small pewter s which is now necessary to any one who walks about beyond asylum bounds or outside asylum hours  you mean to say said turnbull that this was what the master of the asylum urged before the house of commons  dr hutton nodded with gravity  and you mean to say cried turnbull with a vibrant snort that that proposal was passed in an assembly that calls itself democratic  the doctor showed his whole row of teeth in a smile oh the assembly calls itself socialist now he said but we explained to them that this was a question for men of science  turnbull gave one stamp upon the gravel then pulled himself together and resumed but why should your infernal head medicineman lock us up in separate cells while he was turning england into a madhouse im not the prime minister were not the house of lords  he wasnt afraid of the prime minister replied dr hutton he isnt afraid of the house of lords but  well inquired turnbull stamping again  he is afraid of you said hutton simply why didnt you know  macian who had not spoken yet made one stride forward and stood with shaking limbs and shining eyes  he was afraid began evan thickly you mean to say that we  i mean to say the plain truth now that the danger is over said hutton calmly most certainly you two were the only people he ever was afraid of then he added in a low but not inaudible voice except onewhom he feared worse and has buried deeper  come away cried macian this has to be thought about  turnbull followed him in silence as he strode away but just before he vanished turned and spoke again to the doctors  but what has got hold of people he asked abruptly why should all england have gone dotty on the mere subject of dottiness  dr hutton smiled his open smile once more and bowed slightly as to that also he replied i dont want to make you vain  turnbull swung round without a word and he and his companion were lost in the lustrous leafage of the garden they noticed nothing special about the scene except that the garden seemed more exquisite than ever in the deepening sunset and that there seemed to be many more people whether patients or attendants walking about in it  from behind the two blackcoated doctors as they stood on the lawn another figure somewhat similarly dressed strode hurriedly past them having also grizzled hair and an open flapping frockcoat both his decisive step and dapper black array marked him out as another medical man or at least a man in authority and as he passed turnbull the latter was aroused by a strong impression of having seen the man somewhere before it was no one that he knew well yet he was certain that it was someone at whom he had at sometime or other looked steadily it was neither the face of a friend nor of an enemy it aroused neither irritation nor tenderness yet it was a face which had for some reason been of great importance in his life turning and returning and making detours about the garden he managed to study the mans face again and againa moustached somewhat military face with a monocle the sort of face that is aristocratic without being distinguished turnbull could not remember any particular doctors in his decidedly healthy existence was the man a longlost uncle or was he only somebody who had sat opposite him regularly in a railway train at that moment the man knocked down his own eyeglass with a gesture of annoyance turnbull remembered the gesture and the truth sprang up solid in front of him the man with the moustaches was cumberland vane the london police magistrate before whom he and macian had once stood on their trial the magistrate must have been transferred to some other official dutiesto something connected with the inspection of asylums  turnbulls heart gave a leap of excitement which was half hope as a magistrate mr cumberland vane had been somewhat careless and shallow but certainly kindly and not inaccessible to common sense so long as it was put to him in strictly conventional language he was at least an authority of a more human and refreshing sort than the crank with the wagging beard or the fiend with the forked chin  he went straight up to the magistrate and said good evening mr vane i doubt if you remember me  cumberland vane screwed the eyeglass into his scowling face for an instant and then said curtly but not uncivilly yes i remember you sir assault or battery wasnt ita fellow broke your window a tall fellowmcsomethingcase made rather a noise afterwards  macian is the name sir said turnbull respectfully i have him here with me  eh said vane very sharply confound him has he got anything to do with this game  mr vane said turnbull pacifically i will not pretend that either he or i acted quite decorously on that occasion you were very lenient with us and did not treat us as criminals when you very well might so i am sure you will give us your testimony that even if we were criminals we are not lunatics in any legal or medical sense whatever i am sure you will use your influence for us  my influence repeated the magistrate with a slight start i dont quite understand you  i dont know in what capacity you are here continued turnbull gravely but a legal authority of your distinction must certainly be here in an important one whether you are visiting and inspecting the place or attached to it as some kind of permanent legal adviser your opinion must still  cumberland vane exploded with a detonation of oaths his face was transfigured with fury and contempt and yet in some odd way he did not seem specially angry with turnbull  but lord bless us and save us he gasped at length im not here as an official at all im here as a patient the cursed pack of ratcatching chemists all say that ive lost my wits  you cried turnbull with terrible emphasis you lost your wits  in the rush of his real astonishment at this towering unreality turnbull almost added why you havent got any to lose but he fortunately remembered the remains of his desperate diplomacy  this cant go on he said positively men like macian and i may suffer unjustly all our lives but a man like you must have influence  there is only one man who has any influence in england now said vane and his high voice fell to a sudden and convincing quietude  whom do you mean asked turnbull  i mean that cursed fellow with the long split chin said the other  is it really true asked turnbull that he has been allowed to buy up and control such a lot what put the country into such a state  mr cumberland vane laughed outright what put the country into such a state he asked why you did when you were fool enough to agree to fight macian after all everybody was ready to believe that the bank of england might paint itself pink with white spots  i dont understand answered turnbull why should you be surprised at my fighting i hope i have always fought  well said cumberland vane airily you didnt believe in religion you seeso we thought you were safe at any rate you went further in your language than most of us wanted to go no good in just hurting ones mothers feelings i think but of course we all knew you were right and really we relied on you  did you said the editor of the atheist with a bursting heart i am sorry you did not tell me so at the time  he walked away very rapidly and flung himself on a garden seat and for some six minutes his own wrongs hid from him the huge and hilarious fact that cumberland vane had been locked up as a lunatic  the garden of the madhouse was so perfectly planned and answered so exquisitely to every hour of daylight that one could almost fancy that the sunlight was caught there tangled in its tinted trees as the wise men of gotham tried to chain the spring to a bush or it seemed as if this ironic paradise still kept its unique dawn or its special sunset while the rest of the earthly globe rolled through its ordinary hours there was one evening or late afternoon in particular which evan macian will remember in the last moments of death it was what artists call a daffodil sky but it is coarsened even by reference to a daffodil it was of that innocent lonely yellow which has never heard of orange though it might turn quite unconsciously into green against it the tops one might say the turrets of the clipt and ordered trees were outlined in that shade of veiled violet which tints the tops of lavender a white early moon was hardly traceable upon that delicate yellow macian i say will remember this tender and transparent evening partly because of its virgin gold and silver and partly because he passed beneath it through the most horrible instant of his life  turnbull was sitting on his seat on the lawn and the golden evening impressed even his positive nature as indeed it might have impressed the oxen in a field he was shocked out of his idle mood of awe by seeing macian break from behind the bushes and run across the lawn with an action he had never seen in the man before with all his experience of the eccentric humours of this celt macian fell on the bench shaking it so that it rattled and gripped it with his knees like one in dreadful pain of body that particular run and tumble is typical only of a man who has been hit by some sudden and incurable evil who is bitten by a viper or condemned to be hanged turnbull looked up in the white face of his friend and enemy and almost turned cold at what he saw there he had seen the blue but gloomy eyes of the western highlander troubled by as many tempests as his own west highland seas but there had always been a fixed star of faith behind the storms now the star had gone out and there was only misery  yet macian had the strength to answer the question where turnbull taken by surprise had not the strength to ask it  they are right they are right he cried o my god they are right turnbull i ought to be here  he went on with shapeless fluency as if he no longer had the heart to choose or check his speech i suppose i ought to have guessed long agoall my big dreams and schemesand everyone being against usbut i was stuck up you know  do tell me about it really cried the atheist and faced with the furnace of the others pain he did not notice that he spoke with the affection of a father  i am mad turnbull said evan with a dead clearness of speech and leant back against the garden seat  nonsense said the other clutching at the obvious cue of benevolent brutality this is one of your silly moods  macian shook his head i know enough about myself he said to allow for any mood though it opened heaven or hell but to see thingsto see them walking solid in the sunthings that cant be therereal mystics never do that turnbull  what things asked the other incredulously  macian lowered his voice i saw her he said three minutes agowalking here in this hell yard  between trying to look scornful and really looking startled turnbulls face was confused enough to emit no speech and evan went on in monotonous sincerity  i saw her walk behind those blessed trees against that holy sky of gold as plain as i can see her whenever i shut my eyes i did shut them and opened them again and she was still therethat is of course she wasnt she still had a little fur round her neck but her dress was a shade brighter than when i really saw her  my dear fellow cried turnbull rallying a hearty laugh the fancies have really got hold of you you mistook some other poor girl here for her  mistook some other said macian and words failed him altogether  they sat for some moments in the mellow silence of the evening garden a silence that was stifling for the sceptic but utterly empty and final for the man of faith at last he broke out again with the words well anyhow if im mad im glad im mad on that  turnbull murmured some clumsy deprecation and sat stolidly smoking to collect his thoughts the next instant he had all his nerves engaged in the mere effort to sit still  across the clear space of cold silver and a pale lemon sky which was left by the gap in the ilextrees there passed a slim dark figure a profile and the poise of a dark head like a birds which really pinned him to his seat with the point of coincidence with an effort he got to his feet and said with a voice of affected insouciance by george macian she is uncommonly like  what cried macian with a leap of eagerness that was heartbreaking do you see her too and the blaze came back into the centre of his eyes  turnbulls tawny eyebrows were pulled together with a peculiar frown of curiosity and all at once he walked quickly across the lawn macian sat rigid but peered after him with open and parched lips he saw the sight which either proved him sane or proved the whole universe halfwitted he saw the man of flesh approach that beautiful phantom saw their gestures of recognition and saw them against the sunset joining hands  he could stand it no longer but ran across to the path turned the corner and saw standing quite palpable in the evening sunlight talking with a casual grace to turnbull the face and figure which had filled his midnights with frightfully vivid or desperately halfforgotten features she advanced quite pleasantly and coolly and put out her hand the moment that he touched it he knew that he was sane even if the solar system was crazy  she was entirely elegant and unembarrassed that is the awful thing about womenthey refuse to be emotional at emotional moments upon some such ludicrous pretext as there being someone else there but macian was in a condition of criticism much less than the average masculine one being in fact merely overturned by the rushing riddle of the events  evan does not know to this day what particular question he asked but he vividly remembers that she answered and every line or fluctuation of her face as she said it  oh dont you know she said smiling and suddenly lifting her level brown eyebrows havent you heard the news im a lunatic  then she added after a short pause and with a sort of pride ive got a certificate  her manner by the matchless social stoicism of her sex was entirely suited to a drawingroom but evans reply fell somewhat far short of such a standard as he only said what the devil in hell does all this nonsense mean  really said the young lady and laughed  i beg your pardon said the unhappy young man rather wildly but what i mean is why are you here in an asylum  the young woman broke again into one of the maddening and mysterious laughs of femininity then she composed her features and replied with equal dignity well if it comes to that why are you  the fact that turnbull had strolled away and was investigating rhododendrons may have been due to evans successful prayers to the other world or possibly to his own pretty successful experience of this one but though they two were as isolated as a new adam and eve in a pretty ornamental eden the lady did not relax by an inch the rigour of her badinage  i am locked up in the madhouse said evan with a sort of stiff pride because i tried to keep my promise to you  quite so answered the inexplicable lady nodding with a perfectly blazing smile and i am locked up because it was to me you promised  it is outrageous cried evan it is impossible  oh you can see my certificate if you like she replied with some hauteur  macian stared at her and then at his boots and then at the sky and then at her again he was quite sure now that he himself was not mad and the fact rather added to his perplexity  then he drew nearer to her and said in a dry and dreadful voice oh dont condescend to play the fool with such a fool as me are you really locked up here as a patientbecause you helped us to escape  yes she said still smiling but her steady voice had a shake in it  evan flung his big elbow across his forehead and burst into tears  the pure lemon of the sky faded into purer white as the great sunset silently collapsed the birds settled back into the trees the moon began to glow with its own light mr james turnbull continued his botanical researches into the structure of the rhododendron but the lady did not move an inch until evan had flung up his face again and when he did he saw by the last gleam of sunlight that it was not only his face that was wet  mr james turnbull had all his life professed a profound interest in physical science and the phenomena of a good garden were really a pleasure to him but after threequarters of an hour or so even the apostle of science began to find rhododendrus a bore and was somewhat relieved when an unexpected development of events obliged him to transfer his researches to the equally interesting subject of hollyhocks which grew some fifty feet farther along the path the ostensible cause of his removal was the unexpected reappearance of his two other acquaintances walking and talking laboriously along the way with the black head bent close to the brown one even hollyhocks detained turnbull but a short time having rapidly absorbed all the important principles affecting the growth of those vegetables he jumped over a flowerbed and walked back into the building the other two came up along the slow course of the path talking and talking no one but god knows what they said for they certainly have forgotten and if i remembered it i would not repeat it when they parted at the head of the walk she put out her hand again in the same wellbred way although it trembled he seemed to restrain a gesture as he let it fall  if it is really always to be like this he said thickly it would not matter if we were here for ever  you tried to kill yourself four times for me she said unsteadily and i have been chained up as a madwoman for you i really think that after that  yes i know said evan in a low voice looking down after that we belong to each other we are sort of sold to each otheruntil the stars fall then he looked up suddenly and said by the way what is your name  my name is beatrice drake she replied with complete gravity you can see it on my certificate of lunacy     xix the last parley  turnbull walked away wildly trying to explain to himself the presence of two personal acquaintances so different as vane and the girl as he skirted a low hedge of laurel an enormously tall young man leapt over it stood in front of him and almost fell on his neck as if seeking to embrace him  dont you know me almost sobbed the young man who was in the highest spirits aint i written on your heart old boy i say what did you do with my yacht  take your arms off my neck said turnbull irritably are you mad  the young man sat down on the gravel path and went into ecstasies of laughter no thats just the fun of itim not mad he replied theyve shut me up in this place and im not mad and he went off again into mirth as innocent as weddingbells  turnbull whose powers of surprise were exhausted rolled his round grey eyes and said mr wilkinson i think because he could not think of anything else to say  the tall man sitting on the gravel bowed with urbanity and said quite at your service not to be confused with the wilkinsons of cumberland and as i say old boy what have you done with my yacht you see theyve locked me up herein this gardenand a yacht would be a sort of occupation for an unmarried man  i am really horribly sorry began turnbull in the last stage of bated bewilderment and exasperation but really  oh i can see you cant have it on you at the moment said mr wilkinson with much intellectual magnanimity  well the fact is began turnbull again and then the phrase was frozen on his mouth for round the corner came the goatlike face and gleaming eyeglasses of dr quayle  ah my dear mr wilkinson said the doctor as if delighted at a coincidence and mr turnbull too why i want to speak to mr turnbull  mr turnbull made some movement rather of surrender than assent and the doctor caught it up exquisitely showing even more of his two front teeth i am sure mr wilkinson will excuse us a moment and with flying frockcoat he led turnbull rapidly round the corner of a path  my dear sir he said in a quite affectionate manner i do not mind telling youyou are such a very hopeful caseyou understand so well the scientific point of view and i dont like to see you bothered by the really hopeless cases they are monotonous and maddening the man you have just been talking to poor fellow is one of the strongest cases of pure idee fixe that we have its very sad and im afraid utterly incurable he keeps on telling everybodyand the doctor lowered his voice confidentiallyhe tells everybody that two people have taken is yacht his account of how he lost it is quite incoherent  turnbull stamped his foot on the gravel path and called out oh i cant stand this really  i know i know said the psychologist mournfully it is a most melancholy case and also fortunately a very rare one it is so rare in fact that in one classification of these maladies it is entered under a heading by itselfperdinavititis mental inflammation creating the impression that one has lost a ship really he added with a kind of halfembarrassed guilt its rather a feather in my cap i discovered the only existing case of perdinavititis  but this wont do doctor said turnbull almost tearing his hair this really wont do the man really did lose a ship indeed not to put too fine a point on it i took his ship  dr quayle swung round for an instant so that his silklined overcoat rustled and stared singularly at turnbull then he said with hurried amiability why of course you did quite so quite so and with courteous gestures went striding up the garden path under the first laburnumtree he stopped however and pulling out his pencil and notebook wrote down feverishly singular development in the elentheromaniac turnbull sudden manifestation of rapinavititisthe delusion that one has stolen a ship first case ever recorded  turnbull stood for an instant staggered into stillness then he ran raging round the garden to find macian just as a husband even a bad husband will run raging to find his wife if he is full of a furious query he found macian stalking moodily about the halflit garden after his extraordinary meeting with beatrice no one who saw his slouching stride and sunken head could have known that his soul was in the seventh heaven of ecstasy he did not think he did not even very definitely desire he merely wallowed in memories chiefly in material memories words said with a certain cadence or trivial turns of the neck or wrist into the middle of his stationary and senseless enjoyment were thrust abruptly the projecting elbow and the projecting red beard of turnbull macian stepped back a little and the soul in his eyes came very slowly to its windows when james turnbull had the glittering swordpoint planted upon his breast he was in far less danger for three pulsating seconds after the interruption macian was in a mood to have murdered his father  and yet his whole emotional anger fell from him when he saw turnbulls face in which the eyes seemed to be bursting from the head like bullets all the fire and fragrance even of young and honourable love faded for a moment before that stiff agony of interrogation  are you hurt turnbull he asked anxiously  i am dying answered the other quite calmly i am in the quite literal sense of the words dying to know something i want to know what all this can possibly mean  macian did not answer and he continued with asperity you are still thinking about that girl but i tell you the whole thing is incredible shes not the only person here ive met the fellow wilkinson whose yacht we lost ive met the very magistrate you were hauled up to when you broke my window what can it meanmeeting all these old people again one never meets such old friends again except in a dream  then after a silence he cried with a rending sincerity are you really there evan have you ever been really there am i simply dreaming  macian had been listening with a living silence to every word and now his face flamed with one of his rare revelations of life  no you good atheist he cried no you clean courteous reverent pious old blasphemer no you are not dreamingyou are waking up  what do you mean  there are two states where one meets so many old friends said macian one is a dream the other is the end of the world  and you say  i say this is not a dream said evan in a ringing voice  you really mean to suggest began turnbull  be silent or i shall say it all wrong said macian breathing hard its hard to explain anyhow an apocalypse is the opposite of a dream a dream is falser than the outer life but the end of the world is more actual than the world it ends i dont say this is really the end of the world but its something like thatits the end of something all the people are crowding into one corner everything is coming to a point  what is the point asked turnbull  i cant see it said evan it is too large and plain  then after a silence he said i cant see itand yet i will try to describe it turnbull three days ago i saw quite suddenly that our duel was not right after all  three days ago repeated turnbull when and why did this illumination occur  i knew i was not quite right answered evan the moment i saw the round eyes of that old man in the cell  old man in the cell repeated his wondering companion do you mean the poor old idiot who likes spikes to stick out  yes said macian after a slight pause i mean the poor old idiot who likes spikes to stick out when i saw his eyes and heard his old croaking accent i knew that it would not really have been right to kill you it would have been a venial sin  i am much obliged said turnbull gruffly  you must give me time said macian quite patiently for i am trying to tell the whole truth i am trying to tell more of it than i know  so you see i confesshe went on with laborious distinctnessi confess that all the people who called our duel mad were right in a way i would confess it to old cumberland vane and his eyeglass i would confess it even to that old ass in brown flannel who talked to us about love yes they are right in a way i am a little mad  he stopped and wiped his brow as if he were literally doing heavy labour then he went on  i am a little mad but after all it is only a little madness when hundreds of highminded men had fought duels about a jostle with the elbow or the ace of spades the whole world need not have gone wild over my one little wildness plenty of other people have killed themselves between then and now but all england has gone into captivity in order to take us captive all england has turned into a lunatic asylum in order to prove us lunatics compared with the general public i might positively be called sane  he stopped again and went on with the same air of travailing with the truth  when i saw that i saw everything i saw the church and the world the church in its earthly action has really touched morbid thingstortures and bleeding visions and blasts of extermination the church has had her madnesses and i am one of them i am the massacre of st bartholomew i am the inquisition of spain i do not say that we have never gone mad but i say that we are fit to act as keepers to our enemies massacre is wicked even with a provocation as in the bartholomew but your modern nietzsche will tell you that massacre would be glorious without a provocation torture should be violently stopped though the church is doing it but your modern tolstoy will tell you that it ought not to be violently stopped whoever is doing it in the long run which is most madthe church or the world which is madder the spanish priest who permitted tyranny or the prussian sophist who admired it which is madder the russian priest who discourages righteous rebellion or the russian novelist who forbids it that is the final and blasting test the world left to itself grows wilder than any creed a few days ago you and i were the maddest people in england now by god i believe we are the sanest that is the only real questionwhether the church is really madder than the world let the rationalists run their own race and let us see where they end if the world has some healthy balance other than god let the world find it does the world find it cut the world loose he cried with a savage gesture does the world stand on its own end does it stand or does it stagger  turnbull remained silent and macian said to him looking once more at the earth it staggers turnbull it cannot stand by itself you know it cannot it has been the sorrow of your life turnbull this garden is not a dream but an apocalyptic fulfilment this garden is the world gone mad  turnbull did not move his head and he had been listening all the time yet somehow the other knew that for the first time he was listening seriously  the world has gone mad said macian and it has gone mad about us the world takes the trouble to make a big mistake about every little mistake made by the church that is why they have turned ten counties to a madhouse that is why crowds of kindly people are poured into this filthy meltingpot now is the judgement of this world the prince of this world is judged and he is judged exactly because he is judging there is at last one simple solution to the quarrel between the ball and the cross  turnbull for the first time started  the ball and he repeated  what is the matter with you asked macian  i had a dream said turnbull thickly and obscurely in which i saw the cross struck crooked and the ball secure  i had a dream said macian in which i saw the cross erect and the ball invisible they were both dreams from hell there must be some round earth to plant the cross upon but here is the awful differencethat the round world will not consent even to continue round the astronomers are always telling us that it is shaped like an orange or like an egg or like a german sausage they beat the old world about like a bladder and thump it into a thousand shapeless shapes turnbull we cannot trust the ball to be always a ball we cannot trust reason to be reasonable in the end the great terrestrial globe will go quite lopsided and only the cross will stand upright  there was a long silence and then turnbull said hesitatingly has it occurred to you that sincesince those two dreams or whatever they were  well murmured macian  since then went on turnbull in the same low voice since then we have never even looked for our swords  you are right answered evan almost inaudibly we have found something which we both hate more than we ever hated each other and i think i know its name  turnbull seemed to frown and flinch for a moment it does not much matter what you call it he said so long as you keep out of its way  the bushes broke and snapped abruptly behind them and a very tall figure towered above turnbull with an arrogant stoop and a projecting chin a chin of which the shape showed queerly even in its shadow upon the path  you see that is not so easy said macian between his teeth  they looked up into the eyes of the master but looked only for a moment the eyes were full of a frozen and icy wrath a kind of utterly heartless hatred his voice was for the first time devoid of irony there was no more sarcasm in it than there is in an iron club  you will be inside the building in three minutes he said with pulverizing precision or you will be fired on by the artillery at all the windows there is too much talking in this garden we intend to close it you will be accommodated indoors  ah said macian with a long and satisfied sigh then i was right  and he turned his back and walked obediently towards the building turnbull seemed to canvass for a few minutes the notion of knocking the master down and then fell under the same almost fairy fatalism as his companion in some strange way it did seem that the more smoothly they yielded the more swiftly would events sweep on to some great collision     xx dies irae  as they advanced towards the asylum they looked up at its rows on rows of windows and understood the masters material threat by means of that complex but concealed machinery which ran like a network of nerves over the whole fabric there had been shot out under every windowledge rows and rows of polishedsteel cylinders the cold miracles of modern gunnery they commanded the whole garden and the whole countryside and could have blown to pieces an army corps  this silent declaration of war had evidently had its complete effect as macian and turnbull walked steadily but slowly towards the entrance hall of the institution they could see that most or at least many of the patients had already gathered there as well as the staff of doctors and the whole regiment of keepers and assistants but when they entered the lamplit hall and the high iron door was clashed to and locked behind them yet a new amazement leapt into their eyes and the stalwart turnbull almost fell for he saw a sight which was indeed as macian had saideither the day of judgement or a dream  within a few feet of him at one corner of the square of standing people stood the girl he had known in jersey madeleine durand she looked straight at him with a steady smile which lit up the scene of darkness and unreason like the light of some honest fireside her square face and throat were thrown back as her habit was and there was something almost sleepy in the geniality of her eyes he saw her first and for a few seconds saw her only then the outer edge of his eyesight took in all the other staring faces and he saw all the faces he had ever seen for weeks and months past there was the tolstoyan in jaeger flannel with the yellow beard that went backward and the foolish nose and eyes that went forward with the curiosity of a crank he was talking eagerly to mr gordon the corpulent jew shopkeeper whom they had once gagged in his own shop there was the tipsy old hertfordshire rustic he was talking energetically to himself there was not only mr vane the magistrate but the clerk of mr vane the magistrate there was not only miss drake of the motorcar but also miss drakes chauffeur nothing wild or unfamiliar could have produced upon turnbull such a nightmare impression as that ring of familiar faces yet he had one intellectual shock which was greater than all the others he stepped impulsively forward towards madeleine and then wavered with a kind of wild humility as he did so he caught sight of another square face behind madeleines a face with long grey whiskers and an austere stare it was old durand the girls father and when turnbull saw him he saw the last and worst marvel of that monstrous night he remembered durand he remembered his monotonous everlasting lucidity his stupefyingly sensible views of everything his colossal contentment with truisms merely because they were true confound it all cried turnbull to himself if he is in the asylum there cant be anyone outside he drew nearer to madeleine but still doubtfully and all the more so because she still smiled at him macian had already gone across to beatrice with an air of fright  then all these bewildered but partly amicable recognitions were cloven by a cruel voice which always made all human blood turn bitter the master was standing in the middle of the room surveying the scene like a great artist looking at a completed picture handsome as he looked they had never seen so clearly what was really hateful in his face and even then they could only express it by saying that the arched brows and the long emphatic chin gave it always a look of being lit from below like the face of some infernal actor  this is indeed a cosy party he said with glittering eyes  the master evidently meant to say more but before he could say anything m durand had stepped right up to him and was speaking  he was speaking exactly as a french bourgeois speaks to the manager of a restaurant that is he spoke with rattling and breathless rapidity but with no incoherence and therefore with no emotion it was a steady monotonous vivacity which came not seemingly from passion but merely from the reason having been sent off at a gallop he was saying something like this  you refuse me my halfbottle of medoc the drink the most wholesome and the most customary you refuse me the company and obedience of my daughter which nature herself indicates you refuse me the beef and mutton without pretence that it is a fast of the church you now forbid me the promenade a thing necessary to a person of my age it is useless to tell me that you do all this by law law rests upon the social contract if the citizen finds himself despoiled of such pleasures and powers as he would have had even in the savage state the social contract is annulled  its no good chattering away monsieur said hutton for the master was silent the place is covered with machineguns weve got to obey our orders and so have you  the machinery is of the most perfect assented durand somewhat irrelevantly worked by petroleum i believe i only ask you to admit that if such things fall below the comfort of barbarism the social contract is annulled it is a pretty little point of theory  oh i dare say said hutton  durand bowed quite civilly and withdrew  a cosy party resumed the master scornfully and yet i believe some of you are in doubt about how we all came together i will explain it ladies and gentlemen i will explain everything to whom shall i specially address myself to mr james turnbull he has a scientific mind  turnbull seemed to choke with sudden protest the master seemed only to cough out of pure politeness and proceeded mr turnbull will agree with me he said when i say that we long felt in scientific circles that great harm was done by such a legend as that of the crucifixion  turnbull growled something which was presumably assent  the master went on smoothly it was in vain for us to urge that the incident was irrelevant that there were many such fanatics many such executions we were forced to take the thing thoroughly in hand to investigate it in the spirit of scientific history and with the assistance of mr turnbull and others we were happy in being able to announce that this alleged crucifixion never occurred at all  macian lifted his head and looked at the master steadily but turnbull did not look up  this we found was the only way with all superstitions continued the speaker it was necessary to deny them historically and we have done it with great success in the case of miracles and such things now within our own time there arose an unfortunate fuss which threatened as mr turnbull would say to galvanize the corpse of christianity into a fictitious lifethe alleged case of a highland eccentric who wanted to fight for the virgin  macian quite white made a step forward but the speaker did not alter his easy attitude or his flow of words again we urged that this duel was not to be admired that it was a mere brawl but the people were ignorant and romantic there were signs of treating this alleged highlander and his alleged opponent as heroes we tried all other means of arresting this reactionary hero worship working men who betted on the duel were imprisoned for gambling working men who drank the health of a duellist were imprisoned for drunkenness but the popular excitement about the alleged duel continued and we had to fall back on our old historical method we investigated on scientific principles the story of macians challenge and we are happy to be able to inform you that the whole story of the attempted duel is a fable there never was any challenge there never was any man named macian it is a melodramatic myth like calvary  not a soul moved save turnbull who lifted his head yet there was the sense of a silent explosion  the whole story of the macian challenge went on the master beaming at them all with a sinister benignity has been found to originate in the obsessions of a few pathological types who are now all fortunately in our care there is for instance a person here of the name of gordon formerly the keeper of a curiosity shop he is a victim of the disease called vinculomaniathe impression that one has been bound or tied up we have also a case of fugacity mr whimpey who imagines that he was chased by two men  the indignant faces of the jew shopkeeper and the magdalen don started out of the crowd in their indignation but the speaker continued  one poor woman we have with us he said in a compassionate voice believes she was in a motorcar with two such men this is the wellknown illusion of speed on which i need not dwell another wretched woman has the simple egotistic mania that she has caused the duel madeleine durand actually professes to have been the subject of the fight between macian and his enemy a fight which if it occurred at all certainly began long before but it never occurred at all we have taken in hand every person who professed to have seen such a thing and proved them all to be unbalanced that is why they are here  the master looked round the room just showing his perfect teeth with the perfection of artistic cruelty exalted for a moment in the enormous simplicity of his success and then walked across the hall and vanished through an inner door his two lieutenants quayle and hutton were left standing at the head of the great army of servants and keepers  i hope we shall have no more trouble said dr quayle pleasantly enough and addressing turnbull who was leaning heavily upon the back of a chair  still looking down turnbull lifted the chair an inch or two from the ground then he suddenly swung it above his head and sent it at the inquiring doctor with an awful crash which sent one of its wooden legs loose along the floor and crammed the doctor gasping into a corner macian gave a great shout snatched up the loose chairleg and rushing on the other doctor felled him with a blow twenty attendants rushed to capture the rebels macian flung back three of them and turnbull went over on top of one when from behind them all came a shriek as of something quite fresh and frightful  two of the three passages leading out of the hall were choked with blue smoke another instant and the hall was full of the fog of it and red sparks began to swarm like scarlet bees  the place is on fire cried quayle with a scream of indecent terror oh who can have done it how can it have happened  a light had come into turnbulls eyes how did the french revolution happen he asked  oh how should i know wailed the other  then i will tell you said turnbull it happened because some people fancied that a french grocer was as respectable as he looked  even as he spoke as if by confirmation old mr durand reentered the smoky room quite placidly wiping the petroleum from his hands with a handkerchief he had set fire to the building in accordance with the strict principles of the social contract  but macian had taken a stride forward and stood there shaken and terrible now he cried panting now is the judgement of the world the doctors will leave this place the keepers will leave this place they will leave us in charge of the machinery and the machineguns at the windows but we the lunatics will wait to be burned alive if only we may see them go  how do you know we shall go asked hutton fiercely  you believe nothing said macian simply and you are insupportably afraid of death  so this is suicide sneered the doctor a somewhat doubtful sign of sanity  not at allthis is vengeance answered turnbull quite calmly a thing which is completely healthy  you think the doctors will go said hutton savagely  the keepers have gone already said turnbull  even as they spoke the main doors were burst open in mere brutal panic and all the officers and subordinates of the asylum rushed away across the garden pursued by the smoke but among the ticketed maniacs not a man or woman moved  we hate dying said turnbull with composure but we hate you even more this is a successful revolution  in the roof above their heads a panel shot back showing a strip of starlit sky and a huge thing made of white metal with the shape and fins of a fish swinging as if at anchor at the same moment a steel ladder slid down from the opening and struck the floor and the cleft chin of the mysterious master was thrust into the opening quayle hutton he said you will escape with me and they went up the ladder like automata of lead  long after they had clambered into the car the creature with the cloven face continued to leer down upon the smokestung crowd below then at last he said in a silken voice and with a smile of final satisfaction  by the way i fear i am very absent minded there is one man specially whom somehow i always forget i always leave him lying about once i mislaid him on the cross of st pauls so silly of me and now ive forgotten him in one of those little cells where your fire is burning very unfortunateespecially for him and nodding genially he climbed into his flying ship  macian stood motionless for two minutes and then rushed down one of the suffocating corridors till he found the flames turnbull looked once at madeleine and followed                                                      macian with singed hair smoking garments and smarting hands and face had already broken far enough through the first barriers of burning timber to come within cry of the cells he had once known it was impossible however to see the spot where the old man lay dead or alive not now through darkness but through scorching and aching light the site of the old halfwits cell was now the heart of a standing forest of firethe flames as thick and yellow as a cornfield their incessant shrieking and crackling was like a mob shouting against an orator yet through all that deafening density macian thought he heard a small and separate sound when he heard it he rushed forward as if to plunge into that furnace but turnbull arrested him by an elbow  let me go cried evan in agony its the poor old beggars voicehes still alive and shouting for help  listen said turnbull and lifted one finger from his clenched hand  or else he is shrieking with pain protested macian i will not endure it  listen repeated turnbull grimly did you ever hear anyone shout for help or shriek with pain in that voice  the small shrill sounds which came through the crash of the conflagration were indeed of an odd sort and macian turned a face of puzzled inquiry to his companion  he is singing said turnbull simply  a remaining rampart fell crushing the fire and through the diminished din of it the voice of the little old lunatic came clearer in the heart of that whitehot hell he was singing like a bird what he was singing it was not very easy to follow but it seemed to be something about playing in the golden hay  good lord cried turnbull bitterly there seem to be some advantages in really being an idiot then advancing to the fringe of the fire he called out on chance to the invisible singer can you come out are you cut off  god help us all said macian with a shudder hes laughing now  at whatever stage of being burned alive the invisible now found himself he was now shaking out peals of silvery and hilarious laughter as he listened macians two eyes began to glow as if a strange thought had come into his head  fool come out and save yourself shouted turnbull  no by heaven that is not the way cried evan suddenly father he shouted come out and save us all  the fire though it had dropped in one or two places was upon the whole higher and more unconquerable than ever separate tall flames shot up and spread out above them like the fiery cloisters of some infernal cathedral or like a grove of red tropical trees in the garden of the devil higher yet in the purple hollow of the night the topmost flames leapt again and again fruitlessly at the stars like golden dragons chained but struggling the towers and domes of the oppressive smoke seemed high and far enough to drown distant planets in a london fog but if we exhausted all frantic similes for that frantic scene the main impression about the fire would still be its ranked upstanding rigidity and a sort of roaring stillness it was literally a wall of fire  father cried macian once more come out of it and save us all turnbull was staring at him as he cried  the tall and steady forest of fire must have been already a portent visible to the whole circle of land and sea the red flush of it lit up the long sides of white ships far out in the german ocean and picked out like piercing rubies the windows in the villages on the distant heights if any villagers or sailors were looking towards it they must have seen a strange sight as macian cried out for the third time  that forest of fire wavered and was cloven in the centre and then the whole of one half of it leaned one way as a cornfield leans all one way under the load of the wind indeed it looked as if a great wind had sprung up and driven the great fire aslant its smoke was no longer sent up to choke the stars but was trailed and dragged across county after county like one dreadful banner of defeat  but it was not the wind or if it was the wind it was two winds blowing in opposite directions for while one half of the huge fire sloped one way towards the inland heights the other half at exactly the same angle sloped out eastward towards the sea so that earth and ocean could behold where there had been a mere fiery mass a thing divided like a va cloven tongue of flame but if it were a prodigy for those distant it was something beyond speech for those quite near as the echoes of evans last appeal rang and died in the universal uproar the fiery vault over his head opened down the middle and reeling back in two great golden billows hung on each side as huge and harmless as two sloping hills lie on each side of a valley down the centre of this trough or chasm a little path ran cleared of all but ashes and down this little path was walking a little old man singing as if he were alone in a wood in spring  when james turnbull saw this he suddenly put out a hand and seemed to support himself on the strong shoulder of madeleine durand then after a moments hesitation he put his other hand on the shoulder of macian his blue eyes looked extraordinarily brilliant and beautiful in many sceptical papers and magazines afterwards he was sadly or sternly rebuked for having abandoned the certainties of materialism all his life up to that moment he had been most honestly certain that materialism was a fact but he was unlike the writers in the magazines precisely in thisthat he preferred a fact even to materialism  as the little singing figure came nearer and nearer evan fell on his knees and after an instant beatrice followed then madeleine fell on her knees and after a longer instant turnbull followed then the little old man went past them singing down that corridor of flames they had not looked at his face  when he had passed they looked up while the first light of the fire had shot east and west painting the sides of ships with firelight or striking red sparks out of windowed houses it had not hitherto struck upward for there was above it the ponderous and rococo cavern of its own monstrous coloured smoke but now the fire was turned to left and right like a womans hair parted in the middle and now the shafts of its light could shoot up into empty heavens and strike anything either bird or cloud but it struck something that was neither cloud nor bird far far away up in those huge hollows of space something was flying swiftly and shining brightly something that shone too bright and flew too fast to be any of the fowls of the air though the red light lit it from underneath like the breast of a bird everyone knew it was a flying ship and everyone knew whose  as they stared upward the little speck of light seemed slightly tilted and two black dots dropped from the edge of it all the eager upturned faces watched the two dots as they grew bigger and bigger in their downward rush then someone screamed and no one looked up any more for the two bodies larger every second flying spread out and sprawling in the firelight were the dead bodies of the two doctors whom professor lucifer had carried with himthe weak and sneering quayle the cold and clumsy hutton they went with a crash into the thick of the fire  they are gone screamed beatrice hiding her head o god the are lost  evan put his arm about her and remembered his own vision  no they are not lost he said they are saved he has taken away no souls with him after all  he looked vaguely about at the fire that was already fading and there among the ashes lay two shining things that had survived the fire his sword and turnbulls fallen haphazard in the pattern of a cross
