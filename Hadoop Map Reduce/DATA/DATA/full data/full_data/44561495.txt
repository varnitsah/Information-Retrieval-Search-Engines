illustrations   he held the telegram in front of her face read he said  lady olive came slowly forward to meet him  there was some matter which you wished to discuss then deane asked  i hate him she declared to herself i hate him now more than ever     the golden web     book one     chapter i  a life for sale   the contrast in personal appearance between the two men having regard to their relative positions was a significant thing the caller who had just been summoned from the waitingroom and was standing before the others table hat in hand a little shabby with illbrushed hair and doubtful collar bore in his countenance many traces of the wild and irregular life which had reduced him at this moment to the position of suppliant his complexion was pale almost to ghastliness and in his deepset sunken eyes there was more than a suggestion of recklessness he was so nervous that his face twitched as he stood there waiting and the fingers which held his hat trembled his lips were a little parted his breathing was scarcely healthy there was something about his whole appearance indicative of failure the writing upon his forehead was the writing of despair  the man before whom he stood was of an altogether different type his features were strong and regular his complexion slightly bronzed as though from exposure to the sun and wind he had closelycropped black hair keen gray eyes and a determined chin he sat before a table on which were all the modern appurtenances of a business man in close touch with passing events a telephone was at his elbow his secretary was busy at a smaller table in the corner of the room a typist was waiting respectfully in the background his confidential clerk was leaning over his chair notebook in hand receiving in a few terse sentences instructions for the morrows operations stirling deane although he was barely forty years old was at the head of a great mining corporation he had been the one man selected for the position when the most important and farreaching amalgamation of recent days had taken place and this although he came of a family whose devotion to business had always been blended with a singular aptitude for and preëminence in sports deane himself until the last few years had played cricket for his county had hunted two days a week and had by no means shown that wholehearted passion for moneymaking which was rife enough in the circles amid which he moved  he wound up his instructions and dismissed his clerk with a few curt and final words then he turned round in his chair and faced his visitor  i am sorry to have kept you rowan he said this is always rather a busy day in the city and a busy time  his visitor who had been waiting for an hour in an anteroom and was then esteemed fortunate to be accorded an interview looked around him with a little smile  so youve prospered deane he said  naturally the other answered i always meant to and you rowan  the visitor shook his head i have tried many things he said all failuresdisposition or luck i suppose what is it i wonder that keeps some men down while others climb  deane shrugged his shoulders disposition he said is only an appendage and luck doesnt exist in nine cases out of ten if a mans will is strong enough he climbs  rowan nodded gloomily perhaps thats it he assented i never had any will or if i had it didnt seem worth while to use it  take a seat said deane you dont look fit to stand what can i do for you we shall be interrupted in a few moments  i want something to do rowan said  i cant give it to you answered deane firmly but not unkindly  you dont beat about the bush the other declared with a hard little laugh  why should i deane asked it would only waste our time and be after all a mistaken kindness there isnt a man about my place who hasnt grown up under my own personal observation its an important business this rowan i darent risk a single weak link to be frank with youand you see i am being frankid sooner pay your salary than have you here  give me a letter to someone else then rowan begged im just back from africa broken  i cant do that deane answered i know you well i like you we have been friends we have been together in difficulties more than once you have been in a way useful to me i have every disposition to serve you but you were never made for business or any form of regular work i would not offer you a place in my own office and i cannot pass you on to my friends what else can i do for you  rowan looked into his hat and laughed a little bitterly what the devil else is there anyone can do for me he demanded  i can lend you some money deane said shortly  i shall take it rowan answered but it will be spent pretty soon and i doubt whether youll ever get it back i want a chance to make a fresh start  deane shook his head i cant help you he saidnot in that sort of way at any rate if you wanted to settle down in the country id try and find you a place there  no good rowan answered i want to make money and i want to make it quick  the telephone bell rang and deane was busy for several moments answering questions and giving instructions then he turned once more to his visitor  rowan he said you talk like all the others who come down into the city expecting to find it a sort of eldorado i can do nothing for you how much money shall i lend you stop he said holding out his hand i dont want to seem unkind but i am a busy man i dont want to lend you ten pounds today and have you come and borrow another ten pounds next week and another the week after you and i went through some rough times together weve heard the bullets sing weve known what a licking was like and weve shouted ourselves hoarse with joy when the good time came i dont forget these things man i dont want you for a moment to believe that i have forgotten them ask me for any reasonable sum and ill give it you but afterwards we shake hands and part at any rate so far as the city is concerned you understand  rowan leaned forward in his chair he wetted his dry lips nervously with his tongue the look of illhealth in his features was almost painfully manifest the writing which it is not possible to mistake was on his face  look here deane he said hoarsely dont think i am ungrateful youve put the matter straight to me like a man and if needs be ill ask you for a good round sum and go and ill take my oath youll never see me again but listen i am in a bad way i was in the hospital last week and they told me a few things  i am sorry said deane you shall go away and recuperate when youre feeling stronger you can think about some work  rowan shook his head that isnt it he said im a sick man but im not that kind of invalid i have somewhere about twelve months to liveno more i want somehow or other before i die to make a little money i dont want a fortunenothing of that sortbut i want to make just a little  you have a wife deane asked quietly  rowan shook his head a sister poor little girl shes wearing herself out typing in an office and i cant bear the thought of leaving her all alone with nothing to fall back upon  deane drummed with his fingers upon the table his manner was not unsympathetic but betrayed the slight impatience of a man of affairs discussing an unpractical subject with an unpractical person  my dear rowan he said dont you see that your very illness makes it absurd to imagine that you can take a position and save any amount of money worth mentioning in it in twelve months the idea is absurd  i suppose it sounds so rowan admitted but listen deane you know i have many weak points but i am not a coward i like big risks and i am always willing to take them the doctor gives me twelve monthsthat means i suppose about seven months during which i shall be able to get about and five months of slow torture in a hospital i mention this again so that you can understand exactly how much i value my life isnt there any work you could put me on to where the risk was greatthe greater the betterbut if i succeeded i could make a reasonable sum of money think  deane shook his head my dear rowan he said we are not in africa now you know we are in a civilized city where life and death have no other than their own intrinsic worth  you are sure persisted rowan i dont mind what i do he added in a lower tone ive lived in wild countries and ive lived a wild life my conscience is elastic enough id take on anything in the world which meant money you have great interests under your control you must have enemies sometimes there are enterprises into which a man in your position would enter willingly enough if he could find a partner who would be as silent as the grave and who would risk everythingi mean thatnot only his life but everything on the chance of success  deane shook his head slowly and then stopped a sudden change came into his face he had the air of a man absorbed with an unexpected thought a flickering ray of sunshine had come struggling through the dusty window from the court outside it found its way across deanes desk with its piles of papers and documents it rested for a moment upon his dark thoughtful face rowan watched him eagerly was it his fancy or was there indeed a shadow there greater than the responsibilities of his position might warrant     chapter ii  the purchase   deane looked across the room towards his secretary give me five minutes alone ellison he saidyou and miss ansell there see that i am not interrupted  the young man got up at once and left the room followed by the typist deane waited until the door was closed then he turned once more to his visitor  listen rowan he said do i understand you rightly do you mean that you would be willing to undertake a commission which you would certainly find unpleasant and perhaps dangerous  i do mean that rowan declared beating the palm of one hand with his clenched fist i am a desperate man i have no time for long service for industry for perseverance for any form of success which is to be won by orthodox means i am like a man who has mortgaged every farthing he has in the world to take a thirtyfive to one chance on a number dont you understand i want money and i cant wait i havent time give me a chance of something big remember what i have told you twelve months of suffering life is worth little enough in the balance  you misunderstand me a little deane said slowly what i am going to suggest to you may seem difficult enough and under the circumstances unpleasant but there is no actual riskat least he corrected himself there should be none  rowan laughed scornfully for heavens sake dont pick your words so carefully he begged if the thing is big enough i am not afraid if it is dishonest say so i am not a pickpocket but i am past scruples  once more deane was silent for several moments it was a chance thisjust a chance he looked out of the window and he seemed to see in swift panorama all the splendid details of his rise to power he saw himself as the central figure of that panoramarespected honored envied wherever he went east or west it was a life his for a man to be proud of there was no one who had a word to say against himno one who did not envy him his rapid climb up the great ladder he carried power in both hands so that when he moved even amongst the great people of the world a place was found for him he realized in that one moment what it might mean to lose these things and he drew a little breath he must fight to the end make use of any means that came to his hand it was a chance this only a chance but he would take it  listen rowan he said turning once more to the man who had been watching him so eagerly i am taking you at your word i am believing that you mean exactly what you say  god knows i do rowan muttered  very well then deane continued i want you to understand this the company of which i am managing director owns as you may have heard the greatest goldfields in the world our chief possession though is the little anna goldmine which was once as you may have heard my property and for which the corporation paid me a very large sum of money did you ever hear anything of the history of the little anna goldmine rowan  rowan nodded it was a deserted claim which you and some others had a shy at dick murray was one of them that brute sinclair put you on to it  deane nodded you have spoken the truth rowan he said it was a deserted claim four of us took possession but the other three never knew what i knew i bought up their shares one by one i wont go into the matter of law now i simply want you to understand this the mine grew and prospered what it has become you know i sold it to this corporation as i wished to have no outside interests and the price paid me was close upon a million sterling three days ago in this room the man whom you have just spoken ofrichard sinclairproduced documents and tried to convince me that he was the real owner of the little anna goldmine that it had never been deserted and that our taking possession of it was nothing more nor less than an illegal jump  rowan was plainly amazed but it was sinclair he exclaimed who gave you the tip  deane nodded that he said may have been part of his scheme he hadnt the money or the patience to work it himself and it may have occurred to him that if he could get someone else to do all the work believing that they had acquired the mine it might be worth his claiming afterwards i have weighed it all up deane continued i have been to some mining lawyers and i have spent a small fortune in cabling to the cape the conclusion i have come to is this if sinclair prosecutes his claimand he means businessand goes to law there is just a reasonable chance that he might win  a reasonable chance rowan repeated  it isnt only that though continued deane there are other things to be taken into consideration we dont want a lawsuit several of our smaller mines are doing rather badly just now and we have been spending an immense amount of money upon developments any suspicion as to the validity of our title to the little anna mine would be simply disastrous at the present moment our shares would have a tremendous drop just at the time when we are least prepared for it  where do i come in rowan asked quietly  sinclair deane said has only been in the country three days he has no friends he drinks most of the day and he is staying at the universal hotel where i imagine that he spends most of his time at the american bar now i cant treat with the fellow rowan thats the trouble if i were to show the least sign of weakness the game would be up my only chance was bluff i laughed in his face and turned him out of the office but bluff doesnt alter facts you and he are old acquaintances i know very well that you never hit it off together although i never knew what was the cause of your quarrel however theres nothing to prevent your going to see him hes in that sort of maudlin state when hed welcome anybody whod drink with him and let him talk that is where you come in rowan you can drink with him and listen find out whether this is a putup thing or whether he believes in it  rowan nodded anything else he asked in a low tone  there is no reason deane continued why you should not if he gets confidential open up negotiations on your own account  he has some documents i suppose rowan asked  his claim to our mine deane answered is contained in a single paper which he told me never left his person you were a lawyer once rowan you know how to argue to handle facts to make a bargain the return of that document to me would be worth ten thousand pounds  rowans breathing seemed suddenly to have become worse his lips were parted there was a strange glitter in his eyes ten thousand pounds he muttered  it is a great deal of money i know deane said but understand this rowan once and for all if this enterprise appeals to you you must undertake it absolutely and entirely at your own risk above all things it is important that neither sinclair nor anyone else in the world should ever dream that i had been behind any offer you might make or any course of action which you might pursue all that i say to you is that i am willing to give ten thousand pounds for that document  ten thousand pounds rowan muttered it would be enoughmore than enough  if you fail continued deane and find yourself in trouble i know nothing of you i shall not raise a finger to help you i demand from you your word of honor that you do not mention my name that you deal with sinclair simply as a speculative financier disposed to be his friend remember that the slightest association of my name with yours would give him the clue to the whole thing and would mean ruin here on the other hand before you go if you tell me that you are going heart and soul into this enterprise i shall give you five hundred pounds some of this you will need for clothes to make a presentable appearance and to be able to entertain sinclair and play your part as a capitalist if you fail you can keep the balance as a loan or a gift whichever you like now you can take your choice i am placing a good deal of confidence in you but i think that i know my man  rowan struck the end of the table with his hand yes you do deane he declared looking at him with kindling eyes you do know him indeed if i were to die tomorrow dick sinclair is the one man in the world i should die hating he served me a shabby trick once and ive never forgotten it perhaps rowan addedperhaps i may now turn the tables upon him  no mention of my name mind deane repeated emphatically  rowan held out his hand i take my chance deane he said and on my honor ill play the game     chapter iii  a family affair   a few hours later stirling deane sat at a small round diningtable side by side with the father of the girl to whom he had been engaged for exactly three days his hostess the countess of nunneley and her daughter lady olive had only just left them it had been a dinner absolutely en famille  draw up your chair deane and try some of this port lord nunneley said  thank you replied deane ill finish my champagne if i may  just as you like his host answered i notice you are very careful never to mix deane perhaps you are right theres nothing like being absolutely fit and you fellows in the city must have a tremendous lot on your minds sometimes i suppose however prosperous you are you never have a day without a certain amount of anxiety  never deane assented quietly  lord nunneley who had a great reputation as a peer of marked sporting proclivities crossed his legs and leaning back in his chair lit a cigarette  i never thought he continued that i should be glad to give olive to anyoneto anyoneyou wont mind if i say itoutside our own immediate circle of course i know your people were all right ive ridden to hounds with your father many a time but when a family drifts into the city one naturally loses sight of them you will find me a model fatherinlaw though deane i never borrow money i wouldnt be a director of a public company for anything in the world and i havent a single relation for whom i want a berth  deane smiled his manner was natural enough but only he knew how difficult he found it to continue this sort of conversationto keep his attention fixed upon the somewhat garrulous utterances of his prospective fatherinlaw  you are very wise to steer clear of all that sort of thing sir he said the city is no place for men who have not been brought up to it and the days of guineapig directors are over  lord nunneley nodded my lawyers have been making inquiries about you today deane he said you insisted on my doing so so i let them although it was more for your satisfaction than mine according to their report you seem to have rather underestimated your position they tell me that yours is one of the richest corporations in the mining world and that you yourself are very wealthy  deane inclined his head slowly he leaned across the table and helped himself to a cigarette a few nights ago he could have listened to such a speech with a feeling of genuine satisfaction now everything seemed changed the rock upon which he had stood seemed to have become a shifting quicksand dick sinclair was a blackmailer and a thief he told himself with a fierce desire to escape from the shadow which seemed somehow to have settled upon him the document he had brandished was not worth the paper it was written on his attack even if he ventured to make it could prove no more venomous than the sting of an insect yet the shadow remained deane for the first time possibly in his life felt that his nerve had temporarily gone it was all that he could do to sit still and listen to his companions easy talk  of course i am glad enough for olive to marry a rich man especially as her tastes seem to run that way lord nunneley continued but i tell you frankly that i shouldnt have fancied a marriage for money pure and simple i am not a wealthy man but i can keep my places going pretty comfortably and i dont know the meaning of a mortgage olive will have her thousand a year settled upon her for life when she marries and something more when i die in a sense its nothing of course but it will help pay for her frocks  i am sure you are very generous deane murmured i had not even considered the question of dowry so far as olive was concerned  lord nunneley nodded as i remarked just now he went on i should have hated the idea of a marriage for money pure and simple i have seen you ride to hounds deane as well as any man i know and theres no one id sooner trust to bring down his birds at an awkward corner than you that sort of thing counts you know i always meant to have a sportsman for a soninlaw and i am thankful that your city life hasnt spoiled you for the other things by the way how old are you deane  i shall be forty my next birthday deane answered  his host nodded well he said you wont want to go wearing yourself out making more millions surely why dont you retire and buy an estate  i have thought of it deane answered i mean to take things easier at any rate after my marriage  lord nunneley sipped his wine reflectively i have never done a stroke of work all my life he remarked beyond looking after my agents accounts which i have never been able to understand and trying a little scientific farming by which i have invariably lost money i do respect a man though who has been through the mill and held his own and against whom no one has a word to say at the same time deane he added dont stick at it too long if youll forgive my mentioning it you dont look quite the man you did even two or three years ago  i am a little run down deane said i am going to take a holiday in a few weeks  you are coming to us in scotland of course said lord nunneley but holiday or no holiday take my advice and even if you have to sacrifice a bit dont stay in harness too long the money you cant spend isnt worth a snap of the fingers you and olive could live on the interest of what you have and theres scarcely a thing you need deny yourselves  deane hesitated for a moment that is true enough he said but it is never quite so easy when one is involved in things as i am to escape from them the devil spider spins a golden web to catch us mortals and its hard work to get out of it i am afraid that my shareholders would consider themselves very much aggrieved if i sent in my resignation without at least a years warning  a year lord nunneley remarked reflectively well i should feel quite satisfied if i thought that you were going to chuck it then dont misunderstand me deane he went on please dont for a moment believe that i am such an arrant snob as to mind having a soninlaw whos engaged in business i look upon yours as a jolly fine position and i can assure you that i have a sincere respect for a man who has attained to it at your age it is simply that i fancy you are carrying a much heavier burden than you sometimes realizesimply for your own sake and olives that i would like to hear of your taking things more easily  i understand deane saidi quite understand you are really very kind lord nunneley even if it is impossible for me to escape just for the moment i can assure you that i shall take the first opportunity of doing so  the butler with an apologetic bow came softly across the room and delivered a message lady olive was going to a party and would be glad if mr deane could come into the drawingroom at once     chapter iv  a murder   deane with the air of one who was an habitué to the house found his way to the drawingroom where lady olive was seated before the piano playing softly she rose as he entered and came to meet him  i have barely a quarter of an hour stirling she said it was too absurd of you to be sitting there talking to father all the time come and say nice things to me mother has gone upstairs to put on her tiara  he held her at arms length for a moment looking at her she was not very tall but she was graceful and she carried herself as the women of her family had done since the days of elizabeth her face was a little cold except when she smiled and her eyes were large and brilliant there was about her toilette and her features a sort of trim perfection which left no room for criticism she was considered amongst those whom she called her friends handsome rather than beautiful and ambitious rather than affectionate nevertheless she blushed most becomingly when deane stooped to kiss her and her face certainly seemed to lose for the time its somewhat cold expression  you are going to the waldrons i suppose he remarked you look charming dear  she made a little grimace its too bad that you wont be there however in a few days that will be all right now that our engagement is announced everyone will send you cards of course for everywhere i go  he smiled a little doubtfully you wont expect too much of me in that way will you he asked my afternoons for instance are nearly always occupied  you will not find me exacting she said with a reassuring nod i dont expect you to play the part of social butterfly at all and although we must be seen together sometimes of course i havent the least desire to keep you dangling at my heels tell me what has father been talking to you about  he has been urging me to leave the city deane said and buy an estate  lady olive looked thoughtful that is very interesting she said  what have you to say about it he asked  it depends she answered very much upon circumstances i am not sure that i approve of a man having nothing whatever to do besides i have no idea how rich you are stirling i think i ought to warn you that i am very extravagant  i am delighted to hear it he assured her i should dislike a wife who wouldnt spend my money  they were sitting side by side upon a sofa and she toyed with her fan for several moments then she held out her right hand to him and allowed it to remain in his grasp for lady olive this was distinctly a loverlike proceeding she was not at all sure in her own mind whether such a liberty was judicious having been brought up always to consider any display of affection as utterly bourgeois  it seems a curious question to ask she said thoughtfully but after all it would be only affectation to pretend that i was not interested tell me what your income isabout stirling  in round figures he answered it is today i should think a trifle over twentyfive thousand a year  she nodded approvingly and yet without a great deal of enthusiasm we ought to be able to make that do she said do you mean that it would be as much as that if you gave up business perhaps you could give it up partially and keep a few directorships or something of that sort  i could not give up my work at all he told her for two years i get a very large income from my company and i have an agreement with them besides my own interests are so woven up with theirs that i could not run the risk of having anyone at the head of affairs in whom i had not complete confidence  she nodded that is quite reasonable she admitted you get holidays of course  naturally he answered  there was a short silence lady olive was half inclined to wonder why having possessed himself of her hand he made none of the other overtures which she had always understood were usual deane however was in no humor for lovemaking she had represented to him only a few days ago a part of his future life which was altogether inevitable and which he could easily come to find pleasant enough but just now there seemed to be a barrier between them notwithstanding lord nunneleys kindness and his wifes approval he knew very well that it was not only stirling deane who had been accepted as a suitor it was the millionaire the man of great affairs the man of untarnished reputation dick sinclairs threats were still ringing in his ears he somehow felt that he was not even playing the game to be sitting there holding the hand of this most exclusive young lady  you are a little quiet tonight she remarked  perhaps he answered smiling i am a little shy  she was inclined to take his words seriously there had been moments before their engagement when he had certainly looked at her in a very different manner when she had realized that if she really did say yes to him she might find herself in danger of having to submit to something a little more vigorous than the ordinary lovemaking she knew anything of she had even made up her mind with a faint blush to submit to ithad grown to expect it somehow although she would have found the admission distinctly humiliating she was a trifle disappointed  i wonder she whispered looking down upon the carpet if you needif you really need encouragement  she felt a sudden thrill as his arm touched her a sudden sense of his enveloping presence then the door opened and she withdrew herself quickly the countess came into the room a curious replica of her daughter except that her hair was gray and the light in her eyes a little steelier  so sorry you are not going with us she remarked to deane inquire if the brougham is waiting she continued turning to her maid no dont bother stirling she added as he moved toward the door we are really in plenty of time  lord nunneley came in with the evening paper in his hand  is there any news george his wife asked  he shook his head there never is he answered the evening papers arent worth looking at now shocking murder by the bye at one of the big hotels  deane turned slowly round a murder he repeated  his host nodded as he lit a cigarette fellow just arrived in the country he remarkedsupposed to have had a lot of money in his pocket found dead in his room at about seven oclock tonight  do you remember the name of the hotel asked deane  lord nunneley glanced at the paper which he still held in his hand the universal he answeredthat huge new place you know near the strand  was the murderer caught deane asked  arrested just as he was leaving the hotel lord nunneley answeredat least they arrested the man they thought had done it heres the paper if you have a taste for horrors  deane stood perfectly still for several minutes lady olive was buttoning her gloves and did not notice him her mother was standing at the further end of the room helping herself to coffee lord nunneley alone was conscious of the change in his guests expression  nothing wrong i hope deane he asked you didnt know the fellow by any chance did you  deane shook his head he spoke very quietly and very distinctly except that he was unusually pale his manner showed no signs of emotion and yet all the time he felt that he was being stifled in his ears was the singing of tragedy  no he said i never heard of him in my life  he crossed the room to help lady olive with her cloak  stay and have a smoke with me lord nunneley suggested i am going round to the club in about an hours time and then i am going to pick these people up at a ball somewhere  you are very kind deane answered to tell you the truth i have just remembered a very important letter which i ought to have written if you will excuse me i am going to hurry away at once i should like to catch my secretary before he leaves  lord nunneley nodded you will have to get him to give it up he said to his daughter fancy having to write a business letter at ten oclock at night perfect slavery  shall i see you tomorrow stirling lady olive asked walking with him into the hall  well lunch if you like he said or shall i come to tea i shall not be busy much after noon  i am not quite sure what i have to do tomorrow she answered but i think that i would rather that you came here well meet sometime anyhow goodbye  he raised her fingers to his lips enjoy yourself he said  she shrugged her shoulders absolutely a duty dance she murmured waving her hand i know that i shall be bored to death by the bye stirling dont forget that in about three weeks time i want you to give a luncheon party at the carlton to julia and her husband and some of the others  as soon as you like deane answered  julia wont be back till then lady olive said au revoir     chapter v  a debt incurred   a little stream of people came suddenly out from the dark forbiddinglooking building into the sunlit street the tragedy was over and one by one they took their several ways and were swallowed up in the restless life of the great city yet there was not one of them who did not carry in his face some trace of those hours of gloomy excitement some reminiscent shadow of the tragedy which had spread itself out into passionate life before their eyes the most callous was conscious of a few minutes unusual gravity some of the more impressionable carried with them the memory of that hot crowded room the air of tense excitement the slowly spoken solemn words throughout that day and many days to come  and may the lord have mercy upon your soul  there was one man who issued from the building and made his way into the street who seemed altogether dazed his lips were drawn tightly together his eyes were set in an unseeing stare it was not until he had walked fifty yards or so that he seemed even to realize where he was then he came to a sudden standstill and retraced his steps standing outside the building which he had just quitted was a small electric brougham in front of which he stopped he glanced at his watch it was a few minutes past one oclock all around was the great stream of city men and clerks hurrying to their midday meal once more as he stood with the handle in his hand he looked back down the dark passage guarded by a single policeman through which he had come a moment or two before the scene in the little courthouse spread itself out with almost hideous precision before his reluctant eyes he saw once more what is certainly the greatest tragedy which the mechanical side of our everyday life can offer to the seeker after sensations he saw a man stand up and listen to the words pronounced which are to deprive him of lifeand may the lord have mercy upon your soul  deane turned to his chauffeur the carlton he said and stepped inside  the brougham glided away swung in and out of the traffic and ran smoothly along the embankment westward deane let down both the windows took off his hat and placed it on the seat opposite him then he drew a small fine cambric handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his forehead  god in heaven he muttered to himself twelve men and not one of them could see the truth twelve men all fools  he took a cigarette from a small gold case and lit it with trembling fingers then he leaned out of the carriage window stop at the métropole richards he ordered  the man was just swinging into northumberland avenue and he pulled up in front of the hotel deane went in hurriedly and made his way to the smokingroom exchanging abrupt greetings with one or two acquaintances there he ordered and drank quickly a large brandyandsoda when he retraced his steps he felt more composed  to the carlton now he ordered hurry please i fancy that i am a little late  in the foyer of the restaurant lady olive came slowly forward to meet him she was beautifully dressed and she wore her clothes with the air of one who has been accustomed to be clad in silk and laces from the days of her cradle she had been a beauty for so long that no one questioned her looks it seemed even incredible that she was twentynine years old one realized that she was of the order of women who refuse to grow oldwomen without nerves unruffled by emotions women who come smiling through the years unconscious devotees of the essential philosophy to deane she had never seemed more desirable than when she greeted him with a slight uplifting of her eyebrows and turned to present him to another man and woman who were standing by  illustration lady olive came slowly forward to meet him  mr deane is going to make the usual excuses i know she declared let us anticipate him and say nothing about our wait we wont even ask whether it was a directors meeting or a message from the governor of the bank of england stirling this is my cousin mary elstree and her husband major elstreemr deane the others are somewhere about what a tiresome person julia is she has drifted away over there with a lot of people whom i dont know that is the worst of taking julia anywhere i think that she would discover acquaintances in an a b c shop do find her stirling no dont bother here she comes  a tall dark woman detached herself from a neighboring crowd and came up to deane with outstretched hands my dear man she exclaimed how dare you look so cool and nonchalant do you realize that we are all starving we have been waiting here for you for more than half an hour  i am sorry answered deane you see you people here have taken to lunching so early nowadays you make it hard for a man to get through any work at all in the city  early lunches have come in with the simpler life julia raynham declared one has so many more hours to look forward to dinner and so much more appetite when it comes i suppose we must forgive you she went on at any rate you are better than my husband who wont come out to lunch at all he says that all restaurant food is poisonous and i cant drag him away from the club why a man should put his digestion before our society i cant imagine i hope you will never be so ungallant mr deane shall we go in olive  if you will excuse me for one moment deane said passing on ahead i will just see that the table is all right i telephoned to gustave but even a maître dhôtel forgets sometimes  he looked into the room and nodded to the presiding genius who came hurrying up the table was there duly reserved and covered with the dark red roses which he had ordered he turned to mrs elstree and the others who were following her  i think we can go in he said i hope you people have not lost all your appetites waiting for me  lady olive looked at him a little curiously as she took the seat at his left hers by unspoken consent as his fiancée my dear stirling she whispered have you had a very trying morning you look somehow as though you had been worried  he hesitated well he answered scarcely that perhaps i had rather a bad hour or so things dont go always our way you know in the city even when one is most prosperous  you are foolish to worry she said calmly half the people in the world spoil their lives by giving way to that sort of thing i should have thought that your temperament would have saved you from that  deane smiled remember he said that i have been in other places when i might have been with you and excuse me  you are much too gallant she said with a little laugh to argue with seriously  by the bye major elstree asked has anyone seen a special edition i wonder if the rowan case is finished  deane set down the wineglass which he had just raised to his lips the verdict was given just as i left the city he answered rowan was found guilty     chapter vi  an imperious demand   there was a little murmur of interest on the whole although the result of the trial had seemed fairly certain everyone was surprised  guilty of murder or manslaughter major elstree asked  of murder answered deane there was not even a recommendation to mercy  lady olive looked reproachfully at him my dear stirling you really shouldnt have told us at luncheon time if i hadnt been so very hungry i am sure it would have taken my appetite away he was such a goodlooking fellow and he has been so brave all through the trial  brave or callous do you think major elstree asked  brave i think julia raynham declared leaning forward in her place i went to the trial the first day he followed every question that was asked and he was always making suggestions to his solicitor i think when one understands like that when ones intellect is working all the time that you cannot call it callousness  i agree with you lady olive declared i was there myself and except that he looked so ill he seemed quite indifferent and absolutely free from nervousness yet i am quite sure that he realized his position my dear stirling how thoughtful of you to remember the homard americaine i adore hot lobster dont you julia  delicious julia murmured  i wonder major elstree said reflectively what must be the state of mind of a man who has gone through a trial lasting four or five days and suddenly realizes that it is over and finished and that he has lost this poor fellow for instance when he woke up this morning he perhaps hoped to be free tonightthings went altogether his way yesterday and instead of being free he has been taken back to his cell and knowseven at this minute he is realizingthat he will never leave it again until he leaves it to die personally he continued i think that the period of time between the pronouncement of a sentence and its execution ought to be swept away i cannot imagine anything more horrible especially to a man who has to spend the long nights alone with that one thought racking his brain  lady olive laid down her fork my dear harry she declared do be a little more considerate how are we to enjoy our luncheon if we think of that poor man  major elstree bowed across the table i forgot he said let us enjoy our luncheon by all means at the same time i am going to drink my first glass of wine to a reprieve we wont discuss the question of whether he deserves it or not we will talk instead if you like of directoire gowns and flying stars chance for the gold cup buti drink my toast  you are very quiet stirling lady olive murmured to the man who sat by her side  deane smiled at her i am afraid that sometimes when i come away from a maze of figures my brain or at any rate my tongue is not so nimble as it should be ill keep pace with you all presently  a frockcoated whitewaistcoated maître dhôtel came smiling up and addressed him confidentially mr deane he said you are wanted for a moment upon the telephone  you are sure that it is i who am wanted deane asked a little doubtfully  quite sure sir the man replied the inquiry was for mr stirling deane  deane rose to his feet you will excuse me he begged turning to his guests i suppose they have found out at the office that i am here and they have probably something to say to me  nevertheless as he left the room and crossed the hall deane was conscious of feeling more than a little puzzled he was quite certain that he had not told a soul at the office of the incorporated goldmines association over which he presided that he was lunching at the carlton he was equally certain that he had not told anyone else he took up the receiver of the instrument with some curiosity  who is it he asked  who are you was the reply  i am stirling deane deane said who are you and what do you want with me is it the office  no was the reply in a voice wholly unfamiliar to him it is not the office mr deane it is someone with news for you  news deane repeated i should like to know who you are first and to hear your news afterwards  who i am is of no consequence was the reply my news is that basil rowan has been found guilty and has been sentenced to be hanged the verdict has just been pronounced  the receiver nearly fell from deanes fingers he restrained himself however with an effort well he said what is that to you or to me  that is a matter which we will not discuss over the telephone was the calm reply i rang you up to tell you this because i thought it was well that you should know quickly i ask you now what you are going to do  deanes was the face of a strong mana man who scarcely knew the meaning of the word nerves yet he felt himself struggling with a sudden sense of being stifled something seemed to be hammering at his brain his breath was coming in little sobs he answered this mysterious voice almost incoherently  what do you mean how can it concern me tell me who you are at once he said  it does not matter who i am was the reply you have no time to think about that what you want to realize is that basil rowan has been found guilty and that he will be hanged within a fortnight unless  unless what deane gasped  unless someone intervenes was the quiet answer  who could intervene he demanded hoarsely how can anyone intervene  you know was the quiet answer  deane staggered out of the telephone box with those last words ringing in his ears he felt dazed scarcely master of himself the healthy color seemed to have been drawn from his cheeks as he turned mechanically back toward the restaurant halfway there however he paused for the moment he felt it impossible to face his guests he turned into the little smokingroom and sat down the place was empty even the little bar was deserted he sat in one of the green leather chairs his hands clutching the cushioned arms his eyes fixed steadily upon the wall slowly it seemed to fall awayto crumble into nothingnessbefore his rigid gaze again he saw the sombrelooking courthouse the judge upon the bench his sphinxlike face set in an attitude of cold attention he saw the barristers with their wigs and gowns the few distinguished strangers upon the bench the crowd of sightseers behind the barriers and in the centre of it allbasil rowan his pale face and drawn features standing out vividly against the gloomy background it was no ordinary trial this the subtle dramatic excitement which only a question of life or death seems to generate was throbbing through the dreary court it was only comparatively speaking a few days ago that the man who stood there now waiting to hear his doom had found his way down into the city and sat in his office and made his passionate appeal deanes hands gripped the sides of the chair and his lips moved he told himself as he had told himself a hundred times before that this act was none of his doing that not a single word of his had suggested or approved of it he had spoken of arguments of influence was it any responsibility of his that the man who had listened had gone furtherhad chosen to gamble instead with life and death deane went back through that conversation word by word no he was guiltless he had not suggested violence he even told himself that he would not have approved of it and yet the weight upon his heart was not lightened the little picture was still there reproduced with almost photographic exactness was it his fancy or had the trembling mans eyes really turned towards himhad his white lips really framed that passionate unspoken appeal which seemed to ring in his ears  deane rose to his feet with a little stifled cry he seemed to understand now how men who were left alone with their thoughts might find madness     chapter vii  love or interest   deane found his little party drinking their coffee in the palm lounge lady olive greeted him with upraised eyebrows  my dear stirling she exclaimed have you been telephoning to the other end of the world  i am so sorry he answered taking the vacant chair by her side i came away from the office feeling that i had forgotten something and it took me quite a long time to straighten things out tell me what are you all going to do this afternoon  we are going down to ranelagh said lady olive there is some tennis and dicky is playing polo in the regimental finals dont you think that you could take an hour or so off and come down with us you really look as though you needed some fresh air  deane shook his head nothing in the world he declared is more impossible i have an appointment in the city at halfpast three and another at four after that i have at least a hundred letters to dictate  i am beginning to discover lady olive remarked with an air of resignation that there are disadvantages in being engaged to a city man  deane smiled let us hope said he that after you are married you will still regard the situation in the same light your friend julia for instance declares that she would never have married anyone who was not kept away from home at regular intervals  lady olive leaned a little towards him after all he had been very nice the elstrees had found him delightful and there was no man in the lounge half so goodlooking she decided to say something charming  julia she whispered was never in love with her husband even before she married him  and you deane murmured  she laughed at him and looked away but he was suddenly insistent taking her hand and forcing her to turn again towards him  tell me he said quietly do you really care for me olive oh i know you care enough to justify you in marrying me but i mean something different i mean do you really care in the great fashion you know like the people one reads oflike iseult and amy robsart and those others  she looked at him as though he were speaking some foreign language the earnestness in his face was unmistakable she answered him with a perplexed little frown upon her forehead ah i wonder she murmured what a very strange question to ask me stirling just now frankly i dont know i can only tell you that there is no other man you are quite alone  the others were all discussing some subject of kindred interest deane felt curiously prompted to continue his questioning his engagement had been such a very matteroffact affair to a certain extent it was understood that he was marrying for position and she for wealth and yet in all their conversations they had discreetly concealed the fact they had told each other that they cared if not with passion at least in the most approved manner there had been no suggestion in their many têteàtêtes that they were about to embark upon a mariage de convenance  tell me deane persisted if things should go wrong with me or if you had met me simply as a struggler with my feet upon the early rungs of the laddertell me could you have cared then do you think  she looked at him curiously there was something in his face which compelled the truth i do not know she said let me think  think by all means he continued remember that i was introduced to you even as one of the youngest millionaires forgive me if i seem egotistical but i have a fancy to put things plainly there is a glamour about wealth i came to you with that glamour about my name i am rich of course and wealth means power how much of your affection olive came out to the man and how much to the millionaire  you want me to give you a perfectly honest answer she asked  absolutely he assured her dont be afraid of hurting my vanity i want nothing but the truth  at first then she told him nothing to the man and everything to the millionaire this afternoon she continued i rather fancy that the man has the larger share you are quite a fascinating person stirling when you choose to make yourself agreeable  you cant accuse me he remarked of making any special efforts in that direction today  no she answered you were rather quiet but still you were yourself personally i am beginning to find something very attractive about a silent man you speak quite often enough and what you say is to the point it seems always to be the pronouncement of the man who knows you have what julia calls an air of reserved strength about you which i fancy that my sex finds a little attractive tell me why all this questioning  deane looked awaythrough the cluster of palms into the little smokingroom from which he had issued a few minutes before  even the houses he said which according to the injunctions of scripture are built upon a rock are liable to destruction by earthquakes so even the strongest of us in the city have always the hundredth chance working in the world against us the most amazing collapses have taken place i was really wondering what would happenhow greatly it would affect youif my riches were to vanish into thin air  what an unpractical person you are this afternoon she murmured looking at him curiously supposing i were to sit here and worry about the fit of the dress which madame oliver is sending me home this afternoon for the ball tonight i could make myself miserable in five minutes without the shadow of a reason  madame oliver he declared would deserve bankruptcy if she failed to fit a figure like yours  lady olive laughed really she said you are becoming quite a courtier  dear people julia raynham murmured leaning over if we may bring you back to the mundane world everybody else is dying to start for ranelagh  lady olive made a little grimace and rose to her feet at once stirling and i have only been boring one another because you all seemed so occupied she declared ranelagh by all means it is quite time we made a move  they made their way toward the pall mall entrance of the restaurant lady olive fell back once more with deane  its such a nuisance about this wretched dinner tonight she said i think it was very bad taste indeed of the duchess to ask us without you you wont forget to come in and see me for halfanhour before we go on to the ball i shall be in my room at eleven oclock punctually and i will arrange so that i can take you on to amberley house  he bowed i shall be with you  where are you dining she asked  at the club most likely i never dine out on wednesdays if i can help it we are always so busy i shall have a quiet comfortable evening  au revoir then she said stepping into one of the two automobiles which were waiting  deane made his adieux to the rest of the party and watched them drive off then he called a hansom  messrs hardaway and sons bedford row he told the man drive as quickly as you can     chapter viii  an awful responsibility   john hardaway although he was a solicitor in a very busy practice did not keep his friend waiting for a moment come in deane old chap he said is this business or friendship  mostly business declared deane  hardaway glanced at the clock twelve minutes precisely he said fire away theres a good fellow you are not going to give me the affairs of the incorporated goldmines association to look after i suppose  not i deane answered they need a more subtle brain than yours i am afraid i have come to see you about the other affair  the lawyer nodded you heard the result he asked we did what we could  perhaps deane answered the only thing is that you did not do enough i am perfectly convinced hardaway that that man did not go there with the intention of murdering sinclair  the evidence hardaway remarked was exceedingly awkward  do you think deane asked that there is any chance of a reprieve  as things stand at present said hardaway i am afraid not  deane for the first time sat down with frowning face he seemed to be engaged in a deliberate study of the pattern of the carpet hardaway he said finally i want to ask you a question in criminal law  the lawyer laughed dryly not on your own account i hope  you can call it curiosity or whatever you like deane answered the only point is that i want you to answer me a question and forget that i have ever asked it you your lawyer is like your confessor isnt heyour lawyer and your doctor  he should be hardaway answered gravely  then here goes deane said i put a case to you i mention no names you can imagine if you like that i am writing a novel a man is tried for murder and he is sentenced to be hanged all the time there has been watching this case listening to every word of the evidence a person who knows quite as much of it as the prisoner himselfsomeone who if it had been possible could have gone into the witness box and could very likely have induced the jury to have reduced the charge from murder to manslaughter never mind the reasons which made that man hold his tongue consider only the fact that he did hold his peace believing in his heart that it was not possible on the evidence which was submitted for the man to be sentenced as it happened the case for the prosecution was worked up with almost diabolical cleverness and the prisoner was found guiltyguilty of murder he was sentenced to be hanged what can this person do to save his life the trial is closed it is too late for him to offer himself as a witness  hardaway nodded i understand he said the procedure is very simple he should go to the solicitors for the defence and they will communicate with the home secretary  the case cannot be reopened deane asked  no answered hardaway with a shake of the head our criminal law has many anomalies the only thing that could happen in the prisoners favor would be that if this favorable evidence were convincing enough the prisoner might be granted a free pardon and the facts made known through the press anything more i can tell you  nothing deane answered rising many thanks old fellow you have told me just what i want to know  sixandeightpence please hardaway remarked holding out his hand  deane laughed and shook his head i shant pay he declared you can run it in with the other account or ill stand you a dinner when and where you pleasea dinner and a box at the alhambra if you like  hardaway smiled we cant run our office on such clients as you he remarked pressing the bell  you should never try to fleece your friends deane said  referring for one moment to the other affair began hardaway  well  the only real chance of a reprieve that i can see hardaway continued is on account of the fellows health i believe he is really very much worse than he appears and i fancy that if we had a medical examination it would give us at least a chance the trouble is that he really seems quite indifferent are you thinking of trying to see him deane  deane shook his head no he said i am afraid i must not do that there are reasons why i dare not let my name be associated in any way with this affair they may come out later on but just at present i would rather not tell even you what they are by the bye has anyone representing the dead man turned up at alli mean has anyone claimed his effects  no one the lawyer answered from what i can learn they are very insignificant  deane nodded can i rely upon you he asked to let me know at once if anyone should come forward to claim them  by all means hardaway answered  deane went out into the street and stood there for a few moments a little aimlessly then he called a cab and was driven to his offices a great block of buildings like a bank situated in a small court off throgmorton street he passed through the outer offices slowly asking several questions and shaking hands with one or two acquaintances when at last he reached the inner room his own sanctum he turned out his secretary ruthlessly and locked the door he sat in his leather chair in front of the open table covered with letters and books of reference it was before this table that he had built up the fortunes of the great corporation at whose head he was he sat there now erect in his chair with his hands stretched out on the table before him and his eyes looking through the frosted panes of glass opposite was there any compromise he asked himselfany possible compromise again he was looking into the gloomy court again he saw the white face of the man who so short a time ago had sat in this very room only a few feet away and had begged so hard for his chance the whole scene came flashing back to deane as he sat there how much of blame after all was his he had not suggested violence he refused even to admit that it had entered into his head yet he had known what manner of men these two were he had known and their meeting had been all his making never in this world would he be able to escape from the responsibility of itnever in this world would he be able to hear those awful words without a sense of real and personal guiltand may the lord have mercy upon your soul     chapter ix  winifred rowan   the clerk who brought in the little slip of paper was both timid and apologetic he felt himself between two fires the young lady outside had been a little more than insistent the man into whose presence he had come was one who never forgave a mistake  you will pardon me sir he said i hope that i have not done wrong the young lady outside positively declined to go away until she had seen you i thought that i had better at least bring you in her name i remembered that a few weeks ago you saw a gentleman of the same name although it was one of your busiest mornings  deane held out his hand frowning a young lady he remarked shortly well  he took the little slip of paper into his hands and readwinifred rowan he looked up into the clerks impassive face and back again at the slip of paper the young lady is waiting outside he asked  she is outside sir the clerk answered i explained to her that you were not in the habit of seeing any callers except by appointment and i begged her to write and fix a time if she really had business with you she declared however that the matter was an urgent one mr sawday and i both heard what she had to say sir and we thought it best that i should bring you in her name  deane nodded slowly i daresay you were right gray he said since the young lady is so persistent you had better show her in see that i am not disturbed again this afternoon however i have a good deal to do  the clerk departed with a great weight off his mind it was obvious that he had done the right thing he left the door ajar and deane sat with his hands clenching the sides of his luxuriously padded writing chair winifred rowan it was a relative thenmost likely the sister of whom he had spoken what was he to say or do how much was he to admit perhaps she had brought him a message perhaps she could tell him the one thing which he was on fire to know winifred rowan half unconsciously he uttered the name aloud what sort of a woman would she be or girl or child he had no knowledge of rowan save as a fellow adventurer a seeker after fortune in a strange land a brave man willing always to take his life into his hands if the goal were worthy perhaps it might be that she had been with him perhaps she was bringing a message  he heard the murmur of voices outside the door was pushed open the clerk stood on one side  this is the young lady sir he announcedmiss winifred rowan  deane rose for a moment to his feet the clerk with a little deferential movement closed the door and departed they were alone in the room together deane whose selfcontrol was one of the personal characteristics which had counted for something in his rapid access to prosperity felt a nerveless exclamation break from his lips the girl who came so slowly into the room seemed so perfectly to represent what rowan himself might have become she was an idealized likeness of the man by whose side he had fought and suffered and rejoiced the man who only a few weeks ago had stood in her place and made his desperate appealan idealized likeness perhaps in more ways than one she was younger and the stress of life had only lately set its mark upon her she was fair as he was fair with grayblue eyes brown hair and quivering lips a figure slim and yet pliant a manner even in silence appealingenticing deane felt himself curiously moved at the sight of her then he remembered suddenly how great was his need of selfcontrol she was the sister of this man who lay under sentence of death perhaps she had come to plead for his help he must be careful all the time he must be careful  you wish to see me he asked a little brusquely i am stirling deane will you take a chair and tell me in as few words as you can what you want  she ignored his gesture of invitation she came on until she had reached the table before which he was seated then she leaned across and the light of her eyes the very insistence of her presence seemed like things from which no escape was possible  mr deane she said i am basil rowans sister i have come from the old bailey prison i have come she added with faltering voice and a sudden new terror in her face from the condemned cell  deane had a reserve stock of courage to draw upon and he drew upon it freely he looked at her with upraised eyebrows you have come to me he repeated why  first of all then she answered i will tell you why  i think he interrupted that you had better take a seat  she seemed indeed in need of some support she sank into the chair which he had indicated it was close to his side and yet placed so that the light which fell upon her face left him in the shadow  you have come from your brother he said do i understand that he sent youthat he knew you were coming to me  yes she answered he told me to be very careful to be sure that no one else knew and never to mention your name but i have come at his bidding  very well deane said i shall be glad to hear your message  he gave me no explanation she said he allowed me to ask for none he told me to come to you and say this there is no one she asked in a lower tone looking nervously around who could possibly overhear us  not a soul  he told me to say she continued leaning forward and with her eyes suddenly a little distended that he had no difficulty in finding the man of whom you two had spokenthe man whom you used to call bully sinclair he spent the evening with him drank with him went back to his hotel by invitation then he tried very carefully to open up negotiations sinclair became at once suspicious he was very violent and declined to discuss the matter at all he swore all the time that he had been robbed and that he was going to have his revenge my brother tried to reason with him and in the end they quarrelled it was sinclair who struck basil my brother only returned the blow and then he told me to say that before he could search him before he could search the room he found that the man was dead  anything else deane asked  he told me to say that any papers which the man sinclair might have had must be in the room among his effects which have all been put together and are still there locked up waiting for someone to come and claim them he told me to say that he had done his best and that whatever the consequences might be he was ready to face them if you cared to run risks the number of the room at the universal hotel is 27 it is locked and guarded but there might be ways that is what he said  deane leaned a little forward across the table but of himself he demanded did he say nothing of himself  she shook her head it is wonderful she said but he never thinks of himself he is more composed more cheerful than when i bade him goodnight at southampton the day he left home he made me promise that i would tell you these things first before i uttered a word on my own account i have kept my promise you understand what i have told you  perfectly deane answered  then i am going to speak to you now on my own account she said raising her eyes to his mr deane i do not pretend to be a clever person but one thing is perfectly clear to me basil entered into this adventure for your sake your name was never mentioned in the trial and they all seem to have believed that it was to rob sinclair and for nothing else that basil went there that night mr deane i dont believe it his quarrel with sinclair and its awful termination was an accident you must come forward and say that he went there to serve you and not for purposes of robbery it is for you to save his life you can do it and he is my only brother  deanes eyebrows came a little closer together the girl who looked at him wondered no more at the hopeless way in which her brother had spoken of this man his face was as though it were carved out of a stone  miss rowan he said if there is anything which i can do for your brother i will do it for the sake of the days when we lived together and when we were so near the very heart of life and death but i tell you frankly that i see very little chance of successful intervention on my part it takes a good deal in this country to stay the arm of the law and your brother has grievously offended against it  she struck the table before which he sat with the palm of her hand if he did she cried it was for your sake i am sure of it he went to do your bidding and you must save him  may i ask said deane why you are so sure that he went to do my bidding  yes ask if you will and i will answer you i know it because this was the real point of all his message to you this was what i had to say this is really why i have come the documentthe document mindhe said no more but he told me to make this very clear to youthe document is in a worn leather case sewn inside the breast pocket of the coat sinclair was wearing when he died  deane drew a little breath young lady he said it seems to me that you have been unnecessarily prolix your brother sent you here to tell me this  yes  he did not send you here deane continued to beg for helpto waste my time in purposeless recriminations  no she answered faintly  he knew very well deane continued that no mortal man can help him the trial is over and the case is lost the only thing to work for now is a reprieve  but that is not what i want she interrupted he must be pardoned  that answered deane is impossible neither i nor anyone breathing can work miracles  she leaned towards him with accusing eyes but it was you she declaredit was you for whom he undertook this enterprise  deane shrugged his shoulders my dear young lady he said you are mistaken i cannot explain to you yet the full significance of those various messages which you have brought me from your brother but believe me what he did he did knowing well the risks he undertook and without any thought or hope of aid from me if he should fail i will be quite honest with you if you like i will tell you the exact truth your brother and sinclair were once friends sinclair and i were always enemies there was a little matter of business open between us and i thought that your brother might very well arrange it i had no idea of his quarrelling with sinclair i did not encourage him to do so in any way  you sent him there she persisted doggedly  i send messengers to every part of the world deane answered but i do not incite them to enter into murderous quarrels with the people whom they go to see i will do what i can for your brother but it must be in my own way  you will be able at least to save him fromfrom  deane held out his hand of course he answered you need not think about that his health alone would be sufficient to put that out of the question what i can do for him i will i promise you that  the girl rose up and held out her hands a little piteously remember she begged i have no one else to go to no other hope but in you if i lose basil i shall be alone in the world  the tears were in her eyes every line of her face every feature seemed to be pleading with him deane led her to the door himself his tone was unusually kind  i will do my best he promised once more     chapter x  at the theatre   the door had barely closed upon his visitor when deane was back once more in the throes of business answering questions giving quotations receiving offers the telephone was reconnected and rang out its impatient summons every few seconds he signed halfadozen drafts deputed an understudy to receive some of his visitors who were weary of waiting and dictated several important letters when once more the pressure had abated and the telephone had ceased to ring he leaned back in his chair with a little exclamation of relief the visit of rowans sister and her passionate appeal had unnerved him for a moment he found himself trying to recall her last words even at the moment when he realized that she was still in the room sitting at a distant corner  miss rowan he exclaimed why i thought that you had left  i went as far as the outer office she said apologetically and then i slipped back again you were so busy that i did not like to interrupt  deane rose to his feethe was a little cramped from long sitting he lowered the blind and turned on the electric light walking around the room and casually touching the door to see that it was closely shut then he came back to his place and leaned over once more toward the girl why have you come back he asked  to ask you a question she answered  well  basil went on your behalf to see this man sinclair she said he had a commission from you had he not and he failed  yes deane said he failed  it was to make an offer for some document was it not  deane nodded yes he said it was  you are doing your best for basil she said her voice trembling a little you paid for his defence i know you have promised that you will do all that you can even now i thought perhaps i might be able to do something in return why couldnt i get this paper for you  he looked at her steadily for several moments you could he answered if you had the pluck  tell me how she asked  you are his sister he said presumably you are interested in his defence the details of the struggle between those two are of course important it makes all the difference between manslaughter and murder if a weight for instance be held in the hand or thrown you know the lawyers who defended him  of course she answered go on  if they apply to the proper authorities he continued they can obtain an order to reexamine the apartments in the universal hotel in which the struggle took place no doubt you also could find your way there supposing i tell you the truth supposing i admit that your brother did take upon himself a desperate enterprise and that that enterprise was to recover from this man sinclair by purchase or guile or any means which suggested themselves to him the pocketbook of which you have brought me news remember i commit myself to nothing i make no definite statement i simply tell you that it may have been so  it was she said firmly you and i know that well  you are his sister deane said and you have exceptional facilities if you could gain possession of that pocketbook you would be doing me a service which i should find it hard indeed to repay  she rose to her feet very well she said it shall be done i promise you that it shall be done  for the first time when he saw her standing up and realized how frail a creature she really was a wave of pity swept away his own predominant sense of selfinterest  but you are not strong enough for such work as this he declared better let things drift i can take care of myself  she shook her head i have made up my mind she said i am going to make my effort whatever happens  you will remember he said that my name must never pass your lips no dont look at me like that he added quickly dont think of me as a coward or an utterly selfish person i am here for what i represent welfare in this concern or business undertakingcall it what you likedoesnt mean only ruin or wealth for me there are hundreds of us hundreds who are dependent upon the reins i hold it isnt for myself so much that i care try and believe that will you  she looked into his eyes i will she murmured i will believe everything but you must save basil  whether you bring me the pocketbook or not he answered i shall assuredly do all that a man can do for him                                       for the rest of the day stirling deane was his normal self he transacted business with his usual acumen he received his callers and went through the ordinary routine of his position with no indication of any mental disturbance he had indeed little time to spare for thought at halfpast six he was whirled away westward in his electric brougham changed his clothes dined hurriedly in his room and at a quarter to nine was in the stalls of the st james theatre sitting between lady olive and her mother the mechanical part of the days arrangements he had found it easy enough to carry out but to keep his thoughts engrossed upon his surroundings was a sheer impossibility he was not even conscious when the curtain went down until he found lady olives eyes fixed curiously upon him  stirling she said i dont think i like you when you have been at the office all day tell me what can there be about this moneymaking so engrossing that you carry it about with you after you have finished your work like a shadow  he was at once duly apologetic my dear olive he said if i was distrait for a moment please forgive me consider it is not my occupation alone which is engrossing supposing for instance that i were a politician dont you think that i should be better employed in thinking over an impending crisis than in listening to an exceedingly dull play  perhaps she admitted but crises do not occur in political affairs every day i might even be vain enough to suggest another and a simpler means of escape from your boredom  i am very justly rebuked he admitted holding her fingers for a moment only you must remember that it is new for me to have so delightful a means of escape ready by my side give me a little time to realize my good fortune  so long as it doesnt become a habit she murmured i am sure i am not exacting but i should hate to feel that you were always so engrossed in your thoughts that you did not even realize whom you were sitting next  he touched her fingers once more and his pressure was gently returned then as if conscious that she had been a little more than ordinarily complacent she withdrew her hand and leaning over began to talk with her mother about some people whom deane knew nothing of a man from behind touched him on the shoulder he looked up quickly and recognized hardaway  come and have a cigarette the lawyer said it is a quarter of an hours interval and i should like to have a word with you  deane excused himself to his companions and joined his friend in the foyer well he asked tersely  hardaway toyed with a cigarette case and glanced quietly around he was tall and thin cleanshaven with hard pronounced features and sunken eyes gray hair parted in the middle and a single eyeglass suspended around his neck by a narrow black ribbon he looked exactly what he wasa criminal lawyer  i wanted to have a word with you deane he said about this rowan case  deane nodded is there anything fresh he asked  nothing particular the lawyer answered come upstairs for a moment  they found a corner of the refreshment room where no one else was within hearing deane lit his cigarette with perfectly steady fingers there was nothing in his face to indicate the fierce anxiety which was consuming him  with reference to that case his companion commenced the facts were all so simple that there was no need for the prosecution to consider any other motive than the obvious one of attempted robbery therefore no very searching investigation has been made into the dead mans papers yesterday afternoon it occurred to me to look them through once more in case anything had been overlooked i came across a clumsy sort of document purporting to be the deeds of a goldmine i should not have taken any particular notice of it but for the title of the mine  well  it was the little anna goldmine hardaway continued these deeds stated that sinclair himself was the sole owner  a very extraordinary document deane remarked i suppose you couldnt manage things so that i could have a look at it  it would be quite impossible the lawyer answered mine was of course a privileged inspection and i am going beyond my duty in mentioning this affair to you it certainly did seem very singular  especially deane remarked with a faint hard smile since you are in a position to know that i have paid for the defence of the prisoner  it is not my business to connect such facts the lawyer remarked  someone will appear upon the scene sooner or later of course deane said and claim this mans effects  naturally hardaway answered although except for this rather remarkable document they do not seem to have been very valuable  if you should hear of anyone said deane i should be glad if you would let me know without a seconds delay  i will do so the lawyer promised  the bell tinkled the men at the bar finished their drinks threw away their cigarettes and hurried off deane and his companion rose to their feet  hardaway deane said some of the papers are talking about a reprieve for this man rowan will it come to anything do you think  i do not know the lawyer answered cautiously  they moved along the passage leading down to the stalls deane held his companion back until the little throng of hurrying men had passed by  listen hardaway he said i speak to you as one speaks to the dead because you know the secrets of your profession and because i trust you is there any way in which a man of great wealth who had the command of money say up to fifty thousand poundsis there any way in which such a man could help towards obtaining a reprieve  hardaway hesitated for a moment of course he admitted influence is always a useful thing those who have the ruling of these matters are sometimes hesitating between two minds a very straw might turn the balance  deane nodded his head he looked for a moment behind his hand rested upon the curtain which led into the stalls there was not a soul in sight the play had recommenced  hardaway he said i will give fifty thousand pounds if necessary to have that man reprieved the verdict should have been one of manslaughter i am convinced of that i was in court i heard the sentence i saw rowans face i saw the judge put on the black cap and i heard those hateful words up to fifty thousand pounds mind hardaway and i shant have your bill of costs taxed  lady olive was almost petulant what a time you have been stirling she said  do forgive me he begged i met a man outside who kept me gossiping about trifles tell me do you think that we can persuade your mother to come out to supper  weve nowhere else to go lady olive answered do see if you can talk her into it it would be very pleasant  ill try he promised     chapter xi  an appeal   a morning paper apparently in lack of a new sensation suddenly took up the cause of basil rowan an evening paper conducted under the same auspices promptly followed suit this was a case they both declared of obvious manslaughter the evidence clearly pointed to a quarrel between the two men a prominent criminal lawyer allowed his name to be associated with what rapidly grew to be an agitation petitions began to appear the home secretary was bombarded with documents everywhere people were saying that the man should never have been put on his trial for murder the jury had been confused by their instructions it was a case of manslaughter pure and simple  three days after her first visit winifred rowan sat once more in deanes office there were lines underneath her eyes she seemed to have become thinner and more fragile deane himself save that he was a trifle paler was unchangedcarefully dressed as usual and with unruffled demeanor he sat in his accustomed place and guided the destinies of those great affairs which lay under his control for the moment he had relaxed he was doing his best to console the girl who had come to him in a sudden whirl of terror  my dear miss rowan he said i have certain intelligence from my friends i have gone to great lengths in this matter and i can assure you that there is not the slightest doubt about a reprieve being forthcoming  she glanced at the calendar but think she said already for three days he has lain there sentenced to death think of what he must be suffering oh it is horrible it isnt only death she cried think of the manner of itthe hideous disgrace the cruel cold ugliness of it oh if it should come  he held out his hand she was on the verge of hysteria it shall not come he declared firmly i have promised you that  if they are going to reprieve him she continued why do they let him suffer these agonies why do they not tell him so at once i saw him this morning he says nothing he is as brave as a man can be but his eyes are awful and when he tries to speak his voice dies away oh mr deane do something oh do something  she laid her hands suddenly upon his shoulders he took them gently in his  my dear miss rowan i am doing everything that man can do believe me that i am i only wish that your brother had done as he threatened and walked into the river before he came to me  she went away at last deane lay back in his chair feeling absolutely unfit for work twice he laid his hand upon the telephone and twice he withdrew it then he turned to his secretary who had just entered the room  get mr hardaway upon the telephone he directed i want to speak to him  in a few moments the bell of the instrument by his side tinkled he put the receiver to his ear  is that hardaway he asked  yes was the answer  this is stirling deane you remember the subject of our conversation the other night at the theatre i am referring now to the matter of documents of which you spoke  i remember hardaway answered  in whose possession are those documents at the present moment deane asked  in whose possession hardaway repeated do you mean  i mean have they been sent to scotland yard or are they still in that lockedup room at the universal hotel  there was a moments pause then hardaway answered to the best of my belief he said they are still in the room at the hotel they may be removed to scotland yard at any time though  no one has yet claimed sinclairs effects then asked deane  no one was the answer  deane was on the point of ringing off but hardaway suddenly put a question to him shall you be in your office for ten minutes mr deane  for longer than that deane answered  i am coming around the lawyer said i hope you can spare me a moment  deane set down the telephone with a frown perhaps his question had been a clumsy one or was hardaway already suspicious he welcomed the lawyer when he arrived a little coldly  five minutes please he said i have a large mail to go through and an early dinnerparty tonight  the lawyer nodded i dont want to detain you deane he said send your secretary away for a moment theres a good fellow what i have to say can be said in halfadozen words if we are alone  deane pointed to the door one moment if you please ellison he said get everything ready for me that you can  the two men were alone hardaway who had not taken a seat deliberately drew off his glove and tapped the table with his fingertips  deane he said have you any idea of paying a visit to the universal hotel  deane met him on his own ground coolly and with perfect selfpossession i have not made up my mind he said it might be worth it  it wouldnt the lawyer said theres nothing haphazard about the way these things are conducted theres a detective watching number 27 day and night  it occurred to me deane remarked that as there is no mystery about this affair scotland yard would not have thought that necessary  it is as i have told you said hardaway at any time after tomorrow the mans clothing and documents and everything belonging to him will be removed unless they are claimed until they are claimed they are watched it wouldnt do deane for a man in your position to be seen in this place especially when one of those papers bears the name of your mine and sinclair has just been murdered by a man for whose defence you have paid  thats plain speaking deane remarked  its what i came to say hardaway answered dont do it deane we are not in africa you know your methods were splendid there they might spell ruin here goodnight  the reprieve deane asked  a certainty hardaway answered looking back from the door it may be a week before it is issued but it is a certainty all the same  deane sat in his chair looking through the dusty window out into the courta dull vista enough and uninspiring of the lawyers words he took little enough notice the reprieve would come of that he was certain but nevertheless he was beginning to feel the severity of the strain he was a man who would have been kindhearted but for the continual pressure of business obligations he was a great schemer a man of imagination and a brilliant financier there had been little room in his life for the gentler side of his nature to develop yet it had been a genuine horror which he had felt which he had carried about with him since the day he had visited the court and looked into rowans white face and heard those awful words of condemnation amid a silence intense unnatural hideous it was a memory from which he could not easily rid himself a memory which had penetrated even that splendid armor of indifference in which the man of toil and thought gradually encases himself the girls white face too and her plaintive eyes had touched his heart he felt that this period of suspense was growing almost unendurable  his secretary entered the room quietly did you wish me to make any arrangements sir he asked for the journey to scotland  deane looked at him for a moment as a man without understanding then he suddenly remembered that tomorrow was the day on which he was to leave london to join the nunneleys houseparty  i am not sure ellison he said doubtfully i will let you know in a few minutes  once more he was alone more impossible even than the grim monotony of the days in town seemed the thought of that prim country house with its wellordered days its fashionable easygoing crowd of people he suddenly lost heart as he thought of lady olive and the prosecution of his wellordered courtship these things for the moment he felt were impossible he wrote out a telegram and sent for a bradshaw the next day he disappeared from london     chapter xii  ruby sinclair   twentyfour hours later deane walked upon a wilderness of marshy sands glittering here and there with the stain of the sea blue in places with the delicate flush of sea lavender in the background a village of redtiled roofs before him an empty sea behind and around nothing but this stretch of bare flat country empty even of the sea until the tide should come and thrust its long arms of glittering silver up into the heart of the land a few wandering gulls screamed overhead from inland a great silence here too the sea flowing in upon the level sands was quiet and noiseless deane felt every nerve of his body at rest he realized to the full the marvelous joy of solitude all the strain of those last few days seemed to have fallen away he looked back upon that passionate chapter of his life as a stranger might look back upon recorded happenings the tragedy of basil rowan condemned to death amid the awful silence of that spellbound court sitting now in his cell with his head turned toward the door passing through long hours of torture waiting for the reprieve which might never come appealed to him now only as it might appeal to a million others who read the newspapers he was almost able to forget that it was he in a measure who was responsible for that episode he was able even to forget the tragical side of winifred rowans visitsto remember only her gentle appealing ways her passionate pleading her gratitude tempered still with anxiety which had triumphed at their last interview over the repugnance which she had at first plainly shown towards him all these doings and happenings were of another world here trouble and anxiety were like the noxious playthings of a race of children the sea that rippled in so softly on to the firm sands remained untroubled the seagulls wheeling above his head in lazy content filled the air with their soothing cries everywhere the sunshine lay about the seastained places the green marshes sparkled like emeralds the wet seaweed lying about in little heaps seemed struggling to express new subtleties of color down one of the reaches came a brownsailed fishingboat steered by a man who lay at full length upon the deck his head upon a coil of rope one hand only grasping the tiller a few cows were standing about in the drier part of the marshes swinging their tails and moving slowly from one to another of the little plots of herbage the very smoke from those redtiled cottages went straight to heaven unruffled by even the faintest of breezes to deane it seemed that he had found an idyll of still life and with a strong instinct of relief he felt the desire for sleep so long denied him creeping over his hot eyes the drowsiness of the place numbed his senses the pain ceased he was content to forget he threw himself upon the sands with his back to a sandy knoll covered with weedy green grass and with the murmur of the sea in his ears he slept                                       deane was awakened by a light touch upon his arm he sat up and was aware of a girl bending over him  i am sorry to disturb you she said but if you sit there for another five minutes you will be very wet  the tide was already within a few feet of them deane realized the position and struggled to his feet it was very kind of you to wake me he said i have come down here for a rest and i suppose i was entering into the programme a little too thoroughly after london the sea air is just a little strong  she looked at him with interest and he returned the gaze she was tallalmost as tall as he was himselfslim with dark eyes heavy eyebrows and complexion burnt brown by exposure to all sorts of weathers she wore plain tweed clothes in the cut of which his critical eye quickly detected the village tailor yet there was something about her appearance which seemed to remove her definitely from behind the pale of rusticity her eyes were long and a little narrow her eyelids heavy her mouth had a discontented turn at the corners her whole expression was a trifle sullen he was not in the least prepared for the change in her face when her forehead suddenly relaxed the corners of her mouth softened and her lips parted in a dazzling smile  you are a londoner she asked simply  very much so i am afraid  afraid she repeated incredulously  why not he asked i am one of the slaves of the world a man who sits in his office and toils year in and year out were caught in the golden web you see the time comes he continued when we find our way into a little corner of the earth like this and one realizes the gigantic folly of it  your point of view is interesting but unconvincing she said  why unconvincing  have you ever thought of the matter from the other point of view she askedthought about those poor people for instance who have to live in a corner of the world like this always all these things which rest and soothe you here are beautiful by sheer force of contrast for a few daysa week or so perhapsthe contemplation of them would be restful you would lie about on the sands and in the sunshine and believe that you had found paradise and then i think that you would begin to get just a little discontented the sun doesnt always shine here you know and when the sun doesnt shine all the land is colorless the sea is gray and ugly the marshes are flat and dreary the wind even in the summer time is cold  he looked at her with interest she had turned inland walking very slowly and he somehow or other found himself by her side her selfinvited companion  that is rather a pathetic picture he said anyhow the solitude remains and when one has lived with the roar in ones brain year in and year out the solitude itself is marvelous  and when one has lived she said with the solitude always on ones nerves lying about ones senses as though one were the only live thing in a dead and forgotten world dont you think that one may long for the roar even as you have come here longing for the solitude  we apparently represent the opposite poles he remarked lightly tell me do you live here i presume from the feeling with which you speak that you are a native  i have lived here for nine years she answered i live in a small house which you can see just behind the village there it is very tiny but very pretty to look at i have lived there with an aunt who was a farmers daughter and is very domestic and an uncle who was invalided early in life from the indian civil service and who has done nothing but play golf and fish and study his constitution for the last fifteen years  you dont travel much then  i have not been out of this county she answered since i first set foot in it nine years ago i had almost given up all hope of ever leaving it until she added with a little sigh of content a few weeks ago  he nodded sympathetically you are going to travel at last then he asked  i hope so she said i have an uncle come home from abroad who i believe is very rich he wrote to me the day he landed saying that he was going to send for me to pay him a visit i am expecting to hear from him now any day  he is in london  in london with a little sigh fancy she went on turning towards him i have never been in london just say that to yourself and imagine what it means the biggest town i have ever seen is kings lynn have you ever been to kings lynn  he shook his head i am afraid not  then you cant understand she saidi couldnt make you understandwhat it means to me to think that very soon i shall have a glimpse at any rate into the world if i had met you three weeks ago probably i shouldnt have dreamed of waking you up i should have let you get wet and then laughed at you if you had ventured to speak to me i should probably have stuck my nose in the air and walked away you see how mellowing an influence even the possibility of escape is  what a disagreeable young person you must have been he remarked  she nodded they were walking side by side now on the top of a tall dyke on their lefthand side was the creek which flowed into the village from the sea  that is precisely my reputation she declared my aunt detests me my uncle is always irritable because i can beat him at golf he is out playing over there now she remarked with a wave of her hand toward the furthest stretch of the marshes do you play golf  deane admitted that he did not  you came here then only to rest she said  only to rest he answered  where are you staying  he turned around and pointed to the square stone tower which stood on the edge of the sea i am stopping there he answeredthe old coastguards tower they call it i believe it is the queerest habitation i have ever been in  you wonderful person she declared how ever did you get old pegg and his wife to clear out  i paid them well he answered at least i didnt do it myself my servant comes from these parts and he told me about the place and arranged everything i am hoping to be able to buy it  there was as he had remarked from the first not the slightest reticence about her she had almost the frankness of a child  you have a servant she asked looking at him with renewed interest do you mean that he is there with you now  deane nodded i could scarcely be expected to cook for myself could i he inquired he completes my establishment  i suppose she said you are a rich man  deane shrugged his shoulders wealth he remarked is a relative thing  oh i dont understand those fine sayings she declared a little impetuously i only know that to have money is grand is wonderful i would give anything in the world to be rich to have money to spend as i wanted to spend it and clothes and jewels and all the delightful little things of life to go where i wanted live as i wished buy the things i wanted to buy theres something hideous about being a pauper  he looked at her curiously she was certainly for all her frankness a new type her frankness was more the frankness of a child than the outspokenness of gaucherie  some day he said you may probably have your wish there is your uncle for instance  she nodded it is my one hope she said my one hope i go to meet the postman every morning it is three weeks since he wrote and said that he was going to send for me you dont think that he would change his mind she asked turning suddenly towards him with almost tragic intensity  very unlikely i should say he answered has he any other relatives  none she answered even my uncle and aunt with whom i live here are not relatives of his you see he was my fathers brother mr sarsby was my mothers brother  it is mr and mrs sarsby with whom you live he remarked  she nodded yes and my name is sinclair she saidruby sinclair  he stopped short for a minute in the middle of the dyke path she was walking a little ahead and missing him in a few moments turned around he was standing like a man turned to stone  what is the matter she asked are you tired or arent you well  he recovered himself with a little effort it is all right he said you know i told you id come down here to recoup a little i get nervous attacks i was suddenly giddy then  she came back her face was once more softened in its expression of kindly concern would you like to take my arm she asked a little timidly we are close to the cottage now perhaps you would like to come in and sit down my aunt would be glad to see you  no he said let us rest here for a moment  they sat down on the edge of the high grassy bank he tortured himself gazing into her face trying to find some likeness between her and the murdered man there was none he told himselfnone the name was a common oneone of the commonest it was ridiculous to connect this girl in any way with the tragedy under whose shadow he had passed yet he felt his fingers nervously clutching the bank upon which they were sitting the seagulls still wheeled their way across his head the tide was flowing softly up into the creek below them a fishingboat came gliding by a lark rose almost from their feet and was singing just above their heads everywhere around was peace and quiet it was the same land in which he had found content only a few hours ago yet it seemed to him that already the shadow had come  it was she who rose first she shook out her skirts a little reluctantly and turned toward the village saying i am sorry but i must go meals at our house are the one thing more certain than the rising of the sun we lunch at one and it is ten minutes to do you feel well enough to get back or will you come on with me  i will go back he said i wonder he continued what are you going to do this afternoon  she shrugged her shoulders there is nothing she answered come out here i suppose and pray that i may have a letter tomorrow morning  be unconventional he begged take pity upon an invalid and come and have tea with me  id love to she answered if i can get away about halfpast four  yes said he i shall be waiting for you  dont come to meet me she beggednot that it matters of course only if uncle knew that you were staying there and that you came from london and that i had talked to you he would want to come and call he is one of those fussy people who like to hear themselves talk and to make acquaintances its all very well for you to shiver she added with a little smile but i have to live with him  with a laugh he said ill hide until i see you actually before the door you will come though  ill come she promised turning away with a little wave of the hand     chapter xiii  an informal teaparty   after all the element of unconventionality was absent from deanes teaparty about four oclock looking landwards from a little sandy knoll just in front of his strange abode he saw two figures coming along the dyke path a few minutes later ruby sinclair and her companion came across the last little strip of shingle and approached the spot where deane was waiting for them  my uncle would like to make your acquaintance mr deane she said  deane held out his hand and welcomed his visitora small fussylooking little man with a gray moustache and a somewhat awkward air of being at his ease he wore a tweed knickerbocker suitvery oldfashioned and of local makea flannel collar and an illchosen tie he shook hands with his host in a perfunctory sort of manner  thought i must just look you up he explained living out here such a lonely spot too you are going to play golf of course  deane shook his head i never play he answered i have come here to rest  to rest the word seemed a strange one to the fussy little man who was already taking stock of his surroundings photographs in silver frames a pile of booksall new a gun and fishingrod and other such belongingsall naturally the best of their sort  well but you must do something mr sarsby remarked you cannot sit here all day and look at the sealike the fishermen he continued with a little laugh a very lazy lotour fishermen he went on never go out if theres a ripple on the sea  deane nodded the tides he remarked are rather treacherous i should think  the servant brought in tea and a great dish of strawberries at which mr sarsby gazed in amazement  strawberries he exclaimed why we dont begin to think about them for another six weeks  is that so answered deane carelessly i never know anything about seasons and my man is doing the catering miss sinclair you must make the tea for us i am afraid our methods are a little crude but you see we are trying to get along without any womenservants  mr sarsby was a little abashed he had seldom sat down to a table covered by a cloth of such fine linen and he had certainly never been waited upon of late years by a manservant his little eyes roved inquisitively around you come from london sir my niece tells me he remarked  from london deane replied  a wonderful place mr sarsby said with a sigh since i retired unfortunately i have had to drop out of life altogether  your health deane suggested politely  my health and my ridiculously small pension mr sarsby answered i cant make out what the country is coming to years ago pensions were altogether on a different scale today it seems to me that every government is always trying to shirk its obligations to those who go out and help to build up the empire  this was mr sarsbys favorite little speech which he made regularly several times a week in the village and once a year at a club dinner deane received it in sympathetic silence  tell me how you spend your time miss sinclair he asked you play golf i think you told me  oh i do all the obvious things one has to do living in such a place she said i swim and i fish i play golf and tennis when i can get any and i sail a boat when i can borrow one those things are all sport to you i suppose when they become not a part of your life but the whole of it they are a dreary sort of pursuits  my niece is seldom satisfied mr sarsby said sharply  why should i be she asked you at least have had your day you have seen something of life in however small a circle i havent i dare say after twenty years away i might be content with these things life for you is simply a satisfactory thing or not according to whether you have beaten colonel forsitt or whether he has beaten you whether you are heeling your mashie shots or laying them dead holing your putts or leaving them short you see i havent quite come to the stage when i find these things sufficient  at any rate mr sarsby remarked with what he imagined was a dignified air there is no need to take a stranger into your confidence mr deane is scarcely interested  on the contrary deane answered with a little bow but i thought you told me miss sinclair that you were probably leaving us before long  oh i hope so she replied my uncle was not a man to break his promise and he did promise i am expecting to hear now every day  after tea they wandered out on to the little stretch of sandy shingle which alone separated the cottage from the sea the girl had walked on a little ahead and deane laid his hand for a moment upon her uncles shoulder  mr sarsby he said did i understand that the name of your nieces uncle was sinclairthe same as her own  mr sarsby nodded yes sir he saidrichard sinclair he was her fathers brother you seea queer wandering sort of fish however he certainly did write the girl a few weeks ago saying that he was back in england and hoped to realize a large sum of money on some of his investments and promised to send for her to come up to town since then we have heard nothing from him  do you read the papers mr sarsby deane asked  i read the times for an hour every afternoon between five and six mr sarsby admitted i have a special arrangement with mr fouldsthe vicarwhich enables me to do thisa special arrangement he concluded with a little gurgle of satisfaction our vicar by the bye mr deane is a highly intelligent man he will doubtless be coming across to see you  i am here for so short a time deane said it is very kind of people but really it is scarcely worth their while to trouble to come to see me i am going on to scotland in a few days it is only that i was a little run down and scarcely felt up to a large houseparty that i came here first  you are one of those fortunate people i see mr sarsby remarked a little enviously who mix in the world  deane shrugged his shoulders more or less i suppose he admitted but i was asking you whether you read the papers i did so for an object i wonder whether you have noticed the details of a very sordid murder that was committed in a london hotel a short time ago  i never read of such things sir mr sarsby declared they do not interest me i read the political news and the foreign intelligence anything that pertains to india also naturally claims my attention i have always contended he continued that a golf column in the times say twice a week would be much appreciated we who study the game from the scientific point of view would like to see the attitude the times would take on certain matters for instance i myself  pardon my interrupting you mr sarsby deane said with his eyes upon the returning figure of the girl but i was speaking about this murder curiously enough the unfortunate man was named sinclair and he had just returned from abroad  mr sarsby slowly opened his mouth looking up at his companion blankly you dont for a moment imagine he began that there could be any connection between this person and rubys uncle  i havent any idea deane answered but when she mentioned his name and told me that he had just come back from africa and that she had been waiting for a letter which did not come it certainly occurred to me to be rather in the nature of a coincidence  have you a paper mr sarsby asked hurriedly  deane shook his head no he said but there must be a village library or some place where the london papers are preserved  there is mr sarsby declared i will hurry back i will go and read about it at once does it say whether the unfortunate man he continued was possessed of any means  i do not remember deane said the object of the murder was supposed to be robbery but the hotel he was staying at scarcely seemed to be one likely to attract a man of wealth  i shall hurry back at once mr sarsby declared if there is anything in this i must come and ask your advice  if the thing seems in any way possible deane remarked you will have to run up to town and make inquiries  mr sarsby opened his mouth my dear sir he exclaimed go to london but there there he added i forgot if there is anything in it the estate would of course pay my railway fare such a busy week too as i have next week he added taking out his memorandum book and glancing at it for a moment i have seven golf matchesthree foursomes and four singles i scarcely see how i could get away ruby he called come along my dear we must be getting back  the girl stifled a yawn she was beginning to be a bit curious as to why their host had devoted all his attention to her uncle very well she answered laconically i am quite ready goodbye mr deane  if i may he said i will walk a little way with you  they crossed the strip of shingly beach together afterwards by necessity the party became detached mr sarsby walked on ahead deane and the girl followed him a few yards behind  you seem to have found plenty to say to my uncle she remarked curiously  if you will spoil an interesting teaparty he murmured by bringing in an elderly male relative  it wasnt my fault she interrupted he would comeinsisted upon itas soon as he knew that i had spoken to you your man has been making purchases and sending telegrams in the village which has made every one curious people who live in small places are always such snobs  he laughed well i had to talk to your uncle anyhow he said  she nodded you know now what i have to put up with she said he is a dull ignorant pompous little bore you have probably found that out for yourself by now  you dismiss your relatives a little summarily he remarked  i try to speak the truth she answered i believe in being just to people if i knew of any good quality that he possessed i would tell it to youbut i dont  she believed in being just he looked at her as she walked by his side stepping along with the delightful freedom of healthy youth her limbs clearly defined beneath her thin skirtfor they were facing a land breeze which played havoc also with her hair she walked well her head a little thrown back deane recognized the graceful lines of her neck and throat the carriage of her chin there was something particularly rhythmic about her movements she was a believer in justice well she looked like that the mouth in repose was a little hardthe jaw determined he found himself wondering with a nervous sort of morbid curiosity exactly what she would say and do if she had known with whom she was walking and if dick sinclair had indeed been her uncle supposing she knew the whole truthknew of that heated interview knew of rowans enterprise knew of the paper which was still sewn into the dead mans coat she would scarcely be an easy person to deal with he thought  her uncle had turned round they had reached the end of the dyke a little grassgrown footpath led them now to the side of the harbor beyond which lay the village  mr deane he saidmr deane i should like to show you the village schoolroom  deane nodded i should be very glad he said  mr sarsby turned to his niece ruby he said go home and tell your aunt where we are i shall be home in halfanhourperhaps fiveandtwenty minutes if there is any message for me from the golf club the boy can wait till i return this way mr deanethis way  the girl turned away with a little grimace and waved her hand to deane as she disappeared the two men climbed the village street side by side     chapter xiv  an unexpected visitor   mr sarsby like most men of his stamp when brought in touch with larger things than his world knew of was nervous and helpless he seemed to throw the whole weight of further action upon this stranger at whose instigation he had commenced the search  the readingroom was empty except for these two men deane was sitting in the little bow window looking down with apparent interest into the narrow tortuous street sarsby with a pile of torn and crumpled newspapers in front of him was still standing leaning over the long table in the centre of the room his search was finished he had no doubt whatever in his mind the murdered man was indeed rubys uncle  mr deane he exclaimed hoarsely  deane turned his head well  theres no doubt at all about it declared mr sarsby striking the little pile of papers with the back of his hand its the manits rubys uncle the date of his arrival corresponds and the hotel is the one from which he wrote to ruby  deane nodded i fancied that it must be the same he said  it is the same mr sarsby declared what are we to do something must be done at once  exactly deane remarked your niece of course must claim her inheritancethat is if the man was really worth anything  of courseof course mr sarsby said dear me what an unfortunate business this all is i suppose i must go to london with her and london always upsets me horribly  i am afraid that you must make up your mind to that deane remarked as i said before if there is anything i can do to help you i shall be delighted  but you wont be there mr sarsby said you are going from here to scotland  deane hesitated i might he saidin fact i think that i certainly shouldgo to scotland by way of london  but we must leave at once mr sarsby declared at least i suppose so  deane rose to his feet he had not much sympathy for the frightened little man whose eyes were continually seeking his as though for help and advice  well he said i scarcely see how you can keep away under the circumstances you must talk it over with your niece and let me know what you decide  they left the place together as they stepped out on to the pavement mr sarsby coughed apologetically i suppose said he you would consider it necessary for me to tell my niece about this it will be a shock to her of course she had hoped so much from the coming of this uncle and i am afraid that she is not particularly contented here  i scarcely see deane answered how you can keep it from her  there is no mention of any property mr sarsby remarkednone at all in fact the papers say that his effects were so small that it seemed difficult to believe that robbery was the motive of the crime still i suppose she must be told  deane walked down the narrow street his hands behind his back his eyes fixed upon the arm of the river below dotted now with brownsailed fishingboats here after all was a simple way out of the difficulty the murdered man had no other relatives in all probability no one would ever tell the girl no one would ever claim the possessions of the dead man whatsoever they might be then common sense reasserted itself in his brain and he stifled the instinct which he had so nearly yielded to  she must be told mr sarsby he said if you would rather not tell her yourself i will do so  mr sarsby shook his head it isnt that he said i dont mind telling her but its the journey to london and the excitement and all that i hate worry of any sort its bad for my health anyhow  they stood upon the little quay and deane hesitated if there is anything further which i can do he said come out and look me up in any case let me see you before you start for london  mr sarsby wrung his hand it is very good of you he declared i shall certainly come out before we startmost certainly i cant imagine what ruby will say poor girl poor girl  deane retraced his steps along the high dyke bank to the marshes which surrounded his tower once or twice he looked behind looked toward the low white front of the cottage which the girl had pointed out as her abode once he fancied that he saw something moving in the garden and he stood on the top of the dyke gazing with a curious interest at the slowly moving speck passing in and out amongst the trees then it vanished he turned and made his way homeward  towards sunset the heat of the day seemed suddenly to increase a curiously hot wind sprang up from the land black clouds gathered in the sky and unusual darkness hung over the land the air seemed charged with electricity every moment it seemed as though the clouds must break and the storm come the tide came rolling in no longer with a faint insistent ripple but with great powerful waves throwing their spray far and wide deane left his dinner more than once to stand outside on the little knoll and watch every moment he expected to see the banks of black clouds riven with lightning to hear the faroff muttering across the sea grow nearer and nearer the whole world seemed to be in a state of suspended animation the seagulls had ceased their screaming and had taken shelter in some hidden haunt a little fleet of fishingboats had furled their sails not a soul was to be seen upon the marshes  deane finished his dinner and sat by the wideopen window leaning upon his folded arms looking out at the foamflecked seafoam which seemed to glitter with a clear white phosphorescence in the failing light there were books by his side but he felt no inclination to readcigarettes and cigars at his elbow but he lacked the enterprise to smoke there was something almost theatrical something breathless in this pause before the storm he himself was in an emotional frame of mind another page of this tragic chapter had opened before him the coming of this girl was in itself a catastrophe she would take possession of the papers belonging to the murdered manwould show them probably to a lawyer after that only the worst could happen  then as he sat there the profound silence was suddenly broken he heard the crunch of the gravel beneath flying footsteps the rustle of a skirt a little halfsubdued cry he looked up in amazement it was winifred rowan who was coming towards him her hair disordered her eyes lit with feara strange halfterrified figure flying from the storm  miss rowan he exclaimed breathlessly  even as he spoke the clouds were parted at last with a dazzling blaze of forked lightning the girl gave a little cry and held out her hands he leaned over and as the thunder shook the building took her into his arms lifting her over the narrow windowsill into the room     chapter xv  the effect of a storm   deane was never quite sure how it had happened the sudden crash of the storm the vivid play of the lightning in the darkened room the curious exultation which any outburst of nature seems to kindle in the forgotten places had somehow generated a curious excitementsomething electrical incomprehensible yet felt by both of them his hands were still about her for a moment after she was in the room it was perhaps a harmless instinct enough which caused her to draw a little nearer still to him with fear as the thunder crashed overhead and the ground beneath their feet rocked then there happened what he was never able to explain she was in his arms her panting breath fell hot upon his cheek his lips were pressed to hers before he even realized what was happening her head fell a little back her lips seemed to meet his freely unresistingly it was one of those moments of madness which seem to be born and die away without reason almost without volition deane himself was no lothario in his office he had talked kindly with this girl and it had never occurred to him for a single second even to hold her hand in his her comings and goings except for their association had left him unmoved afterwards when he tried to think of it his senses were simply benumbed yet the fact remained that she had come into his arms as though she had heard the call of his heart for her that their lips had met with all the effortless certainty of fate  the thunder ceased she disengaged herself from his arms with a little cry her bosom was still heaving her cheeks were white almost to ghastliness with one little patch of brilliant color where his lips had rested for a moment she tried to speak but the words seemed stifled in her throat he led her to a chair arranged cushions for her back and stood over her  is there news he asked  none she faltered  he shook his head he was completely bewildered how did you find me out he asked what brings you here at this hour  it is because there is no news she cried speaking with difficulty i cannot rest or sleep every moment that passes tears at my heartstrings life has become nothing but a living nightmare dont be angry with me that i came i was obliged to do something or i should have gone mad  i am not angry he said i am only amazed i cannot understand  oh i found out where you were she said i did everything that was mean i bribed someone to tell me this morning i saw basil i think i came to him at a weak moment the horror was in his eyes i shrieked when i saw him even now when i think i must shriek mr deane i have come to pray to beg you to go back you are very rich there must be ways of saving him you have influence with people go back and use it what can you do here in the wilderness it seems almost as though you had left him to die  he stooped down and took her hands once more in his my dear little friend he said remember what i told you in my office believe me i should not have left london if the slightest doubt had remained as to your brothers safety never mind how i managed it you had better not ask you had better not know but your brother will be reprieved it is a certain thing  she drew a long breath once more her face was at any rate human the lightning filled the room with a sudden glare she caught at him with a scream oh i am afraid i am afraid she moaned  he passed his arm around her reassuringly you are overwrought he said you are almost at the end of your strength  he poured out some brandy and water and made her drink it her hand shook so that he had to guide the glass to her lips  listen he said you must keep calm or you will be ill and you will not be able to help your brother tell me have you eaten anything today  i dont remember she gasped  deane rang the bell something to eat he ordered for one as quickly as you can and some wineanything will do  it was to the mans credit that he received his orders without comment or surprise once more they two were alone  if you have any faith in me deane said or any belief remember what i have told you your brother is safe tomorrow or the next day the reprieve will be signed  say it again she gasped clinging to his hand  tomorrow or the next day he repeated firmly the reprieve will be signed there can be no mistake there will be none  ah she murmured half closing her eyes it was to hear you talk like this that i came i could not have borne it alone for another second something in my head seemed to be giving way  the storm too is terrifying he said you were fortunate not to be ten minutes later look  he led her to the window across the marsh was a darkness that was less of the atmosphere than of the falling torrents of rainrain that fell in sheets flung up again from the hard paths of the marshes in a white fringelike foam seaward the waves had become breakers the one white line had become a dozen  you would have been drowned he said leading her back to her chair  it is good of you she said not to be angry i ought not to have come i know that only i was afraid in london i should have gone mad  the servant entered with a tray deane stood over her while she ate walking up and down the room talking in a disconnected manner of many things outside the storm was passing away through the wideopen windows fresh salt air came stealing into the room deane stood looking out for a few minutes and then turned towards his visitor with an air of perplexity she met his gaze and her eyes suddenly filled with tears  oh i know i have been foolish she said i am here and you dont know what to do with me isnt that what you were thinking i have been very foolish she added with a sudden flood of color streaming into her cheeks but remember when i came i was mad you will remember that  yes he answered reassuringly i will remember that  there was an awkward silence deane felt that it would have been torture to her if he had alluded to that moment of madness and yet it was hard altogether to avoid it  i am afraid he said that you will have to put up with bachelor quarters tonight you can have my room here i have another which will do but you would find it a little rough  she looked at him timidly couldnt iget back to the village  he led her outside and pointed the storm coming with the full tide had wrought a strange change in the face of the land up to the very top of the dykes was a turbulent waste of waters the tower had been left as though upon an island nowhere in sight was any land to be seen  you see deane said to the girl it would not be safe to try and get to the village the water is up to within a few inches of the dyke and in the half darkness one might easily make a false step from here one cannot quite see but i should imagine that the flood is over the village street  she turned back toward the little gray stone building if you will let me sleep in your sittingroom then she said timidly i will not turn you out of your room  he laughed my dear young lady he said if anyone in the world ever needed sleep tonight it is you i am going to send you up to lie down at once you must promise me promise faithfully that you will remember what i have said that you will say this to yourself the reprieve will come it is the truth mind say that to yourself and sleep  then he touched the bell and spoke to his servant grant please make my room as habitable as possible for this young lady we are on an island and no one will be able to leave tonight put out anything of mine you think may be useful to her  she turned towards him impulsively you are very good to me she said  my dear miss rowan i only wish that it were in my power  then he stopped short after all it was not wise to tell her too much he raised her fingers to his lips and avoided with a sudden twinge of selfreproach the soft invitation of her timidly raised eyes  you must sleep well he said as he pointed the way up the stairs remember you can take what i have told you as a promise     chapter xvi  a reprieve   morning dawned upon a land still as though from exhaustion the long waves sole remnant of the storm came gliding in with a slow lazy motion and broke noiselessly upon the firm sands the sky was blue of wind there was none at all inland the floodtide was still high only the tops of the dykes were visible everywhere the sea had found its way into unexpected places little patches of the marsh from which it had just receded shone with a new glorya green glitter like the sparkle of emeralds deane who was out early for his bed had been no more than a sofa gave a little start of surprise as he opened the door and found winifred rowan standing on a little knoll by the side of the flagstaff looking seaward  she turned towards him at once with the sound of the opening door he realized then more completely than in the dusk of the evening how great the strain of these last few days had beenthe strain which had driven her into this strange journey the black rings under her eyes seemed as though traced with a pencil her cheeks were thinner there was something pathetic about the quick startled look which flashed into her eyes at the sound of deanes approaching footsteps  i am afraid he said gravely that you have not slept  as much as usual she answered tell me what time do your letters come  he looked inland generally about eight they may be a little later today  she nodded i must go back she said vacantly when is there a train  it was impossible to ask her to stop and yet he felt all the pathos of sending her back to face alone the shadow of her terrible anxiety  there is no hurry he said we will look out the trains after breakfast  are yougoing to stay here she asked anxiously  if i thought he answered that there was the slightest thing i could do in london which i have not already done i would go back by the first train this morning but indeed you must remember what i told you last night the matter is practically settled in a few days he will know  it is those few days she said softly which are so terrible  it was hard to try and make use of any conventional phrase of reassurance deane remembering how intense how real and startling a thing this tragedy really was found it hard impossible indeed  tell me he asked do you live absolutely alone  yes she told him there was a cousin who was with me for some time but she got a situation the other side of london and had to move i was in a boardinghouse she continued after a moments hesitation untilthis happened then all the peoplewell they meant to be kind she broke off but the woman who kept it thought i had better leave and i suppose she was right  we will go in to breakfast he said a little abruptly  every moment he seemed to realize more completely the pathos of her position they turned towards the house suddenly her fingers fell upon his arm who is that she asked pointing landwards  deane followed her outstretched finger riding along the top of one of the dykes as though unconscious of the sea flowing on either side came a boy on a bicycle the bicycle was painted red and the boy had on a cap whose high peak gave it a semiofficial look  he is coming here said deane it may be my letters or i think  he stopped short he knew very well that it was a telegram the boy was bringing but he almost feared to say anything which would bring hope into her face  it isntit couldnt be a telegram she asked a little wistfully  it might be he admitted i get a good many of course  he told the lie unblushingly all the time he watched with an anxiety which seemed incredible for the coming of the messenger  you must remember he said that even if this should be a telegram i really do not expect any news yet  she said nothing she stood with parted lips by his side and they watched the boy drive his bicycle along the seastained bank once he skidded and she gave a little scream deane laughed at her surprised to discover something unnatural in the sound  well he said we will meet the boy here i am afraid you will find a few stock exchange quotations inside the envelope even if he should be  it is a telegraph boy she interrupted i can see the wallet  she clung to his arm deane found himself patting her fragile hand with his strong fingers he drew her arm through his and led her a few steps further forward the boy jumped off his bicycle and opened his wallet as he approached with a familiar movement deane took the telegram into his fingers and tore it open his arm suddenly went round her waist  miss rowan he said be brave and i will tell you some good news see you can read it for yourself the reprieve is signed  she suddenly fell a dead weight upon his arm and almost as quickly she recovered herself her closed eyes were opened she clung to him passionately it is true she cried out  he held the telegram in front of her face read he said reprieve signed last night will be communicated to rowan this morning hardawaythat is the name of my solicitor so there is no possible doubt about it the matter is ended  he turned to the boy who stood looking on with wooden face then he drew a coin from his pocket my young friend he said you are in luck take that and go home to your breakfast  the boy looked at the sovereign and up at deane so far as his features were capable of expression at all they spoke of stupefaction then as though afraid that deane might change his mind he mounted his bicycle and rode rapidly away  it is a relief to you of course deane said trying to speak in as matteroffact a tone as possible but this thing was a certainty all the time i have always tried to make you believe that come in now and let us have some breakfast you ought to have an appetite  she followed him without a word she seemed indeed like a person dreaming not wholly able to realize the things happening around her even the moments that passed deane waited upon her at breakfast and talked in a matteroffact way accepting her monosyllabic answers as natural thingscarrying on a conversation too with the man who waited at the sideboard by degrees a more natural expression came into her face when at last the meal was over and the servant had left the room she burst suddenly into tears deane took her outside and placed her in a chair sitting by her side on the sands  now he said that is all over  when can i go back she asked suddenly they will let me see basil i must go and tell him  he knows of course deane replied but naturally he will want to see you you can leave here in about an hour i am not sureperhaps i may come with you  she sat there quietly absolutely content to lie still and gaze out at the sea presently grant came out with a note which deane silently opened it was dated from the cottage rakney       dear mr deane       my niece knows and she insists upon going to london at once      we are all very much disturbed if it is not troubling you too      much when you are passing this way we should be so grateful if      you would call in for a minute  deane looked thoughtfully seaward and his face hardened as he crumpled the note up in his hand then he rose to his feet i am going in to see about the trains for you he said                                       he hired a cart from the village and they stood together on the platform of the nearest railway station an hour or so later she laid her arm upon his sleeve  will you stop for a moment please she said i am afraid i must have seemed ungracious after all i ought to be very grateful to you  he shook his head no he answered it is always i who must be your debtor i ought to have been firmer with your brother when i sent him to this man sinclair to make terms it was a desperate enterprise after all and i ought to have realized the danger of your brother being tempted to use violence to me he was nothing more than a unit of humanity and i took him at his word if he had brought me the paper i wanted i was quite prepared to ask him no questions whatever and he would have been a rich man i cant help feeling that in a sense i am responsible for his present position and yours  she looked away from him her eyes were fixed upon the horizon she appeared to be steadily thinking the matter out the wind blew little wisps of fair hair over her face her eyes were steadfast her forehead a little wrinkled she seemed to be endeavoring to arrive at a conscientious decision  no she said after some time i cannot see that you are to blame i am sure that it never entered into your head that my brother might be tempted to use violence  deane looked away with a little frown in his heart he knew very well that he was not so sure well he said we will let that go at any rate my responsibility to you remains tell me what i can do how can i help you  she shook her head i am going back to my work she said i need no help  your work he repeated  she nodded with a little sigh i am a typist she said you know what that meansgenteel starvation long hours gray days never mind i am almost used to it  you need be a typist no longer unless you choose he said part of what i promised to your brother belongs to you  she shook her head dont speak of it she exclaimed i should feel that it was blood money  at least let me hear from you sometimes he said dont let me lose sight of you altogether while your brother is unable to help you  she hesitated then lifting her eyes to his i dont believe she said softly that you would tell me anything that was not true  i dont believe that i should he answered  then tell me this she said honestly when you made my brother that offer when you sent him to deal with this man sinclair can you tell me that you had not an idea in your mind that he might be led on to do something rash  deane hesitated he was not a man of overstrict scruples but he hated lies somehow or other it seemed to him impossible to look at this girl and tell her anything that was not the truth  i am not altogether sure he answered at the back of my head there was just the idea that your brother was desperate that he would gain what he wanted somehow or other  she turned away and walked a little way down the platform the train was already in the station she entered a carriage and sat in the furthest corner thank you she said i am glad that you have told me the truth would you mind going away now please  i am sorry deane said simply remember that i only did what ninetynine men out of a hundred would have done in my place i wanted that paper and your brother begged for just such an enterprise  she held out her hands if you please she said goodbye  deane turned away the girl was a little fool of course yet as he turned and watched the smoke of the train disappear and thought of her in her empty thirdclass carriage alone he was conscious of a sense of acute depressionnone the less acute because it was vague he turned back to the village walking with heavy steps it was as though a new trouble had come into his life     chapter xvii  a new danger   deane was shown into what was apparently the morningroom of the sarsby domicile by an openmouthed and very countrylooking domestic who regarded him all the time with unaffected curiosity mr sarsby was sitting in an easychair reading the times directly he recognized his visitor he showed signs of nervousness  ah mr deane he said rising how do you do mr deane  deane shook hands his host did not ask him to sit down nor did he himself resume his seat  i looked in deane explained to know what your niece had decided to do  she has decided to go to london at once mr sarsby answeredat once it is very inconvenient for all of us i am almost sorry that you ever happened to point out the paragraph especially as there seems to be no property of any sort to be found  the door was suddenly opened and ruby sinclair entered there was a frown which was almost a scowl upon her dark handsome face little mr sarsby seemed suddenly to have become a person of no importance  mr deane will excuse me he said hurriedly yet with a marked attempt at stiffness i have to return the times  he left the room deane looked after him with some surprise  what is the matter with your uncle he asked the girl  he has just heard she answered that a young lady from somewhere or other spent the night out at the tower last night  deane looked at her in amazement and what business is it of his he asked  i dont know brusquely as a rule gentlemen when theyre living alone dont have young lady visitorsnot to stay the night at any rate  deane laughed the young lady in question he said came to see me on a very important matter if you heard anything of the storm last night you would understand that it was scarcely possible for any one to have found her way from the tower to the mainland after the floodtide was in  the girl nodded shortly its not my business she said i am glad you came i wanted to ask you something who is this man rowan who killed my uncle  deane shook his head slowly no one knows very much about him he said they were out in south africa together it was there perhaps that their quarrel if they had one started  it says in the times this morning that he has been reprieved why she asked fiercely why dont they hang him  because they came to the conclusion he answered that there had been a fight and that it was not a deliberate murder  they ought to have hanged him she declared it was brutalhideous  you are going to london are you not he asked quietly  her eyes flashed yes she answered i am going i am afraid it will be too late all the papers declare that my uncles possessions were of little value he has been robbed i am sure he has been robbed his letter told me that he would have plenty of money he would not write and tell me that if he had nothing  you will be able to find out deane answered a little coldly  i shall find out the girl declared i am going to a good lawyer he wrote as though he had something in his possession which was worth money it was for that i am sure that this man rowan tried to kill him i shall find out all about it when i get there  the man rowan was arrested on the premises deane reminded her there was no time for him to have taken anything away and the room was locked up by the police  i dont care she answered oh cant you understand what this means to me she cried jumping up from the chair in which she had seated herself a moment or so before i am starved for life here starved for the want of it she cried i was never meant to live in a place like thisa life like this it isnt fair other girls have clothes and jewels and men to admire them and go to theatres and see the world why shouldnt i i will i am going to london to find out what that man killed my uncle for and i mean never to come back here again  the girl was evidently in earnest her bosom was heaving her dark eyes were full of fire deane noticed the firm lines of her mouth the crisp determination of her speech and he realized a new danger this girl was not one to be bribed or put off every word she had said she had meant there was a distinct change in her whole appearance since the last time he had seen her she was at once handsomer and less attractive the wistfulness of her few sad speeches to him had passed away the vague discontent seemed suddenly to have become focussed in a passionate anger against this untoward stroke of fate  well said deane at length rising as though about to leave i hope you may discover after all that your uncle was a man of property  why wont you help me she asked suddenly you could if you would  could i he answered i wonder  of course you could she declared coming a little nearer to him i suppose i seem a very ordinary discontented sort of creature to you but you havent lived as many years as i have pushing against the walls of a prison i think i am one of those persons who would improve a good deal with a little prosperity she added with a sudden smile which transformed her face a smile which was almost brilliant why wont you help me  do you mean that you would like me to go to london for you and search through your uncles effects deane asked quietly if you gave me a letter i suppose i could do that  come with me then she begged i mean to do everything for myself but there are many little things i am ignorant about if you would come with me i promise you she added looking into his eyes that you would not find me ungrateful  when are you going he asked  monday morning she answered  deane walked to the window and looked out for a moment at the tangled wilderness of cottage flowers which seemed to have been encouraged to grow there in wild profusiona brilliant spot of color as he remembered very well from the sea line in a day or so at most this girl might if she realized her position or if she were properly advised be in a position to bring ruin upon him an alliance with her was obviously the very best thing that could happen for him yet he felt a certain distrust a certain unexplained reluctance to accepting her overtures if she discovered her power she would drive a hard bargainhe knew that well enough if she did not discover it  he turned away and faced her suddenly yes he said ill help you if i can well go to london together on monday morning  a curious look came into her face she drew him out of the room come she said i wont ask you to stay to tea because my aunt thinks that you are a most improper person ill walk with you back across the marshes i want you to tell me what you really think and i want to show you the one letter i received from my uncle  she read the letter to him as they walked side by side on the top of the dyke path which was high enough now from the receding waste of waters the air was unusually salt great masses of seaweed had been brought in and left by the ebbing tide the wind had freshened since the morning she walked on in supreme disregard of her disordered hair and skirts  you see she said he writes distinctly as one who has or expects to have money listen i did no particular good out there she read but i have brought something home with me which will mean a fortune of some sort or another i expect you have had quite enough of your country life and you wont object to coming and sharing it with me i am rather a rough sort and i have a few vices that your respected uncle sarsby knows all about but i fancy you will get a better time with me than with that solemn old prig id like to do what i can for you though we havent seen much of one another but your mother was the best sister a man ever had and for her sake i look upon you as the only relative ive got worth counting  she looked up at him eagerly now tell me she asked would he have written that if he hadnt somethingjewels or estate or something of that sort which he knew was going to bring him in money  it doesnt sound so deane admitted  she thrust the letter back into her pocket you will help me she said her face glowing her eyes full of anticipation we will go through his papers carefully we will find out somehow or other what he meant oh it is good to think that i have only a few more days to eat and to sleep in this ghastly wilderness  you may be disappointed he reminded her  never she answered my uncle was no fool what he had i shall discover  you may be disappointed he continued in the things which wealth itself brings you you may find life not so very much more wonderful a thing in the city than here in the wilderness  dont you believe it she exclaimed with a scornful laugh i am not that sort i am not an artist who can sit about here for days and potter about with a paintbox and look at a sunset or a streak of wild lavender or the shimmering of the yellow sands as though it were something so marvelous that life itself stood still while they realized it i like beautiful places and beautiful things but i hate the impersonality of it all i want to feel the touch of lace and furs and fine linen to eat soft food to listen to music to ride when i want to to sleep when i want to to have friends who admire me men friends worth speaking to different from these yokels round here i suppose i have got it in my blood she added with a little laugh the milkandwater ways of life dont attract me i want the big things  do you know what the big things are he asked  when i have found my way where i mean to find it i shall know she answered here one might live till ones hair was gray and ones looks had passed liveif you call it livingand never once see over the wall when i have come so that i can see over the wall then i will tell you if you are still curious what the big things of life are for me     chapter xviii  an expensive key   it was three oclock in the morning when deane softly opened the door of his bedroom in the hotel universal and looked up and down the side corridor there was no one in sight no sound of any one passing in the main corridor a few yards away for several moments he stood and listened intently then he moved a few yards to the left and stopped opposite another door he scrutinized the number27 it was the number he sought he felt in his pocket for the keys which he had collected from various sources one by one he tried them in the lock in vain not one fitted he tried the handle of the door softly there was no doubt about it the door was securely fastened he recognized at once the failure of his first attempt and returned to his room his bed was as yet undisturbed he had not even changed the tweed travelling suit in which he had journeyed up from rakney it was a fools errand after all he thought on which he had come yet somehow or other after his conversation with ruby sinclair after he had realized how thorough her search would indeed be how convinced she was that somewhere amongst the effects of the dead man lay the secret of wealth he had realized more completely than ever before the danger in which he stood granted even that no suspicion of complicity with rowan attached to him his financial ruin would be none the less complete if that paper should ever come into the hands of people who understood its worth never had the situation seemed so clear so dangerous as that night after he had walked home with the girl and turned his face again toward the sea something in the very desolation of the marshes seemed to help thought perhaps by the absence of any distracting object there was a sense of breadth about the place as he walked with only the murmur of the sea in his ears he saw things clearly he saw himself in the prime of life suddenly flung from the place to which he had climbed flung down to join all those poor millions of strugglers whose first foot has yet to be planted upon the first rung of the great ladder he was too old to begin at the beginning there was no place for him down amongst those on whom failure had already placed her mark he could not have borne it to be stripped of his riches his name the position of which he was without a doubt proud to suffer the breaking of his engagement the downfall of all his ambitionsthe very thought of it was intolerable and in the deep silence of that night as he listened to the gurgling of the sea below and the faint movement of the wind across the level land he realized with a sudden pain at his heart the danger in which he stood in three days the girl would be there scotland yard would send one of its myrmidons with her she would have free access to all the dead mans belongings she would take with her a lawyer every scrap of paper the man had possessed every trifling object would have its value the little anna goldmine was world famous there would be no chance of their overlooking a single document bearing such a name  before he had reached his strange dwellingplace he had come to a resolution early next morning stopping only to leave a note telling the girl where to find him when she arrived in london he was off by the early train by means of a little diplomacy he had succeeded in gaining a room within a few doors of the one in which sinclair had been killed only a few feet of wall separated him from the room in which somewhere or other was to be found the paper he coveted well his first attempt had been a failure he knew quite well that the place was paraded by night watchmen and that any attempt to gain an entrance into the room by orthodox means would result in prompt discovery there was nothing to be done until the morrow he threw himself upon the bed and tried to sleep waking with the first gleam of daylight he took off his clothes bathed and made a leisurely toilet then he rang for the valet de chambre the man was a pleasantfaced loquacious sort of fellow deane talked to him for a while and then made his effort  wasnt it upon this floor he asked that a murder took place lately  the valet looked around him for a moment before answering yes sir he replied in the very next room we are not allowed to talk about it more than we can help  deane nodded all the time he was watching the man wondering how far he dared go look here he said you seem an honest fellow i suppose youd have no objection to bettering yourself in life  no objection in the slightest sir the man answered  i am on the staff of a newspaper deane said slowly and my people are particularly anxious that i should inspect the interior of the room in which that murder was committed your people downstairs have absolutely refused to allow me to do anything of the sort i have taken this room in the hope of being able to get in there do you think there is any chance for me  i should say not sir the man answered the door is locked and mr hartshorn himself the manager has taken the key  there isnt such a thing as a duplicate i suppose deane asked  not that i know of sir the man answered  you couldnt suggest any means by which i could enter that room even if it were an affair of say fifty pounds to you deane asked calmly  the man started fifty pounds was a great deal of money on the other hand the fifty pounds would take some earning i am afraid i cant sir he said there is no duplicate key that i know of and in any case i dare not run the risk  fifty pounds is not enough perhaps deane said money is no particular object to me if you said that you thought you could provide me with the key for a hundred pounds i would willingly pay it  i am afraid not sir the man answered turning as though to leave the room  two hundred pounds deane said  it isnt a matter of money sir the man declared i darent do it i should be certain to be found out and i should be sent away without a character  i will take you into my service deane said  the man shook his head thank you sir he said my character is worth a good deal to me i think ill keep out of this if you dont mind  deane called him back imperatively let us understand one another he said drawing something from his pocket are you going down to the manager to tell him what i have told you  the man hesitated deane held out a fivepound note there is no reason for you to do so you know deane said just as there is no reason why you should not accept this tip  the valet hesitated and finally accepted the fivepound note which deane was holding out  i am sure i dont know why i should take it sir he said but there is no reason after all why i should say anything of what you have been talking about downstairs  deane sat in his chair waiting there was a knock at the door and a chambermaid entered to retire at once in confusion deane looked at her curiously something in her figure and her start had seemed familiar to him he got up and rang the bell in a moment or two a waiter appeared he was obviously a german dark and sallow he spoke imperfect english and there was a gleam of cupidity in his eyes which to deane seemed hopeful  bring me some tea at once he orderednothing to eat  the man departed and reappeared in a few minutes  anything else sir he asked after he had set down the tray  deane did not answer him directly by the way he said finally wasnt there a murder committed in one of these rooms  it was next door sir the man answered  the room is locked up deane asked  yes sir  that is a pity deane remarked do you know who has the key i should very much like just to have a look around  the waiter shook his head the key is downstairs in mr hartshorns office sir and we have no duplicate here the police who came they desired that no one should enter the room until they had removed the effects to scotland yard  so i was told downstairs deane remarked do you suppose he continued that it would be possible to get hold of a duplicate key i should like very much to see the interior of that roomif possible to take a photograph of it for my newspaper i am willing to pay  the waiter shook his head reluctantly i do not think that there is a duplicate key he said with his eyes fixed upon deanes right hand  perhaps you could make inquiries deane suggested smoothly i want to get a photograph of the inside of the room for my people if possible it would be worth quite a great deal of money  the man was impressed i will go away and see he said slowly  keep this to yourself deane ordered i dont want it all over the hotel  the man made a sign of assent and withdrew deane rang for the chambermaid once twice three times he rang without response then a middleaged person came shuffling in very much out of breath deane gave her some trivial order  by the way he asked are you the chambermaid who waits on this room  no she answered with some hesitation the regular chambermaid is down at her breakfast  deane nodded will you tell her he asked that i should like to see her as soon as she is up i want to see about some laundry he added  the woman disappeared deane was left alone once more he unpacked some books and made himself comfortable in an easychair he was not able even to descend to the smokingroom mr stirling deane it was well known had left town for scotland mr b stocks who had arrived at the hotel the night before and taken this room was a person who had particular reasons for not desiring to be seen even in the precincts of the hotel deane settled himself down to reada somewhat difficult task by the time he had smoked several cigarettes there was a soft tap at the door and the waiter reappeared  i beg your pardon sir he said  go ahead deane answered  i have found a key in the serviceroom which i think would open number 27  deane nodded very well he said let me have the use of it tonight and i will give you twenty pounds  the man moistened his lips with his tongue twenty pounds was a wonderful sum but  there is a good deal of risk about it sir the man said slowly and i have to divide with the nightporter who told me where to find this key  very well deane answered i will give you twenty pounds eachno more  the man placed the key silently in his hands and deane counted out eight fivepound notes  if i were you sir he said if you want to be alone in the room and be sure of no one seeing you i should use it between four and five tomorrow morning everyone is off duty then except the nightporter  deane nodded by the way he said do you know anything about the chambermaid on this floorthe young slim one  the waiter shook his head she has only just come  do you know her name asked deane  the man smiled it is always the same he answeredalways mary  she would not be allowed in 27 deane asked she would not be likely to be there to clean it out or anything of that sort  the man shook his head again no one is allowed to enter it he said no one has been in but the detectives and lawyers  deane dismissed the man and settled down once more to his reading he found it difficult however to concentrate his thoughts the key was on the chair by his side it was all he could do to restrain himself from stealing down the corridor and commencing his search     chapter xix  the search   deane remembered afterwards with a painful exactness every step which he took in his stockinged feet down the dimlylit corridor only one of the electric lights had been left burning and that one was encased in a shade of red glass and was set in the wall facing him a few seconds ago he had heard big ben strike four oclock for the last two hours he had sat in his room and waited time seemed to have stood still in that two hours he had seen himself stripped of all his possessions dishonored friendless he had seen himself married to lady olive richer and more prosperous than ever a successful politician a man on whom the eyes of the world were turned always with respect and approval hope and fear had swung in his mind like the movement of a pendulum all that he needed was that paper if once he could see it burning into white ashes or torn into a hundred pieces he knew that there was nothing in the world strong enough to bar his progress  four oclock at last at the sound of the hour he had sprung to his feet before the echoes of the last stroke had died away he was absolutely committed to his enterprise for a moment he stood outside the door of his room which he had left ajar he looked toward the main corridor and listened intently there was no sound to be heard the night watchmanif indeed he were making his roundswas nowhere in that vicinity in all the great hotel not a soul seemed to be stirring  deane drew one long breath and without a seconds hesitation stole forward until he stood in front of number 27 once more he looked around him the lights from all the transoms in sight had been extinguished there was only that dimly burning electric light at the end of the corridor to dissipate the gloom he fitted the key into the lock and turned it the door swung open deane closed it behind him turned on the electric light and gazed around him with fast beating heart he was there at last within this room if anywhere was his salvation  it was after all a very ordinary hotel apartment there was a small single bed a wardrobe a toilet table and chest of drawers a hard uninvitinglooking sofa and an easychair with a stiff back and armless upon the bed were laid out a number of articles of wearing apparel and upon the floor were two empty portmanteaus upon the dressingtable were a number of papers arranged with some appearance of method the toilet things were still in their places everything was arranged in a stiff and precise condition it was evident that official hands had been at work  deanes rapid glance around lasted barely a few seconds then he moved toward the dressingtable and commenced a careful search amongst the papers there one by one he glanced them througha bill for clothes a restaurant account halfadozen counterfoils of theatre and musichall tickets an account for wines and cigars consumed on the steamer arizona homeward bound from cape town there was the address of a manicurist a programme of the empire very soon deane had come to the end of them from the first to the last there was not a single document there of any interest or importance  he turned away toward the clothes which were laid out upon the bed one by one he lifted them up and laid them down again until he came to the gray suit which the man sinclair had been wearing on the day when he had made his eventful visit to the city deane held up the coat and a little exclamation almost escaped from his lips as he saw where in a certain place the lining showed signs of stitching as though something had been sewn inside the pocket he thrust his hand there there was an opening but it was empty he tried the other side but in vain then he began slowly to realize that this search of his was doomed to end in failure there was nowhere else to look he glanced at his watch although it seemed to him that he had been in the little room for hours he had indeed been there for barely five minutes  he moved toward the door opened it softly and listened outside in the corridor there was no sound of anyone stirring no sign of life or movement anywhere he returned to the room and renewed his search one by one he lifted up the different articles of clothing and felt in the pockets his search was rewarded with the discovery of a single halfpenny in an odd waistcoat pocket he left the clothes alone then and went through the papers once more with a similar lack of success softly he opened all the drawers ransacked the wardrobe searched every inch of the room when at last he desisted it was because there was nowhere else to look nothing else to attempt he stood up in the middle of the room and drew a little breath he had found nothing nothing had transpired to compensate in any way for the risk which he had run yet there was one consolation it was scarcely possible that ruby sinclair could be more successful than he the paper which might make her fortune and ruin him was not here  deane turned at last toward the door there was no need for him to prolong the risk he ran he would return to his room and leave the hotel later in the morning  he took a few cautious steps toward the door suddenly he stopped short and held his breath very slowly he turned his head and listened intently someone was stirring in the next room there was a connecting door hidden by a curtain and even as he stood there he heard the handle shake as though it were being turned he leaned forward and turned out the electric light standing there in the darkness he distinctly heard a key inserted in the lock of the hidden door he heard it softly opened and the curtain pushed back there was someone else in the room someone else whom he could not see someone else who also took an interest in the effects of the murdered man  there was an interval of several secondsit seemed minutesit might well have been hours then the stealthy footsteps came towards him a little stiff rustle of draperies proclaimed the sex of the intruder without a seconds warning the electric light flashed out all over the room the girl would have screamed but deane who was prepared leaned forward and his hand suddenly closed over her mouth she looked at him with dilated eyes  you she exclaimed you  good god he answered winifred rowan  their mutual surprise was something paralyzing they drew apart and looked at one another as they might have done at ghosts  what do you want here he asked hoarsely  was it his fancy he wondered or did her lips curl for a moment in something like mockery  i came to repay a debt she whispered i came to find the paper which you are afraid may fall into someone elses hands i came to search for it but it is not here  and i deane answered  you have found it perhaps she exclaimed  he shook his head it has gone  perhaps he never had it she whispered  deane shook his head he was being led away by the excitement the tenseness of the momentthe unexpectedness of the whole situation he showed it to me he answered only just before that night  ah  the monosyllable seemed to leave her lips dry she moistened them with her tongue and moved a little towards him there was something in her face which he could not recognize and then before further speech was possible they heard something which coming so unexpectedly against such a background of silence terrified them both an electric bell somewhere close at hand was ringing out its sharp summons into the night  what is that deane asked quickly  someone is ringing from one of the numbers opposite she answered get back to your room quickly they have heard us talking someone will be in here to search  but you he objected  i am safe she answered i am on duty on this floor i have something to do in the next room quick  he slipped from the door the little side corridor was as yet empty for a second or two he listened intently there were no footsteps as yet audible in the main corridor in halfadozen swift strides he reached the door of his own room turned the handle and passed inside almost immediately there were footsteps in the corridor outside the bell of the room opposite was answered again silence the seconds grew into minutes and the minutes passed away then his door was suddenly opened from the outside softly and silently winifred rowan stood there on the threshold of his room with the handle of the door still in her hand and to his fancy there was something ominous in the way she looked at him  you need search no more she said i have found the paper  he held out his hand the reward is yours he declared  she drew away from him i shall claim it very soon she said ring your bell at seven oclock when i shall be on duty and i will bring it to you hush  she glided away and closed the door deane drew a long breath so it was over thenover and he had won     chapter xx  in doubt   punctually at seven oclock next morning deane rang his bell once more the fat old lady entered with her amiable smile and slow movements  some tea sir she asked  deane looked at her for a moment without speaking when does the other chambermaid come on duty he asked  she ought to be on now was the answer but she hasnt come ive just sent the boots up to her room  deane ordered some hot water and lay still for halfanhour then he rang the bell again the same woman came  would you like your tea sir she asked  if you please he answered  she was already halfway out of the door before he stopped her  you are still on duty then he said  the other chambermaid cant be found sir she answered her bed hasnt been slept in and she doesnt seem to be anywhere about the place  deane nodded it was after all perhaps the most sensible thing she could do to get clear away send me my tea at eight oclock he ordered and let me have a bath at once  the valet shall come and tell you when it is ready sir she answered  he passed a tip across to the woman who accepted it tell the waiter when he brings the tea to give me my bill he said  in an hours time deane had left the hotel he had seen nothing more of winifred rowan and on the whole he was disposed to applaud her precaution he drove at once to his rooms where grant his man was already installed  i shall catch the midday train to scotland grant he announced telephone up for seats and sleepingberths also telephone to the office and tell them to ring up here at once if a young lady should make any inquiries for me perhaps they had better send her on here  he went out and did some shopping the sun was shining and a soft west wind blowing london which seems to hold its populace longer than any other great city was gay almost joyous he had to elbow his way through crowds as he passed along piccadilly the streets and shops were thronged the sky above was blue the rare sunshine seemed to make cheerful even this most sombre of cities  deane had the feeling of a man who has escaped from a great dangerwho has been able to throw off a heavy weight this miserable document of sinclairs was as good as in his possession after all basil rowan was not suffering in vain the girl should have every penny that he had promised her brother her way in life should be made easy it was a very small price indeed to be free from such torture as he had suffered during the last few weeks he bought presents a little recklesslypresents for olivesomething too for winifred rowan a gold cigarettecase for himself he ordered a great basket of flowers to take with him to scotland and paid a visit to his gunmakers then he returned to his chambers fully expecting to have some news of winifred rowan  any one rung up he asked his man  no one sir of any importance was the answer  did you ask the office about miss rowan  no young lady at all has inquired for you there sir grant answered  deane was a little surprised but after all what did it matter he travelled up to scotland with a lighter heart than he had carried for months lady olive who met him early in the morning at the small wayside station which was nearest to her fathers seat was amazed at his vivacity  i expected to find you a pale wornout thing she remarked as their motorcar climbed the white stonebordered road which crossed the heathercovered mountain you dont look as though you needed a change at all  ive found so swift a tonic you see he answered pressing her hand  she laughed gayly this was more the man as he had been before the days of their engagement i think it is the smell of the powder she said you men are all like schoolboys for your holidays father says that the birds are much too wild and that it will be all even you can do to hit them  deane smiled there is nothing in the world he answered which i want to do so much as to lie up there in the heather and close my eyes and feel the sun and the wind  in other words she said you are lazy  is that laziness he asked i dont think so  rest then she said  ah that is a very different thing he replied we all need rest  especially you she said who carry about with you always the memory of some things from which you can never escape  he looked at her quickly but it was obvious that her speech was wholly unpremeditated  i often wonder she said calmly when i see you in the evenings how you manage to shake off all your anxieties so easily for i suppose she continued that success like everything else carries always its anxieties  sometimes more than failure he answered  well she continued it doesnt seem possible to associate the word failure with you some day you must tell me the whole story of your life i can scarcely believe that there has ever been a time when you havent succeeded in anything you undertook  he laughed grimly you should have been with me in africa he said after the fighting was over we expected to go about picking up gold almost on the streets  you were too sanguine she laughed  it was hard enough work to live he answered i tried many thingsfailures all of them  until the little anna goldmine she remarked  until the little anna goldmine he assented and that at first seemed hopeless enough the mine had been deserted twice the natives there had a name for it which means the grave of dead hopes  they turned into the avenue and the house was at once visible standing on the edge of a lake large and a little bare the lawns and gardens were brilliant with color and the hills on the other side of the water were purple with heather  well here is all the rest you want she said we havent a neighbor within six miles and a most harmless lot of guests  he drew a long sigh of content the tragedy indeed of the last few weeks seemed to lie far behind in some other world     chapter xxi  ruby is disappointed   the solicitor hung up his silk hat motioned his two visitors to seats and took his accustomed place in front of his writingtable i am afraid he said turning toward mr sarsby but in reality addressing his niece that your visit to town has been in some respects a disappointment to you especially he continued bearing in mind the letter which you my dear young lady have just shown me still there is no getting away from facts we have carefully examined every paper and every portion of the personal belongings of the deceased and i am afraid we must come to the decision that there is nothing in those effects worth taking away  it certainly seems not mr sarsby assented i must say that from the first i have discouraged my niece in her expectations i never knew sinclair but everyone spoke of him as being a shiftless and impossible sort of person  the lawyer nodded from the state of his effects he remarked that seems very possible and yet one cannot help wondering what it was that he had in his mind when he wrote to your niecewhat it was too that induced him to take rooms in a hotel like the universal  ruby sinclair rose slowly to her feet she came to the table before which the solicitor was seated and she looked down at him with blazing eyes cant you see you two she exclaimedcant you understand that the man has been robbed of something he would never have written me in that strain if he had not believed that he possessed something which was at any rate worth money and a great deal of money he would never with only twenty pounds in his pocket have gone to a hotel like the universal drunk champagne there and lived as though his means were unlimited these things are ridiculous  but my dear young lady the lawyer commenced  cant you see the truth she exclaimed my uncle was murdered why what was the motive robbery do you think that it was for the sake of the twenty pounds or so that he had on him and which were found untouched the man rowan was in south africa with my unclehe knew his business it was no ordinary quarrel this i tell you that rowan robbed my uncle of somethingi dont know whatbut something which was the backbone of this letter she exclaimed dashing it upon the tablesomething which justified him in staying at the universal something which must be found  the lawyer nodded that point of view he admitted has occurred to me i must confess and yet you must remember that the man rowan was arrested upon the premises he had nothing with him which could by any chance have belonged to the dead man  the girl stamped her foot impatiently have you read the evidence at the trial she asked it is very clear that this man rowan was no fool whatever he wanted from my uncle he secured and disposed of before he was arrested the last thing he would do would be to carry about with him on his person anything which he had taken from my uncle  what you suggest may be possible of course the lawyer remarked but unfortunately we have not the slightest indication of it the man rowan was not seen to speak to anyone in the hotel and it is known that he did not leave it after the quarrel until his arrest  and you are content to leave it like that the girl asked  the lawyer shrugged his shoulders it is not that we are content he said a little stiffly but there certainly seems to be no cause for any further action  the girl turned to mr sarsby we had better go she said abruptly there is nothing to be gained by staying here  the solicitor accompanied them to the door miss sinclair he said i can sympathize with your disappointment but i do beg of you not to go looking for a mares nest it is disappointing of course to find that your uncle was practically a pauper especially after that letter of his but on the other hand men in his position i am afraid are proverbially given to exaggeration  thank you the girl said sharply i think that we will not talk about this any more  mr sarsby and his niece walked slowly up a little side street which led into the strand the former who was sharing to some extent his nieces disappointment found compensation in the thought of a speedy return to rakney  i am afraid ruby he said that you are very much disappointed and it seems to me that we have wasted our railway fares to london it cant be helped we may as well make the best of it and get back at once i can see no reason why we should not catch the three oclock train i shall be able to play my match then with colonel forsitt tomorrow morning  you can go and play your match if you want to the girl answered i am going to stay in london  to stay in london mr sarsby repeated  i mean it the girl answered i dont mean to be robbed i mean to stay here and find out why this man rowan quarrelled with my uncle and what my uncle meant when he wrote to me about a fortune you go back if you like she continued give me five pounds to stay here with and ill come back when ive found out the truth  mr sarsby was aghast he looked at his niece with wideopen eyes what had come to her that she should speak of such a sum as five pounds almost carelessly  i shall do nothing of the sort he answered decidedly nor shall i allow you to stay up here alonea most improper proceeding i should call itquite unheard of we will go back to the hotel pay our bill have a little lunch at an a b c shop and catch the three oclock train home  if you wont let me have the five pounds she answered all right goodbye  she turned abruptly away and before his astonished eyes plunged into the stream of traffic making for the other side of the street he followed her as soon as he saw a safe opening and found her on the point of entering a small restaurant  my dear ruby he exclaimed sharply you are mad how dared you leave me like that  she shrugged her shoulders i have been mad she answered to live that awful life down at rakney for these last few years ive had enough of it uncle i am here and i am going to stay here if i cant succeed in what i am going to undertake i shall try and find some work  mr sarsby gasped it was a wholly unexpected revolt you mean to say that you dont want to come back to rakney  never if i can help it the girl answered i hate the place i hate the life i am tired sick to death of it all she cried passionately and i would as soon come up here and live for a week or two and then throw myself into the thames as go on with it any longer if you wont let me have the five pounds she continued i have enough jewelry with me to fetch about that the money would only mean a week or two longer  but where would you live he exclaimed what would you do  that is my affair she answered simply first of all though i should go to mr deane and i should ask him to help me any man of common sense would agree with me at once in believing that my uncle was robbed  but your aunt mr sarsby exclaimed weakly  my aunt can get on very well without me the girl declared  mr sarsby felt that a situation had arisen with which he was unable to cope the only thing that occurred to him to do was to temporize you will have to come back to the hotel he said to get your luggage we will talk it over on the way there  just as you please the girl answered carelessly only so far as i am concerned there is nothing to talk over  mr sarsby hailed a bus which deposited them presently within a few yards of the semiprivate hotel in montague street at which they were staying it was one of those establishments which from being a small boardinghouse had blossomed out into a hotel with all the outward signs of its more prosperous rivals there was an entrance hall a reception office and two longlimbed giants in light blue livery who spoke every language except their own the people who frequented it were either americans or people from the isolated country places such as mr sarsby and his niece  i am not going to talk anything over until i have had some lunch the girl declared we need not go out it is only eighteenpence each here you can afford that especially as you are probably going to be rid of me forever  mr sarsby frowned we will lunch here if you prefer it he said i am not aware that i have hesitated at anything on the score of expense  the girl laughed there was a note in her mirth which was strange to mr sarsby he relinquished his wellworn silk hat to a boy in buttons straightened his oldfashioned tie before a passing mirror and led the girl into the diningroom the size of the apartment the number of the waiters the indefinable sense of being in a great city which had oppressed him since the train had rolled into the terminus on his arrival once more had its effect upon him he felt sure that his niece understood nothing of what she was talking about he drank bottled beer with his lunch and soon summoned up courage to reopen the matter  it was a very good idea of yours my dear ruby he said to lunch here i am sure that for the money it is a most excellent meal  she gave vent to a little interjection which might have meant anything if he had not been so sure that she was unused to such magnificence he would have believed that it was intended to indicate a certain amount of contempt at her entertainment  and now mr sarsby continued let me speak to you seriously  the suggestion that there had been anything of mirth from which mr sarsby desired to lead the way appealed to the girls sense of humor her lips parted and the sullen discontent of her face was for a moment lightened  very well she said let us be serious go on tell me what you have to say  what i want to put before you is briefly this he declared you do not understand the impossibility of a young girl barely twenty years old with yourhe coughed a littlepersonal attractions being left alone in london of course it is difficult for me to explain to you exactly what i mean  you neednt the girl interrupted contemptuously do you think that i am a fool i know all about those risks which people speak about with bated breath and i should like you to know that i am quite able to take care of myself i am not afraid so i do not know why anyone need be afraid for me  mr sarsby looked at her and wondered where amongst the wastes and windswept places of his lonely home had the girl acquired the knowledge which she alluded to so scornfullyhad she learned too he reflected to carry herself as she had done since their arrival with an ease and assurance which he had tried in vain to emulate he realized at that moment that all further argument would be wasted nevertheless he continued to ease his conscience  you may know a good deal he said or think you dogirls nowadays read and talk of most surprising thingsbut london is not a safe place for a young girl whatever you may say especially a young girl without enough money to live on  i suppose she said laughing at him openly that rakney is a safe place well i have tried it for a good many years and i have had enough you neednt be afraid she continued that i shall return to rakney in the guise of a prodigal daughter if i dont succeed in tracing richard sinclairs fortune i shall find something else to do if you will give me the five pounds i ask for it will make things easier if not i shall get on without it  he felt that he was being weak even his conscience told him that greater firmness was necessary and yet he recognized something in the girls demeanor which assured him absolutely that any protests were hopeless there was a hidden strength there shared by neither her aunt nor himselfsomething which kept her apart from themwhich made him half believe in spite of himself that what she set herself to do she would accomplish  at least he said we must know where you are going to live  there is no need for you to stay in london she answered while i look about for a room i know exactly the sort of place i am going to take i am going out in the tube to one of the suburbs where a bedroom is not very expensive and i shall take my meals out it will cost me very little to live and five pounds will go quite a long way by the time it is spent i think that i shall have discovered something i will not write you for any more money i promise  mr sarsby sighed i suppose you must have your own way he said i dont know what your aunt will say  she laughed they had finished their luncheon and had risen from the table enough about my aunt she said she will have all the anxiety of her preserves upon her mind directly and i think she will be glad not to be bothered with me you catch your three oclock train and play your golf match tomorrow  i suppose i may as well he said weakly although i never can putt after a railway journey  go and try anyhow she answered we will say goodbye to one another here if you dont mind the porter will take care of my luggage until i have taken my room  i suppose if i were to stay up with you for a few days he began  please uncle dont she began firmly it isnt any use you have been kind to me in your way but the life at rakney is horrible to me i have made up my mind to have no more of it youve done your best for me you cant do more goodbye there is your bag and you havent too much time to catch the three oclock train take the first turn to the left from here and book to kings cross by the tube goodbye  mr sarsby picked up his bag and departed without any further protest the girl stood upon the steps and watched him and as she watched some of the darkness seemed to pass away from her face he disappeared around the corner she was alonefree at any rate she drew a long breath and the dull streets and gray sky seemed suddenly to have become like the walls and canopy of a new paradise     book two     chapter i  free to die   at about quarter past ten in the morning a man still young but deathly pale with hollow cheeks and receding eyes stood on the edge of the pavement outside a great and gloomylooking building a nailstudded door had just been opened and closed to let him pass the attendant who wore prison livery leaned forward curiously to look at him as he walked out with uncertain footsteps the prison doctor stood by his side and called a fourwheel cab  you are sure he said that you have somewhere to go to rowan  quite sure sir the man answered  keep your courage up my man added the doctor if your friends can afford it go down to the south at once you will find it easier there theres your cab you have some money have you not  plenty thank you doctor rowan answered youve been kind to me sir he added thank you  there wasnt much i could do the doctor answered helping him into the cab except to get you out of this hole make the most of your time now good luck to you  the cab rolled off rowan after the first few minutes exhaustion due to his unaccustomed preparations leaned forward on the seat looking out with hungry wistful eyes upon the world which he had scarcely hoped to see again very soon the full flood of london traffic was flowing past him the streams of men and women jostling one another upon the pavements the long tangled thread of moving vehicles taximeter cabs hansoms and wagons the sun was shining the faces of the people seemed to him accustomed to the white hopeless countenances of the men he had passed in his daily exercises and in the prison infirmary unusually buoyant and cheerful it was a glad world this into which he had come a world which he was so soon to leave it was hard to think he was free only that he might crawl away into some corner where he could die  the cab stopped at last before a block of offices in a bystreet of the city rowan reluctantly alighted and crossing the pavement entered the building he passed through a swing door to a desk a small boy poked his head out of an inquiry office  can you tell me if miss rowan is employed here rowan asked  yes but you cant see her the small boy answered shes in with the guvnor now  rowan hesitated perhaps you will kindly tell her when she is disengaged he said that her brother is here and would like to speak to her for a moment  the officeboy withdrew his head but he seemed uncertain rowan seated himself upon a hard bench set against the wall on a small round table in front of him were pens and paper and a copy of the trade journal rowan turned over its pages listlessly for a moment or two and then set himself down to wait it was quite halfanhour before a door in front of him opened and winifred rowan appeared she looked at her brother in blank astonishment she was paler than ever there were dark rings under her dilated eyes she looked at him as one looks upon some strange monstrosity  basil she murmured it cant be you and yetbasil  it is i he answered  free she cried  he laughed a little bitterly they have let me out to die he answered the doctor today signed a certificate that i have no reasonable chance of living longer than another month so here i am free winifred if you like to call it freedom  she came and sat on the bench by his side at that moment it was hard to say from their appearance which of the two seemed the nearer death  when were you released she asked  halfanhour ago he answered i came straight here i wondered whether you could get a months vacation and come with me somewhere south we have enough money for a little time  if they will not let me go she answered i will leave that is simple enough we have enough money basil we will go this afternoon  he shook his head first he said i must seei must see  whom she asked  a friend he answered someone who may be inclined to do something for menot for myself he added hastilythat of course is ridiculousbut it is of you i am thinking of you after i am gone  i shall be all right basil she said we have several hundred pounds left you know  it is not enough he answered firmly winifred will you go on an errand for me  where to she asked with a sudden sinking of her heart  to a man whose address i will give youa rich man a great man i think that he will be willing to do something for us his name is stirling deane i will write his address down for you  mr deane she repeated i have been before to see him basil i went before your reprieve came  of course he said i had forgotten well i want you to go up to him now i want to see him but i do not want to go to his offices where do you live winifred  it is an apartment house for women only she answered i cannot take you there  then we must go to a hotel he said it seems a mockery to buy clothes but there are one or two things i must have tomorrow we will go somewhere south  she glanced at the clock i will see whether i can get away now she said  she disappeared and came out again in a few minutes with her hat on come she said  he led her to the cab outside we will drive to a hotel he said when we have taken some rooms you shall go and see mr deane i think that he will come to me if you will tell him that i am free that i have only three weeks to live and that i should like to see him  very well she answered  they stepped into the cab tell him to drive to one of the large hotels rowan saidany except the universal  she shuddered as she gave the order she too had her memories of the universal of which he knew nothing slowly they made their way westwards the girl held his hand in hers  it is good to see you again basil she said  it is good to be here again he answered to be out in the world even though it be to die i suppose the authorities have really been kind to me it is as much as anyone could expect and yet winifred i should like you to remember this always the quarrel between sinclair and myself was of his seekingnot mine the blow of which he died was struck purely in selfdefence i could box and he couldnt or he would have half killed me that night  i know she answered breathlessly dont talk of it  he went on as though not hearing her he came at me with both hands clenched and i hit him under the chin i had to or he would have killed me if he could he was a strong man and he had been drinking until he was half mad it was not my fault winifred  oh i know that she said try and forget it now it was a wicked wicked accident  life has been wicked enough for you and me lately he answered sighing you are worn to a shadow winifred i suppose it is this wretched typing day by day we must put an end to it  she shook her head i must earn a living dear she said but dont bother about me i shall be all right see he has stopped this must beyes it is the grand hotel will that do  he nodded quite well he answered  he paid the cabman and making some excuse at the office about luggage to come took rooms then he put winifred into a hansom and wrote down for her deanes address which she already knew  bring him back with you if you can he begged bring him back here i shall be waiting in the readingroom just round the corner there to the right  she hesitated you look so faint basil she said i am not sure whether i ought to leave you  i am going to have some brandy and milk he answered i am going to sit down and have it there in that corner i shall wait till you come you will know where to look for me hurry dear please i shall know no peace until i have seen deane     chapter ii  a lapse of memory   deane sat at his desk immersed once more in the affairs of his great business his cheeks were bronzed with the sun and heatherscented wind his eyes were clear and bright all traces of the unsettlement of those few nervous weeks seemed to have passed away one thing only occasionally disturbed himthe nonappearance of winifred rowan since those few seconds of tremulous excitement when they had stood face to face in the darkened room of the hotel he had neither seen nor heard from her he could understand her having left the hotel hurriedly he could have understood her keeping away for a day or two but a whole month had passed and she had taken no steps whatever to communicate with him he had left exact instructions as to what was to be done should she come to the office while he was in scotland he had had the whole of his private letters forwarded lest by chance a word from her should fail to reach him there was something a little ominous in this absolute silence something which troubled him occasionally which set him thinking wondering whether under that still quiet demeanor there might be qualities of which he had taken no accountwhether indeed she too were not a schemer who meant to make the most of this opportunity which chance had thrown in her way  a clerk entered and stood at his side a young lady is here to see you sir he announcedmiss rowan  miss rowan deane repeated mechanically  yes sir the clerk answered we have instructions outside to let you know if she called at any time  deane leaned back in his chair with a few quick words he dismissed his secretary from the immediate business in hand you may show miss rowan in he said  a moment or two later she entered deane watched her with a new curiosity as he rose to his feet she was as quietly dressed as usual as pale and her eyes except for one upward glance seemed always to be seeking the carpet there was something curiously negative about her appearancesomething it seemed to him almost wilfully so the rich brown hair which had flashed almost to golden in the morning sunlight at rakney was drawn up and concealed as though the owners sole object was that it might escape attention her clothes were not unbecoming but they were the quietest of their sort her eyes which should have been beautiful were so perpetually veiled and hidden that their quality was lost both physically and in her reticent speech she appealed to him more than ever that morning as a woman whose desire seemed to be to creep through life unnoticed  at last he remarked holding out his hand pleasantly i have been expecting to see you for some time miss rowan  you have been expecting to see me she repeated raising her eyes to his how strange  why strange he answered glancing around the room and lowering his voice a little dont you remember at our last meeting you promised to bring my tea a few hours later since then i have not even seen you nor have you sent me a line  she raised her eyes again and looked at him they were very beautiful eyes but he did not understand the somewhat blank expression which shone out of them i do not understand you she said quietly  deane would have been irritated but something in her manner struck him as so strange that his feeling turned to one of bewilderment come he said you are not going to suggest that i have been dreaming or that you have had one of these fashionable lapses of memory you remember meeting me in that room in the universal hotel  without change of countenance or expression she answered i have never been in the universal hotel in my life  deane looked at her his lips a little parted and as he looked his feeling of bewilderment grew my dear young lady he protested do you mean to tell me  you have been mistaking me for someone else i think she said calmly there are so many people about who are like me we will not talk of this just now if you do not mind i have come to you from my brother  well said deane  my brother is free she went on he was released at nine oclock this morning the doctor at the prison signed a certificate that he has only a month or so to live he is free on the understanding that he goes away to some quiet place he came to me an hour ago it is at his wish that i am here  go on deane rapped out  he wishes to see you she said that is all he does not think that there is any risk about it under the circumstances we are staying for the night at the grand hotel tomorrow we shall go down to devonshire or cornwall he will be glad if you will come and see him as soon as possible  i will come deane said but first miss rowan i must have an understanding with you  an understanding with me she repeated slowly  naturally he answered i want to know first of all whether you are my friend or my enemywhether in short you mean to play the blackmailer or whether you mean to return to me that document which you abstracted from amongst sinclairs effects  she drew a little sigh i am quite sure now mr deane she said that you are mistaking me for someone else i do not know what you are talking about  deane was silent for several moments he was feeling nervous and disturbed there was something uncanny about this quiet persistent denialthe still face the steadfast beautiful eyes which seemed yet like unlit fires devoid of sympathy or apprehension  i scarcely know deane said how we are to continue this discussion for some reason or other you are sitting there within a few feet of me and denying something which we both know to be the truth you have a motive i suppose but whatever that motive may be you cannot imperil it by speaking openly here we are absolutely alone there is not a soul within hearing you and i both know miss rowan that you hold that paper to obtain which your brother risked his life and met with such misfortune it would be his wish i know that you should give it to me the terms i offered him for its recovery were surely liberal if you think otherwise tell me your price we are alone you are not giving yourself away tell me your price  i have no price mr deane she said because i have no paper i am not a thief nor have i stolen anything from anybody all that you say is strange to me my brother is waiting and he is very ill will you come with me now or will you follow as soon as you can  deane leaned back in his chair and laughed it was not altogether a natural laugh but it was the only relief he could find from his overwrought feelings what sort of a game you and i are going to play miss rowan i cannot imagine he said i have made the first and the obvious move and you have declared your opening we must let it go at that i suppose when you are disposed to talk common sense i and my chequebook will be glad to listen to you in the meantime let me beg of you one thing and that is keep that paper in some safe place  she rose to her feet with a little sigh you are mistaking me for someone else mr deane she said  he crossed the room and fetched his hat and gloves from a cupboard he glanced into a lookingglass for a moment to straighten his tie and met the girls eyes fixed upon him he stood quite still watching she was looking at him at his back as he stood there there was expression in her face at last an expression which puzzled him which he failed altogether to understand he stood quite still with his fingers still upon the sailor knot of his tie as though she realized the possibilities of the mirror she suddenly turned around when he came towards her the mask if it was a mask was there once more  if you will come with me said he i should be glad to go and see your brother  they passed through the offices side by side many curious eyes followed them deane paused at one or two of the desks to leave a few parting instructions then he handed the girl into the electric brougham which was waiting at the door  the grand hotel he told the man  he got in and seated himself by her side miss rowan he said you are beginning to interest me exceedingly  i am sure that you cannot be in earnest she answered without turning her head i am a most uninteresting person living a most uninteresting life  i think you said that you were a typist he remarked  i am she answered i am employed by messrs rubicon  moore in st marys passage i have been there for three years  with occasional holidays he remarked with a smile  she shook her head the only holiday i have taken she answered was when i came to see you  he deliberately leaned forward to look into her face the memory of that moment when he had held her in his arms the breaking of the storm the thrill the wonderful unanalyzed excitement which seemed to play about them like the lightning which was soon to flash across the sea and land came back to him he looked deliberately into her facestill as the graveat the large eyes which were listlessly fixed upon the streaming people  you are the most amazing person he said softly perhaps as you were never at the hotel universal you were never in rakney perhaps it was not you who came to me with the storm who tapped at my window who stood there like the daughter of the storm itself who  it was i who came to rakney she said you know that very well mr deane neither have i forgotten it but i think that you should not remind me just now of that  of course she was right but deane felt a little unhinged her invulnerability was maddening perhaps not he answered perhaps i have no right to remind you of that night of the time when you crept in from the storm crept into my arms  she turned her head slightly away as though interested in the passing throng no flush of color tinged her cheeks her straight firm lips never trembled he tried to take her handsmall it was and encased in old neatlymended gloves she drew it quietly but firmly away she remained silent  perhaps i have no right he continued to remind you of these things but neither have you the right to deny our later meeting you are playing some sort of a game with me he continued a little roughly and your methods whatever they may be include a lie therefore i myself take license  if you have quite finished mr deane she said i should be glad my visit to you and all the circumstances connected with it is one of the things which i wish to forget  to relegate to the same place in your memory he remarked as your brief essay in the rôle of a chambermaid  she leaned out of the window here we are she remarked i am anxious about my brother please hurry     chapter iii  a painful interview   rowan sat still in his corner and although the hotel could not be called fashionableperhaps in these later days scarcely luxuriousthe little ebb and flow of life upon which he looked seemed tinged with a peculiar bitterness his hollow eyes followed each group of these men and women so full of vivacity of happiness of affairs the envy in his heart was like a real and passionate thing it was an envy scarcely founded upon comparisons for them was lifefor him was none in front of him always was that ghastly unchanging verdict a monthtwo at the mostthirty days of illhealth of suffering of weakness and after thatwhat he caught his breath with a little shudder and calling a passing waiter ordered some brandy he looked around and longed to find someone to speak to someone to occupy his attention for a single moment to stop the flow of gruesome fancies which seemed always biting their way into his brain he had faced death readily enough in those old days when deane and he had ridden side by side and the bullets had whizzed around them like rain and the dead men lay in heaps but this was different the blood ran warm in their veins then their hearts were strong he had no strength now to battle with these fancies no strength to do anything but cower before the slowly coming grisly shadow of his fate he looked continually at the door longing always for the return of his sister and the coming of deane even the prison hospital was better than this  a girl passed by young and beautiful carrying in her arms a little dog she threw a compassionate glance at rowan and he felt the sweat break out upon his forehead it was too awful this he was rising to his feet even as deane and his sister entered the lounge he moved toward them with uncertain footsteps  we must have a sittingroom he said i cannot face these people i am beginning to feel a coward  deane went to the office and very soon they found themselves upon the third floor in an apartment overlooking northumberland avenue gorgeous with plush and gilt mirrors stiffly arranged chairs an ornate chiffonnier rowan who had come up in the lift muttering to himself but obviously anxious for silence from his two companions threw himself almost as the door closed upon the hard couch  i am broken he cried out i am broken  winifred sank on her knees by his side her arms went round his neck deane turned away and walked to the window a little awkwardly somehow he felt that it would be taking a mean advantage if he should look into her face though all the time he was longing to see if her eyes had really softened if those lips were really trembling a little lips that were pressed to her brothers forehead  basil she whispered you mustnt bear up please mr deane is here he has come with me sit up and talk to him  rowan pulled himself together he sat up and deane obeying a gesture from her crossed the room once more  rowan he said i am very sorry to see you like this  its my first day out rowan answered its a little trying you know especially when the end is so near i wanted just a few words with you deane it is good of you to come  deane nodded i only wish there was something i could do he said  there is nothing answered rowan  the girl turned away when you want me basil she said softly i shall be in the next room  you might have some brandy brought up he said i must talk for a few minutes and i am not feeling very strong  i will ring the bell in the other room she said and order it  she disappeared through the connecting door deane who had found himself watching her slow even progress turned once more to the man who sat by his side  i never thought id see you again rowan commenced i did my best deane i made friends with sinclair all righthe was glad enough to have anyone to drink withand before long he began to tell me about his claim to the little anna mine  did he believe in it asked deane  absolutely rowan answered i am quite sure of that he absolutely believed that directly he put it into the hands of any solicitor you would have to come to him and buy even though it cost you half your fortune he was waiting those few days to see if you came  deane nodded tell me how it happened he said  it was like this rowan continued speaking hoarsely and with difficulty that night he wasnt quite so drunk i pressed him a little too closely about his claim and where he kept the paper he was suddenly suspicious and quarrelsome he tried to turn me out and when i wanted to soothe him down he struck me he was a strong man and i was weak i think that he meant to murder me i remember i was half on the floor my forehead was bleeding already and he was coming towards me shrieking with rage i am going to finish you he called out then i struck hoping only to stun him and as you know the blow killed him i forgot for a moment about the paper i thought only about making my escape i had bad luck and i did not succeed i am afraid it was a bungling sort of job deane  i am very sorry indeed deane said that i ever suggested it to you  it wasnt your fault rowan answered nothing of this sort would have happened if he hadnt come for me i meant to rob him if i couldill admit thatbut no more you see it was useless for me to try and open negotiations he was too confident altogether he spoke of a million pounds as his price tell me he went on how do things stand now who has possession of the paper  deane hesitated for a moment i do not know  rowans face fell he seemed disappointed i had an idea he said slowly that you might have made some attempt to recover it everything was left in the room at the hotel for some time it was easily done  i did make an attempt deane said slowly i have searched the room for that paper but failed to find it  you yourself rowan asked eagerly  yes i heard that there was a claimant coming for sinclairs effects and that they were going to be removed to scotland yard i took a room at the hotel and i got hold of a key i went through everything the man had  it was in the breast pocket of his gray coat underneath the lining rowan gasped  i found the place deane answered but it was empty  rowan wiped the sweat from his forehead his breathing was becoming difficult already the excitement was affecting him but it was there on that night he exclaimed he took off his coat a few minutes before and i saw him feel it in the lining  all i can tell you deane answered is that the lining of the gray coat was torn as though something had been abstracted the paper was not there it was not anywhere in the room i ran a risk he continued after a moments pause which i dare not think of even now but it was in vain someone had been before me  was there anyone else upon the scent then rowan asked  can you think of anyone deane asked  rowan looked at him with distended eyes you dont mean to insinuate he began that ithat i had given it away  not wilfully answered deane is there anyone at all to whom you spoke of this  rowan shook his head only to my sister he said and she is as silent as the grave  nevertheless deane said the paper has gone someone has itis holding it nowfor a purpose i suppose there can but be one purpose perhaps he added you had better ask your sister to be quite sure whether she ever mentioned its existence to anyone  we will ask her at once rowan exclaimed i will ask her before you let me get up help me i will fetch her  deane stretched out his hand no he said you must not excite yourself rowan i will knock at the door and call your sister  rowan lay back gasping deane crossed the room and knocked at the door which led to the inner apartment  miss rowan he said  she opened the door almost immediately yes  deane stood aside your brother he said has a question to ask you     chapter iv  a question   winifred came slowly into the room it seemed to deane watching her curiously that she had been steeling herself to defiance there was no change in her expression and her lips seemed tighter drawn than ever she went at once to her brothers side  you have been talking too much basil she said you know that it is not good for you  he leaned across to the little table which stood by his side and helped himself to brandy he was indeed looking terribly ill the lines under his eyes seemed traced with a coalblack pencil and his hand shook so that half the brandy was spilled  winifred he said i must ask you a question you remember that i spoke to you of a documentsinclair had it i was trying to deal with him trying to get it back for mr deane here  yes she answered calmly i remember your speaking of it  we have reason to believe he continued gasping a littlereason to believe that it has been stolen mr deane wants to know whether at any time you have mentioned its existence to anyone  she looked at deane and back at her brother her face was unchanged no she said i have mentioned it to no one  you see her brother continued its like this no one but i knew of that paper deane here told me and i told no one except you and yet we have evidence we know that it has been stolen from sinclairs room since his death that is why we want you to be quite sure that you did not mention its existence to anyone  no mention of it has crossed my lips she answered i have no friends no confidants i have spoken to no one about it nothing in the world she continued would be more improbable than that i should have done so  he turned to deane who stood by with impassive face you hear he exclaimed you hear i was quite sure about winifred she doesnt go talking about shes no gossip are you winifred  i hope not she answered  i have no reason i am sure deane said slowly to doubt miss rowans discretion  she raised her eyes for a moment and met his the faint satire in his tone was intentionally provocative but it failed to move her her regard of him was entirely impersonal he looked away with a light shrug of the shoulders  well rowan he said it seems there is nothing further to be done if the paper does turn up he added i shall know how to deal with its holder in the meantime about yourself  rowan laughed a little hysterically about myself he repeated thats a fruitful subject isnt it  doctors make mistakes sometimes deane said let us hope that they may have made one in your case anyhow there is no reason why you should not be comfortable and have the best medical advice go wherever you think best and send me your address i shall not forget that your accident took place when you were engaged upon my affairs  you are very good deane rowan said  the girl looked up mr deanes kindness is quite unnecessary she said we are in no want of money  your sister does not quite understand deane said turning to him we have been through too many rough times in africa together to stand upon ceremony now you will perhaps be able to explain to her later on  he took up his hat and turned toward the door i shall expect to hear from you he said as soon as you have decided where to goeither from you rowan he added shaking hands with him or from your sister  you are very kind deane rowan said i am sorry i have made such a mess of things  it was not your fault deane answered goodday miss rowan  she looked at him for a moment but she did not offer to take his outstretched hand he smiled and withdrew it at once  goodday mr deane she said  the door closed behind him rowan was watching his sister anxiously winifred he said what is the matter with you you were scarcely civil to mr deane  oh i think i was she answered in any case we dont want to take alms from him do we  it isnt exactly that rowan objected  it is  he can afford it rowan declared he is very rich a thousand pounds to him is like sixpence to us  it doesnt alter facts she rejoined i do not like mr deane basil it is through him that this trouble has come upon us you have taken enough of his money  and when i am gone he asked what about you then  have i ever failed to make my own way she asked quietly i shall be safe enough basil  he commenced to cough and very soon further speech was impossible he was painfully exhausted she sat by his side until he went off to sleep of his hopeless state there could no longer be any doubt he was wasted almost to a shadow even in sleep his breath came heavily and a fever seemed upon him she stole softly from his side and stood for a few minutes at the window looking out below the pulse of the great world was beating with the same maddening regularity the stream of wayfarers swept on the roar of traffic was as inevitable as the waves of the sea she stood by the window with small clenched hands behind her his loud breathing seemed to beat out the time toward death                                       deane himself was one of those wayfarers but at least his thoughts as he was being whirled eastward in his brougham were fixed upon the tragedy which he had left behind him he knew very well that it was not a question of months but of days with basil rowan was it only for that that the girl was waiting her whole attitude towards him had about it a certain flavor of mystery which oppressed him it was like trying to face an enemy hidden in a darkened room listening for his footstep not knowing whence the blow might fall notwithstanding the warm sunshine he shivered a little as he descended from the carriage and entered his offices     chapter v  mutual information   the girl was sitting in the middle of a hard horsehair sofa her elbows upon her knees her head resting in her hands she looked across the dreary apartment and out of the illcleaned windows with dull despairing eyes this then was to be the end of her dreams she must go back to the life which she felt to be intolerable or she must throw herself headlong into the maelstrom  there was one other occupant of the room and curiously enough his attitude appeared to be a somewhat similar one he was a short thickset young man with brown moustache flashily dressed with a red tie an imitation diamond and soiled linen to further disfigure an appearance at no time particularly prepossessing he was standing with his legs a little apart looking out into the uninspiring street his hands were thrust deep down into the pockets of his trousers he had all the appearance of a man who finds the burden of life an unwelcome thing presently he began to whistle not cheerfully but some doleful air of sentimental import the girl upon the couch seemed irritated she herself was in the last stage of dejection and the sound grew maddening  oh dont do that please she exclaimed at last  he turned around in amazement for the first time realizing that he was not alone i beg your pardon he said  the girl remembered that he was a stranger to her but after all what did it matter i asked you to stop whistling she said  he answered certainly and continued to look at her she returned his gaze with a disapprobation which she scarcely attempted to conceal  sort of habit i get into he explained when im in the dumps  does it do you any good she asked if so ill learn how to whistle myself  meaning he remarked that we are companions indumpiness  she shrugged her shoulders but did not trouble to reply  i wish to god he exclaimed id never left cape town  then for the first time she looked at him with a gleam of interest and asked do you come from south africa  he nodded i did and i only wish i were back there i could always keep my head above water there but london is a rotten hole i suppose its because i dont know the runs he added meditatively anyhow its broke me  she continued the conversation without feeling the slightest interest in it but simply because it was an escapea temporary escapefrom her thoughts what did you come over for she asked  a fools errand he answered i lent a man some moneya sort of speculation it wasand i came over to see how he was getting on  and i suppose hed lost it she remarked  hes lost himself answered the man which is about as bad i wish i could lay my hands upon him id get a bit of my own back one way or another  london is a big place she returned people are not easy to find unless you know all about them  this man left south africa only a month or so ago he gave me an address here where he said i should always hear of him ive been there nearly every day he turned up there all right regularly after he first landed he hasnt been there at all for two months and they havent the least idea where he is  you dont even know she asked whether the speculation is successful or not  he shook his head gloomily it dont make much odds so far as i can see he said if it came off hes bolted with the profits if it didnt hes hiding for fear i shall want my money back again its a rotten sort of show anyway  what was his name she asked idly  his real name the man answered was the same as your ownthat is he added i think i heard old mrs towsley call you miss sinclair didnt i  she looked at him steadily for several moments without speaking he was not a person of quick apprehensions but even he could not fail to see the change in her face her lips were parted her eyes were suddenly lit with an almost passionate fire the change in her features was illuminating she was no longer a tired depressedlooking young woman of illtempered appearance her good looks had reasserted themselves life seemed to have been breathed into her pulses  his real name was sinclair she repeated softly he came from south africa tell me some more about him  why he asked bluntly  because she told him my name is ruby sinclair and i am here on very much the same errand as you only with this difference she addedi know where my uncle is i know what has become of him there are other things for which i seek  he came over from the window and stood on the hearthrug by her side some part of her excitement had become communicated to him i say he exclaimed this is a rum go and no mistake if its the same man we may be able to help one another its richard sinclair i am looking for called over there bully sinclair he was a man about fifty years old been in south africa for the last twenty years a mine prospector and general adventurer hed had his fingers in a good many pies had richard  what was he over in england for she asked  the young man hesitated i dont know that theres any harm in telling you he said only remember its information for information im giving you the whole show away  ill tell you all you want to know she interrupted go on  well the young man said he came over to lay claim to a goldmine that he considered hed been done out of  a goldmine the girl repeated breathlessly was it a rich onevery rich i mean  i should say so the young man answered it was a complicated bit of businessthe mines in other hands you seebut sinclair reckoned that hed got a claim to it anyway and he expected either to be squared for a big amount or to get a syndicate to take the thing up he came to me dead on his uppers my names hefferom he and i had been pretty thick at odd times and though wed been in a good many deals together wed kept friends in a way he came to me as i say in cape town and he told me what the game was he wanted a matter of two or three hundred pounds to get over to this side and to start things properly well i thought it out and though it was about all i was worth in the world i let him have it over he comes i got a letter from him to say hed landed and never another line i cabledno answer over i came myself for hed scarcely left cape town before a little affair that i was mixed up in went plumb wrong and i lost every penny id got left so over here i come and ive been here a fortnight and i tell you sinclair seems to have vanished from the face of the earth the worst of it is he continued im stoneybroke ive got to leave this place today because i cant pay my bill and ive no idea where to raise a sovereign  the girls sense of humor triumphed for a second over her excitement there are your diamonds she reminded him i heard you talking about them at dinner the other night one of them you said was worth a hundred pounds  a bluff he answered readily they are false every one of them i talked like that to get old mother towsley to let my account go on a bit but she wasnt having any now i say ive told you my story tell me why you are so keen on knowing about it  yes she said i will tell you my name is ruby sinclair and i am the niece of the man whom you have come to england to find  he made use of an oath for which he forgot even to apologize you know where he is he exclaimed come remember it was a fair bargain information for information  he is dead  the young man staggered back his first emotion of shocked surprise lasted only a few seconds anger and disappointment took its place dead he exclaimed and my moneywhat about that what he left belongs to me anyway its got to be made up i can show you his note for it  you had better wait she answered coldly until i have told you everything i suppose you dont read the papers  never he answered what good are they to me  they might have been of some use on the present occasion she answered they might at any rate have saved you from wasting a good deal of time my uncle was murdered in the hotel universal by a man named rowan  the young man swore againfluently volublyswore until he had come to the end of a varied and extensive vocabulary when he had finished there was an excited flush in his cheeks and a bright light in his eyes by rowanbasil rowan he exclaimed he was one of us out there when we were prospecting up the newey valley look here he continued you and i have got to have this out murdered was he well im the man that may be able to throw some light upon that whats happened to rowan had he anything to say  i will tell you all that i know the girl answered my uncle wrote me directly he arrived in england he told me that he had been fortunate in africa that he had come to take possession of a large fortune and that he would be sending for me in a very short time to live with him and that as he had no other relative i should be rich all my days i replied of course asking whether i could not come at once he wrote me again to tell me to wait for a day or two until his affairs were settled then i heard no more i waited i wrote again i waited and wrote again there was no reply i found afterwards that my letters had never even been called for at the address where he told me to write then one day a stranger who was staying at rakney told my uncle there to look at the papers we found the story of his murder he had been dead some time  rowan was tried i suppose the man asked did he say what his motive was has he been hanged  he insisted upon it that it was a quarrel the girl said i do not believe him he was found guilty and reprieved i saw in the papers last night that he had been released i believe that he has only a few days to live  and you the young man asked  i came up the girl said slowly to take possession of my uncles effects  have you got them he asked breathlessly  yes the girl answered  there were papers he demanded  some she answered but none of any importance  he looked at her suspiciously she shrugged her shoulders look here she said i am telling you the truth look at me look at my glovesmended halfadozen times look at my clothes just hanging on my back and no more if there had been a single thing amongst my uncles papers on which i could have raised even a fivepound note do you think that i should be sitting here like this wondering which might be the quickest way out of the world  the young man moistened his lips he was obviously in a state of excitement listen he said among these papers was there a sort of deed on yellow parchment paper roughly written with a government stamp in the lefthand corner a paper which spoke of a goldmine called the little anna goldmine  she shook her head decidedly there was nothing of the sort  then the young man swore again and this time he seemed to surpass himself your uncle was robbed he exclaimedrobbed of that paper i tell you he added he was murdered for it and for no other reason  how do you know the girl cried  why its as simple as a b c he explained he had the paper in his possession when he came to england the mine has been claimed by a great syndicate who are working it now he came to see them to make terms the next thing we hear is that he is murdered and the paper is gone they thought that no one else knew of it young lady he exclaimed you may thank your stars as i do that you and me have come together well have justice and well have that fortune yet     chapter vi  an opportune arrival   with his feet to the sea and his head pillowed by many cushions rowan lay in a long invalid chair at the edge of the little strip of shingle which separated the tower of rakney from the sea every limb was at rest every nerve seemed lulled into quiescence the sun and wind had left their traces upon his hollow cheeks it seemed indeed as though death had lifted her hand from his forehead it was only when one looked closer that one realized his terrible weakness realized how slender indeed the thread was by which he held on to life there was scarcely a breath of wind stirring the sun was high in the heavens and the whole country seemed lulled into a state of almost unnatural repose the distant trees were motionless as though indeed they were simply painted things against that background of deep blue sky the smoke from the little cluster of cottages crept upwards straight as a ruled line the cattle in the fields seemed all asleep exhausted by the unexpected heat the sea was like a lake unruffled almost unrippled  the man dozed and winifred sat by his side with her eyes fixed steadily and yet absently upon the distant horizon a week at most the doctor had given him and after thatwhat she looked backwards to the windowthe window through which she had entered on that wild night earlier in the year she looked away again uneasily she was afraid of such moments as these it was to escape from them that she had protested so vehemently against their accepting deanes offer of his cottage  at low tide a rough pebbly road led from the village to the cottage as well as the dyke footpath higher up along this came two people a man and a woman mere specks at first in the distance but rapidly becoming more and more evident they walked fast and they looked always anxiously toward the tower which stood out at the end of the road against the background of the skya curious almost uncanny sort of building  if they see us coming said ruby sinclair they will certainly try to prevent our seeing him our only chance is to come upon them unexpectedly they can watch the dyke path from the front but few people ever come by this road it winds about so and it is generally thick with sea mud  the man nodded he too was keeping his gaze fixed in a strained manner upon their goal now that we are so near he said so near to him we will make him speak we will not be driven away he cannot escape from us there  there was a curious air of determination about these two a certain grimness which seemed common to both of them as they hurried along the rough stonestrewn road they had reached the last hundred yards now and their course was perfectly straight they walked single file along the little stretch of marshland which served as a footpath  he is in front lying on a chair she whispered they wont be able to get him in now before we are there  the road terminated suddenly upon the beach the man and the girl scrambled up a little shingly mound when at last winifred heard the sounds of their approach they were already between her and the house any attempt at escape was useless she came a few steps toward them  who are you please and what do you want she asked quickly  hefferom stretched out a hand toward the prone figure of rowan who was lying there still with closed eyes we want a few words with your brother he said we shall not keep him long but it is very important we have come a long way to see him  it is impossible she said firmly he is very ill indeed the doctor allows him to see no one i dont know how you found your way here but you must please return at once  i have come a long way hefferom said slowly  i am sorry she answered but cant you see that it makes no difference if you were to ask him questions he is not well enough to answer youscarcely to understand any sudden shock at alleven a recognitionmight kill him  hefferom hesitated no longer he pushed winifred away and motioned to ruby to follow him at that moment rowan opened his eyes and turned his head hefferom walked towards him and leaned over his chair  you remember me rowan he said my name is hefferom steve hefferom we were up the newey valley together camped out you know at princes gorge for more than a monthyou and i and deane and a lot of us  i remember rowan faltered trying to raise himself yes i remember  he had a fit of coughing winifred passed her arms around him and held him up if you stay she whispered to hefferom you will kill him he ought not to speak ever a sentence  it isnt much we want him to say miss hefferom answered doggedly but theres a question hes got to answer if he is as near death as you say it cant make much difference what happens and it means more than death to me and to this young lady  rowan had recovered sufficiently to drink from a glass which winifred had handed to him he turned once more toward hefferom that is all finished he said painfullythose days i am illtoo ill to talk too ill to think too ill to live please go  hefferom bent over him rowan he said you and i were never enemies even if we didnt exactly hit it off together listen to me for a moment sinclair borrowed my last three hundred pounds in cape town to come over here and lay claim to the little anna goldmine he had the government deed with him i have seen it i followed him over to claim my share and i found him dead killed and the paper gone i am not asking you to give away your game whatever it was but we want the paper this is sinclairs niece with me and i am his partner we inherit his claim to the little anna goldmine and we want that document  the document was not amongst sinclairs effects when they were examined after his death rowan said i did not take it i do not know what has become of it that is the truth leave me alone now i cannot talk any more  his head dropped back upon his pillow he was white to the lips winifred hurried to his side once more she turned upon the two  are you satisfied she cried you have nearly killed himfor nothing i know very well that no document of any sort such as you describe has been found if mr sinclair ever had it it was probably stolen from him  stolen yes hefferom saidstolen right enough that is what we are here about this young lady is his niece and im his partner what was left behind belongs to us and so far as i know the only thing worth having was that document we want it and by god he wound up weve got to have it  do you imagine the girl asked without change of countenance that you will find it here  i will tell you what i do imagine hefferom answered men dont commit murder for nothing your brother tried to steal that paper or rather he did steal it the games up now hes no opportunity to make use of it and it belongs to us it belongs to us and weve come for it there now you know the truth weve come for it and weve come to stop until we get it  rowan raised himself a little in his seat hefferom he said its no use talking like that i havent got it ill be frank frank as you have been i know no more than you do who has got it i quarrelled with sinclair and he got suspicious we fought in his room and the result you know but i was arrested before i left the hotel everyone knows that the paperi never had iti never even saw it where it is now god only knows i dont  rowan fell back in his chair coughing violently for several moments he was incapable of speech winifred knelt by his side when he had finished coughing she held a wineglass to his lips and made him sip its contents he lay back now as though completely exhausted she turned to face these unwelcome visitors  you see she cried pointing to him a little more of this and you will kill him go away both of you he has nothing to tell you  hefferom laughed a little brutally come he said this game wont do we are here for the truth not to be put off with these fairytales it is the truth we want and the truth well have or ill wring it out of him even if it kills him  rowans eyes were closed and he showed no sign of having heard winifred stood up boldly before him you are fools she said he has told you all he knows if sinclair ever had the deed you speak of he parted with it to someone else not to my brother  someone else hefferom repeated do you take us for fools if he parted with that deed he parted with it for a fortune wheres the money show us the deed or the money and we are satisfied show us neither and well not leave this place until he has spoken  a step upon the shingle behind suddenly diverted their attention the eyes of every one of them were fixed upon the tall figure who was walking swiftly up the slope they had been so engrossed that they had not even heard the sound of the motorcar which was standing there splashed with mud and with its engine still panting with his glasses in his hand and his long gray coat thrown open stirling deane strode up to them  come he said it seems to me that i have arrived opportunely what does this mean who are these people miss sinclair is this man your companion what does he mean by speaking in such a tone to a dying man  no one answered him hefferom stood as though turned to stone but his eyes never left deanes     chapter vii  hefferom is optimistic   ruby sinclair leaned forward and touched her companions back as they flew through the village of rakney look said she you see that cottage we are just passing that is where i have lived for the last four years  hefferom followed her outstretched finger he saw the little grove of bare trees and the marshland stretching out beyond to the bare sea winter and summer he asked  winter and summer  he nodded about time you went fortunehunting he said  no other word passed between them until they reached the railway station they descended from the car and watched it almost immediately swing round and disappear  so this is the end of our little excursion to rakney ruby remarked  yes hefferom answered arent you satisfied  why should i be she asked what have we gained  hefferom drew a long breath ah i forgot he said you dont understand  he drew her into the refreshment room she declined to drink but she sat in a corner while he disposed of several whiskies and sodas at first he would say nothing and she waited presently he began  you think he said that i was a coward because when deane bundled us off in his car and told the man to drive us to the nearest railway station i did not protest you think that i should have made a scene there it wasnt worth while deanes coming gave the whole game away dont you really understand  not a word she answered  listen then stirling deane is the man who is supposed to be the owner of the little anna goldmine which was really your uncle sinclairs  she looked at him with gleaming eyes say that again she said i dont quite understand  the deed which is missing from your uncle sinclairs effects hefferom said slowly is the titledeed to the little anna goldmine that mine was illegally taken possession of by stirling deane he sold it to the company of which he is now president at an enormous price he is the man with whom your uncle sinclair came to england to treat sinclair was murdered by whom by rowan who was at the back of rowan whose tool was he we know chance this afternoon made everything clear to us cant you see that rowan killed your uncle and stole that deed to save stirling deane from ruinat his bidding as his accomplice  it takes my breath away the girl murmured now i think of it of course it is deanes cottage they are in he was there himself only a few weeks ago it was through him that we heard of my uncles murder  the whole things as simple as a b c hefferom declared cant you see that deane has given himself into our hands of course rowan stole the deed of course deane has it he will have to pay for our silence by god he will have to pay  the girl looked up from her seat on the leathern couch looked at her companion long and critically do you think we can hold our own against a man like stirling deane  it depends upon the cards and they are in our hands we must go back to london we must wait till he is at his office then i will see him you can leave the thing in my hands now i shall know how to approach him he cannot deny his friendship with the rowans they are occupying even at this moment his own cottage very likely i shall be able to discover other things connecting him with them the newspapers you showed me spoke of great influence which was brought to bear on the granting of the reprieve we may find that stirling deane was at the back of that anyhow he is connected closely enough with them i am here ready to swear that when sinclair left africa he left with the original titledeed of the little anna goldmine in his pocket i think that the friendship between his murderer and stirling deane who sold that mine for close upon a million pounds is a thing that will need a little explanation  and in the meantime said the girl bitterly we are starving  not quite he answered we have thirtyeight shillings that will take us back to london and find us rooms somewhere for the night we must scrape along somehow until i can get to deanes offices  you are not forgetting the girl remarked that the thirtyeight shillings you are speaking of is my property  we are partners hefferom declared you shall carry the purse if you will but there is no object in it  you seem to do most of the spending she reminded him if you think that we can afford it she added glancing at his empty glasses i should like a cup of tea  he ordered it at once and sat down by her side look here he said i dont see what you want to be so blooming standoff for times are a bit rough with us just now but you mark my word we shall pull through all right this man deane is in the hollow of our hands he has been rowans accomplice no one who knows the facts could possibly doubt it a word from us would ruin him  the girl sighed she had drawn a little away from the man do you believe then she asked that mr deane has the deed  either that or it is destroyed answered hefferom but dont bother about that whether the deed is still existing or not we know enough to make it worth his while to buy us even though it costs him half his fortune  in the meantime the girl said please get the tickets the train will be in in a few minutes  come with me he said suspiciously remember were partners  oh we are partners right enough she answered rising and following him out of the place you neednt be afraid that i am going to let you go just now you are all that stands between me and a return to rakney  on the way up to town he began to build castles he was optimistic sanguine in the extreme the girl listened almost stolidly her companion had begun to depress her he was badly dressed his linen was soiled his imitation jewelry was hideous he sat opposite her in the train and there were things in his face from which she shrank she was more than thankful that they were not alone  are you tired or what he asked at last a little sullenly surely i made it all plain enough you dont doubt that theres money in this for us  there should be she admitted slowly and yet  and yet what  i have seen mr deane before she said hesitatingly i have talked with him once or twice somehow or other when i think that it may come to be a struggle between you and him  he interrupted her with a brazen laugh you think i wont be able to stand up against him well you shall see theres a good deal in holding the cards you know  you havent the deed she reminded him  i dont want it he answered i am not afraid of stirling deane i have known him a good many years and he knows me we are up against one another now and you may fancy his chances but i tell you my backs against the wall and his isnt hes there fighting in the open ive got him i tell yougot him  she half closed her eyes this was not the way in which she had hoped to come into her fortune in her heart she could not believe a word he said deane was a strong man hefferom she was already beginning to discover was nothing but a bully and a craven if it came to a duel between the two she found it easier to believe that hefferom would be worsted  at kings cross station they separated hefferom a little sulkily accepted his dismissal and parted with half of the money which he had  you can go where you choose she said you can come back to mrs towsleys if you like but i tell you frankly that except while we are on business i think it better that we should stay apart  i cant see why he muttered  for one thing she said we might be taken for adventurers i do not know much about the law but it seems to me you wont be very far out of its clutches when your negotiations with mr deane begin  i can take care of myself he answered gruffly can i see you back to the old ladys anyhow  no she answered i would rather go alone  come and have one drink in the refreshment room just to wish ourselves luck he begged  she went in with him and drank a cup of coffee he had two liqueurs and would have had more but she dragged him sharply away  remember she said that i have nothing more i can raise money on these few shillings are all we have if mr deane does not return for several days we must leave  deane will come back he said with a defiant laugh i let him have things his own way today but he knows just where he is mark my words he will be at the office tomorrow morning and he will be there expecting to see me     chapter viii  a bold move   hefferom was over sanguine it was three days before he was able to see stirling deane during that three days he had lived on a few shillings spent mostly in drinks he swaggered into deanes office an untidy dissolutelooking creature his efforts to seem at his ease were almost ludicrous  a bit different this to the newey valley he remarked as he sat down without waiting for an invitation things have gone pretty well with you eh deane slapup offices youve got and the chink of money everywhere it reminds me of what ive come about  you have come for money have you deane asked  well i dont know about that i dont know how you look at it but it seems to me that theres a bit owing a bit which might come my way i should tell you perhaps that i am representing miss sinclair as well as myself  richard sinclairs niece deane asked  exactly she is heiress to anything the old man had and i was partner with him in the little anna goldmine  in what asked deane  in the little anna goldmine hefferom repeated distinctly  deane leaned back in his chair i must ask you to explain yourself he said the little anna goldmine belongs to the syndicate of which i am a director  thats all very well for a bluff answered hefferom but you got rid of sinclair a little too easily  got rid of him  oh im not thinking of this last time hefferom interrupted with a hard laugh i am thinking of the time he put you on to the mine and you took possession of it  it was perfectly legal deane remarked  perhaps soperhaps it wasnt hefferom answered anyway i know very well and so probably do you that sinclair left south africa six months ago with the government titledeed of the little anna goldmine in his pocket i advanced him the money to come and he made me his partner  these are amazing statements of yours deane said may i ask where is this wonderful deed  you may ask hefferom answered but not me better go to rowan he knows though he keeps his lips tight shut he knows and so do you never mind about that you dont want a lawsuitno more do we  who are we deane asked  miss sinclair and myself hefferom answered we are partners in this i have come to you as a reasonable man sinclair landed in this country with the titledeeds of the mine which you have always considered yours in his pocket today he is murdered and his papers have disappeared he was murdered by rowan whom you are now befriending theres a story there for the newspaperstheres something more than a story deane  do i understand deane asked calmly  you can understand what you please hefferom said i want my money back and i want big interest and then theres the girl she should be standing at this moment in your shoes half of the little anna goldmine is hers by right it is for you to say what it would be worth your while to put down to close this business  now deane remarked suavely you are talking common sense but what i should like to know is where is this wonderful titledeed  oh dn you its in the fire i suppose hefferom cried you and he know rowans your man and hes the sort to die game but he didnt kill sinclair for nothing i wouldnt mind betting that that deed has been burnt to ashes but even then i know a little too much eh  deane shrugged his shoulders you know a great deal too much he said i am to understand then finally that you want me to buy your silence  put it that way if you choose hefferom answered only i warn you that i havent come here on a childs game this is a big businessa big business for me and for the girl she must have her share and i mine  and the amount  one hundred thousand pounds remember that it has to be divided  in other words remarked deane i am to buy your silence as to these matters upon which you have spoken for the sum of one hundred thousand pounds  it is too little hefferom declared the mine is worth ten times as muchthe mine and your position  if i give you this sum deane asked do i understand that it closes the whole affair you must remember that i do not admit having even seen this deed you spoke of supposing it turns up in somebody elses hands  hefferom laughed ironically well guarantee you against that he declared  thats easy to say deane objected but i dont see how come i will be perfectly truthful i havent got that deed if it should be still in existence and be used against me after i have paid you this sum of money i should be in somewhat an unfortunate position  there isnt the slightest fear of it hefferom said besides  besides what deane asked looking up from his desk  it isnt as though the deed were a certainty he said slowly of course the law is a little complicated there would be witnesses on both sides and the case might go anyhow  it would depend a little i think deane said quietly on which side you gave evidence for i think you could upset that deed if you chose  perhaps i could hefferom said gruffly  will you do it deane asked if it should ever be set into action against me remember that even though i know you will not believe me the fact remains that although i have defended rowan i am not in possession of that deed  hefferom leaned across from his chair listen deane he said i am not here to bluff about that wonderful document perhaps it isnt worth the paper its written on anyhow heres my word for it ill see if ever an action is brought against you on the strength of that deed that you blow it all sky high in five minutes  is the deed a forgery deane asked  hefferom did not answer  or is it only the date deane continued  still hefferom was silent then there is no necessity he said after a pause of putting these things into plain words you have only to find the money and your anxieties are over  deane touched a bell by his side yours i am afraid he answered are only just beginning  the curtains behind were suddenly thrown aside a tall sparelooking man stepped out deane turned towards him  inspector he said i give this man in charge for a barefaced attempt at blackmailing me you have heard all that has been said i dont think that there is anything for me to add  he rang the bell by his side a second time a moment later a policeman entered from the outer office hefferom who had sprung to his feet was glaring at them both white with passion  so this is your game deane he exclaimed by the lord you shall pay for it you to dare to use the law against meyou who sent rowan like a paid assassin to murder sinclair  a gross calumny deane answered calmly i had no interest in sinclairs life or death  its a dd lie cried hefferom if you are going to do any arresting inspector arrest that man he cried pointing with his fat white forefinger to where deane stood debonair and welldressed as usual and with a little bunch of violets in his buttonhole i tell you that he paid the man rowan to kill bully sinclair in the universal hotel i tell you i can prove it i can prove thisthat sinclair left south africa six months ago with the deeds of the little anna goldmine which this man dared to sell as being his own at close upon a million pounds less than six months ago i can tell you more  they led him from the room still shouting at the door he turned back its a bold game this deane he cried but by heavens ill cry quits with you before long you think you have a case against me i am only certain of one thing and that is that you have driven a nail into your own coffin if i could only get at you youyou blackguard  his eyes were bloodshot he strained and struggled to free himself from the grasp of the two men  id kill you where you stand he cried do you think that i can be muzzled do you think that the truth wont come to light people shall know it even if i never leave off telling it till my last breath comes  deane listened to him with immovable face they got him outside at last he heard him being dragged down the corridor protesting all the time then he resumed his seat its a bold game to play he said to himself thoughtfully and yet if they really havent the deed there was nothing else to be done     chapter ix  lord nunneley is frank   i asked you to lunch at the club deane said lord nunneley because i thought that we could talk here without being interrupted if you came to cavendish square olive would walk you right away from the table and if i asked to have a chat with you alone there would be a perfect avalanche of questions to face  deane looked up a little curiously for the first time he realized that this was not simply a casual invitation his prospective fatherinlaw had really something to say to him  there was some matter which you wished to discuss then deane asked i need scarcely say that i am quite at your service  illustration there was some matter which you wished to discuss then deane asked  lord nunneley passed his cigarettecase across the table they were nearing the end of a very excellent luncheon well he said there were a few things i wanted to say to you you see deane the city is no longer a mythical place to us idlers we meet people whose life is centred in moneymaking every day i have friends friends beside yourself who come from lombard street and one hears things gossip i mean and stray talk  deane seemed suddenly to recede into himself his host noticed the change and blamed himself for his want of tact nevertheless as he had begun so he went on  you see deane he continued olive is my only daughter and it makes one more than ordinarily cautious this blackmailing case of yours has set people talking a bit of course i think you were right it was a brave and sportsmanlike thing to do the man is committed for trial and i only hope hell get penal servitude all the same there are a lot of people you know deane who dont take quite the same view of it  naturally deane assented one can scarcely occupy such a position as mine without having enemies there are wheels within wheels in the financial world you know lord nunneley just as there are in the social world there are a dozen men who covet my post and as many hundreds of hangerson and parasites who would be glad to see me out of it  quite so returned lord nunneley of course this man hefferoms attitude was distinctly belligerent and his solicitors evidently knew what they were talking about when they reserved his defence tell me when sinclair came to you first had he really any papers at all which were likely to cause you embarrassment  he had an original claim to the little anna goldmine deane admitted but it had lapsed before i took possession it was not worth the paper it was written on  still he had got that document lord nunneley asked  without a doubt deane answered  you have no idea i suppose what became of it lord nunneley asked  not the slightest replied deane i only know that it was not found among his effects  would it have been of any interest to you to secure it lord nunneley continued  i would have given a few hundredperhaps a few thousandpounds for it deane answered partly as a curiosity partly in order to save any possible trouble  of course lord nunneley said leaning back in his chair and sipping his coffee the world is full of people who love to gossip and you cannot gossip unless you invent ill about someone somehow or other it never amuses people to talk good of their friends conversation only becomes interesting when one can associate evil with them there are things being said in connection with this hefferom affair deane which are not altogether pleasant  go on said deane  for instance his host continued i was told last night that hefferoms tale was in substance truehe did advance this man sinclair money to come to england and assert his right to the little anna goldmine sinclair was murdered with this deed in his possession and it is freely whispered that you have befriended rowanhis murderer the paper has disappeared we know that still there is a further rumor that it may turn up at his trial in that case wouldnt you be rather badly hit  deane shrugged his shoulders the exact facts are these he said sinclairs claim to the little anna goldmine is worth very little nevertheless he knew that any action he might take against me in the present state of our money market here would be somewhat disastrous it would upset our credit and bring down our prices therefore his idea without a doubt was to come to england and make a bargain with me he didnt expect the mine what he wanted was blood money he came and perhaps unwisely i would have nothing to do with him rowan was known to both of us out there he came to see me a few days afterwards and i commissioned him to buy this deed if he could he went to look for sinclair they drank together an old quarrel was revived and they fought the end of that you know where the document has gone to i cant imagine but i can assure you that it was never meant to be the basis of a serious claim merely the foundation stone of a perfect system of blackmailing if i had listened for five minutes to hefferom i should have been in his power all my life i should have lost my selfrespect very soon i should have lost my nerve i couldnt do it i preferred to face him in a court of justice he came to blackmail me and he deserved to be punished if he can prove that it is i who am the illdoer i will take my punishment i can say no more  you talk lord nunneley said looking at him kindly as i would have my own son talk and yet deane this whole affair is distressing to me i tell you frankly that it has upset all the pleasure with which i consented to your engagement i cannot bear that anyone associated with olive should ever find himself in such a position this case of course may go all in your favor or it may not if it does not well you know very well that it would be the beginning of very unpleasant things  does olive know of this little luncheon party of ours lord nunneley deane asked  she does not lord nunneley asserted olive is above all things staunch she is i believe too sincerely attached to you i am speaking entirely for myself i am speaking too as the father of an only daughter whose engagement to you was after all a little experimental i should like to see my daughter released from that engagement deane  deane smoked steadily for several minutes finally this is a little hard on me isnt it sir i have only done what you yourself would have donerefused to have underhand dealings with men who made dishonorable propositions to me  it is hard on you deane lord nunneley declared it is very hard indeed but remember i never wanted olive to marry anyone in the city i know you and i like you if you came to me with your hands clean and plenty of money i should not hesitate for a second for i believe that olive likes you but i hate scandal i hate gossip i hate notoriety this blackmailing case of yours is going to result in all three id like to go home and lay the case before olive and have your permission to say that if it seems good to her mother and myself the engagement between you two is broken  deane leaned back in his chair it seemed to him that he had so little time to give to thoughts outside the immediate trend of the days work it was proposed that his engagement with olive should be broken what did it mean to him this engagement how far into his life had she come what place did she hold in his heart his thoughts travelled backwards he remembered his almost meteorlike accession to wealth and influence he remembered how all doors had flown open to him he remembered and realized exactly where he stood he thought of lady olive he remembered the first day when he had decided that she was the woman who would look well at the head of his table who would be a pleasant companion for him and would insure his having friends when he gave up his struggling amongst the class of people with whom he desired to associate it was in that way that he had looked at it from the first was it the same now he had touched her hands he had even kissed her lips she had come into his arms and allowed him to embrace her without any obvious reluctance only a few weeks ago she had kissed him voluntarily absolutely of her own will during their fortnight in scotland she had shown herself more feminine than he had ever believed her she had insisted upon taking him for walks by herself she had taken his arm encouraged him to make love to her had deserted the bridge table in the evenings to sit in dark corners with him had allowed him to hold her hand even to snatch a few kisses if she did not care for him at least she was very near it and as for himhe was fond of her without a doubt somewhere in the background of his apprehension there was some shadowy idea of a greater thing than this a love more thrilling more passionate more mysteriousmusic in the veins which no lady olive in the world had ever created but there was about these thoughts something absolutely unreal fantastic they had never taken to themselves shape never become associated with any human being they were nothing to trust to he told himselfnothing he looked out of the rainswept window of the club curiously enough he had a sudden vision of winifred rowans quiet set face the memory of one passionate moment seemed suddenly to creep along his heartstrings like the wind over the strings of a harp such folly he thought frowning such absolute folly  lord nunneley he said at last i am only anxious to do what lady olive wishes if you will go home and tell her exactly what you have told me i should like you to add that it is only her happiness that i wish and that if she desires to release me i shall accept her decision without a murmur  lord nunneley played with his coffeespoon nervously i knew youd say something like that deane he said of course it will not be easy i believe that my daughter is really fond of you and our influence over her both her mothers and mine is somewhat limited you wouldnt feel inclined i suppose to come over to our side to realize that under the circumstances an alliance between you and her could scarcely be a satisfactory thingin short to encourage her to bring it to an end  in other words deane said you propose that instead of suffering myself to be jilted by lady olive i should offer myself as a victim  its asking a good deal i know lord nunneley said and of course it all depends upon how you feel about it but i tell you frankly i cant help thinkingyou must realize a little that this blackmailing case even if it turns out well is bound to put a different complexion upon things  you must convince lady olive of that deane said i am ready to accept my dismissal but you must forgive me if i decline to do anything to facilitate it on the contrary i shall insist upon seeing lady olive before she absolutely decides i shall not plead with heryou need not be afraid of thatbut i shall want to be quite sure that there has been no misunderstanding of any sort  there is no time like the present lord nunneley said drive home with me and we will interview my daughter at once                                       she heard all that her father had to say listened to him gravely and attentively then she turned to deane and you she asked what do you say to it all  my dear olive said deane it amounts to this i am to be the hero or victim as the case may be of a cause célèbre i cannot come out of it with any considerable credit i may come out to find myself under very grave suspicion i admit that appearances are against me there will even be people who will whisper that i sent rowan from my office as an assassin to sinclair and that the deed he brought with him from south africa is in my safe or at the back of my fire no one has ever been free from calumny i certainly am going to have my share of it it mayit very likely willlessen my prestige you will find some of your friends who will talk of the deane blackmailing affair and who will never be quite sure whether i was prosecutor or defendant you will find all your life my name looked upon with a certain amount of suspicion because in a case of this sort prosecutor and defendant and even the witnesses are all classed together by that somewhat vague portion of the public which your friends represent i admit all this i also admit that it would be an act of perfect justice if you should tell me to kiss your hands and go  she pointed to the door father she said will you leave us for a moment there is something which i have to say to stirling     chapter x  a broken engagement   even after the door had closed upon lord nunneley and deane was alone with his fiancée words did not seem to come easily to either of them lady olive was sitting back in the corner of a low couch deane was standing upon the hearthrug his hands behind him his face a little wrinkled with perplexity  i suppose he said thoughtfully you would like me olive to explain exactly how this claim came about  on the contrary she answered i do not wish you to do anything of the sort  he looked at her in some surprise her voice had prepared him for a change of some sort but he was nevertheless puzzled there was a slight flush of color in her cheeks and her eyes were softer than usual  stirling she said come and sit down here by my side  he obeyed at once she turned and faced him  i am puzzled stirling she said i want to ask you a question you have been lunching with my father  yes deane answered at his club  i know that he feels very strongly about this matter she said tell me did the suggestion that our engagement should be broken off come from him  certainly  and you she said tell me exactly what you felt what it meant to you i dont want you to fence with words please she went on tell me this honestly was it anything of a relief to you  assuredly not he answered wonderingly  think again she begged you answer quickly but is that because you are very very sure or because you are taking it for granted you see you are one of those men stirling she went on earnestly whose disposition does not allow them to look back we are engaged i was your deliberate choice and after that so far as you are concerned the matter was ended the possibility that you had made a mistake would never occur to you simply because you would regard the matter as inevitable tell me if it were not inevitable if you were not engaged to me at this moment stirling would you ask me again  her words amazed him he had never given her credit for such insight such perceptions it seemed indeed as though she had realized something of which he himself was not yet conscious and yet something which might very well exist  how long have you had this idea olive he asked gravely  all the time she answered at first of course it seemed all right but up in scotland and since then i have wondered whether you have not looked upon me as something quite outside your lifea necessary and desirable adjunct perhaps to your household and growing prosperity dont think that i am complaining she continued but in all our recent communications the personal note has not been very strongly marked has it i can see exactly too how my fathers suggestion has moved you you dont feel do you as though the sun had ceased to shine or the world to move because there is a chance that you may lose me  deane was not often so doubtful of himself in a sense he knew that she was right and yet her very apprehension of these things the new earnestness with which she was looking at him the thought that he was very near indeed to losing her seemed to stimulate his interestmade him feel indeed that it would not be a light thing to give her up  olive he said i wish i could make you know exactly how i feel if i have been a little slow and reticent of speech believe me it is not that i have not cared on the other hand there is some truth in what you have saidi mean that i do honestly believe that i have taken things a little too much for granted that knowing there was no other woman in my life knowing how desirable you were and how really fond of you i was i think i was content to let the rest come as i certainly did feel that it would come  i think i understand she said slowly now tell me exactly what you think of my fathers request  i think that it is reasonable deane answered it is more reasonable even than your father knows of i think that i have been a little too successful perhaps during these later years of my life i have grown to underestimate the possibilities of trouble  this is really serious then  he nodded i am afraid he said that i have been a little overbold i ought to have kicked that man hefferom out of my office halfadozen times until he came to reason and then bought him off for good for a thousand pounds but you see i didnt all my life i have hated compromises i knew that he was a blackguard and i dealt with him as a blackguard and i have left him with the cards in his hands  then i suppose my father was right she said sighing  i suppose he was deane answered  she held out her hand very well stirling she said let it be so our engagement is broken and i will see that the proper steps are taken to announce it but i want you to understand this from me that if you had cared if i could have seen any signs whatever of your caring no word of my fathers nor anything that could have happened to you in the city or elsewhere any disgrace or any loss of money could have separated us  he took a step towards her olive he exclaimed  no she said a little sharply and rang the bell  he turned and walked out in the hall he passed lord nunneley we have arranged it according to your wish sir he said your daughter and i  lord nunneley looked at him curiously deane had the look of a man who has been hard hit  i am sorry deane i hope you understand theres nothing personal in it  i understand said deane briefly     chapter xi  bitter words   from the pit of the worldfrom the law courts hot and crowded where the atmosphere was heavy with strifethe modern battleground where the fighting was at least as dramatic over the souls of men as on those other fields reddened with their blood deane escaped to find himself after a few hours journey in this strangest of churchyards upon the bare hillside the church itself squat squaretowered and tumbling into decay stood out like a watchtower upon the cliff the churchyard bordered by low gray stone walls seemed to contain little more than a dozen or so of graves and from one of these deane turned away and with winifred by his side commenced the long descent to the level of the sea the halfadozen who had attended the ceremony out of curiosity had already melted away the parson with his book under his arm had gone into the vestry but neither custom nor age had failed to rob those few sentences of their wonderful threatening pathos even deane was a little moved the girl who walked by his side carried still with her that impenetrable mask but there was something more like real sadness in the steady gaze of her unseeing eyes  the air was filled with sunshine the singing of larks and the calling of the whitewinged seagulls wheeling about their heads below the sea had receded to its furthest limits the creeks were dry the shore was piled with masses of fragrant seaweed the grassgrown dykes which led down to the tower stood high and dry like ribbons across the land little sandy spits were visible far out from the shore and only the whitetopped posts marked the way of the tidal river out beyond the island of seagulls and sand  deane after his anxious days and his tearing ride from town in the great motor felt the peace of all these things showed it in his face felt it in his heart the last few days had taught him a good deal never had he been so weary of his place in the great world as he was that afternoon even that little ceremony in the windswept churchyard the coffin lowered into the grave the heaping of earth the simple words spoken by the bareheaded vicareven that little ceremony had left its impression after all how small the difference between death and lifeignominy and greatness his own reputation had many times during the last few days trembled in the balance what was the value of that evenof all his wealthcompared to the great primeval facts of life  his thoughts suddenly turned to the girl by his side he looked at her pityinglylooked at her too with curiosity she had accepted his coming almost as a matter of course all the time though he had known well that she was suffering she had been wordless as though her grief were something so great that no outward sign of it could be anything else but pitifully inadequate in her quiet graceful walk the very reserve the negativeness so to speak of her coloring her speech her looks she still represented to him an insoluble enigma was it possible now that her brother had gone that she would speak in any case the silence between them could not continue much longer for already they were down on the marshes and as though by common consent had turned seaward towards where the lonely gray tower stood out on its little sandy eminence  tell me miss rowan he said what are your plans now  my plans she repeated without turning her head  yes he went on i know that your brothers death is a blow to you but remember that it was inevitable it was a thing which was bound to come and in many ways it was kinder and better that it should happen like this you could not have chosen for him a more peaceful ending a more peaceful restingplace for anyone with even the faintest beliefs in the future life could anything be more beautiful than to rest there with the eternal lullaby of the sea in his ears free from encroachment save the encroachment of nature herself  she turned to look at him and the calm scrutiny of her level gray eyes somehow disturbed him it is easy for you to talk like that she said you are still young and strong and if the pendulum of fate swings against you one day it pays you back the next you are selfish because you cannot help it you cannot even realize the hideousness of death you cannot realize it because it comes to other people and not to you  you are a little unfair miss rowan deane answered you must remember that your brother was a doomed man  yes but why she cried he was younger than you there were no worse things in his life always he was battling with failure and disappointment and this is the endto sit opposite a doctor and be told you may live a month three months a measure of time oh its easy to think about it for other people think of yourself going about with the knowledge in your heart that as the days passed one by one they brought you nearer to the end that every morning when your eyes opened instead of the joy of life would come once more that terrible fear  your brother was not a coward miss rowan deane said  a coward you mean that he did not show his sufferings she exclaimed that does not mean that he did not suffer oh i have heard him in the night when he thought that he was alone i have heard his agony and that is the end  she turned and faced the little stone church on the hill the rudely enclosed churchyard in the far corner of which was still visible the bare heap of mould  he felt it coming he felt the strength pass from him day by dayhe who had never known what it was to live who had never known the days of riches or success or power there he liesgod knows for what purpose to what end  deane walked for a little way in silence it seemed to him that the girls bitterness was scarcely reasonable yet he realized that at such a time reason loses its power  his last days at least were as comfortable as possible  comfortable she exclaimed scornfully he lived in hell  you are not blaming me by any chance deane asked quietly  she turned upon him and the mask seemed suddenly raised there blazed into her eyes a great fire there trembled in the notes of her voice a wonderful passion her form seemed to dilate they were walking now upon the top of the dyke and she seemed to have been suddenly transformed into something vengeful some grim representation of fate  blame you she cried i tell you that i hate all you smug successful phrasemaking men who succeeded where he failed what are you that he was not he was brave he worked hard he was honest courageous he was all that a man should be if you were ever these things you at least were not more and to you comes wealth and easy days honor a long peaceful future londonthe worldis full of you grubbing your way through life thinking what magnificent creatures you are opening your pockets to help with your alms those who have fallen those who if there was justice upon the earth should be in your places  this is unreasonable deane declared coldly  unreasonable who said it was anything else she cried what reason is there in life in death in success or failure can you tell me the laws by which life is ruled can you find them anywhere at the base of any mans success or anothers failure reasonable indeed one man swims and another drowns who can tell why one man grows rich another starves and as often as not it is the clever man who starves and the fool who grows rich there is no reason in those things there is no reason in my hate for you and all those who have lived easy lives and who go on living them while helies there  she turned back once more and pointed with outstretched hand towards the little church the wind blew her skirts about herdisturbed for once the trim uncompromising arrangement of her hair the color had come into her cheeks at last deane wondered why he had never before thought her beautiful  i am sorry you are feeling like this he said i did what i could for your brother  be silent she interrupted fiercely you did what you could to insure your own safety you sent him on a desperate unworthy missionto worm his way into the confidence of a drunkard to steal for you to be your jackal what did you care what the consequences might be what did you care so long as your own reputation and wealth were saved he was to be one othermy poor basilone other of those to be crushed beneath the great wheels  it is not fair replied deane to make such statements your brother knew his risks and he took them  knew his risks she repeated you mean that because you were on your feet when he was on the ground you would make use of him like any other lump of mud you would spurn with your foot if you had not found a use for it he did your bidding poor fool but where he failed i succeeded you have to deal with me now and i think that it is my turn to make terms  deane looked at her curiously at last he said you are going to admit your possession of that little document  at last she admitted i am going to tell you that i have it  and to name your price he asked  there was a queer little sound in her throat like an unnatural laugh my price yes that is another matter     chapter xii  a strange betrothal   southward through the country lanes whose hedges were still wreathed with late honeysuckle on to the great mainroad deanes car was driven through the nightalways southward till the lights of the great city flared before them up into the sky deane himself for hour after hour had sat back in his corner buried in thought his companion was even more invisible but as the end of the journey drew near he roused himself with an effort turned on the electric light which hung down from the roof of the car lit a cigarette and bending forward looked into the halfhidden face of the girl who was reclining by his side  my dear fiancée he said we are nearing london wont you rouse yourself and give me your further orders  she sat up with a little yawn let down the windows please she said we will have some fresh air in for a few minutes  he obeyed her at once the sweet midnight air through which they were rushing was like a douche of cold water upon her face  how far are we from london she asked  less than twenty miles unless we are stopped we shall certainly be there in halfanhour  why did you disturb me she asked  to know your wishes  you had better leave me at one of the small hotels in the west end she said i daresay you can think of one at which you are known in the morning please come and see me and bring some money i shall want to engage a companion and a maid and to buy some clothes  deane looked at her curiously her manner was perfectly natural anything else he asked calmly  i dont think so she answered  you mentioned the fact i believe he continued that you werethat you had done me the honorthat you were in fact my fiancée  well she murmured  under those circumstances he continued dont you think  his hand rested for a moment upon hers she drew it at once away no i think not she answered  i have not had much experience he went on in being engaged but it seemed to me that there were certain privileges which belonged to that state  you are perfectly well aware she answered that ours is not an engagement of that sort you know something about the world in which the men marry for position and the women for money dont you you can look upon our engagement as being of that order i marry you because it is the only way i can make you pay your debt i have given you notice from the first i mean to gain everything i can and to give nothing  nothing he repeated  as little as possible she answered as a matter of fact you are singularly indifferent to me you simply represent the things i desire the things which are owing to me the things which were owing toto him i marry you to acquire them you marry me because you must  well he said ours promises to be a novel matrimonial experience  not at all she answered  you have been reading too many novels he declared people really dont marry in this sort of way at all there is always a pretence of sentiment about it if not for very shames sake they try to cultivate it  then we she answered will remain exceptions  do you dislike me he asked  personally i have not thought about you she answered apart from that i hate you you represent the victor and all that i have loved upon this earth have been the vanquished willingly i would not give you so much as the touch of my fingers if i thought that my presence was a pleasure to you i would shrink back into myself if i thought that any happiness could come to you from our association even now i would throw myself from the car and end it  our prospects of matrimonial bliss he remarked appear to me to be distinctly above the average  i do not expect she answered to find any pleasure that may come to me in later life at your hands  i shall certainly not allow you to flirt  i know the law she answered i know what i may do and what i may not do i shall not transgress it i want your money i want your position i want your power these things i will share with you for the rest you cannot keep too far away to please me  he leaned towards her heedless of the fact that she was shrinking away there was something a little pitiful in the bluegray eyes which tried so hard to hold him at a distance well said he it will be an interesting experiment at any rate personally i think that you are a brave woman i wonder that you did not take the money without me  what good would that have been to me she answered i have no name no friends cant you imagine the sort of people who would have come hanging on to my skirts if i had made my début on the scene as a widow or a spinster with a large fortune unattached looking for companions no i need your name mr stirling deane  i am not at all sure he answered grimly that you will find that much of an asset  you must see to it that i do find it an asset and a valuable one she answered you are relieved now from any fear of that deed being produced there is no shadow of evidence to connect you with the man sinclair or with my brothers transaction with him if your lawyers are clever and you are brave you must win your case with honor and hefferom will be sent to prison he deserves it in any case  deane nodded i shall win my case all right he said for me there never was any danger except in the production of that document concerning which you have been so mysterious  it was mine she answered i ran all the risk to get it i ran risks the memory of which will haunt me all my days i have lost basil all that i can do is to exact the utmost price that you can pay for that little paper  it isnt worth it you know said deane i believe even now that i should win my case anyhow  she smileda curious little contraction of the corners of her lips her eyes mocked him perhaps she said but it is a different thing since sinclairs murder its production today would ruin you inevitably whether it were held a legal document or not  we all make mistakes he said looking out of the window  but too often others pay for them she murmured turning away  presently he gave some instructions to the chauffeur the pace of the car slackened as they reached the outskirts of london and turned westward  well he remarked the world is full of surprises for us i little thought when i came down to rakney that it was to find a bride  she shivered a little at his words but made no reply  forgive me he said if i do not seem very coherent about it all as a matter of fact you see i was not expecting to take up obligations of this sort again so quickly  if you do not mind she said coldly we will not discuss it  i may at least be permitted to ask he continued when it is your intention tomarry me  in about two months time she answered  you would like our engagement announced he asked  she hesitated for a few seconds in a fortnights time she declared  in the meantime he inquired i shall have the pleasure of being received by you  certainly she answered i shall expect to lunch and dine with you occasionally to be taken to the theatres and for short expeditions into the countryranelagh and hurlingham for instance  delightful  the car stopped at one of the smallest and most famous of semiprivate hotels in the neighborhood of bond street deane assisted his companion to alight  if you will come in for a moment he said i will arrange things for you here they know me very well  she followed him into the hotel and waited while he interviewed the manager then he took his leave of her bowing over her reluctantly offered hand and smiling into her face as though honestly anxious to penetrate behind its absolute imperturbability  i hope you will find the little suite comfortable he said you must go to bed soon and try and rest they will do everything that is possible for you i am sure until you have your own maid and things goodnight  she raised her eyes for a moment to his but there was more indignation than gratitude in the glance she threw upon him i am very much obliged to you goodnight  deane drove back to his rooms as yet he could scarcely realize the situation had anyone ever been confronted with a position so unique the mystery of the girls impenetrability was solved at last     chapter xiii  desperation   the curtain had fallen upon the first act of this little drama in deanes life hefferom was committed for trial deane had walked into the court a few minutes late as though the whole affair was one which interested him only indirectly he had gone into the witness box without hesitation and his story had been so perfectly rational and straightforward that people began to wonder whether indeed any defence was possible crossexamination only amused him hefferom who went into court expecting to be released was committed at once to the old bailey and to everyones surprise his own included was refused bail  deane left the court a few minutes after the case was closed and paused for a moment to light a cigarette on the steps on the edge of the pavement there was a woman who watched with steady and scrutinizing interest every person who left the entrance of the law courts when deane came out she advanced towards him is hefferom free she asked  deane looked at her and recognized at once ruby sinclair  no he answered he is committed for trial  you  she leaned forward as though about to strike him deane neither shrank back nor showed any sign of interest in her words  what is hefferom to you he asked quickly  he is no blackmailer at any rate she answered fiercely  the court has ventured to think otherwise deane declared  she was almost at his side now suddenly his eyes caught the sight of something glittering something half drawn from the pocket of her dress her wrist was caught in a clasp of iron  young lady he said sternly are you mad  if i am it is your fault she answered  nonsense he declared you see that policeman there he is watching us now let go the revolver and be off i dont want to give you into custodymy life is worth something for others as well as myselfand i shall certainly do it unless you obey me  she gave a little sob and her fingers relaxed their hold upon the revolver which deane transferred into his own pocket she glided away into the crowd deane stepped into his brougham giving the man the address of the hotel where winifred rowan was staying he leaned back in the seat looking at the little weapon in his hands somehow the fact of his escape instead of bringing any exultation with it seemed to depress him strangely deane had never called himself or believed himself to be a religious man yet there was certainly one principle which had always been part of his creedto live and let live he was not a greedy capitalist he could look upon money without any desire to absorb it yet lately he seemed to have been forced into tortuous paths from the moment when he had attempted to make use of rowan as a tool everything had gone against him rowan himself lay dead in that windy churchyard and the words which had been spoken over rowans grave were still fresh in his memory he had lost lady olive of whom in a way he had been fond and at her own bidding he was engaged to this strange impenetrable girl a situation which he could not wholly realize and yet which he felt to be surrounded with danger and humiliation then there was this otherruby sinclairwho had come to london expecting to find a fortune and had found nothing but her uncles dead body she too looked upon him as a hungry schemer the indirect cause of her uncles death a robber if not a murderer he looked at the little revolver opened it carelessly and laughed as he stared into the empty breech it was unloaded a brandnew toy which had never been discharged he threw it into the opposite seat with a little gesture of contempt all its tragedy seemed to have passed away she had bought it to frighten him with there had after all been no serious purpose in her mind she too perhaps had hoped to play the part of extortioner  what was his offence he asked himself as his brougham glided along the embankment simply this there had been a claim presented for his mine which was without doubt a fraud which few people would ever have believed in and which in a court of law would have stood but little chance of success what a fool he had been not to defy sinclair to go to his directors and tell them the truth to resist stoutly any claim the man might bring since his first compromise with rowan everything had gone wrong it was unworthy for a man in his position to have allowed rowan even to play the ambassador apart from anything else he saw very clearly in those few minutes where the mistake of his life had been what he could not see was whither he was tending  winifred was waiting for him in the hall of the small hotel in dover street for three days at her own request he had not seen her nothing however had prepared him for the transformation which he now saw she was faultlessly dressed in a gown of the latest design and a picture hat which even he recognized as being something quite apart from the usual efforts of even the bond street shopkeepers in every detail she seemed to express the wholly selfsatisfied halfinsolent perfection of the woman who knows that she may and does command the best of everything and with this change in her dress seemed to have come a similar change in her deportment her aloofness was still evident enough but she carried herself with confidence and with a sort of languid graceful ease  you are nearly ten minutes late she said quietly where are you taking me to lunch  wherever you like he answered what about princes  she took a gold purse and a tiny black spaniel from the neatly dressed maid who stood by her side and lifting her skirts in her other hand passed through the door which he was holding open the lace of her petticoat the slenderness of her arched instep the delicate narrowness of her patent shoes were revelations to him he gave an order to his chauffeur and sat down by her side  you appear he said to possess a gift for assimilation  my sex is like that she said i have had a good many years to wait to store up knowledge in besides she continued a little mockingly you yourself are supposed to be something exceptional in the way of grooming arent you there is no need for other people to find our engagement surprising  looking at her critically i think he said that there is no fear of that  you flatter me she murmured  not at all he answered people might wonder perhaps how it is possible to fall in love with anyone whose expression so much resembles that of those statues in there pointing to a gallery which they were passing you have no other fault there is none at least to be found in your appearance you certainly do look however a little inclined to be faultily faultless  she laugheda laugh however which brought no color into her cheeks or light into her eyes i am a statue she said into which life has not yet been breathed you see you have been a little remiss up till now you have never attempted to make love to me  do you mean to say he asked leaning towards her  she gently pushed back his hand saying please dont be ridiculous of course you must know that overtures of that sort under the circumstances are impossible  for always he asked  certainly  perhaps you will draw up a little code of conditions he remarked i feel a little in the dark sometimes as to what is expected of me  you will easily pick it up as we go along she replied is this princes i wonder if i shall succeed in behaving as though i had lunched here every day of my life     chapter xiv  an afternoons shopping   deane found a singular interest an interest which amounted almost to fascination in watching the demeanor and general deportment of his companion her adaptability was little short of marvellous she smiled at the right moment at the obsequious maître dhôtel and exhibited just the proper amount of interest in the luncheon which deane ordered the restaurant was somewhat crowded but there was no one who attracted more notice than deane and the girl who sat opposite himslim and elegantly dressedlooking around her with a certain partly veiled interest which was all the time in piquant contrast to the languor of her eyes and manner she was by no means a silent companion although her conversation consisted for the most part of questions she had an unerring gift for discovering the most noteworthy of the little crowd by whom they were surrounded and she was continually asking questions about them with a persistence which clearly indicated an interest scarcely suggested by her general deportment  i wonder deane said toward the end of their meal whether social preëminence is amongst your carefully veiled ambitions  i am not at all sure she answered of course one develops according to circumstances in the office of messrs rubicon  moore i naturally cared nothing for the world which i could only read about in the columns of modern society as one comes into touch with things one appreciates it is always interesting to know people  i am afraid deane said with covert satire that my friends are scarcely what you would call fashionable  your friends she remarked looking up at him but that doesnt matter does it i shall make my own friends later on  deane looked across the table she was patting the head of her little spaniel and watching with a selfpossession which amounted almost to insolence the exodus of a party from the neighboring table  young lady he said what sort of a life did you lead before you went to messrs rubicon  moores i always understood that your people were very poor and only respectably connected  you understood the truth she answered with composure  will you tell me then he asked how you learned to wear your clotheshow you picked up all the little tricks of social life  the very faintest of smiles parted her lips a smile that wrinkled at the corners of her eyes and suddenly altered her appearance so that deane was forced to recognize the charm which even to himself he had denied  my dear mr deane she said it is the natural heritage of a woman to assimilate quickly especially she added after a moments pause amongst surroundings for which she has had a great desire many a time when i was typing pricelists in that wretched little office in a black alpaca gown with my hat hanging up opposite mea black straw with faded flowers which had cost me three or four shillings with darned stockings and patched bootsmany a time i have left off typing for a few minutes and thought and wondered what this must be like i suppose i have what you would call a natural aptitude for it it is because i have thought of it pondered over it desired it  deane looked at her wonderingly well he said let me congratulate you you play the game to perfection if i were in a position to make terms  you are not she interrupted shortly please to pay the bill i am going to take you shopping  they left the brougham at the corner of bond street winifred had signified her desire to walk for a little time deane found himself becoming thoroughly interestednot as he told himself in his companion herself but in his study of her the women they passed she subjected nearly every one of them to a close and comprehensive scrutiny at the men she scarcely glanced she found perhaps her greatest interest in the shop windows she led him across the road to the establishment of a great jeweller  you have not given me an engagement ring she said a little abruptly we will go in and choose one  he followed her obediently into the shop and stood by her side while she described minutely the sort of ring she required her manner inspired instant respect she knew exactly what she wanted and what she wanted was the rarest and most beautiful stones set in the newest fashion she showed very little enthusiasmhesitated evenover the ring which was produced at last after a little hesitation and shown almost with reverence it had been made for a queen but something had gone wronga matter of politicsand they had not dared to part with it even deane stared when the man at his elbow whispered the price but winifred never moved a muscle  i think it will do she said turning to him it is very nearly what i wanted and i want a few pinsemeralds and diamonds i prefer  the shopman was already producing a tray from the window she spoke of pearls and examined those that were shown her with the air of a connoisseur  i shall want a rope of pearls very soon she told the man but not just yet perhaps you will let mr deane know when you have enough of the ones the color and size i like  it will give us very great pleasure madam to collect them the man said bowing  deane produced his chequebookfortunately he was well knownand wrote a cheque for over two thousand pounds in exchange for the receipt which the man handed to him winifred calmly withdrew her glove and slipped on the ring the other things she asked them to send when she left the shop it seemed to deane that there was a little more color in her cheeks and a deeper light in her eyes  jewelry interests you he remarked as they stood for a moment on the pavement  yes she answered of course it does everything of this sort interests me havent i longed all my days to feel the touch of pearls upon my bare neck to have something like this upon my finger that i could look at and worship not only for itself but for the things it represents come and buy me some flowers my sittingroom is a wilderness afterwards i am going into the milliners beyond  deane followed her obediently into the florists opposite she chose a great bowl of pink roses and some white lilac  how many of the roses madam the shopman asked her  she looked at him with faintly upraised eyebrows oh send them as they are she answered carelessly  there are four dozen madam the man remarked bowing  she nodded indifferently the fact that they were a shilling each did not appear to interest her  is that all the lilacs you have she asked as they were leaving the shop  all we have at present madam the man answered  please get some more she said if you can these hotel sittingrooms she added turning to deane seem to have a sort of odor of their own one can only get rid of it by having flowers everywhere now i am going in here she said stopping at a tiny milliners you must wait for mei know you are dying to smoke a cigarettebut you had better give me your pocketbook  i am afraid deane answered imperturbably that its contents will be of little use to you for i have only twenty pounds with me if you will take thesehe handed her the notesi will take a taximeter and cash a cheque i shall only be a few minutes  she nodded and disappeared into the shop when she came out again deane had returned from his little expedition and was talking to some men whom he knew they glanced at winifred a little curiously as they raised their hats and passed on  we can perhaps continue our shopping deane said more comfortably now  she ignored the faint note of satire in his tone one needs so many things she murmured the woman inside is just making out my bill i think i shall want another thirty pounds  i am afraid he said that you have not been able to find what you wanted the amount seems trivial  well she said there was a lace dressinggown about which i could not quite make up my mind perhaps after all i had better have it  she turned back into the shop and he followed her the lace dressinggown was still lying upon a chair and in a few moments deane found it being held up before him by a vivacious little frenchwoman who was endeavoring to convince him that in it madame would look a dream it was very filmy very dainty wonderfully expensive deane heard the price without moving a muscle  i think you had better have it he said i am sure he went on looking into her eyes that you will look charming in it  for the first time he seemed to score she bent over some lace handkerchiefs as though anxious to avoid his gaze very well she said i think that will be all now please pay and let us go  once more they were in the streets  i want a dressingbag she said a little abruptly  by all means he answered we had better go back to the jewellers do you prefer motherofpearl fittings or gold  i am not sure she answered i should like to look at some  they were twenty minutes or so making a selection deane wrote another cheque and stuffed another receipt into his pocket he had made a few suggestions himself which had increased the cost considerably  where to now he asked  i want some gloves she said perhaps you would rather go back to your office now i must not take up your whole afternoon  i am entirely at your service he assured her believe me i find shopping quite an interesting novelty  you mean she said that you like to watch the effect upon me you think i dont understand it is quite easy tell me how i seem to you  you seem very much to the manner born he answered but you seem also if i may say so as though you were getting rid of the pentup desires of years for instance he added as they strolled along the south side of the street there is a certain almost fiercenessi wont say barbarismin the way you absorb the things you desire i am not complaining he added quickly as a matter of fact i am rather inclined to welcome any note of humanity so long as we are engaged he added looking at her sideways one would just as soon feel that one were engaged to a living person as an automaton  she kept her eyes averted but he saw the faint spot of color burning in her cheeks  this is where i think i shall get the gloves i want she said  i will come in with you if i may he answered  her purchases here showed a little more restraint nevertheless everything she chose was the best of its sort when she came out her appetite seemed somehow whetted she walked along the street almost listlessly  do you know that it is nearly halfpast four he said you had better let me give you some tea  she nodded indifferently thank you that would be very nice  will you come to my rooms he asked or shall we go into the carlton and hear the music  she looked at him quickly and then back into a shop window to the carlton if you please she said coldly  they walked to the corner of the street and stood waiting while the brougham came round to them she turned toward a florists and looked into the window  you would like some more flowers he asked  she led him into the shop without a word there was a cluster of red roses over which she bent and selected one i should like this please she said  one only madam the shopman asked  one only she answered composedly i will pin it in here if you will cut the stalk a little she added removing a brooch from the bosom of her gown will you pay for this please she added turning to deane  he was taken aback for a moment you are sure that there is nothing else he asked  nothing she answered  they left the shop and he handed her into the brougham deane was suddenly conscious that his pulse was beating a little faster even though her fingers had lain in his absolutely unresponsive he was wondering what sort of a whim it was which had led her to desire that one flower     chapter xv  a friend   a man in the city who was an old friend of lord nunneley stopped the latter as he was on the point of entering his club  by the bye nunneley he said did i understandi think i saw it in the papersthat the marriage between your daughter and stirling deane was off  the engagement has been broken off answered lord nunneley a little stiffly why  thats all right said the man the only thing was that as i was one of the people you came to to ask about deane i felt that if it was still on i ought to tell you that things arent supposed to be just the same as they were  do you mean about deane asked lord nunneley  his friend nodded there are some very curious rumors going about he said you remember of course his charging a man named hefferoma south africanwith an attempt at blackmail the other day the man was committed for trial and there was not much came out in the evidence before the magistrates since then however people have been talking they say that hefferom had actual knowledge of documents proving that deanes title to the little anna goldmine was a false one and that the mine in reality belonged to hefferom himself and a partner  that sounds like a very curious story lord nunneley remarked if it is true why doesnt hefferom produce his document and have done with it  because it has been stolen the other answered there are all sorts of stories going about too concerning the theft the point remains however that there is a strong feeling that the document in question does exist and that it may turn up if so of course it would ruin deane i see that the shares of his corporation have had a most tremendous drop so it seems as though there might be something in it buy a special edition this afternoon and youll know more about it  lord nunneley nodded thank you he said i will do so  lord nunneley walked slowly along pall mall after all there was no need to buy a paper on the placards which the boys were displaying as he neared trafalgar square were great headlines       extraordinary drop of shares in the goldmines association      panic in the city  lord nunneley bought a paper and stood for a few minutes reading it then he called a taxicab and gave the man the address of deanes offices he was well known there and deanes confidential man at once came forward  mr deane will see you of course my lord he said he is really disengaged now but we are obliged to deny him to everybody because of these interviewers will you come with me my lord  lord nunneley found himself ushered into deanes private room deane was dictating rapidly to his secretary as usual he was calm selfpossessed carefully groomed and dressed there was nothing about his appearance in any way to suggest a panic he heard his visitors name however with surprise  nunneley he exclaimed rising to his feet  lord nunneley nodded and held out his hand i was in the city and thought id look you up deane he said can i have a word or two with you  certainly deane answered give us five minutes ellisonor stay away until i ring he added to his secretary  lord nunneley accepted an easychair and also a cigarette but he seemed in no great hurry to explain his business i was very sorry deane he said at last to see the papers this evening i hope the trouble isnt very serious  do you hold any of our shares deane asked  if i did said the other coloring a little i should not have come here  deane accepted the reproof i beg your pardon  i daresay continued lord nunneley my coming seems to you under the circumstances a little superfluous however what i wanted to say is this you see olive is our only child and that made us very anxious about anything to do with her i am sure that you yourself must feel now when you are under so much anxiety that it is better not to have the added responsibility of your engagement upon your shoulders  i have never questioned your wisdom in breaking it off deane said quietly under the circumstances i agree with you that it is a very good thing  thats all right lord nunneley continued a little hastily of course neither you nor olive are children and you are not the sort to wear your hearts upon your sleeve in short he added somewhat abruptly youll both get over it theres no doubt about that i didnt come to revert to this matter at all i simply wanted to say that though our relations are changed i still do feel a considerable amount of friendship for you deane and i wanted to come and just tell you i was sorry and look here he went on a little awkwardly ive between seven and eight thousand pounds for which i am looking for an investment and if the moneys any use to you deane why say the word and ill write you a cheque on the spot  deane looked at his visitor for a moment in an astonishment which triumphed over the natural impassivity of his expression then a little flush rose in his cheeks he got to his feet and held out his hand  nunneley he said this is awfully good of you i shall not forget it believe that if we wanted money or if i did personally id accept your offer like a shot  too much of a drop in the bucket i suppose lord nunneley remarked it isnt much i know  it isnt that deane interrupted the situation is simply that our shares have had a big drop because of certain rumors about our title to the little anna goldmine if those rumors were confirmed five or six hundred thousand pounds wouldnt help us if they are not confirmed and if they die a natural death as i imagine they must our shares will recover themselves and we shall not need money  you dont believe in the existence of any such document then lord nunneley asked  i do not believe that it will be produced deane answered and if it were produced he went on i do not believe in its validity i would not say as much even as this to the reporters but the document about which people have been talking is simply an original claim to the little anna goldmine which was deserted by the very man who put me on to it and in whose name the claim stands you see therefore that any attempt to establish a legal claim is more or less a swindle  lord nunneley rose to his feet you are really not so very much alarmed then  deane shook his head this drop in shares after all he said does not affect us particularly except for the time it simply means that the market declares that we are a few hundred thousand pounds poorer today than we were yesterday whether the market is right or not remains to be proved  well i am glad to have seen you at any rate deane and remember if there is anything i can do  you have already deane said done a great deal lord nunneley i shall not forget your visit or your offer  thats all right lord nunneley declared olive did not know i was coming but im sure if she had known she would have sent her love dont bother to ring i can find my way out  the visit of his projected fatherinlaw seemed to deane like a pleasant little oasis in the middle of a long dreary day these rumors of which lord nunneley had heard seemed to have come into existence during the last few hours there had been some large failures lately and investors were all nervous the country was short of money in ordinary times an attack upon the stability of such a corporation as his would have been impossible today nothing seemed impossible in his heart deane knew or felt that the situation was safe yet the very fact that these rumors had sprung into being seemed to denote the line of defence which hefferoms lawyers were prepared to offer in the coming trial he would be accused everywhereif not in words in suggestionof complicity in the murder of sinclair the existence of that document would be believed in it would be said openly perhaps that he was responsible himself for its suppression it was not the fact that on paper he was nearly a quarter of a million poorer than he had been a week ago that troubled him it was the reflection that bold though his words had been it was within the power of the man who lay awaiting his trial practically to ruin him the question of the whereabouts of the document might be in a few weeks the most discussed matter in london  deane acting upon a sudden impulse left his office by the back entrance and drove to the small hotel where winifred was staying miss rowan was at home he was told and after a few minutes delay he was shown into her sittingroom  miss rowan will be with you in a moment her maid announced coming through from the bedroom she is with her dressmaker at present  deane nodded and took up the newspaper mechanically from the table the room seemed to him almost faint with the perfume of flowers he glanced around carelessly and suddenly found his attention riveted upon her writingtable in a little silver vase standing by itself was the red rose which he had bought for her two days since     chapter xvi  passion   she came to him in a few moments dressed in a fascinating negligée gowncame to him with a rustle of silk and a faint expression of surprise upon her upraised eyebrows  i did not expect you until this evening she remarked  he nodded i took the liberty of coming here to ask you a question  she smiled as she sat down upon the sofa oh the paper is quite safe  how did you know what i came for he asked a little startled  my dear friend she said shrugging her shoulders as i have decided that it is to my interests to link my future with yours you cannot wonder that i have found such details as thoseshe pointed to an evening paper which he noticed now lying upon her writingtableinteresting i have been trying to understand how matters stand tell me if i am right it seems to me that so long as that document remains an imagined thing so long as it is not produced or sworn to definitely you are safe  the corporation is safe answered deane and in a measure i suppose i am on the other hand i shall be accused naturally of suppressing it and probably of complicity in sinclairs murder there is hefferom you see prepared to swear that sinclair came to london with that paper in his possession sinclair is known to have come to my office he has certainly been murdered the paper cannot be found and the corporation remains in possession of the mine people will certainly put these things together  she nodded it will be very bad indeed she said slowly for your reputation  it will i am afraid said deane considerably lessen my social value as your husband  it seems to me she replied that money is so powerful i daresay you will be able to live it down  with your help deane remarked sarcastically it seems to me very possible by the bye he continued with reference to that document you must forgive me if i feel some slight uneasiness at times as to its safety  you need have none she answered it is in safe keeping  it is your own interests as well as mine you are guarding he reminded her  i am perfectly aware of it she answered since you are here may i offer you some tea  thanks he said i think not by the bye do you care to go to the opera tonight i have two stalls and melba is singing  a sudden light flashed over her face it was as though the mask had been raised for a moment perhaps by contrast her tone seemed colder than ever as she answered him i should like to very much will you call for me  at halfpast seven he answered we will have a little dinner somewhere first  you are sure she asked that you do not mind being seen out  it is all to my advantage he answered the men who are most talked about should never shrink from publicity the people who have been told today that i am a bankrupt a swindler and a murderer and that my ruin is only a matter of minutes will hesitate if they see me with you in the stalls of the opera tonight  nero fiddled she reminded him  nero was a hysterical person he answered my tendencies are towards the other extreme until halfpast seven then  until halfpast seven she repeated  he bowed and left her without even shaking hands she stood quite still for a moment looking at the door which he had closed behind him then she crossed the room slowly and lifted the vase with its solitary rose to her lips a second later it lay dashed to pieces upon the floor the flaming color was in her cheeks her fists were clenched  i hate him she declared to herself i hate him now more than ever  illustration i hate him she declared to herself i hate him now more than ever                                       winifred talked more than usual at the short dinner which they had at a famous café close to the opera house deane a little weary with the strain of the day was at first irresponsive but gradually he forgot himself in the interest of playing his new part she was wearing a dress of black velvet a rope of pearls which had been sent for her inspection only that afternoon and pearl earrings concerning which she gravely asked his opinion there was something a little unenglishlooking about her tonightabout the small delicate head with the masses of brown hair the pale complexion the deep eyes with their hidden depths the pearls which fell so gracefully over her black gown many people knew him by sight and pointed him out to othersthe man whom everyone was talking about the man who was supposed to be shivering on the brink of social and financial ruin whose very freedom from justice might be a matter of hourssitting there with a girl who was unknown to all of them yet without a doubt one of his own world some of them wondered that she should care to be seen about with him at such a time these however were mostly the men the women who saw him as usual wellgroomed goodlooking debonair only admired him the more for his courage  they had driven the few yards together to the opera house in silence nevertheless deane fancied that his companion seemed tonight a little more accessible he was amazed to find how great an interest he was beginning to take in her moods amazed to find himself taking every opportunity to touch her fingers to speak covertly of the destined ending of their engagement he fancied sometimes that her fingers rested more softly in his that the chill aloofness of her demeanor had been more than once on the point of being raised and yet after all it might only be fancy he thought as he followed her and the attendant along the corridor into their places he was a fool to trouble himself about it she was very likely what she had always seemeda bloodless indifferent creature with a greed for jewels and fine clothes sprung up in hera fungus growth the evil result of her long years of servitude yet that night his convictions as to her coldness received something of a shock it was the first night they had been to the opera together and he had imagined that she would sit as she had sat through so many theatresslightly bored slightly nonchalant interested only to know who the people might be by whom they were surrounded and in the play itself if by chance it was well acted and satisfactory tonight he realized that there were things which could move her even if he himself had not the power he saw her eyes flash with the glory of the music and he saw them turn marvellously soft and tender as the whiterobed iseult sang to them with sobs in her throat sobs which seemed to make that melody only more intense and sweeter she seemed to respond to every note of the music more than once he saw her quiver with excitement by accident her fingers touched his and rested there he felt a thrill which amazed him for the moment he too forgot that wretched maze of affairs in which he was plunged the great passionate lovestory throbbed too in his heart and veins the figures on the stage were for a moment dim they existed only as types in those few seconds he realized for the first time in his life the real meaning of this wonderful emotion with which the very air around them seemed charged and almost at the moment of realization there came to him fiercely insistently the great questiondid she share it did she understand was it possible that such a passion could be born of itself without response or encouragement he leaned forward and tried to see into her face a great stillness reigned in the halfdarkened opera house a stillness except for the wonderful music which still flowed from those divine lips he leaned forward until he could see her face and his heart throbbed with the wonder of it all the passion all the intense mystery of a strenuous love were there in her glowing eyes her halfparted lips it was only a momentary glimpse he had then as though conscious of his observation she raised her fan their eyes had never met he was left after all with the problem unsolved  deane came down to earth again as the curtain fell his companion drew a long soft breath and leaned back in her seat  dont you want to go out and smoke or something she asked calmly i do not feel like talking at all the music is wonderful  he left her without a word only as he reached the end of his row and turned to walk up the sloping aisle he glanced back once more she had not moved her eyes were closed she seemed indeed like a person exhausted with the strain of listening he made his way out to the refreshment room humming softly to himself it was a mask after all which she wore he understood suddenly the relief which had come to him he understood that this engagement which had seemed to him like a piece of halfcontemptible bathos had suddenly become the first and most desirable thing in his life     chapter xvii  a despairing call   the great lawyer whom the telephone message from deane had summoned sat in a comfortable easychair adjoining deanes writingtable his manner was serious but not discouraging  you see deane he said after all it depends very much upon this alleged document the whole case practically hinges upon it if the defendants are unable to procure it or a copy of it or witnesses who can swear to it i do not think that they can do us much harm especially if we take the course which i have already suggested to our counsel as yet we have received no intimation that the other side have the slightest trace of the document in question if on the other hand it should come into their possession they are bound to notify us may i ask mr deane what you believe the probabilities are as regards this matter  it isnt a matter of probability deane answered to the best of my belief there is no such document in existence  in that case the lawyer continued i think that you need have no further anxiety about the case of course there is no chance of a long sentence for the defendant you understand that  perfectly deane answered i dont wish it i should not have prosecuted him at all but it seemed the only way to stop what might have grown into a serious annoyance  i am sorry the lawyer said that the whole thing seems to have been taken so seriously by the press and the public i see your shares have dropped to a ridiculous amount  a chance for someone to make money deane remarked i am much obliged to you for coming up hardaway  the lawyer nodded and took his departure deane sat for some time in a brown study fundamentally he had all the direct impulses and propensities of a truthful man the course of action into which he was at present driven was distastefulalmost repugnant to him yet after all he was only fighting hefferom with his own weapons the man was a blackmailernothing more or less yet the fact did not seem to deane to make his hands the cleaner and there was the girl the memory of her face haunted him her desperate plight had been only too apparent if that document of sinclairs was worth the paper it was written on it was he who was the supplanter the thief morally responsible for her grievous plight he moved in his chair uneasily it was almost a relief when the telephone bell at his elbow rang  is that mr deane a womans voice asked  yes he answered  mr stirling deane  yeswhat is it he asked quickly  there was a moments silence the terrified voice which had still seemed somehow familiar to him was silent he could hear from the room to which the instrument was connected the musical chiming of a swiss clockthe call of a birdand then silence his hand was upon the receiver to ring up the exchange when suddenly a cry of terror a cry of shrill agonized terror rang in his ear  stirling mr deane stirling come  there was an abrupt cessation of that frantic cry the last word was muffled as though something had been dashed against the speakers mouth there was the sound of the falling of a chair or heavy piece of furniture then silencesilence ominous heavy maddening  deane rang up the exchange the young lady who answered him was a little annoyed at his vehemence  i want you to tell me to whom i have been speaking he exclaimed where was i rung up from a few moments ago  no idea the young lady answered tartly didnt they give their name  i want to know where the call was from deane said please tell me quickly  we dont take any note of local calls the young lady answered ring off please  stop deane cried listen please this is important i am mr deanemr stirling deaneof the incorporated goldmines association i have just been rung up by a woman in distresssome one who appealed for help she was dragged away from the telephone before she could tell me where she was speaking from you must try and find out the number for me you must do it it may be a matter of life or death  there was an instants silencea buzzing noisethen a mans voice sorry sir he said our operator cannot remember the exact number that was speaking to you it was a house in red lion square though she is sure of that  how many subscribers have you there deane asked swiftly  twentyfour or five sir the man answered sorry we cant help you further  deane left the office in such a hurry that a whole crop of fresh rumors were started he drove as swiftly as his electric brougham could take him to the corner of red lion square all the time with a telephone directory on his knee he was copying out addresses he entered red lion square on foot with the paper in his hand there were twentyeight addresses he had no idea where to begin  seven or eight were the addresses of business firms he struck these out then he tried the others one after the other he interviewed all sorts of people unsuccessfully he was received everywhere with suspicion most of the houses were converted flats or cheap lodginghouses halfdressed women leered at him over the banisters shabby men of all ages were slavishly anxious to earn a tip gradually he was forced to realize that his was a mad almost hopeless search people stood at their doors and watched him jeering women hung out of the windows shouting coarse invitations or derisive comments upon his perseverance his nerves were all on edge his blood was hot with anger somewhere within a few hundred perhaps a few yards of him this girl was in the hands of persons who meant ill to her the terror in her voice was no ordinary fear she was face to face with the worst that could happen  he reached the last house on his list it was on the further side of the square and one of the most respectable in appearance contrary to what was apparently the usual custom the front door was closed and most of the blinds drawn there was no sign of life about the place when he rang the bell yet after scarcely a moments delay the door was thrown open and a neatly dressed parlormaid answered his summons  deane adopted new tactics he drew a sovereign from his waistcoat pocket and held it between his fingers you are on the telephone i believe he said number 0198 someone rang me up from here about an hour or so ago i recognized the voice but the message was indistinct will you tell miss rowan that i am here  the girl shook her head there is no one of that name living here sir she answered  a rather pale young lady tall and slim who has just arrived deane persisted i am anxious to find her quickly cant you help me  he pulled out a handful of gold and the girl looked at it with covetous eyes she sighed as she once more shook her head  there is no one here of that name sir she saidno young lady at all in fact  you are quite sure deane asked with a sinking heart  quite sir the girl answered confidently  she made a movement as though to close the door it is possible that deane would have taken the hint and departed but for that last searching look which he threw at her he thrust his boot against the door and resumed his place on the inner side of the threshold from there he looked at her once more he was right there were traces of powder on her cheeks and her eyebrows were certainly not natural underneath her trim black skirt he had caught a glimpse of brown openworked stockings and tan shoes with a large bow and high heels instinctively he felt that no ordinary servant would have been allowed to go about like this  i should like to see your mistress before i go deane said firmly please go and tell her i will not detain her more than a few moments  shes not in the girl answered with a distinct change of manner please dont stay about here or i shall get into trouble  i am sorry deane answered but if she is not in i am going to wait for her  he was in the hall nowa miserable untidy place with a brokendown mirror and hatrack as sole furniture and covered with a much soiled oilcloth the stairs were right ahead of him and deane looked up he looked into a womans face as she leaned over the well of the banisters looking down almost immediately she drew away and came down  deane rose up to meet her she was dressed in black was very pale with large earringspretty in a way and certainly not of formidable appearance  you wished to see me she asked a little hesitatingly as she reached the bottom stair i thought i heard you tell my servant that you wished to speak to her mistress  you are right madam deane answered i do wish to speak to you  and what is it that you wish the lady asked  an act of kindness deane answered for which i am willing to payto pay heavily i am in search of a young lady who rang me up only an hour or so ago from this localityi believe from this house i am offering a reward of two hundred pounds for any one who may help me in my search  he raised his voice he meant the servant or the person who was posing as a servant to hear him he was unable to observe her closely but he noticed that she moved a little nearer and appeared to be listening intently  i am afraid that you have come to the wrong house the lady answered gently this is not a very nice neighborhood i know but we are quite respectable people here and we are not upon the telephone at all  not on the telephone at all deane repeated but i have your name and number from the telephone companynumber 0198mrs garvice  mrs garvice has left the lady declared i have taken the house but the telephone was of no use to me so i have had it taken away  may i see the place where the instrument was deane asked i have a particular reason for asking  certainly not the lady answered a little sharply open the door hilda we have nothing else to say to you sir  the maid obeyed and deane reluctantly took up his hat he was already upon the threshold when he suddenly stopped a remarkable change came over him he stepped quickly back the woman had gone as pale as death from one of the rooms upstairs came the shrill unmistakable summons of a telephone bell and mingling with it the chiming of a cuckoo clock  shut the door deane ordered sternly madam he said turning towards the lady of the house it is still within your power to earn that two hundred pounds  the woman looked at him curiously two hundred pounds she said is a great deal of money one does not carry about sums like that  deane thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out a little roll of notes i have twelve tenpound notes here he said and i can write a cheque for the balance you know what i want if you turn me away i shall be back with a search warrant in less than halfanhour  she held out her hand for the notes follow me she said you understand that i am simply a lodginghouse keeper i cannot be responsible for my tenants or their actions  i understand that deane answered eagerly quick lead the way upstairs     chapter xviii  winifred is trapped   deane followed his guide up two flights of stairson the landing of the third she paused  i do not usually interfere with the comings and goings of my lodgers she said they pay for their rooms that is all i ask you see the door opposite you  yes deane answered quickly  that room is tenanted by a young woman who called herself montague but received letters under the name of sinclair she had a visitor this afternoon who might be the young person of whom you are in search you had better go in and see  deane was across the landing in a moment he tapped sharply upon the door there was no answer he tried the handle the door was locked  open the door he cried out shaking it vigorously  there was no answer to deane the silence was ominous he turned to the woman who stood silently by his side with a fierce little exclamation where is the telephone he demanded  inside there she answered it used to be my sittingroom  the door is locked he exclaimed  i do not understand it she admitted  have you another key  no  he flung himself at the door tearing it half from its hinges another assault and with a tearing of splinters it fell inside deane stepped over it into the room and a low cry of anger broke from his lips the woman at his side fled shrieking downstairs on the floor lay winifred rowan her limbs bound with cords a gag in her mouth her clothing all dishevelled her eyes shining with an almost painful intensity from her ashen gray face deane fell on his knees by her side  winifred he exclaimed my god  he snatched his knife from his pocket removed the gag from her mouth and cut all her bonds her hands tried nervously to rearrange her dress over her bosom he tore off his own coat and threw it over her  are you badly hurt he asked anxiously  i am not hurt much she answered weakly but  but what he demanded  she commenced to cry softly but insistently black fear rose up to torture him but what he repeated with sinking heart  it has gone she murmured crossing her hands upon her bosom  what has gone he asked quick  the deed she whispered dont look at me like that i couldnt help it it was a trap of course to get me here and i was a fool the letter was from you but i ought to have known that it was a forgery i was taken unawares she was like a madwoman she would have torn the clothes from my body i struggled i called out it was no use she has taken it away  but you are not hurt he exclaimed anxiously  ino she answered a little vacantly but it is gone i was not fit to be trusted with it i ought to have given it up to you  she was very pale and he was afraid of her fainting he summoned the landlady once more she was waiting on the stairs close by  something very serious has happened here he said sternly this young lady has been assaulted and robbed  im sure im very sorry the woman declared you cant blame any of us though i never heard a sound no more did hilda and i cant prevent my lodgers having visitors  we wont discuss it deane said sharply but if this is miss montagues room  it isnt the woman interrupted its my sittingroom miss montague has only an attic and she came to me and said that she couldnt receive a visitor there and asked me to lend her my room for a few minutes  deane nodded the other rooms on this floor are unoccupied of course he said oh its quite easy to understand i dont need to ask you any more questions i dont want any more explanations if you want to keep this out of the police court you will do exactly as i tell you  yes she exclaimed eagerly i will do anything  send your servant for a cab deane said and arrange this young ladys dress so that i can take her home  i will fetch her a bodice of my own declared the woman hurrying off  winifred had risen to her feet and was sitting in an easychair she was leaning forward with her face half buried in her hands deane turned towards her  winifred  she avoided his gaze dont she begged please dont talk to me i cant bear it  but i may say he began  no she interrupted almost fiercely please say nothing i mean it i cannot bear to talk i cannot bear to be talked to  a little throb of anger darkened his face she had not even common gratitude for her rescue she had but one thought one regretthe loss of that future of luxury to attain which she had bound herself to him a curious anger burned in his blooda pain which he could not analyze shook his heart then there came the sound of voices on the stairs feminine voices raised in anger the door was burst open ruby stood there upon the threshold looking in upon them her lips curved in an ugly smile of triumph her eyes ablaze behind her stood the landlady a black bodice in her hand her forehead wrinkled in a deprecating frown  so youve found her have you ruby exclaimed her face turned towards deane her finger outstretched to where winifred sat shrinking back in her chair thieves both of you thieves thieves  deane pointed to winifreds torn clothing and that he asked  it was restitution the girl declared fiercely the deed was mine your millions are mine she stole it for youher brother was a murderer for you how do you think the story will look in the newspapers eh inciting to murder and theft isnt that a crime swindlers both of you she cried passionately youd have kept me a beggar eh she cried to winifred while you clad your poor body in silks and laces covered yourself with jewels and made him marry you and i was to starveto starve or worse well well see well see  young lady deane said calmly you are being led away by your imagination you have taken a paper away from miss rowan which you seem to think is going to turn out a sort of el dorado it isnt worth the paper its written on  its a lie the girl shrieked ive taken it to the lawyers it is genuinethey all say so  deane almost lifted winifred from her chair that remains to be seen he declared  in any case it was stolen she cried that young woman there has got to say how it came into her possession and what she meant by going around with it sewn into her bodice oh you neednt try to dupe me she cried i want my moneygod knows how i want it and i mean to make her suffer too she added pointing to winifred shes a thief shes lived in luxury while ive starvedshes worn the clothes of a princess while ive gone in rags but she shall pay my god she shall pay  deane with winifred by his side had reached the door i am afraid he said turning to the girl who was still regarding them with breathless anger that you have let your imagination run away with you a good deal a dose of the law courts will do you no harm if you care for a word of warning from me you can have it dont build your hopes too much upon that paper  we shall see she cried fiercely you cant frighten me if the paper is of no value why did she steal it why did she carry it sewn in her clothes if you  she hesitated for a moment her eyes rested upon deane her expression softened if you want to make terms she began  he turned away come winifred he said                                       in the cab they scarcely spoke she had the air of a person utterly exhaustedindifferent to anything that might happen  tell me he asked soon after they started what made you go to that house  the letter from you she answered i was a fool of course but i went it doesnt matter does it  i suppose not he answered  the despair in her face nerved him to further speech i am afraid he said that you are worrying about that deedor rather the loss of it i am sorry that i came too late but it couldnt be helped you did all that you could i am sure of that  of course she interposed impatiently and i have failed that is the end of it  he looked out of the window looked with stern unseeing eyes upon the passing people the sun had ceased to shine his heart was heavy as lead he seemed suddenly to realize the reason of her dejection she believed in the deed she believed that he was indeed a pauper it was for the wreck of her hopes that she was lamenting the rest went for nothing he was a poor manno longer of any interest to her his manner unconsciously stiffened as the thought came rushing home to him he drew away from her and he remained silent until the cab stopped in front of her hotel she stepped out quickly and almost ran across the pavement  tomorrow she said holding out her hand as though to prevent his following  he bowed and turned away her deshabille was without doubt an embarrassment already he was beginning to find excuses for her nevertheless he watched the slim swaying figure as the doors closed upon her with something of apprehension was it ominous that she should pass away without a backward glance was she indeed nothing but an adventuress deprived of her prey  he paid the cab and walked slowly back to his rooms his solicitor had already rung up two of his directors were waiting to see him a reporter buttonholed him upon the pavement from all of which things deane knew that ruby sinclair had lost no time that the first note of battle had been sounded     chapter xix  miss sinclairs offer   miss rowan had left two hours ago and had taken all her luggage and paid her bill apparently she had no idea of returningat any rate she had not reserved any rooms the hallporter of the little hotel looked at deane with some curiosity as he answered his rapid questions the manageress came rustling out of her office and beamed on deane who had once stayed there for several weeks she confirmed the information which he had already received and supplemented it with a few further details  miss rowan paid her bill deane asked  certainly sir the manageress answered miss rowan was exceedingly particular about paying her accounts the moment they were presented  and she left no message deane asked  none at all sir was the answer  he noticed the gleam of curiosity in her eyes and promptly altered his tactics thank you very much he said turning away i quite understood that miss rowan was not leaving until this afternoon my mistake i daresay by the bye have you any instructions with regard to letters  none the manageress replied if any come we shall keep them until we hear from her  deane turned away and reëntered his brougham i shall find a note at my rooms i daresay he remarked good morning mrs merrygold  his words were prophetic he called at his rooms on his way to the club for lunch and found a note there addressed to him in winifreds handwriting       wednesday morning       you will understand of course that this is the end the      jewels which you gave me i have returned today by registered      post one ring i have kept it is i think the least valuable      of any but i did not wish to part with it if you insist      however it is always at your disposal       i am going back where i belongto the world which i should      never have quitted everything has been a great mistake please      understand that you are absolutely and entirely free in every      way i only trust that i may live long enough to atone in some      measure for my folly       winifred rowan  deane read this letter over a dozen times one thing alone seemed clear she had deserted him she had not even waited for the final issue she had fled from the sinking ship with a haste almost indecent she had made no terms suggested no compromise deane when he thought the whole matter over was still puzzled such precipitancy was not logical if his hand was no longer strong enough to open the gates of the promised land it could at least have lifted her up from the miseries of her past life he found himself after a study of her few lines curiously depressed she had gonewillinglyapparently without regret except for her wasted opportunities he felt an emptiness in his life which he failed to understand there had been nothing of the sort when lady olive had held out her hand and bidden him farewell was he getting sentimental he set his teeth absurd it was an episode happily concluded outside there was thunder in the aira storm for him to face  his solicitor did not beat about the bush in the face of that document mr deane he said the treasury do not propose to proceed with the prosecution of hefferom its existence of course throws altogether a different light upon the whole situation whatever may be its exact legal worth hefferom was simply engaged upon a task of compromise he had something solid behind him there is not a shadow of evidence against him  very well said deane let hefferom go i confess that when i sent to scotland yard i never anticipated that this particular document would ever come into evidence  you knew of its existence the lawyer asked  sinclair himself showed it to me deane answered calmly so far as sinclair himself was concerned the affair was a swindle for it was he who recommended me to jump the claimsaid he thought that there was some stuff there but he had no money to work it i let him off a hundred pounds he owed me and took his advice but that is ancient history the mine is my property all rightor rather it was  mr hardaway listened with a grave face deane he said i hope and believe that you may be speaking the truth but the original deed is in the hands of unscrupulous people we had a notification this afternoon that a suit is about to be commenced against your corporation  the sooner the better deane answered well know where we are at any rate i claim that by the statute laws of the country that claim was forfeit if it was not then the inducing me to sink capital and work the claim was a damnable conspiracy  your corporation fight with you of course the lawyer asked  of course deane answered what else could they do we fight to the end  that night shares in the incorporated goldmines association stood at 90 at closing time the following day they stood at 74 a few lines in the paper had done it an action had been started by hefferom and the legatees of the estate of the late richard sinclair claiming as their property the little anna goldmine the thing had been talked about for some time but now that it had actually occurred people seemed none the less staggered the city believed in stirling deaneit had believed in him so implicitly that in its heart it had never placed any faith in this cloud of rumors yet there it was now in black and white it was no longer possible to speak of compromise the matter was to be fought out in the open courts and failure could spell nothing but ruin to one of the richest corporations in london deanes photograph was in all the papersalso the menu of a famous dinner which he gave to his directors he sent a cheque for five thousand pounds to a hospital and was reported to be going on the turf the lawsuit he treated everywhere as a joke he was careful always to wear the usual bunch of violets in his buttonhole and to affect something of the dandy in his attire his personal demeanor kept his shares at least ten points higher than they would otherwise have been  but deane nevertheless was in hell he was badgered by his directors worried by his lawyers and underneath it all and apart from his financial responsibilities he was suffering from a sense of personal loss a wound whose pain left him but little peace he never stopped to admit to himself exactly what his suffering was he sat for hours lost in thought and his thoughts were always of that pale lady of his dreams who had stolen so abruptly from his arms the girl who had played for a few weeks so strange a part in his life he tried to find what had become of her but in vain she seemed to have completely vanished he puzzled over her behavior until the lines in his face grew set and hard was she indeed ingrateready to abandon her strange bargain at the first whisper of disaster or had she some other reason he had accepted her terms because of the power which she heldwhat if at the loss of that power she had taken it for granted that their bargain was cancelled and had hurried away to avoid the shame of dismissal from him it was just what she would doperhaps just what she had done  deane was careful during these days of probation to attend at his office regularly and to shrink from none of his customary duties one afternoon his clerk brought him in a card  a young lady to see you sir he announced  deanes heart gave a jump the blood rushed through his veins he was scarcely able to read the card which he had taken into his fingers with wellaffected carelessness then the pain came the black disappointment which seemed to turn his heart into a stone it was not she he found it hard to take any interest in this caller and yet he felt that her coming was significant       miss ruby sinclair  you can show the young lady in gray deane ordered  when she arrived deane scarcely knew her she was expensively dressed from head to foot she carried herself with an assurance which was almost overdone the fashion of her dress and hat were certainly not chosen with a view to being overlooked she was very modernshe reminded him exactly of a young lady in a musical comedy with whom he had once had a slight acquaintance he would scarcely have been surprised had he found when she lifted her veil that her eyebrows were blackened  you didnt expect to see me of course she said holding his hand for a moment and looking at him steadfastly may i sit down  of course he answered  she chose the easychair and crossed her legs with a good deal of rustle and a considerable display of black silk stocking  she looked at him curiously are you still angry with me she asked  well i dont usually bear malice he answered but i can scarcely forgive your method of dealing with miss rowan  or its results she asked with a little laugh well i came out on the top anyhow and you must remember mr deane that i was desperateyou dont know how desperate she continued after a moments pause i hadnt a shilling left in the worldnot a shillingnot a friend and somewhere in london there was wealth that belonged to me  that deane remarked dryly is a matter which is as yet undecided  well i judge by facts she answered with a little laugh lawyers dont usually throw money away do they theyre willing to advance me all i want on the security of the little anna goldmine  deane smiled upon her genially my mine he remarked  no she declaredthe property of the legatees of richard sinclair  deane shook his head my dear young lady he said you were more in your element when you walked bareheaded upon the sands of rakney and saved me from a wetting than in your present pose  and you she declared were nicer to me a great deal for those few days  naturally he answered smiling how can i be particularly amiable to a young lady who is trying to ruin me  she looked at him earnestly in her fashionable attire she presented indeed a very different appearance from the eager brownskinned girl with the shapely limbs and delightful carriage whom he had first seen at rakney yet he fancied that she was trying to reawaken his earlier impressions of herinnocent of vanity as he was he could not misunderstand her appealing gaze  i do not want to ruin you she declared i do not want to do anything of the sort isnt there enough for both of us why should we fight  he sighed how can we compromise he asked the mine does not belong to me any longer i sold it years ago to the incorporated goldmines association  you could not sell what didnt belong to you she objected  they paid me the money for it at any rate he answered  if i win she asked who will lose the money  the incorporated goldmines association he answered but they would have a claim upon me i suppose eventually that i should  she held out her handno longer brown and stained with seaweed but delicately gloved perfumed elegant let us be friends she said i am sorry i was rough to your little ally i couldnt help it she was in my way i chose the only means we neednt consider heryou and i are different sort of people we know what we want i am not only a money grubber i want the rest of life the whole thingthe music the poetry the passion remember my wretched starved existence do you wonder that i am on fire to pass on to the other things it isnt the moneyyour money or any one elses i want life i want the wine and the spices i want the dregs cant you understand you mustyou must  her passionate eyes sought his her body swayed towards him deane looked downwards upon his blotter in the outer office he could hear the clicking of typewriters the subdued murmur of voices through the halfopened window came floating in the everlasting chorusthe falling footsteps upon the pavement the jingling of hansom bells the faroff roar of the heavier traffic all these things seemed to him curiously unreal he was conscious only of the intensity of the moment the pleading of her eyes the warm breath upon his cheeks he heard the rustling of her skirts he felt that she was rising from her chair then he braced himself for his effort  my dear young lady he saidif you really want to compromisefor a moderate amounti will send for my lawyer we cannot arrange this thing by ourselves  she rose to her feet but for a moment she was speechless when he looked at her face he found it almost unrecognizable she dropped her veil quickly but from behind it the flash of her eyes was in itself a threat  i am sorry he said lamely i hope you understand  she turned to the door and passed out without a word     chapter xx  through the mill   deane stood at last on the other side of those long dragging months of unspeakable weariness day after day in the close atmosphere of the courts week after week of what seemed to him unnecessary repetitions and delaysso the great machine of the law moved on its slow and stately way and the case of sinclair v the incorporated goldmines association crept on toward the end one thing at least deane had gained his examination and crossexaminationand he was in the witness box altogether for nearly two daysfailed to reveal a single weak joint in the armor of his truthfulness his story was consistent and honorable throughout he was able to prove the payment to sinclair to prove sinclairs suggestion that he should have a try at the mine at the end of the case one thing remained certain and that was that morally speaking the mine was deanes when he had sold it to the corporation yet behind it all there were those titledeeds with which sinclair had never parted and which now formed the backbone of this present suit the more sensational part of the case too concerning which there had been endless rumors collapsed immediately  is it not true that sinclair paid you a visit at your offices a few days before his murder counsel asked  certainly deane answered  will you tell us what transpired at that interview  well it scarcely amounted to an interview deane answered composedly the man was drunk and i found him offensive he brandished the document at me on which the present case is founded and i suspected him of an attempt at blackmail i had him thrown out  yet a few days afterwards you commissioned rowanthe man who murdered sinclairto obtain that document from him counsel said amidst some sensation  scarcely that deane answered rowan who had been a friend of mine in south africa and was a man of an altogether different stamp than sinclair called upon me a few days later i told him the circumstances  you incited him to procure that document from sinclair counsel declared  i cannot admit that deane answered i told him that i had declined to be blackmailed by sinclair but that after all i would prefer to pay a reasonable sum of money for the document in question rowan had been on more friendly terms with sinclair than any of us and i thought that he might induce him to listen to reason  if the document was valueless why should you bother about it  im afraid that you dont know much about the mining world deane replied amiably any prejudicial report however malicious however false affects the market and one must always consider ones stockholders  very well then counsel said we come to this you deputed rowan to see what he could do with sinclair do you realize your responsibility in this matter you are aware of what happened  certainly deane answered i shall never cease to regret it sinclair was mad drunk and the two men quarrelled the blow which killed him was struck in selfdefence  the law did not take that view  i stood by rowan when he died deane said with a sudden note of solemnity in his tone he told me the truth then and the truth is what i have told you  nevertheless he stole the document counsel continued it was discovered afterwards in the possession of miss rowan  so i have heard deane answered calmly it was a pity that she did not hand it over to me  you would have destroyed it i suppose  most certainly deane answered the mine belonged to me sinclair had declared before witnesses that there were no papers that the claim had not been worked for the requisite time and therefore by the mining laws of the country my purchase was good  the case lasted well over the christmas recess during the holidays deane spent a good part of his time seeking for some trace of winifred rowan he went himself to her old employers but they were able to tell him nothing they could only show him the testimonial which they had written at her request and which she had taken away with her a few days after her departure from the hotel there was no one who seemed able to help him in the least very regretfully he called in the services of a private detective who however was equally unsuccessful the holidays passed the case was reopened and deane was once more immersed in the struggle  it was over at last the strain remainedthe great judge who had heard it declined to pronounce judgment immediately on the conclusion of the pleadings it might be three days or it might be even a week before his decision was known deane turned away from the court with a strong and instinctive desire for solitude the suspense long drawn out through the weeks and through the months had become unbearable he felt himself no longer able calmly to discuss the pros and the cons of the case with his fellow directors and friends he was sick to heart of it all he escaped from one or two passersby and a reporter or so who tried to buttonhole him and ignoring his brougham around which several others were waiting he sprang into a hansom and drove to the garage where he kept his touring car a few brief orders a pencilled note to his servant and deane leaving the garage by the other entrance took the tube to its terminus walked out into the country and was caught up within an hour by the car in which his servant was sitting on the front seat by the side of the chauffeur  the evening passed swiftly into night as they thundered up the great north road into the darkness deane wrapped in his thick coat and rugs leaned back in his seat with both windows down feeling an inexpressible relief in the sharp sting of the night air the flakes of snow and little clouds of rain blown every now and then through the open windows he was free at last from the hateful environment of the last few months no longer was there anyone to point him out as the man who had sold for a million pounds a mine which had never belonged to him save for the two motionless figures in front he was alone there was no one to ask him wearisome questions no one to offer him sympathy or wish him goodfortune on they sped through the night till the villages were like dead haunts without a light in the windows and only an occasional lamppost to mark the place where men slumbered they passed through a town which was like a city of the dead and on again to the wilder country where the rabbits rushed terrified before the streaming lights of the car and the wind alone of all natures voices seemed left to remind him that this was not a world of ghosts through which he rushed  presently he saw the man at the wheel swerve a little in his seat and he lifted the speakingtube to his lips can we get through to rakney murray he asked him or shall we stop at kings lynn  we can get through sir the man replied if we can rest for halfanhour somewhere  they knocked up an innkeeper in kings lynn and the two men ate and drank deane himself drank a long whiskey and soda and lit a cigar then they rushed onward into the darkness already lightening a little in the east dawn was breaking as they climbed their last hill and ran down toward the marshlands a red light loomed over the gray sullen sea the marshes themselves seemed heavy and undistinguishablepatches of land and dark creeks of saltwater running into one another out in the bay the foamtopped breakers came rolling sullenly in when at last they turned through the gate and went slowly up the rough roadmarked out with white stakeswhich led up to the tower the dawn had actually come the night was a thing of the past although its shadow seemed to hang low over the gray land the sea had been lately over the rough road and progress was difficult at last though they reached the little bank of shingle on which the tower was built and deane with a little sigh of relief stepped wearily down while his servant unlocked the front door and busied himself arranging a bed and lighting a fire deane walked down to the edge of the sea whose whitetopped waves were dragging back the shingle as they fell and broke with a dull grinding noise never it seemed to him had the beauty of loneliness appealed to him more strongly than at this hour of dawn the birds were silent the wind had fallen there was no sound whatever from the sleeping land only the eternal breaking of the waves continueda sound which was more like the background for stillness grim and mysterious inevitable as existence itself far away now seemed that crowded court with its eager faces its rapt issuesfar away seemed the importance of wealth the great question whether he should remain amongst the millionairesthe world buyers or take his place amongst the poor men of the earth what did it matter after all this kingship of the cities with their lack of perspective their crowded hours their strange artificial atmosphere the value of these things was grotesque for a momentdistorted he had been wise to come here he told himself as a breath of the morning wind stole faint and fresh across the salt sea perhaps he would be wiser still if he defied fortune and stayed here always  his servant summoned him and he went reluctantly indoors he ate some biscuits and drank some milk then as the real dawn broke over the sea a fiery red and with many suggestions of troubled weather in its angry glow he opened the window and threw himself upon the little iron bedstead with its lavenderscented sheets     chapter xxi  all as it should be   there was one person in london who knew deanes whereabouts and from him there came no word to deane himself there seemed something unreal about the long hours which he spent in solitude wandering along the sea front following the sands left by the receding tidehimself a lonely figure on the great gray plain a storm of rain once blew in from the sea but mostly the day was still and colorless to deane after the long hours in the crowded courts his directors meetings his selfimposed mask of ease and confidence the relief of this absolute solitude was immeasurable it was just the season of the year when nature and those who minister to her seem alike to sleep it was too early for any thought of spring the storms of autumn lay behind a certain quietness seemed to hang over the land as though indeed sea and resisting sands were exhausted with the long struggle of the winter  towards afternoon came some few moments of flickering sunlight deane sat on a wooden bar on the top of one of the dykes and above his head a lark was singing a little timidly a little doubtful even of his lonely music but still lending a note of real life to the still gray world over which he hovered deane looked at the queer stone tower on its bank of shingle and blessed the chance which had led him to purchase it he looked inland to the little redtiled village to the deserted quay from which all the fishingboats had been dragged high and dry along the straight line of raised dyke which formed the footpath between him and the village as he looked he became conscious that someone had started out from the village along the dyke top far away at the other end he could see a slowly approaching figure his heart gave a little beat was it a messenger at last coming to bring him his fate he looked up again to where the lark was singing it seemed after all so small a thing nearer and nearer the figure came near enough at last for deane to be able to distinguish something of its outline then he rose to his feet with a quick indrawn breatha little cry of surprise to which there was no one to listen for this was no messenger from the village coming it was a girl in a long gray cloak and a hat which she carried in her hand as though the fresh salt air of the marshes was something also to her deane saw the neatly arranged brown hair blown into confusion about her face against the empty background he recognized the poise of her head the firm but delicate walk the slender swaying figure he knew who it was that came and it seemed to him that from that moment he knew too other things his sense of proportions was suddenly shiftedenlarged perhapsaltered certainly he understood things which before had been mysteries to him he understood as though in some moment of inspiration that riches or poverty life even or death are the incidents of life before its greatest truths nothing that he could think of seemed able to hold his thoughts his heart was beating to music the lark was singing to him a song of her ownsinging in weak tremulous notes a song of life and love and passion he rose to his feet and went to meet her she stopped short and faltered for a moment he hurried on  winifred he exclaimed  she held out her hands her eyebrows were upraised her mouth was quivering her eyes were seeking his with a sort of plaintive earnestness it is true then she exclaimed you are really here  i am really here he answered and it is really you nothing else seems to matter very muchand yet i would like to know why you alone of all the world should have discovered my hiding place  she laughed and seemed quite unconscious of the fact that he was still holding her hands i have been ill she said i came down here to rest last night i heard in the village that you had arrived that you were here alone i knew then she continued softly what had happened i felt that i must come if it was only for a few moments  it was very nice of you he said  then they stood side by side in a silence charged with a sort of impotent passion why had she troubled to come he wondered now that the bubble of his wealth was burstshe who had held him to her coldblooded compact who had bound him to her by as sordid a bargain as ever the mind of woman could have conceived  i am glad to see you he said and yet i dont know why you did not hesitate to leave me without word of you as soon as you saw the breakers ahead  she drew a little away looking at him as though she had only half understood when i lost the bond by which i held you she said i could scarcely expect you to continue to pay i have thought it all over since until i think that i have drunk in all the shame which a woman could feel it was a hateful miserable thing but then my life has been a hateful miserable thing ever since i was a child and i did long yes i did long she added fervently for something a little different  you disappeared then he said slowly because you imagined naturally enough that so soon as you had lost your hold upon me i should be only too glad to free myself from our engagement  of course she answered the color slowly staining her cheeks there was no doubt whatever about that only since then i have understood how great a mistake i made if things had turned out differently she continued i should never have dared to come to you to tell you this and to ask for your forgiveness but as it is she added you cannot misunderstand me any longer can you  i suppose not he admitted  i wanted to come and tell you that i was sorry she continued softly and i wanted too to remind you that you are still young and that the loss of a fortune is not the most terrible thing in the world i heard yesterday that you were out upon salthouse neck close to the quicksands you know it is never safe there with these winter tides life is not a thing to be trifled with it may seem terrible to you just now to have lost your great fortune to be once more a poor man these things after all dont count for much against the gift of life i know it sounds like humbug to hear me talk like this but they were gossiping about you in the village one man was saying that he shouldnt be at all surprised to hear that you had disappeared and to findto find she added with a little shiver your body come up the creek with the next tide you wouldnt do anything like that would you  not a ghost of a chance of it he answered cheerily besides i am not quite a pauper yet  you have lost the case havent you she asked quickly they seemed to think so in the village and i heard that mr sarsby said his niece had come into a million pounds  up till last night at any rate answered deane nothing was decided the judge reserved his decision  then why she asked wonderingly did you come down here  he drew her a little closer to him and looked into her eyes i think dear he said that it was providence which sent me                                       they walked along the sands and for them the sun shone still and the song of the lark was only the faint echo of a still more wonderful music and then as they turned back they saw along the dyke a boy riding a bicycle a boy with a leather satchel around his waist and the rim of whose bicycle was red he pressed her arm  courage dear he said this is the mercury who brings us the knowledge of our fate in a few moments you will know whether you are to become the wife of a millionaire or a working man  if you would only believe she murmured how little it matters  i do believe he answered i came down here for one reason to escape the shock of hearing the news before others now that it comes i simply do not mind there are greater things in the world than the little anna goldmine  he took the telegram from the boy and opened it with firm fingers he read it out aloud without a tremor       counsel met in judges private room by appointment today have      compromised with plaintiffs twenty thousand pounds  deane threw a coin to the boy who remounted his bicycle and rode away then turning to winifred you see he said you have brought me luck  i only pray she murmured as they turned together toward the tower that i may bring you happiness                                       deane met mrs hefferom a few months afterwards and was struck at once by her altered expression they came face to face at the corner of a street and both involuntarily stopped  i hope said deane politely that you are making good use of my money  and i hope she answered laughing that you are making more fortunes from my mine  i am doing fairly well thank you deane admitted but you know that i have a wife to keep now  and i a husband she answered i am trying to reform stephen hefferom  i hope that you are succeeding  on the whole yes she declared smiling we live at streatham and he goes in to the city every day he has bought a share in a business we are not millionaires yet but one never can tell  at any rate he remarked pleasantly to judge by your appearance i should say that you find it better than rakney  dont mention the place or any one in it she said with a shiver thank heaven i shall never have to go back to it stephen is really doing very well and half the money is still settled upon me you have no idea she continued how domesticity has agreed with him he has scarcely a vice left  it has made a lot of difference to me returned deane cant you recognize my subdued appearance  i never saw you looking so well she answered frankly now i must hurry off i am going to call for my husband and take him to lunch  and i am going to fetch my wife for the same reason deane answered smiling the best of luck to you both  they parted in the crowd swept away by the flood the endless tide of passing humanity and with a smile upon his lips deane went to his appointment   the end     other works little
