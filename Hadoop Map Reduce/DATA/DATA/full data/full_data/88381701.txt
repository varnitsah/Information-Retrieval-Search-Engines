88381701	the ancien regime by charles kingsley   preface   the rules of the royal institution forbid and wisely religious or political controversy  it was therefore impossible for me in these lectures to say much which had to be said in drawing a just and complete picture of the ancien regime in france  the passages inserted between brackets which bear on religious matters were accordingly not spoken at the royal institution  but more  it was impossible for me in these lectures to bring forward as fully as i could have wished the contrast between the continental nations and england whether now or during the eighteenth century  but that contrast cannot be too carefully studied at the present moment  in proportion as it is seen and understood will the fear of revolution if such exists die out among the wealthier classes and the wish for it if such exists among the poorer and a large extension of the suffrage will be looked on aswhat it actually isa safe and harmless concession to the wishesand as i hold to the just rightsof large portion of the british nation  there exists in britain now as far as i can see no one of those evils which brought about the french revolution  there is no widespread misery and therefore no widespread discontent among the classes who live by handlabour  the legislation of the last generation has been steadily in favour of the poor as against the rich and it is even more true now than it was in 1789 thatas arthur young told the french mob which stopped his carriagethe rich pay many taxes over and above the poorrates a direct tax on the capitalist in favour of the labourer more than are paid by the poor  in england says m de tocqueville of even the eighteenth century the poor man enjoyed the privilege of exemption from taxation in france the rich  equality before the law is as wellnigh complete as it can be where some are rich and others poor and the only privileged class it sometimes seems to me is the pauper who has neither the responsibility of selfgovernment nor the toil of selfsupport  a minority of malcontents some justly some unjustly angry with the present state of things will always exist in this world  but a majority of malcontents we shall never have as long as the workmen are allowed to keep untouched and unthreatened their rights of free speech free public meeting free combination for all purposes which do not provoke a breach of the peace  there may be and probably are to be found in london and the large towns some of those revolutionary propagandists who have terrified and tormented continental statesmen since the year 1815  but they are far fewer in number than in 1848 far fewer still i believe than in 1831 and their habits notions temper whole mental organisation is so utterly alien to that of the average englishman that it is only the sense of wrong which can make him take counsel with them or make common cause with them  meanwhile every man who is admitted to a vote is one more person withdrawn from the temptation to disloyalty and enlisted in maintaining the powers that bewhen they are in the wrong as well as when they are in the right  for every englishman is by his nature conservative slow to form an opinion cautious in putting it into effect patient under evils which seem irremediable persevering in abolishing such as seem remediable and then only too ready to acquiesce in the earliest practical result to rest and be thankful  his faults as well as his virtues make him antirevolutionary  he is generally too dull to take in a great idea and if he does take it in often too selfish to apply it to any interest save his own  but now and then when the sense of actual injury forces upon him a great idea like that of freetrade or of parliamentary reform he is indomitable however slow and patient in translating his thought into fact and they will not be wise statesmen who resist his dogged determination  if at this moment he demands an extension of the suffrage eagerly and even violently the wise statesman will give at once gracefully and generously what the englishman will certainly obtain one day if he has set his mind upon it if on the other hand he asks for it calmly then the wise statesman instead of mistaking english reticence for apathy will listen to his wishes all the more readily seeing in the moderation of the demand the best possible guarantee for moderation in the use of the thing demanded  and be it always remembered that in introducing these men into the balance of the constitution we introduce no unknown quantity statesmen ought to know them if they know themselves to judge what the working man would do by what they do themselves  he who imputes virtues to his own class imputes them also to the labouring class  he who imputes vices to the labouring class imputes them to his own class  for both are not only of the same flesh and blood but what is infinitely more important of the same spirit of the same race in innumerable cases of the same ancestors  for centuries past the most able of these men have been working upwards into the middle class and through it often to the highest dignities and the highest family connections and the whole nation knows how they have comported themselves therein  and by a reverse process of which the physiognomist and genealogist can give abundant proof the weaker members of that class which was dominant during the middle age have been sinking downward often to the rank of mere daylabourers and carrying downward with themsometimes in a very tragical and pathetic fashionsomewhat of the dignity and the refinement which they had learnt from their ancestors  thus has the english nation and as far as i can see the scotch likewise become more homogeneous than any nation of the continent if we except france since the extermination of the frankish nobility  and for that very reason as it seems to me it is more fitted than any other european nation for the exercise of equal political rights and not to be debarred of them by arguments drawn from countries which have been governedas england has not beenby a caste  the civilisation not of mere booklearning but of the heart all that was once meant by mannersgood breeding high feeling respect for self and respect for othersare just as common as far as i have seen among the handworkers of england and scotland as among any other class the only difference is that these qualities develop more early in the richer classes owing to that severe discipline of our public schools which makes mere lads often fit to govern because they have learnt to obey while they develop latergenerally not till middle agein the classes who have not gone through in their youth that spartan training and who indeed from a mistaken conception of liberty would not endure it for a day  this and other social drawbacks which are but too patent retard the manhood of the working classes  that it should be so is a wrong  for if a citizen have one right above all others to demand anything of his country it is that he should be educated that whatever capabilities he may have in him however small should have their fair and full chance of development  but the cause of the wrong is not the existence of a caste or a privileged class or of anything save the plain fact that some men will be always able to pay more for their childrens education than others and that those children will inevitably win in the struggle of life  meanwhile in this fact is to be found the most weighty if not the only argument against manhood suffrage which would admit manybut too many alaswho are still mere boys in mind  to a reasonable household suffrage it cannot apply  the man who being almost certainly married and having children can afford to rent a 5 pound tenement in a town or in the country either has seen quite enough of life and learnt quite enough of it to form a very fair judgment of the man who offers to represent him in parliament because he has learnt not merely something of his own interest or that of his class butwhat is infinitely more importantthe difference between the pretender and the honest man  the causes of this state of society which is peculiar to britain must be sought far back in the ages  it would seem that the distinction between earl and churl the noble and the nonnoble freeman was crushed out in this island by the two norman conqueststhat of the anglo saxon nobility by sweyn and canute and that of the anglodanish nobility by william and his frenchmen  those two terrible calamities following each other in the short space of fifty years seem to have welded together by a community of suffering all ranks and races at least south of the tweed and when the english rose after the storm they rose as one homogeneous people never to be governed again by an originally alien race  the english nobility were from the time of magna charta rather an official nobility than as in most continental countries a separate caste and whatever caste tendencies had developed themselves before the wars of the roses as such are certain to do during centuries of continued wealth and power were crushed out by the great revolutionary events of the next hundred years  especially did the discovery of the new world the maritime struggle with spain the outburst of commerce and colonisation during the reigns of elizabeth and james help toward this good result  it was in vain for the lord oxford of the day sneering at raleighs sudden elevation to complain that as on the virginals so in the state jacks went up and heads went down the proudest noblemen were not ashamed to have their ventures on the high seas and to send their younger sons trading or buccaneering under the conduct of lowborn men like drake who would like to see the gentleman that would not set his hand to a rope and hale and draw with the mariners  thus sprang up that respect for even fondness for severe bodily labour which the educated class of no nation save our own has ever felt and which has stood them in such good stead whether at home or abroad  thus too sprang up the system of society by which as the ballad sets forth the squires son might be a prentice good and marry     the bailiffs daughter dear    that dwelt at islington  without tarnishing as he would have done on the continent the scutcheon of his ancestors  that which has saved england from a central despotism such as crushed during the eighteenth century every nation on the continent is the very same peculiarity which makes the advent of the masses to a share in political power safe and harmless namely the absence of caste or rather for there is sure to be a moral fact underlying and causing every political fact the absence of that wicked pride which perpetuates caste forbidding those to intermarry whom nature and fact pronounce to be fit mates before god and man  these views are not mine only  they have been already set forth so much more forcibly by m de tocqueville that i should have thought it unnecessary to talk about them were not the rhetorical phrases caste privileged classes aristocratic exclusiveness and suchlike bandied about again just now as if they represented facts  if there remain in this kingdom any facts which correspond to those words let them be abolished as speedily as possible but that such do remain was not the opinion of the master of modern political philosophy m de tocqueville  he expresses his surprise that the fact which distinguishes england from all other modern nations and which alone can throw light on her peculiarities    has not attracted more attention    and that habit has rendered it as it were imperceptible to the english themselvesthat england was the only country in which the system of caste had been not only modified but effectually destroyed  the nobility and the middle classes followed the same business embraced the same professions and what is far more significant intermarried with each other  the daughter of the greatest nobleman and this if true of the eighteenth century has become far more true of the nineteenth could already without disgrace marry a man of yesterday     it has often been remarked that the english nobility has been more prudent more able and less exclusive than any other  it would have been much nearer the truth to say that in england for a very long time past no nobility properly so called have existed if we take the word in the ancient and limited sense it has everywhere else retained     for several centuries the word gentleman he might have added burgess has altogether changed its meaning in england and the word roturier has ceased to exist  in each succeeding century it is applied to persons placed somewhat lower in the social scale as the bagman of pickwick has become and has deserved to become the commercial gentleman of our day  at length it travelled with the english to america where it is used to designate every citizen indiscriminately its history is that of democracy itself     if the middle classes of england instead of making war upon the aristocracy have remained so intimately connected with it it is not especially because the aristocracy is open to all but rather because its outline was indistinct and its limit unknown not so much because any man might be admitted into it as because it was impossible to say with certainty when he took rank there so that all who approached it might look on themselves as belonging to it might take part in its rule and derive either lustre or profit from its influence  just so and therefore the middle classes of britain of whatever their special political party are conservative in the best sense of that word  for there are not three but only two classes in england namely rich and poor those who live by capital from the wealthiest landlord to the smallest village shopkeeper and those who live by handlabour  whether the division between those two classes is increasing or not is a very serious question  continued legislation in favour of the handlabourer and a beneficence towards him when in need such as no other nation on earth has ever shown have done much to abolish the moral division  but the social division has surely been increased during the last half century by the inevitable tendency both in commerce and agriculture to employ one large capital where several small ones would have been employed a century ago  the large manufactory the large shop the large estate the large farm swallows up the small ones  the yeoman the thrifty squatter who could work at two or three trades as well as till his patch of moor the handloom weaver the skilled village craftsman have all but disappeared  the handworker finding it more and more difficult to invest his savings has been more and more tempted to squander them  to rise to the dignity of a capitalist however small was growing impossible to him till the rise of that cooperative movement which will do more than any social or political impulse in our day for the safety of english society and the loyalty of the english working classes  and meanwhileere that movement shall have spread throughout the length and breadth of the land and have been applied as it surely will be some day not only to distribution not only to manufacture but to agriculture likewisetill then the best judges of the working mens worth must be their employers and especially the employers of the northern manufacturing population  what their judgment is is sufficiently notorious  those who depend most on the working men who have the best opportunities of knowing them trust them most thoroughly  as long as great manufacturers stand forward as the political sponsors of their own workmen it behoves those who cannot have had their experience to consider their opinion as conclusive  as for that influence of the higher classes which is said to be endangered just now it will exist just as much as it deserves to exist  any man who is superior to the many whether in talents education refinement wealth or anything else will always be able to influence a number of menand if he thinks it worth his while of votesby just and lawful means  and as for unjust and unlawful means let those who prefer them keep up heart  the world will go on much as it did before and be always quite bad enough to allow bribery and corruption jobbery and nepotism quackery and arrogance their full influence over our home and foreign policy  an extension of the suffrage however wide will not bring about the millennium  it will merely make a large number of englishmen contented and loyal instead of discontented and disloyal  it may make too the educated and wealthy classes wiser by awakening a wholesome fearperhaps it may be by awakening a chivalrous emulation  it may put the younger men of the present aristocracy upon their mettle and stir them up to prove that they are not in the same effete condition as was the french noblesse in 1789  it may lead them to take the warnings which have been addressed to them for the last thirty years by their truest friendsoften by kinsmen of their own  it may lead them to ask themselves why in a world which is governed by a just god such great power as is palpably theirs at present is entrusted to them save that they may do more work and not less than other men under the penalties pronounced against those to whom much is given and of whom much is required  it may lead them to discover that they are in a world where it is not safe to sit under the tree and let the ripe fruit drop into your mouth where the competition of species works with ruthless energy among all ranks of being from kings upon their thrones to the weeds upon the waste where he that is not hammer is sure to be anvil and he who will not work neither shall he eat  it may lead them to devote that energy in which they surpass so far the continental aristocracies to something better than outdoor amusements or indoor dilettantisms  there are those among them who like one section of the old french noblesse content themselves with mere complaints of the revolutionary tendencies of the age  let them beware in time for when the many are on the march the few who stand still are certain to be walked over  there are those among them who like another section of the french noblesse are ready more generously than wisely to throw away their own social and political advantages and play for it will never be really more than playing at democracy  let them too beware  the penknife and the axe should respect each other for they were wrought from the same steel but the penknife will not be wise in trying to fell trees  let them accept their own position not in conceit and arrogance but in fear and trembling and see if they cannot play the man therein and save their own class and with it much which it has needed many centuries to accumulate and to organise and without which no nation has yet existed for a single century  they are no more like the old french noblesse than are the commercial class like the old french bourgeoisie or the labouring like the old french peasantry  let them prove that fact by their deeds during the next generation or sink into the condition of mere rich men exciting by their luxury and laziness nothing but envy and contempt  meanwhile behind all classes and social forcesi had almost said above them allstands a fourth estate which will ultimately decide the form which english society is to take a press as different from the literary class of the ancien regime as is everything else english and different in thisthat it is free  the french revolution like every revolution it seems to me which has convulsed the nations of europe for the last eighty years was caused immediatelywhatever may have been its more remote causesby the suppression of thought or at least by a sense of wrong among those who thought  a country where every man be he fool or wise is free to speak that which is in him can never suffer a revolution  the folly blows itself off like steam in harmless noise the wisdom becomes part of the general intellectual stock of the nation and prepares men for gradual and therefore for harmless change  as long as the press is free a nation is guaranteed against sudden and capricious folly either from above or from below  as long as the press is free a nation is guaranteed against the worse evil of persistent and obstinate folly cloaking itself under the venerable shapes of tradition and authority  for under a free press a nation must ultimately be guided not by a caste not by a class not by mere wealth not by the passions of a mob but by mind by the net result of all the commonsense of its members and in the present default of genius which is uncommon sense commonsense seems to be the only if not the best safeguard for poor humanity  1867     lecture icaste   delivered at the royal institution london 1867  these lectures are meant to be comments on the state of france before the french revolution  to english society past or present i do not refer for reasons which i have set forth at length in an introductory discourse there never was any ancien regime in england  therefore when the stuarts tried to establish in england a system which might have led to a political condition like that of the continent all classes combined and exterminated them while the course of english society went on as before  on the contrary england was the mother of every movement which undermined and at last destroyed the ancien regime  from england went forth those political theories which transmitted from america to france became the principles of the french revolution  from england went forth the philosophy of locke with all its immense results it is noteworthy that when voltaire tries to persuade people in a certain famous passage that philosophers do not care to trouble the worldof the ten names to whom he does honour seven names are english it is he says neither montaigne nor locke nor boyle nor spinoza nor hobbes nor lord shaftesbury nor mr collins nor mr toland nor fludd nor baker who have carried the torch of discord into their countries  it is worth notice that not only are the majority of these names english but that they belong not to the latter but to the former half of the eighteenth century and indeed to the latter half of the seventeenth  so it was with that inductive physical science which helped more than all to break up the superstitions of the ancien regime and to set man face to face with the facts of the universe  from england towards the end of the seventeenth century it was promulgated by such men as newton boyle sydenham ray and the first founders of our royal society  in england too arose the great religious movements of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuriesand especially that of a body which i can never mention without most deep respectthe society of friends  at a time when the greater part of the continent was sunk in spiritual sleep these men were reasserting doctrines concerning man and his relation to his creator which whether or not all believe them as i believe them to be founded on eternal fact all must confess to have been of incalculable benefit to the cause of humanity and civilisation  from england finally about the middle of the eighteenth century went forthpromulgated by english noblementhat freemasonry which seems to have been the true parent of all the secret societies of europe  of this curious question more hereafter  but enough has been said to show that england instead of falling at any period into the stagnation of the ancien regime was from the middle of the seventeenth century in a state of intellectual growth and ferment which communicated itself finally to the continental nations  this is the special honour of england universally confessed at the time  it was to england that the slowlyawakening nations looked as the source of all which was noble true and free in the dawning future  it will be seen from what i have said that i consider the ancien regime to begin in the seventeenth century  i should date its commencementas far as that of anything so vague unsystematic indeed anarchic can be definedfrom the end of the thirty years war and the peace of westphalia in 1648  for by that time the mighty spiritual struggles and fierce religious animosities of the preceding century had worn themselves out  and as always happens to a period of earnest excitement had succeeded one of weariness disgust halfunbelief in the many questions for which so much blood had been shed  no man had come out of the battle with altogether clean hands some not without changing sides more than once  the war had ended as one not of nations not even of zealots but of mercenaries the body of europe had been pulled in pieces between them all and the poor soul thereofas was to be expectedhad fled out through the gaping wounds  life mere existence was the most pressing need  if men couldin the old prophets wordsfind the life of their hand they were content  high and low only asked to be let live  the poor asked itslaughtered on a hundred battlefields burnt out of house and home vast tracts of the centre of europe were lying desert the population was diminished for several generations  the trading classes ruined by the long war only asked to be let live and make a little money  the nobility too only asked to be let live  they had lost in the long struggle not only often lands and power but their ablest and bravest men and a weaker and meaner generation was left behind to do the governing of the world  let them live and keep what they had  if signs of vigour still appeared in france in the wars of louis xiv they were feverish factitious temporarysoon as the event proved to droop into the general exhaustion  if wars were still to be waged they were to be wars of succession wars of diplomacy not wars of principle waged for the mightiest invisible interests of man  the exhaustion was general and to it we must attribute alike the changes and the conservatism of the ancien regime  to it is owing that growth of a centralising despotism and of arbitrary regal power which m de tocqueville has set forth in a book which i shall have occasion often to quote  to it is owing too that longing which seems to us childish after ancient forms etiquettes dignities court costumes formalities diplomatic legal ecclesiastical  men clung to them as to keepsakes of the pastrevered relics of more intelligible and betterordered times  if the spirit had been beaten out of them in a century of battle that was all the more reason for keeping up the letter  they had had a meaning once a life once perhaps there was a little life left in them still perhaps the dry bones would clothe themselves with flesh once more and stand upon their feet  at least it was useful that the common people should so believe there was good hope that the simple masses seeing the old dignities and formalities still parading the streets should suppose that they still contained men and were not mere wooden figures dressed artistically in official costume  and on the whole that hope was not deceived  more than a century of bitter experience was needed ere the masses discovered that their ancient rulers were like the suits of armour in the tower of londonempty iron astride of wooden steeds and armed with lances which every ploughboy could wrest out of their hands and use in his own behalf  the mistake of the masses was pardonable  for those suits of armour had once held living men strong brave wise men of an admirable temper doing their work according to their light not altogether wellwhat man does that on earthbut well enough to make themselves necessary to and loyally followed by the masses whom they ruled  no one can read fairly the gesta dei per francos in oriente or the deeds of the french nobility in their wars with england or those taleshowever legendaryof the mediaeval knights which form so noble an element in german literature without seeing that however black were these mens occasional crimes they were a truly noble race the old nobility of the continent a race which ruled simply because without them there would have been naught but anarchy and barbarism  to their chivalrous ideal they were too often perhaps for the most part untrue but partial and defective as it is it is an ideal such as never entered into the mind of celt or gaul hun or sclav one which seems continuous with the spread of the teutonic conquerors  they ruled because they did practically raise the ideal of humanity in the countries which they conquered a whole stage higher  they ceased to rule when they were through their own sins caught up and surpassed in the race of progress by the classes below them  but even when at its best their system of government had in itlike all human inventionoriginal sin an unnatural and unrighteous element which was certain sooner or later to produce decay and ruin  the old nobility of europe was not a mere aristocracy  it was a caste a race not intermarrying with the races below it  it was not a mere aristocracy  for that for the supremacy of the best men all societies strive or profess to strive  and such a true aristocracy may exist independent of caste or the hereditary principle at all  we may conceive an utopia governed by an aristocracy which should be really democratic which should use under developed forms that method which made the mediaeval priesthood the one great democratic institution of old christendom bringing to the surface and utilising the talents and virtues of all classes even to the lowest  we may conceive an aristocracy choosing out and gladly receiving into its own ranks as equals every youth every maiden who was distinguished by intellect virtue valour beauty without respect to rank or birth and rejecting in turn from its own ranks each of its own children who fell below some lofty standard and showed by weakliness dulness or baseness incapacity for the post of guiding and elevating their fellowcitizens thus would arise a true aristocracy a governing body of the really most worthythe most highly organised in body and in mindperpetually recruited from below from which or from any other ideal we are yet a few thousand years distant  but the old ancien regime would have shuddered did shudder at such a notion  the supreme class was to keep itself pure and avoid all taint of darker blood shutting its eyes to the fact that some of its most famous heroes had been born of such lefthanded marriages as that of robert of normandy with the tanners daughter of falaise  some are so curious in this behalf says quaint old burton writing about 1650 as these old romans our modern venetians dutch and french that if two parties dearly love the one noble the other ignoble they may not by their laws match though equal otherwise in years fortunes education and all good affection  in germany except they can prove their gentility by three descents they scorn to match with them  a nobleman must marry a noblewoman a baron a barons daughter a knight a knights  as slaters sort their slates do they degrees and families  and doubtless this theorylike all which have held their ground for many centuriesat first represented a fact  these castes were at first actually superior to the peoples over whom they ruled  i cannot as long as my eyes are open yield to the modern theory of the equalityindeed of the nonexistenceof races  holding as i do the primaeval unity of the human race i see in that race the same inclination to sport into fresh varieties the same competition of species between those varieties which mr darwin has pointed out among plants and mere animals  a distinguished man arises from him a distinguished family from it a distinguished tribe stronger cunninger than those around  it asserts its supremacy over its neighbours at first exactly as a plant or animal would do by destroying and where possible eating them next having grown more prudent by enslaving them next having gained a little morality in addition to its prudence by civilising them raising them more or less toward its own standard  and thus in every land civilisation and national life has arisen out of the patriarchal state and the eastern scheik with his wives free and slave and his hundreds of fighting men born in his house is the type of all primaeval rulers he is the best man of his hordein every sense of the word best and whether he have a right to rule them or not they consider that he has and are the better men for his guidance  whether this ought to have been the history of primaeval civilisation is a question not to be determined here  that it is the history thereof is surely patent to anyone who will imagine to himself what must have been in the first place the strongest and cunningest savage must have had the chance of producing children more strong and cunning than the average he would havethe strongest savage has stillthe power of obtaining a wife or wives superior in beauty and in household skill which involves superiority of intellect and therefore his children wouldsome of them at leastbe superior to the average both from the fathers and the mothers capacities  they again would marry select wives and their children again would do the same till in a very few generations a family would have established itself considerably superior to the rest of the tribe in body and mind and become assuredly its ruling race  again if one of that race invented a new weapon a new mode of tillage or aught else which gave him power that would add to the superiority of his whole family  for the invention would be jealously kept among them as a mystery a hereditary secret  to this simple cause surely is to be referred the system of hereditary caste occupations whether in egypt or hindoostan  to this too the fact that alike in greek and in teutonic legend the chief so often appears not merely as the best warrior and best minstrel but as the best smith armourer and handicraftsman of his tribe  if however the inventor happened to be a lowborn genius its advantages would still accrue to the ruling race for nothing could be more natural or more easyas more than one legend intimatesthan that the king should extort the new secret from his subject and then put him to death to prevent any further publicity  two great inventive geniuses we may see dimly through the abysses of the past both of whom must have become in their time great chiefs founders of mighty aristocraciesit may be worshipped after their death as gods  the first who seems to have existed after the age in which the black race colonised australia must have been surely a man worthy to hold rank with our brindleys watts and stephensons  for he invented and mind one man must have invented the thing first and by the very nature of it invented it all at once an instrument so singular unexpected unlike anything to be seen in nature that i wonder it has not been called like the plough the olive or the vine a gift of the immortal gods and yet an instrument so simple so easy and so perfect that it spread over all races in europe and america and no substitute could be found for it till the latter part of the fifteenth century  yes a great genius was he and the consequent founder of a great aristocracy and conquering race who first invented for himself and his children after him abow and arrow  the nextwhether before or after the first in time it suits me to speak of him in second placewas the man who was the potential ancestor of the whole ritterschaft chivalry and knightly caste of europe the man who first finding a foal upon the steppe deserted by its dam brought it home and reared it and then bethought him of the happy notion of making it drawpresumably by its taila fashion which endured long in ireland and had to be forbidden by law i think as late as the sixteenth century a great aristocrat must that man have become  a greater still he who first substituted the bit for the halter  a greater still he who first thought of wheels  a greater still he who conceived the yoke and pole for bearing up his chariot for that same yoke and pole and chariot became the peculiar instrument of conquerors like him who mightily oppressed the children of israel for he had nine hundred chariots of iron  egyptians syrians assyrians greeks romansnone of them improved on the form of the conquering biga till it was given up by a race who preferred a pair of shafts to their carts and who had learnt to ride instead of drive  a great aristocrat again must he have been among those latter races who first conceived the notion of getting on his horses back accommodating his motions to the beasts and becoming a centaur halfman halfhorse  that invention must have tended in the first instance as surely toward democracy as did the invention of firearms  a tribe of riders must have been always more or less equal and free  equal because a man on a horse would feel himself a man indeed because the art of riding called out an independence a selfhelp a skill a consciousness of power a personal pride and vanity which would defy slavery  free because a tribe of riders might be defeated exterminated but never enchained  they could never become gleboe adscripti bound to the soil as long as they could take horse and saddle and away  history gives us more than one glimpse of such tribesthe scourge and terror of the nonriding races with whom they came in contact  some doubtless remember how in the wars between alfred and the danes the army the scandinavian invaders again and again horse themselves steal away by night from the saxon infantry and ride over the land whether in england or in france doing unspeakable evil  to that special instinct of horsemanship which still distinguishes their descendants we may attribute mainly the scandinavian settlement of the north and east of england  some too may recollect the sketch of the primeval hun as he first appeared to the astonished and disgusted old roman soldier ammianus marcellinus the visages more like cakes than faces the figures like those which are hewn out with an axe on the poles at bridgeends the ratskin coats which they wore till they rotted off their limbs their steaks of meat cooked between the saddle and the thigh the little horses on which they eat and drink buy and sell and sleep lying forward along his narrow neck and indulging in every variety of dream  and over and above and more important politically the common councils held on horseback under the authority of no king but content with the irregular government of nobles under whose leading they force their way through all obstacles  a racelike those cossacks who are probably their lineal descendantsto be feared to be hired to be petted but not to be conquered  instances nearer home of free equestrian races we have in our own english borderers among whom as mr froude says the farmers and their farm servants had but to snatch their arms and spring into their saddles and they became at once the northern horse famed as the finest light cavalry in the world  and equal to themsuperior even if we recollect that they preserved their countrys freedom for centuries against the superior force of englandwere those troops of scots who century after century swept across the border on their little garrons their bag of oatmeal hanging by the saddle with the iron griddle whereon to bake it careless of weather and of danger men too swift to be exterminated too independent to be enslaved  but if horsemanship had in these cases a levelling tendency it would have the very opposite when a riding tribe conquered a nonriding one the conquerors would as much as possible keep the art and mystery of horsemanship hereditary among themselves and become a ritterschaft or chivalrous caste  and they would be able to do so because the conquered race would not care or dare to learn the new and dangerous art  there are persons even in england who can never learn to ride  there are whole populations in europe even now when races have become almost indistinguishably mixed who seem unable to learn  and this must have been still more the case when the races were more strongly separated in blood and habits  so the teutonic chief with his gesitha comites or select band of knights who had received from him as tacitus has it the warhorse and the lance established himself as the natural rulerand oppressorof the nonriding populations first over the aborigines of germany proper tribes who seem to have been enslaved and their names lost before the time of tacitus and then over the nonriding romans and gauls to the south and west and the wendish and sclavonic tribes to the east  very few in numbers but mighty in their unequalled capacity of body and mind and in their terrible horsemanship the teutonic ritterschaft literally rode roughshod over the old world never checked but when they came in contact with the freeriding hordes of the eastern steppes and so established an equestrian caste of which the greek text of athens and the equites of rome had been only hints ending in failure and absorption  of that equestrian caste the symbol was the horse  the favourite and therefore the chosen sacrifice of odin their ancestor and god the horses flesh was eaten at the sacrificial meal the horses head hung on the ash in odins wood gave forth oracular responses  as christianity came in and the eating of horseflesh was forbidden as impiety by the church while his oracles dwindled down to such as that which faladas dead head gives to the goosegirl in the german tale the magic power of the horse figured only in ballads and legends but his real power remained  the art of riding became an hereditary and exclusive scienceat last a pedantry hampered by absurd etiquettes and worse than useless traditions but the power and right to ride remained on the whole the mark of the dominant caste  terribly did they often abuse that special power  the faculty of making a horse carry him no more makes a man a good man than the faculties of making money making speeches making books or making a noise about public abuses  and of all ruffians the worst if history is to be trusted is the ruffian on a horse to whose brutality of mind is superadded the brute power of his beast  a ruffian on a horsewhat is there that he will not ride over and ride on careless and proud of his own shame  when the ancient chivalry of france descended to that level or rather delegated their functions to mercenaries of that levelwhen the knightly hosts who fought before jerusalem allowed themselves to be superseded by the dragoons and dragonnades of louis xivthen the end of the french chivalry was at hand and came  but centuries before that shameful fall there had come in with christianity the new thought that domination meant responsibility that responsibility demanded virtue  the words which denoted rank came to denote likewise high moral excellencies  the nobilis or man who was known and therefore subject to public opinion was bound to behave nobly  the gentlemangentilemanwho respected his own gens or family and pedigree was bound to be gentle  the courtier who had picked up at court some touch of roman civilisation from roman ecclesiastics was bound to be courteous  he who held an honour or edel of land was bound to be honourable and he who held a weorthig or worthy thereof was bound himself to be worthy  in like wise he who had the right to ride a horse was expected to be chivalrous in all matters befitting the hereditary ruler who owed a sacred debt to a long line of forefathers as well as to the state in which he dwelt all dignity courtesy purity selfrestraint devotionsuch as they were understood in those rough dayscentred themselves round the idea of the rider as the attributes of the man whose supposed duty as well as his supposed right was to govern his fellowmen by example as well as by law and forceattributes which gathered themselves up into that one wordchivalry an idea which perfect or imperfect god forbid that mankind should ever forget till it has become the possessionas it is the godgiven rightof the poorest slave that ever trudged on foot and every collierlad shall have becomeas some of those barnsley men proved but the other day they had become already     a very gentle perfect knight  very unfaithful was chivalry to its idealas all men are to all ideals but bear in mind that if the horse was the symbol of the ruling caste it was not at first its only strength  unless that caste had had at first spiritual as well as physical force on its side it would have been soon destroyednay it would have destroyed itselfby internecine civil war  and we must believe that those franks goths lombards and burgunds who in the early middle age leaped on the backs to use mr carlyles expression of the roman nations were actually in all senses of the word better men than those whom they conquered  we must believe it from reason for if not how could they numerically few have held for a year much more for centuries against millions their dangerous elevation  we must believe it unless we take tacituss germania which i absolutely refuse to do for a romance  we must believe that they were better than the romanised nations whom they conquered because the writers of those nations augustine salvian and sidonius apollinaris for example say that they were such and give proof thereof  not good men according to our higher standardfar from it though sidoniuss picture of theodoric the east goth in his palace of narbonne is the picture of an eminently good and wise ruler  but not good i say as a rulethe franks alas often very bad men but still better wiser abler than those whom they ruled  we must believe too that they were better in every sense of the word than those tribes on their eastern frontier whom they conquered in after centuries unless we discredit which we have no reason to do the accounts which the roman and greek writers give of the horrible savagery of those tribes  so it was in later centuries  one cannot read fairly the history of the middle ages without seeing that the robber knight of germany or of france who figures so much in modern novels must have been the exception and not the rule that an aristocracy which lived by the saddle would have as little chance of perpetuating itself as a priesthood composed of hypocrites and profligates that the mediaeval nobility has been as much slandered as the mediaeval church and the exceptions takenas more salient and excitingfor the average that side by side with ruffians like gaston de foix hundreds of honest gentlemen were trying to do their duty to the best of their light and were raising and not depressing the masses below themone very important item in that duty being the doing the whole fighting of the country at their own expense instead of leaving it to a standing army of mercenaries at the beck and call of a despot and that as m de tocqueville says in feudal times the nobility were regarded pretty much as the government is regarded in our own the burdens they imposed were endured in consequence of the security they afforded  the nobles had many irksome privileges they possessed many onerous rights but they maintained public order they administered justice they caused the law to be executed they came to the relief of the weak they conducted the business of the community  in proportion as they ceased to do these things the burden of their privileges appeared more oppressive and their existence became an anomaly in proportion as they ceased to do these things  and the ancien regime may be defined as the period in which they ceased to do these thingsin which they began to play the idlers and expected to take their old wages without doing their old work  but in any case government by a ruling caste whether of the patriarchal or of the feudal kind is no ideal or permanent state of society  so far from it it is but the first or second step out of primeval savagery  for the more a ruling race becomes conscious of its own duty and not merely of its own powerthe more it learns to regard its peculiar gifts as entrusted to it for the good of menso much the more earnestly will it labour to raise the masses below to its own level by imparting to them its own light and so will it continually tend to abolish itself by producing a general equality moral and intellectual and fulfil that law of selfsacrifice which is the beginning and the end of all virtue  a race of noblest men and women trying to make all below them as noble as themselvesthat is at least a fair ideal tending toward though it has not reached the highest ideal of all  but suppose that the very opposite tendencyinherent in the heart of every child of manshould conquer  suppose the ruling caste no longer the physical intellectual and moral superiors of the mass but their equals  suppose themshameful but not without exampleactually sunk to be their inferiors  and that such a fall did comenay that it must have comeis matter of history  and its cause like all social causes was not a political nor a physical but a moral cause  the profligacy of the french and italian aristocracies in the sixteenth century avenged itself on them by a curse derived from the newlydiscovered america from which they never recovered  the spanish aristocracy suffered i doubt not very severely  the english and german owing to the superior homeliness and purity of ruling their lives hardly at all  but the continental caste instead of recruiting their tainted blood by healthy blood from below did all under pretence of keeping it pure to keep it tainted by continual intermarriage and paid in increasing weakness of body and mind the penalty of their exclusive pride  it is impossible for anyone who reads the french memoirs of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries not to perceive if he be wise that the aristocracy therein depicted was ripe for ruinyea already ruinedunder any form of government whatsoever independent of all political changes  indeed many of the political changes were not the causes but the effects of the demoralisation of the noblesse  historians will tell you how as early as the beginning of the seventeenth century henry iv complained that the nobles were quitting their country districts how succeeding kings and statesmen notably richelieu and louis xiv tempted the noblesse up to paris that they might become mere courtiers instead of powerful country gentlemen how those who remained behind were only the poor hobereaux little hobbyhawks among the gentry who considered it degradation to help in governing the parish as their forefathers had governed it and lived shabbily in their chateaux grinding the last farthing out of their tenants that they might spend it in town during the winter  no wonder that with such an aristocracy who had renounced that very duty of governing the country for which alone they and their forefathers had existed there arose government by intendants and sub delegates and all the other evils of administrative centralisation which m de tocqueville anatomises and deplores  but what was the cause of the curse  their moral degradation  what drew them up to paris save vanity and profligacy  what kept them from intermarrying with the middle class save pride  what made them give up the office of governors save idleness  and if vanity profligacy pride and idleness be not injustices and moral vices what are  the race of heroic knights and nobles who fought under the walls of jerusalemwho wrestled and not in vain for centuries with the equally heroic english in defence of their native soilwho had set to all europe the example of all knightly virtues had rotted down to this their only virtue left as mr carlyle says beinga perfect readiness to fight duels  every intendant chosen by the comptrollergeneral out of the lowerborn members of the council of state a needy young plebeian with his fortune to make and a stranger to the province was in spite of his greed ambition chicane arbitrary tyranny a better manabler more energetic and often to judge from the pages of de tocqueville with far more sympathy and mercy for the wretched peasantrythan was the count or marquis in the chateau above who looked down on him as a roturier and let him nevertheless become first his deputy and then his master  understand mei am not speaking against the hereditary principle of the ancien regime but against its caste principletwo widely different elements continually confounded nowadays  the hereditary principle is good because it is founded on fact and nature  if mens minds come into the world blank sheets of paperwhich i much doubtevery other part and faculty of them comes in stamped with hereditary tendencies and peculiarities  there are such things as transmitted capabilities for good and for evil and as surely as the offspring of a good horse or dog is likely to be good so is the offspring of a good man and still more of a good woman  if the parents have any special ability their children will probably inherit it at least in part and over and above will have it developed in them by an education worthy of their parents and themselves  if man werewhat he is nota healthy and normal species a permanent hereditary caste might go on intermarrying and so perpetuate itself  but the same moral reason which would make such a caste dangerousindeed fatal to the liberty and development of mankind makes it happily impossible  crimes and follies are certain after a few generations to weaken the powers of any human caste and unless it supplements its own weakness by mingling again with the common stock of humanity it must sink under that weakness as the ancient noblesse sank by its own vice  of course there were exceptions the french revolution brought those exceptions out into strong light and like every day of judgment divided between the good and the evil  but it lies not in exceptions to save a caste or an institution and a few richelieus liancourts rochefoucaulds noailles lafayettes were but the storks among the cranes involved in the wholesale doom due not to each individual but to a system and a class  profligacy pride idlenessthese are the vices which we have to lay to the charge of the teutonic nobility of the ancien regime in france especially and though in a less degree perhaps over the whole continent of europe  but below them and perhaps the cause of them all lay another and deeper vicegodlessnessatheism  i do not mean merely want of religion doctrinal unbelief  i mean want of belief in duty in responsibility  want of belief that there was a living god governing the universe who had set them their work and would judge them according to their work  and therefore want of belief yea utter unconsciousness that they were set in their places to make the masses below them better men to impart to them their own civilisation to raise them to their own level  they would have shrunk from that which i just now defined as the true duty of an aristocracy just because it would have seemed to them madness to abolish themselves  but the process of abolition went on nevertheless only now from without instead of from within  so it must always be in such a case  if a ruling class will not try to raise the masses to their own level the masses will try to drag them down to theirs  that sense of justice which allowed privileges when they were as strictly official privileges as the salary of a judge or the immunity of a member of the house of commons when they were earned as in the middle age by severe education earnest labour and life and death responsibility in peace and war will demand the abolition of those privileges when no work is done in return for them with a voice which must be heard for it is the voice of truth and justice  but with that righteous voice will mingle another most wicked and yet alas most flattering to poor humanitythe voice of envy simple and undisguised of envy which moralists hold to be one of the basest of human passions which can never be justified however hateful or unworthy be the envied man  and when a whole people or even a majority thereof shall be possessed by that what is there that they will not do  some are surprised and puzzled when they find in the french revolution of 1793 the noblest and the foulest characters labouring in concert and side by sideoften too paradoxical as it may seem united in the same personage  the explanation is simple  justice inspired the one the other was the child of simple envy  but this passion of envy if it becomes permanent and popular may avenge itself like all other sins  a nation may say to itself provided we have no superiors to fall our pride we are content  liberty is a slight matter provided we have equality  let us be slaves provided we are all slaves alike  it may destroy every standard of humanity above its own mean average it may forget that the old ruling class in spite of all its defects and crimes did at least pretend to represent something higher than mans necessary wants plus the greed of amassing money never meeting at least in the country districts any one wiser or more refined than an official or a priest drawn from the peasant class it may lose the belief that any standard higher than that is needed and all but forgetting the very existence of civilisation sink contented into a dead level of intellectual mediocrity and moral barbarism crying let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  a nation in such a temper will surely be taken at its word  where the carcase is there the eagles will be gathered together and there will not be wanting to such nationsas there were not wanting in old greece and romedespots who will give them all they want and more and say to them yes you shall eat and drink and yet you shall not die  for i while i take care of your mortal bodies will see that care is taken of your immortal souls  for there are those who have discovered with the kings of the holy alliance that infidelity and scepticism are political mistakes not so much because they promote vice as because they promote or are supposed to promote free thought who see that religion no matter of what quality is a most valuable assistant to the duties of a minister of police  they will quote in their own behalf montesquieus opinion that religion is a column necessary to sustain the social edifice they will quote too that sound and true saying of de tocquevilles 1 if the first american who might be met either in his own country or abroad were to be stopped and asked whether he considered religion useful to the stability of the laws and the good order of society he would answer without hesitation that no civilised society but more especially none in a state of freedom can exist without religion  respect for religion is in his eyes the greatest guarantee of the stability of the state and of the safety of the community  those who are ignorant of the science of government know that fact at least  m de tocqueville when he wrote these words was lamenting that in france freedom was forsaken a thing for which it is said that no one any longer cares in france  he did not it seems to me perceive that as in america the best guarantee of freedom is the reverence for a religion or religions which are free themselves and which teach men to be free so in other countries the best guarantee of slavery is reverence for religions which are not free and which teach men to be slaves  but what m de tocqueville did not see there are others who will see who will say if religion be the pillar of political and social order there is an order which is best supported by a religion which is adverse to free thought free speech free conscience free communion between man and god  the more enervating the superstition the more exacting and tyrannous its priesthood the more it will do our work if we help it to do its own  if it permit us to enslave the body we will permit it to enslave the soul  and so may be inaugurated a period of that organised anarchy of which the poet says     it is not life but death when nothing stirs     lecture iicentralisation   the degradation of the european nobility caused of course the increase of the kingly power and opened the way to central despotisms  the bourgeoisie the commercial middle class whatever were its virtues its value its real courage were never able to stand alone against the kings  their capital being invested in trade was necessarily subject to such sudden dangers from war political change bad seasons and so forth that its holders however individually brave were timid as a class  they could never hold out on strike against the governments and had to submit to the powers that were whatever they were under penalty of ruin  but on the continent and especially in france and germany unable to strengthen itself by intermarriage with the noblesse they retained that timidity which is the fruit of the insecurity of trade and had to submit to a more and more centralised despotism and grow up as they could in the face of exasperating hindrances to wealth to education to the possession in many parts of france of large landed estates leaving the noblesse to decay in isolated uselessness and weakness and in many cases debt and poverty  the systemor rather anarchyaccording to which france was governed during this transitional period may be read in that work of m de tocquevilles which i have already quoted and which is accessible to all classes through mr h reeves excellent translation  every student of history is of course well acquainted with that book  but as there is reason to fear from language which is becoming once more too common both in speech and writing that the general public either do not know it or have not understood it i shall take the liberty of quoting from it somewhat largely  i am justified in so doing by the fact that m de tocquevilles book is founded on researches into the french archives which have been made as far as i am aware only by him and contains innumerable significant facts which are to be found as far as i am aware in no other accessible work  the french peoplesays m de tocquevillemade in 1789 the greatest effort which was ever made by any nation to cut so to speak their destiny in halves and to separate by an abyss that which they had heretofore been from that which they sought to become hereafter  but he had long thought that they had succeeded in this singular attempt much less than was supposed abroad and less than they had at first supposed themselves  he was convinced that they had unconsciously retained from the former state of society most of the sentiments the habits and even the opinions by means of which they had effected the destruction of that state of things and that without intending it they had used its remains to rebuild the edifice of modern society  this is his thesis and this he proves it seems to me incontestably by documentary evidence  not only does he find habits which we supposeor supposed till latelyto have died with the eighteenth century still living and working at least in france in the nineteenth but the new opinions which we look on usually as the special children of the nineteenth century he shows to have been born in the eighteenth  france he considers is still at heart what the ancien regime made her  he shows that the hatred of the ruling caste the intense determination to gain and keep equality even at the expense of liberty had been long growing up under those influences of which i spoke in my first lecture  he shows moreover that the acquiescence in a centralised administration the expectation that the government should do everything for the people and nothing for themselves the consequent loss of local liberties local peculiarities the helplessness of the towns and the parishes and all which issued in making paris france and subjecting the whole of a vast country to the arbitrary dictates of a knot of despots in the capital was not the fruit of the revolution but of the ancien regime which preceded it and that robespierre and his comite de salut public and commissioners sent forth to the four winds of heaven in bonnet rouge and carmagnole complete to build up and pull down according to their wicked will were only handling somewhat more roughly the same wires which had been handled for several generations by the comptrollergeneral and council of state with their provincial intendants  do you know said law to the marquis dargenson that this kingdom of france is governed by thirty intendants  you have neither parliament nor estates nor governors  it is upon thirty masters of request despatched into the provinces that their evil or their good their fertility or their sterility entirely depend  to do everything for the people and let them do nothing for themselvesthis was the ancien regime  to be more wise and more loving than almighty god who certainly does not do everything for the sons of men but forces them to labour for themselves by bitter need and after a most spartan mode of education who allows them to burn their hands as often as they are foolish enough to put them into the fire and to be filled with the fruits of their own folly even though the folly be one of necessary ignorance treating them with that seeming neglect which is after all the most provident care because by it alone can men be trained to experience selfhelp science true humanity and so become not tolerably harmless dolls but men and women worthy of the name with     the reason firm the temperate will    endurance foresight strength and skill    the perfect spirit nobly planned    to cheer to counsel and command  such seems to be the education and government appointed for man by the voluntatem dei in rebus revelatum and the education therefore which the man of science will accept and carry out  but the men of the ancien regimein as far as it was a regime at alltried to be wiser than the almighty  why not  they were not the first nor will be the last by many who have made the same attempt  so this council of state settled arbitrarily not only taxes and militia and roads but anything and everything  its members meddled with their whole hearts and minds  they tried to teach agriculture by schools and pamphlets and prizes they sent out plans for every public work  a town could not establish an octroi levy a rate mortgage sell sue farm or administer their property without an order in council  the government ordered public rejoicings saw to the firing of salutes and illuminating of housesin one case mentioned by m de tocqueville they fined a member of the burgher guard for absenting himself from a te deum  all selfgovernment was gone  a country parish was says turgot nothing but an assemblage of cabins and of inhabitants as passive as the cabins they dwelt in  without an order of council the parish could not mend the steeple after a storm or repair the parsonage gable  if they grumbled at the intendant he threw some of the chief persons into prison and made the parish pay the expenses of the horse patrol which formed the arbitrary police of france  everywhere was meddling  there were reports on statisticscircumstantial inaccurate and uselessas statistics are too often wont to be  sometimes when the people were starving the government sent down charitable donations to certain parishes on condition that the inhabitants should raise a sum on their part  when the sum offered was sufficient the comptrollergeneral wrote on the margin when he returned the report to the intendant goodexpress satisfaction  if it was more than sufficient he wrote goodexpress satisfaction and sensibility  there is nothing new under the sun  in 1761 the government jealous enough of newspapers determined to start one for itself and for that purpose took under its tutelage the gazette de france  so the public newsmongers were of course to be the provincial intendants and their subnewsmongers of course the subdelegates  but alas the poor subdelegates seem to have found either very little news or very little which it was politic to publish  one reports that a smuggler of salt has been hung and has displayed great courage another that a woman in his district has had three girls at a birth another that a dreadful storm has happened buthas done no mischief a fourthliving in some specially favoured utopiadeclares that in spite of all his efforts he has found nothing worth recording but that he himself will subscribe to so useful a journal and will exhort all respectable persons to follow his example in spite of which loyal endeavours the journal seems to have proved a failure to the great disgust of the king and his minister who had of course expected to secure fine weather by nailing like the schoolboy before a holiday the hand of the weatherglass  well had it been if the intermeddling of this bureaucracy had stopped there  but by a process of evocation as it was called more and more causes criminal as well as civil were withdrawn from the regular tribunals to those of the intendants and the council  before the intendant all the lower order of people were generally sent for trial breadriots were a common cause of such trials and m de tocqueville asserts that he has found sentences delivered by the intendant and a local council chosen by himself by which men were condemned to the galleys and even to death  under such a system under which an intendant must have felt it his interest to pretend at all risks that all was going right and to regard any disturbance as a dangerous exposure of himself and his chiefsone can understand easily enough that scene which mr carlyle has dramatised from lacretelle concerning the canaille the masses as we used to call them a generation since  a dumb generationtheir voice only an inarticulate cry  spokesman in the kings council in the worlds forum they have none that finds credence  at rare intervals as now in 1775 they will fling down their hoes and hammers and to the astonishment of mankind flock hither and thither dangerous aimless get the length even of versailles  turgot is altering the corn trade abrogating the absurdest corn laws there is dearth real or were it even factitious an indubitable scarcity of broad  and so on the 2nd day of may 1775 these waste multitudes do here at versailles chateau in widespread wretchedness in sallow faces squalor winged raggedness present as in legible hieroglyphic writing their petition of grievances  the chateaugates must be shut but the king will appear on the balcony and speak to them  they have seen the kings face their petition of grievances has been if not read looked at  in answer two of them are hanged on a new gallows forty feet high and the rest driven back to their dens for a time  of course  what more exasperating and inexpiable insult to the ruling powers was possible than this  to persist in being needy and wretched when a whole bureaucracy is toiling day and night to make them prosperous and happy  an insult only to be avenged in blood  remark meanwhile that this centralised bureaucracy was a failure that after all the trouble taken to govern these masses they were not governed in the sense of being made better and not worse  the truth is that no centralised bureaucracy or socalled paternal government yet invented on earth has been anything but a failure or is it like to be anything else because it is founded on an error because it regards and treats men as that which they are not as things and not as that which they are as persons  if the bureaucracy were a mere briareus giant with a hundred hands helping the weak throughout the length and breadth of the empire the system might be at least tolerable  but what if the government were not a briareus with a hundred hands but a hydra with a hundred heads and mouths each far more intent on helping itself than on helping the people  what if subdelegates and other officials holding office at the will of the intendant had to live and even provide against a rainy day  what if intendants holding office at the will of the comptrollergeneral had to do more than live and found it prudent to realise as large a fortune as possible not only against disgrace but against success and the dignity fit for a new member of the noblesse de la robe  would not the system then soon become intolerable  would there not be evil times for the masses till they became something more than masses  it is an ugly name that of the masses for the great majority of human beings in a nation  he who uses it speaks of them not as human beings but as things and as things not bound together in one living body but lying in a fortuitous heap  a swarm of ants is not a mass  it has a polity and a unity  not the ants but the firneedles and sticks of which the ants have piled their nest are a mass  the term i believe was invented during the ancien regime  whether it was or not it expresses very accurately the life of the many in those days  no one would speak if he wished to speak exactly of the masses of the united states for there every man is or is presumed to be a personage with his own independence his own activities his own rights and duties  no one i believe would have talked of the masses in the old feudal times for then each individual was someones man bound to his master by ties of mutual service just or unjust honourable or base but still giving him a personality of duties and rights and dividing him from his class  dividing i say  the poor of the middle age had little sense of a common humanity  those who owned allegiance to the lord in the next valley were not their brothers and at their own lords bidding they buckled on sword and slew the next lords men with joyful heart and good conscience  only now and then misery compressed them into masses and they ran together as sheep run together to face a dog  some wholesale wrong made them aware that they were brothers at least in the power of starving and they joined in the cry which was heard i believe in mecklenburg as late as 1790 den edelman wille wi dodschlagen  then in wat tylers insurrections in munster anabaptisms in jacqueries they proved themselves to be masses if nothing better striking for awhile by the mere weight of numbers blows terrible though aimlesssoon to be dispersed and slain in their turn by a disciplined and compact aristocracy  yet not always dispersed if they could find a leader as the polish nobles discovered to their cost in the middle of the seventeenth century  then bogdan the cossack a wild warrior not without his sins but having deserved well of james sobieski and the poles found that the neighbouring nobles steward had taken a fancy to his windmill and his farm upon the dnieper  he was thrown into prison on a frivolous charge and escaped to the tatars leaving his wife dishonoured his house burnt his infant lost in the flames his eldest son scourged for protesting against the wrong  and he returned at the head of an army of tatars socinians greeks or what not to set free the serfs and exterminate jesuits jews and nobles throughout podolia volhynia red russia to desecrate the altars of god and slay his servants to destroy the nobles by lingering tortures to strip noble ladies and maidens and hunt them to death with the whips of his cossacks and after defeating the nobles in battle after battle to inaugurate an era of misery and anarchy from which poland never recovered  thus did the masses of southern poland discover for one generation at least that they were not many things but one thing a class capable of brotherhood and unity though alas only of such as belongs to a pack of wolves  but such outbursts as this were rare exceptions  in general feudalism kept the people divided and therefore helpless  and as feudalism died out and with it the personal selfrespect and loyalty which were engendered by the old relations of master and servant the division still remained and the people in france especially became merely masses a swarm of incoherent and disorganised things intent on the necessaries of daily bread like mites crawling over each other in a cheese  out of this mass were struggling upwards perpetually all who had a little ambition a little scholarship or a little money endeavouring to become members of the middle class by obtaining a government appointment a man says m de tocqueville endowed with some education and small means thought it not decorous to die without having been a government officer  every man according to his condition says a contemporary writer wants to be something by command of the king  it was not merely the natural vanity of which m de tocqueville accuses his countrymen which stirred up in them this eagerness after place for we see the same eagerness in other nations of the continent who cannot be accused as wholes of that weakness  the fact is a government place or a government decoration cross ribbon or what not is in a country where selfgovernment is unknown or dead the only method save literary fame which is left to men in order to assert themselves either to themselves or their fellowmen  a british or american shopkeeper or farmer asks nothing of his government  he can if he chooses be elected to some local office generally unsalaried by the votes of his fellowcitizens  but that is his right and adds nothing to his respectability  the test of that latter in a country where all honest callings are equally honourable is the amount of money he can make and a very sound practical test that is in a country where intellect and capital are free  beyond that he is what he is and wishes to be no more save what he can make himself  he has his rights guaranteed by law and public opinion and as long as he stands within them and as he well phrases it behaves like a gentleman he considers himself as good as any man and so he is  but under the bureaucratic regime of the continent if a man had not something by command of the king he was nothing and something he naturally wished to be even by means of a government which he disliked and despised  so in france where innumerable petty posts were regular articles of sale anyone it seems who had saved a little money found it most profitable to invest it in a beadledom of some kindto the great detriment of the country for he thus withdrew his capital from trade but to his own clear gain for he thereby purchased some immunity from public burdens and as it were compounded once and for all for his taxes  the petty german princes it seems followed the example of france and sold their little beadledoms likewise but even where offices were not sold they must be obtained by any and every means by everyone who desired not to be as other men were and to become notables as they were called in france so he migrated from the country into the nearest town and became a member of some small bodyguild town council or what not bodies which were infinite in number  in one small town m de tocqueville discovers thirtysix such bodies separated from each other by diminutive privileges the least honourable of which was still a mark of honour  quarrelling perpetually with each other for precedence despising and oppressing the very menu peuple from whom they had for the most part sprung these innumerable small bodies instead of uniting their class only served to split it up more and more and when the revolution broke them up once and for all with all other privileges whatsoever no bond of union was left and each man stood alone proud of his individualityhis complete social isolation till he discovered that in ridding himself of superiors he had rid himself also of fellows fulfilling every man in his own person the old fable of the bundle of sticks and had to submit under the consulate and the empire to a tyranny to which the ancien regime was freedom itself  for in france at least the ancien regime was no tyranny  the middle and upper classes had individual libertyit may be only too much the liberty of disobeying a government which they did not respect  however submissive the french may have been before the revolution to the will of the king one sort of obedience was altogether unknown to them  they knew not what it was to bow before an illegitimate and contested powera power but little honoured frequently despised but willingly endured because it may be serviceable or because it may hurt  to that degrading form of servitude they were ever strangers  the king inspired them with feelings    which have become incomprehensible to this generation   they loved him with the affection due to a father they revered him with the respect due to god  in submitting to the most arbitrary of his commands they yielded less to compulsion than to loyalty and thus they frequently preserved great freedom of mind even in the most complete dependence  this liberty irregular intermittent says m de tocqueville helped to form those vigorous characters those proud and daring spirits which were to make the french revolution at once the object of the admiration and the terror of succeeding generations  this libertytoo much akin to anarchy in which indeed it issued for awhileseems to have asserted itself in continual petty resistance to officials whom they did not respect and who in their turn were more than a little afraid of the very men out of whose ranks they had sprung  the french governmentone may say every government on the continent in those dayshad the special weakness of all bureaucracies namely that want of moral force which compels them to fall back at last on physical force and transforms the ruler into a bully and the soldier into a policeman and a gaoler  a government of parvenus uncertain of its own position will be continually trying to assert itself to itself by vexatious intermeddling and intruding pretensions and then when it meets with the resistance of free and rational spirits will either recoil in awkward cowardice or fly into a passion and appeal to the halter and the sword  such a government can never take itself for granted because it knows that it is not taken for granted by the people it never can possess the quiet assurance the courteous dignity without swagger yet without hesitation which belongs to hereditary legislators by which term is to be understood not merely kings not merely noblemen but every citizen of a free nation however democratic who has received from his forefathers the right the duty and the example of selfgovernment  such was the political and social state of the ancien regime not only in france but if we are to trust as we must trust m de tocqueville in almost every nation in europe except britain  and as for its moral state  we must look for thatif we have need which happily all have notin its lighter literature  i shall not trouble you with criticisms on french memoirsof which those of madame de sevigne are on the whole the most painful as witness her comments on the marquise de brinvillierss execution because written by a woman better and more human than ordinary  nor with menagiana or other anasas vain and artificial as they are often foul nor with novels and poems long since deservedly forgotten  on the first perusal of this lighter literature you will be charmed with the ease grace lightness with which everything is said  on the second you will be somewhat cured of your admiration as you perceive how little there is to say  the head proves to be nothing but a cunning mask with no brains inside  especially is this true of a book which i must beg those who have read it already to recollect  to read it i recommend no human being  we may consider it as it was considered in its time the typical novel of the ancien regime  a picture of spanish society written by a frenchman it was held to beand doubtless with reasona picture of the whole european world  its french editor of 1836 calls it a grande epopee one of the most prodigious efforts of intelligence exhausting all forms of humanityin fact a second shakespeare according to the lights of the year 1715  i mean of course gil blas  so picturesque is the book that it has furnished inexhaustible motifs to the draughtsman  so excellent is its workmanship that the enthusiastic editor of 1836 tells usand doubtless he knows bestthat it is the classic model of the french tongue and that as le sage had embraced all that belonged to man in his composition he dared to prescribe to himself to embrace the whole french language in his work  it has been the parent of a whole school of literaturethe bible of tens of thousands with admiring commentators in plenty on whose souls may god have mercy  and no wonder  the book has a solid value and will always have not merely from its perfect art according to its own measure and intention but from its perfect truthfulness  it is the ancien regime itself  it set forth to the men thereof themselves without veil or cowardly reticence of any kind and inasmuch as every man loves himself the ancien regime loved gil blas and said the problem of humanity is solved at last  but ye longsuffering powers of heaven what a solution  it is beside the matter to call the book ungodly immoral base  le sage would have answered of course it is for so is the world of which it is a picture  no the most notable thing about the book is its intense stupidity its dreariness barrenness shallowness ignorance of the human heart want of any human interest  if it be an epos the actors in it are not men and women but ferretswith here and there of course a stray rabbit on whose brains they may feed  it is the inhuman mirror of an inhuman age in which the healthy human heart can find no more interest than in a pathological museum  that last indeed gil blas is a collection of diseased specimens  no man or woman in the book lay or clerical gentle or simple as far as i can remember do their duty in any wise even if they recollect that they have any duty to do  greed chicane hypocrisy uselessness are the ruling laws of human society  a new book of ecclesiastes crying vanity of vanity all is vanity the conclusion of the whole matter being left out and the new ecclesiastes rendered thereby diabolic instead of like that old one divine  for instead of fear god and keep his commandments for that is the whole duty of main le sage sends forth the new conclusion take care of thyself and feed on thy neighbours for that is the whole duty of man  and very faithfully was his advice easy enough to obey at all times obeyed for nearly a century after gil blas appeared  about the same time there appeared by a remarkable coincidence another work like it the child of the ancien regime and yet as opposite to it as light to darkness  if le sage drew men as they were fenelon tried at least to draw them as they might have been and still might be were they governed by sages and by saints according to the laws of god telemaque is an idealimperfect doubtless as all ideals must be in a world in which gods ways and thoughts are for ever higher than mans but an ideal nevertheless  if its construction is less complete than that of gil blas it is because its aim is infinitely higher because the form has to be subordinated here and there to the matter  if its political economy be imperfect often chimerical it is because the mind of one man must needs have been too weak to bring into shape and order the chaos social and economic which he saw around him  m de lamartine in his brilliant little life of fenelon does not hesitate to trace to the influence of telemaque the utopias which produced the revolutions of 1793 and 1848  the saintly poet was he says without knowing it the first radical and the first communist of his century but it is something to have preached to princes doctrines till then unknown or at least forgotten for many a generationfree trade peace international arbitration and the carriere ouverte aux talents for all ranks  it is something to have warned his generation of the dangerous overgrowth of the metropolis to have prophesied as an old hebrew might have done that the despotism which he saw around him would end in a violent revolution  it is something to have combined the highest christian morality with a hearty appreciation of old greek life of its reverence for bodily health and prowess its joyous and simple country society its sacrificial feasts dances games its respect for the gods its belief that they helped guided inspired the sons of men  it is something to have himself believed in god in a living god who both in this life and in all lives to come rewarded the good and punished the evil by inevitable laws  it is something to have warned a young prince in an age of doctrinal bigotry and practical atheism that a living god still existed and that his laws were still in force to have shown him tartarus crowded with the souls of wicked monarchs while a few of kingly race rested in elysium and among them old pagansinachus cecrops erichthon triptolemus and sesostrisrewarded for ever for having done their duty each according to his light to the flocks which the gods had committed to their care  it is something to have spoken to a prince in such an age without servility and without etiquette of the frailties and the dangers which beset arbitrary rulers to have told him that royalty when assumed to content oneself is a monstrous tyranny when assumed to fulfil its duties and to conduct an innumerable people as a father conducts his children a crushing slavery which demands an heroic courage and patience  let us honour the courtier who dared speak such truths and still more the saintly celibate who had sufficient catholicity of mind to envelop them in old grecian dress and without playing false for a moment to his own christianity seek in the writings of heathen sages a wider and a healthier view of humanity than was afforded by an ascetic creed  no wonder that the appearance of telemaque published in holland without the permission of fenelon delighted throughout europe that public which is always delighted with new truths as long as it is not required to practise them  to read telemaque was the right and the enjoyment of everyone  to obey it the duty only of princes  no wonder that on the other hand this vengeance de peuples lecon des rois as m de lamartine calls it was taken for the bitterest satire by louis xiv and completed the disgrace of one who had dared to teach the future king of france that he must show himself in all things the opposite of his grandfather  no wonder if madame de maintenon and the court looked on its portraits of wicked ministers and courtiers as caricatures of themselves portraits too which composed thus in the palace of versailles under the auspices of that confidence which the king had placed in the preceptor of his heir seemed a domestic treason  no wonder also if the foolish and envious world outside was of the same opinion and after enjoying for awhile this exposure of the great ones of the earth left telemaque as an utopia with which private folks had no concern and betook themselves to the easier and more practical model of gil blas  but there are solid defects in telemaqueindicating corresponding defects in the authors mindwhich would have in any case prevented its doing the good work which fenelon desired defects which are natural as it seems to me to his position as a roman catholic priest however saintly and pure however humane and liberal  the king with him is to be always the father of his people which is tantamount to saying that the people are to be always children and in a condition of tutelage voluntary if possible if not of tutelage still  of selfgovernment and education of human beings into free manhood by the exercise of self government free will free thoughtof this fenelon had surely not a glimpse  a generation or two passed by and then the peoples of europe began to suspect that they were no longer children but come to manhood and determined after the example of britain and america to assume the rights and duties of manhood at whatever risk of excesses or mistakes and then telemaque was relegatedhalf unjustlyas the slavish and childish dream of a past age into the schoolroom where it still remains  but there is a defect in telemaque which is perhaps deeper still  no woman in it exercises influence over man except for evil  minerva the guiding and inspiring spirit assumes of course as mentor a male form but her speech and thought is essentially masculine and not feminine antiope is a mere layfigure introduced at the end of the book because telemachus must needs be allowed to have hope of marrying someone or other  venus plays but the same part as she does in the tannenhauser legends of the middle age  her hatred against telemachus is an integral element of the plot  she with the other women or nymphs of the romance in spite of all fenelons mercy and courtesy towards human frailties really rise no higher than the witches of the malleus maleficanum womanas the old monk held who derived femina from fe faith and minus less because women have less faith than menis in telemaque whenever she thinks or acts the temptress the enchantress the victim according to a very ancient calumny of passions more violent often more lawless than mans  such a conception of women must make telemaque to the end of time useless as a wholesome book of education  it must have crippled its influence especially in france in its own time  for there for good and for evil woman was asserting more and more her power and her right to power over the mind and heart of man  rising from the long degradation of the middle ages which had really respected her only when unsexed and celibate the french woman had assumed often lawlessly always triumphantly her just freedom her true place as the equal the coadjutor the counsellor of man  of all problems connected with the education of a young prince that of the influence of woman was in the france of the ancien regime the most important  and it was just that which fenelon did not perhaps dared not try to touch and which he most certainly could not have solved  meanwhile not only madame de maintenon but women whose names it were a shame to couple with hers must have smiled at while they hated the saint who attempted to dispense not only with them but with the ideal queen who should have been the helpmeet of the ideal king  to those who believe that the world is governed by a living god it may seem strange at first sight that this moral anarchy was allowed to endure that the avenging and yet most purifying storm of the french revolution inevitable from louis xivs latter years was not allowed to burst two generations sooner than it did  is not the answerthat the question always is not of destroying the world but of amending it  and that amendment must always come from within and not from without  that men must be taught to become men and mend their world themselves  to educate men into selfgovernmentthat is the purpose of the government of god and some of the men of the eighteenth century did not learn that lesson  as the century rolled on the human mind arose out of the slough in which le sage found it into manifold and beautiful activity increasing hatred of shams and lies increasing hunger after truth and usefulness  with mistakes and confusions innumerable they worked but still they worked planting good seed and when the fire of the french revolution swept over the land it burned up the rotten and the withered only to let the fresh herbage spring up from underneath  but that purifying fire was needed  if we inquire why the many attempts to reform the ancien regime which the eighteenth century witnessed were failures one and all why pombal failed in portugal aranda in spain joseph ii in austria ferdinand and caroline in naplesfor these last be it always remembered began as humane and enlightened sovereigns patronising liberal opinions and labouring to ameliorate the condition of the poor till they were driven by the murder of marie antoinette into a paroxysm of rage and terrorwhy above all louis xvi who attempted deeper and wiser reforms than any other sovereign failed more disastrously than anyis not the answer this that all these reforms would but have cleansed the outside of the cup and the platter while they left the inside full of extortion and excess  it was not merely institutions which required to be reformed but men and women  the spirit of gil blas had to be cast out  the deadness selfishness isolation of mens souls their unbelief in great duties great common causes great selfsacrificesin a word their unbelief in god and themselves and mankindall that had to be reformed and till that was done all outward reform would but have left them at best in brute ease and peace to that soulless degradation which as in the byzantine empire of old and seeming in the chinese empire of today hides the reality of barbarism under a varnish of civilisation  men had to be awakened to be taught to think for themselves act for themselves to dare and suffer side by side for their country and for their children in a word to arise and become men once more  and what is more men had to punishto avenge  those are fearful words  but there is in this godguided universe a law of retribution which will find men out whether men choose to find it out or not a law of retribution of vengeance inflicted justly though not necessarily by just men  the public executioner was seldom a very estimable personage at least under the old regime and those who have been the scourges of god have been in general mere scourges and nothing better smiting blindly rashly confusedly confounding too often the innocent with the guilty till they have seemed only to punish crime by crime and replace old sins by new  but however insoluble however saddening that puzzle be i must believeas long as i believe in any god at allthat such men as robespierre were his instruments even in their crimes  in the case of the french revolution indeed the wickedness of certain of its leaders was part of the retribution itself  for the noblesse existed surely to make men better  it did by certain classes the very opposite  therefore it was destroyed by wicked men whom it itself had made wicked  for over and above all political economic social wrongs there were wrongs personal human dramatic which stirred not merely the springs of covetousness or envy or even of a just demand for the freedom of labour and enterprise but the very deepest springs of rage contempt and hate wrongs which caused as i believe the horrors of the revolution  it is notorious how many of the men most deeply implicated in those horrors were of the artist classby which i signify not merely painters and sculptorsas the word artist has now got somewhat strangely to signify at least in englandbut what the french meant by artistesproducers of luxuries and amusements playactors musicians and suchlike down to that distracted perukemaker with two fiery torches who at the storm of the bastile was for burning the saltpetres of the arsenal had not a woman run screaming had not a patriot with some tincture of natural philosophy instantly struck the wind out of him with butt of musket on pit of stomach overturned the barrels and stayed the devouring element  the distracted perukemaker may have had his wrongsperhaps such a one as that of poor triboulet the fool in le roi samuseand his own sound reasons for blowing down the bastile and the system which kept it up  for these very ministers of luxurythen miscalled artfrom the periwig maker to the playactorwho like them had seen the frivolity the baseness the profligacy of the rulers to whose vices they pandered whom they despised while they adored  figaro himself may have looked up to his master the marquis as a superior being as long as the law enabled the marquis to send him to the bastile by a lettre de cachet yet figaro may have known and seen enough to excuse him when lettres de cachet were abolished for handing the marquis over to a comite de salut public disappointed playactors like collet dherbois disappointed poets like fabre dolivet were they say especially ferocious  why not ingenious sensitive spirits used as lapdogs and singingbirds by men and women whom they felt to be their own flesh and blood they had it may be a juster appreciation of the actual worth of their patrons than had our own pitt and burke  they had played the valet and no man was a hero to them  they had seen the nobleman expose himself before his own helots they would try if the helot was not as good as the nobleman  the nobleman had played the mountebank why should not the mountebank for once play the nobleman  the noblemans god had been his five senses with to use mr carlyles phrase the sixth sense of vanity why should not the mountebank worship the same god like carriere at nantes and see what grace and gifts he too might obtain at that altar  but why so cruel  because with many of these men i more than suspect there were wrongs to be avenged deeper than any wrongs done to the sixth sense of vanity  wrongs common to them and to a great portion of the respectable middle class and much of the lower class but wrongs to which they and their families being most in contact with the noblesse would be especially exposed namely wrongs to women  everyone who knows the literature of that time must know what i mean what had gone on for more than a century it may be more than two in france in italy andi am sorry to have to say itgermany likewise all historians know what i mean and how enormous was the evil  i only wonder that they have so much overlooked that item in the causes of the revolution  it seems to me to have been more patent and potent in the sight of men as it surely was in the sight of almighty god than all the political and economic wrongs put together  they might have issued in a change of dynasty or of laws  that issued in the blood of the offenders  not a girl was enticed into louis xvs petit trianon or other den of aristocratic iniquity but left behind her parents nursing shame and sullen indignation even while they fingered the illgotten price of their daughters honour and left behind also perhaps some unhappy boy of her own class in whom disappointment and jealousy were transformedand who will blame himinto righteous indignation and a very sword of god all the more indignant and all the more righteous if education helped him to see that the maidens acquiescence her pride in her own shame was the ugliest feature in the whole crime and the most potent reason for putting an end however fearful to a state of things in which such a fate was thought an honour and a gain and not a disgrace and a ruin in which the most gifted daughters of the lower classes had learnt to think it more noble to becomethat which they becamethan the wives of honest men  if you will read fairly the literature of the ancien regime whether in france or elsewhere you will see that my facts are true  if you have human hearts in you you will see in them it seems to me an explanation of many a guillotinade and fusillade as yet explained only on the ground of madnessan hypothesis which as we do not yet in the least understand what madness is is no explanation at all  an age of decay incoherence and makeshift varnish and gilding upon wormeaten furniture and mouldering wainscot was that same ancien regime  and for that very reason a picturesque age like one of its own landscapes  a picturesque bit of uncultivated mountain swarming with the princes game a picturesque old robber schloss above now in ruins and below perhaps the picturesque new schloss with its french fountains and gardens french nymphs of marble and of flesh and blood likewise which the prince has partially paid for by selling a few hundred young men to the english to fight the yankees  the river too is picturesque for the old bridge has not been repaired since it was blown up in the seven years war and there is but a single lazy barge floating down the stream owing to the tolls and tariffs of his serene highness the village is picturesque for the flower of the young men are at the wars and the place is tumbling down and the two old peasants in the foreground with the single goat and the hamper of vinetwigs are very picturesque likewise for they are all in rags  how sad to see the picturesque element eliminated and the quiet artistic beauty of the scene destroyedto have steamers puffing up and down the river and a railroad hurrying along its banks the wealth of the old world in exchange for the wealth of the newor hurrying it may be whole regiments of free and educated citizensoldiers who fight they know for what  how sad to see the alto schloss desecrated by tourists and the neue schloss converted into a coldwater cure  how sad to see the village church and all built up again brandnew and whitewashed to the very steepletopa new school at the townenda new crucifix by the wayside  how sad to see the old folk well clothed in the fabrics of england or belgium doing an easy trade in milk and fruit because the land they till has become their own and not the princes while their sons are thriving farmers on the prairies of the far west  very unpicturesque no doubt is wealth and progress peace and safety cleanliness and comfort  but they possess advantages unknown to the ancien regime which was if nothing else picturesque  men could paint amusing and often pretty pictures of its people and its places  consider that word picturesque  it and the notion of art which it expresses are the children of the ancien regimeof the era of decay the healthy vigorous earnest progressive middle age never dreamed of admiring much less of painting for their own sake rags and ruins the fashion sprang up at the end of the seventeenth century it lingered on during the first quarter of our century kept alive by the reaction from 181525  it is all but dead now before the return of vigorous and progressive thought  an admirer of the middle ages now does not build a sham ruin in his grounds he restores a church blazing with colour like a medieval illumination  he has learnt to look on that which went by the name of picturesque in his greatgrandfathers time as an old greek or a middle age monk would have doneas something squalid ugly a sign of neglect disease death and therefore to be hated and abolished if it cannot be restored  at carcassone now m violletleduc under the auspices of the emperor of the french is spending his vast learning and much money simply in abolishing the picturesque in restoring stone for stone each member of that wonderful museum of middle age architecture roman visigothic moslem romaine early english later french all is being reproduced exactly as it must have existed centuries since  no doubt that is not the highest function of art but it is a preparation for the highest a step toward some future creative school  as the early italian artists by careful imitation absorbed into their minds the beauty and meaning of old greek and roman art so must the artists of our days by the art of the middle age and the renaissance  they must learn to copy before they can learn to surpass and meanwhile they must learnindeed they have learntthat decay is ugliness and the imitation of decay a making money out of the public shame  the picturesque sprang up as far as i can discover suddenly during the time of exhaustion and recklessness which followed the great struggles of the sixteenth century  salvator rosa and callot two of the earliest professors of picturesque art have never been since surpassed  for indeed they drew from life  the rags and the ruins material and alas spiritual were all around them the lands and the creeds alike lay waste  there was ruffianism and misery among the masses of europe unbelief and artificiality among the upper classes churches and monasteries defiled cities sacked farmsteads plundered and ruinate and all the wretchedness which callot has immortalisedfor a warning to evil rulersin his miseres de la guerre  the world was all gone wrong but as for setting it right againwho could do that  and so men fell into a sentimental regret for the past and its beauties all exaggerated by the foreshortening of time while they wanted strength or faith to reproduce it  at last they became so accustomed to the rags and ruins that they looked on them as the normal condition of humanity as the normal field for painters  only now and then and especially toward the latter half of the eighteenth century when thought began to revive and men dreamed of putting the world to rights once more there rose before them glimpses of an arcadian ideal  country lifethe primaeval calling of menhow graceful and pure it might be  how gracefulif not pureit once had been  the boors of teniers and the beggars of murillo might be true to present fact but there was a fairer ideal which once had been fact in the eclogues of theocritus and the loves of daphnis and chloe  and so men took to dreaming of shepherds and shepherdesses and painting them on canvas and modelling them in china according to their cockney notions of what they had been once and always ought to be  we smile now at sevres and dresden shepherdesses but the wise man will surely see in them a certain pathos  they indicated a craving after something better than boorishness and the many men and women may have become the gentler and purer by looking even at them and have said sadly to themselves such might have been the peasantry of half europe had it not been for devastations of the palatinate wars of succession and the wicked wills of emperors and kings     lecture iiithe explosive forces   in a former lecture in this institution i said that the human race owed more to the eighteenth century than to any century since the christian era  it may seem a bold assertion to those who value duly the century which followed the revival of greek literature and consider that the eighteenth century was but the child or rather grandchild thereof  but i must persist in my opinion even though it seem to be inconsistent with my description of the very same era as one of decay and death  for side by side with the death there was manifold fresh birth side by side with the decay there was active growthside by side with them fostered by them though generally in strong opposition to them whether conscious or unconscious  we must beware however of trying to find between that decay and that growth a bond of cause and effect where there is really none  the general decay may have determined the course of many mens thoughts but it no more set them thinking than as i have heard said the decay of the ancien regime produced the new regimea loose metaphor which like all metaphors will not hold water and must not be taken for a philosophic truth  that would be to confess manwhat i shall never confess him to bethe creature of circumstances it would be to fall into the same fallacy of spontaneous generation as did the ancients when they believed that bees were bred from the carcass of a dead ox  in the first place the bees were no bees but fliesunless when some true swarm of honey bees may have taken up their abode within the empty ribs as samsons bees did in that of the lion  but bees or flies each sprang from an egg independent of the carcass having a vitality of its own it was fostered by the carcass it fed on during development but bred from it it was not any more than marat was bred from the decay of the ancien regime  there are flies which by feeding on putridity become poisonous themselves as did marat but even they owe their vitality and organisation to something higher than that on which they feed and each of them however defaced and debased was at first a thought of god all true manhood consists in the defiance of circumstances and if any man be the creature of circumstances it is because he has become so like the drunkard because he has ceased to be a man and sunk downward toward the brute  accordingly we shall find throughout the 18th century a stirring of thought an originality a resistance to circumstances an indignant defiance of circumstances which would have been impossible had circumstances been the true lords and shapers of mankind  had that latter been the case the downward progress of the ancien regime would have been irremediable  each generation conformed more and more to the element in which it lived would have sunk deeper in dull acquiescence to evil in ignorance of all cravings save those of the senses and if at any time intolerable wrong or want had driven it to revolt it would have issued not in the proclamation of new and vast ideas but in an anarchic struggle for revenge and bread  there are races alas which seem for the present at least mastered by circumstances  some like the chinese have sunk back into that state some like the negro in africa seem not yet to have emerged from it but in europe during the eighteenth century were working not merely new forces and vitalities abstractions which mislead rather than explain but living persons in plenty men and women with independent and original hearts and brains instinct in spite of all circumstances with power which we shall most wisely ascribe directly to him who is the lord and giver of life  such persons seemedi only say seemedmost numerous in england and in germany  but there were enough of them in france to change the destiny of that great nation for awhileperhaps for ever  m de tocqueville has a whole chapter and a very remarkable one which appears at first sight to militate against my beliefa chapter showing that france was the country in which men had become most alike  the men he says of that time especially those belonging to the upper and middle ranks of society who alone were at all conspicuous were all exactly alike  and it must be allowed that if this were true of the upper and middle classes it must have been still more true of the mass of the lowest population who being most animal are always most mouldedor rather crushedby their own circumstances by public opinion and by the wants of five senses common to all alike  but when m de tocqueville attributes this curious fact to the circumstances of their political stateto that government of one man which in the end has the inevitable effect of rendering all men alike and all mutually indifferent to their common fatewe must differ even from him for facts prove the impotence of that or of any other circumstance in altering the hearts and souls of men in producing in them anything but a mere superficial and temporary resemblance  for all the while there was among these very french here and there a variety of character and purpose sufficient to burst through that very despotism and to develop the nation into manifold new and quite original shapes  thus it was proved that the uniformity had been only in their outside crust and shell  what tore the nation to pieces during the reign of terror but the boundless variety and originality of the characters which found themselves suddenly in free rivalry  what else gave to the undisciplined levies the bankrupt governments the parvenu heroes of the republic a manifold force a selfdependent audacity which made them the conquerors and the teachers for good and evil of the civilised world  if there was one doctrine which the french revolution specially proclaimedwhich it caricatured till it brought it into temporary disreputeit was this that no man is like another that in each is a godgiven individuality an independent soul which no government or man has a right to crush or can crush in the long run but which ought to have and must have a carriere ouverte aux talents freely to do the best for itself in the battle of life  the french revolution more than any event since twelve poor men set forth to convert the world some eighteen hundred years ago proves that man ought not to be and need not be the creature of circumstances the puppet of institutions but if he will their conqueror and their lord  of these original spirits who helped to bring life out of death and the modern world out of the decay of the mediaeval world the french philosophes and encyclopaedists are of course the most notorious they confessed for the most part that their original inspiration had come from england  they were or considered themselves the disciples of locke whose philosophy it seems to me their own acts disproved  and first a few words on these same philosophes  one may be thoroughly aware of their deficiencies of their sins moral as well as intellectual and yet one may demand that everyone should judge them fairlywhich can only be done by putting himself in their place and any fair judgment of them will i think lead to the conclusion that they were not mere destroyers inflamed with hate of everything which mankind had as yet held sacred  whatever sacred things they despised one sacred thing they reverenced which men had forgotten more and more since the seventeenth centurycommon justice and common humanity  it was this i believe which gave them their moral force  it was this which drew towards them the hearts not merely of educated bourgeois and nobles on the menu peuple they had no influence and did not care to have any but of every continental sovereign who felt in himself higher aspirations than those of a mere selfish tyrantfrederick the great christina of sweden joseph of austria and even that fallen juno catharine of russia with all her sins  to take the most extreme instancevoltaire we may question his being a philosopher at all  we may deny that he had even a tincture of formal philosophy  we may doubt much whether he had any of that human and humorous common sense which is often a good substitute for the philosophy of the schools  we may feel against him a just and honest indignation when we remember that he dared to travestie into a foul satire the tale of his countrys purest and noblest heroine but we must recollect at the same time that he did a public service to the morality of his own country and of all europe by his indignationquite as just and honest as any which we may feelat the legal murder of calas  we must recollect that if he exposes baseness and foulness with too cynical a license of speech in which indeed he sinned no more than had the average of french writers since the days of montaigne he at least never advocates them as did le sage  we must recollect that scattered throughout his writings are words in favour of that which is just merciful magnanimous and even at times in favour of that which is pure which proves that in voltaire as in most men there was a double selfthe one sickened to cynicism by the iniquity and folly which he saw around himthe other hungering after a nobler life and possibly exciting that hunger in one and another here and there who admired him for other reasons than the educated mob which cried after him vive la pucelle  rousseau too  easy it is to feel disgust contempt for the confessions and the nouvelle heloisefor much too much in the mans own life and character  one would think the worse of the young englishman who did not so feel and express his feelings roundly and roughly  but all young englishmen should recollect that to rousseaus emile they owe their deliverance from the useless pedantries the degrading brutalities of the medieval system of school education that emile awakened throughout civilised europe a conception of education just humane rational truly scientific because founded upon facts that if it had not been written by one writhing under the bitter consequences of miseducation and feeling their sting and their brand day by day on his own spirit miss edgeworth might never have reformed our nurseries or dr arnold our public schools  and so with the rest of the philosophes  that there were charlatans among them vain men pretentious men profligate men selfish selfseeking and hypocritical men who doubts  among what class of men were there not such in those evil days  in what class of men are there not such now in spite of all social and moral improvement  but nothing but the conviction among the average that they were in the rightthat they were fighting a battle for which it was worth while to dare and if need be to suffer could have enabled them to defy what was then public opinion backed by overwhelming physical force  their intellectual defects are patent  no one can deny that their inductions were hasty and partial but then they were inductions as opposed to the dull pedantry of the schools which rested on tradition only half believed or pretended to be believed  no one can deny that their theories were too general and abstract but then they were theories as opposed to the notheory of the ancien regime which was let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die  theoriesprinciplesby them if men do not live by them men are at least stirred into life at the sight of something more noble than themselves  only by great ideas right or wrong could such a world as that which le sage painted be roused out of its slough of foul selfsatisfaction and equally foul selfdiscontent  for mankind is ruled and guided in the long run not by practical considerations not by selfinterest not by compromises but by theories and principles and those of the most abstruse delicate supernatural and literally unspeakable kind which whether they be according to reason or not are so little according to logicthat is to speakable reasonthat they cannot be put into speech  men act whether singly or in masses by impulses and instincts for which they give reasons quite incompetent often quite irrelevant but which they have caught from each other as they catch fever or smallpox as unconsciously and yet as practically and potently just as the nineteenth century has caught from the philosophers of the eighteenth most practical rules of conduct without even in most cases having read a word of their works  and what has this century caught from these philosophers  one rule it has learnt and that a most practical oneto appeal in all cases as much as possible to reason and the laws of nature  that at least the philosophers tried to do  often they failed  their conceptions of reason and of the laws of nature being often incorrect they appealed to unreason and to laws which were not those of nature  the fixed idea of them all was says m de tocqueville to substitute simple and elementary rules deduced from reason and natural law for the complicated traditional customs which governed the society of their time  they were often rash hasty in the application of their method they ignored whole classes of facts which though spiritual and not physical are just as much facts and facts for science as those which concern a stone or a fungus  they mistook for merely complicated traditional customs many most sacred institutions which were just as much founded on reason and natural law as any theories of their own  but who shall say that their method was not correct  that it was not the only method  they appealed to reason  would you have had them appeal to unreason  they appealed to natural law  would you have had them appeal to unnatural lawlaw according to which god did not make this world alas that had been done too often already  solomon saw it done in his time and called it folly to which he prophesied no good end  rabelais saw it done in his time and wrote his chapters on the children of physis and the children of antiphysis  but born in an evil generation which was already even in 1500 ripening for the revolution of 1789 he was sensual and i fear cowardly enough to hide his light not under a bushel but under a dunghill till men took him for a jester of jests and his great wisdom was lost to the worse and more foolish generations which followed him and thought they understood him  but as for appealing to natural law for that which is good for men and to reason for the power of discerning that same goodif man cannot find truth by that method by what method shall he find it  and thus it happened that though these philosophers and encyclopaedists were not men of science they were at least the heralds and the coadjutors of science  we may call them and justly dreamers theorists fanatics  but we must recollect that one thing they meant to do and did  they recalled men to facts they bid them ask of everything they sawwhat are the facts of the case  till we know the facts argument is worse than useless  now the habit of asking for the facts of the case must deliver men more or less from that evil spirit which the old romans called fama from her whom virgil described in the aeneid as the ugliest the falsest and the cruellest of monsters  from fama from rumours hearsays exaggerations scandals superstitions public opinionswhether from the ancient public opinion that the sun went round the earth or the equally public opinion that those who dared to differ from public opinion were hateful to the deity and therefore worthy of deathfrom all these blasts of fames lying trumpet they helped to deliver men and they therefore helped to insure something like peace and personal security for those quiet modest and generally virtuous men who as students of physical science devoted their lives during the eighteenth century to asking of naturewhat are the facts of the case  it was no coincidence but a connection of cause and effect that during the century of philosopher sound physical science throve as she had never thriven before that in zoology and botany chemistry and medicine geology and astronomy man after man both of the middle and the noble classes laid down on more and more sound because more and more extended foundations that physical science which will endure as an everlasting heritage to mankind endure even though a second byzantine period should reduce it to a timid and traditional pedantry or a second irruption of barbarians sweep it away for awhile to revive again as classic philosophy revived in the fifteenth century among new and more energetic races when the kingdom of god shall have been taken away from us and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof  an eternal heritage i say for the human race which once gained can never be lost which stands and will stand marches and will march proving its growth its health its progressive force its certainty of final victory by those very changes disputes mistakes which the ignorant and the bigoted hold up to scorn as proofs of its uncertainty and its rottenness because they never have dared or cared to ask boldlywhat are the facts of the caseand have never discovered either the acuteness the patience the calm justice necessary for ascertaining the facts or their awful and divine certainty when once ascertained  but these philosophers it will be said hated all religion  before that question can be fairly discussed it is surely right to consider what form of religion that was which they found working round them in france and on the greater part of the continent  the quality thereof may have surely had something to do as they themselves asserted with that sort of rage with which to use m de tocquevilles words the christian religion was attacked in france  m de tocqueville is of opinion and his opinion is likely to be just that the church was not more open to attack in france than elsewhere that the corruptions and abuses which had been allowed to creep into it were less on the contrary there than in most catholic countries  the church of france was infinitely more tolerant than it ever had been previously and than it still was among other nations  consequently the peculiar causes of this phenomenon the hatred which it aroused must be looked for less in the condition of religion than in that of society  we no longer he says shortly after ask in what the church of that day erred as a religious institution but how far it stood opposed to the political revolution which was at hand  and he goes on to show how the principles of her ecclesiastical government and her political position were such that the philosophes must needs have been her enemies  but he mentions another fact which seems to me to belong neither to the category of religion nor to that of politics a fact which if he had done us the honour to enlarge upon it might have led him and his readers to a more true understanding of the disrepute into which christianity had fallen in france  the ecclesiastical authority had been specially employed in keeping watch over the progress of thought and the censorship of books was a daily annoyance to the philosophes  by defending the common liberties of the human mind against the church they were combating in their own cause and they began by breaking the shackles which pressed most closely on themselves  just so  and they are not to be blamed if they pressed first and most earnestly reforms which they knew by painful experience to be necessary all reformers are wont thus to begin at home  it is to their honour if not content with shaking off their own fetters they begin to see that others are fettered likewise and reasoning from the particular to the universal to learn that their own cause is the cause of mankind  there is therefore no reason to doubt that these men were honest when they said that they were combating not in their own cause merely but in that of humanity and that the church was combating in her own cause and that of her power and privilege  the church replied that she too was combating for humanity for its moral and eternal wellbeing  but that is just what the philosophes denied  they said and it is but fair to take a statement which appears on the face of all their writings which is the one keynote on which they ring perpetual changes that the cause of the church in france was not that of humanity but of inhumanity not that of nature but of unnature not even that of grace but of disgrace truely or falsely they complained that the french clergy had not only identified themselves with the repression of free thought and of physical science especially that of the newtonian astronomy but that they had proved themselves utterly unfit for centuries past to exercise any censorship whatsoever over the thoughts of men that they had identified themselves with the cause of darkness not of light with persecution and torture with the dragonnades of louis xiv with the murder of calas and of urban grandier with celibacy hysteria demonology witchcraft and the shameful public scandals like those of gauffredi grandier and pere giraud which had arisen out of mental disease with forms of worship which seemed to them rightly or wrongly idolatry and miracles which seemed to them rightly or wrongly impostures that the clergy interfered perpetually with the sanctity of family life as well as with the welfare of the state that their evil counsels and specially those of the jesuits had been patent and potent causes of much of the misrule and misery of louis xivs and xvs reigns and that with all these heavy counts against them their morality was not such as to make other men more moral and was notat least among the hierarchyimproving or likely to improve  to a mazarin a de retz a richelieu questionable men enough had succeeded a dubois a rohan a lomenie de brienne a maury a talleyrand and at the revolution of 1789 thoughtful frenchmen asked once and for all what was to be done with a church of which these were the hierophants  whether these complaints affected the french church as a religious institution must depend entirely on the meaning which is attached to the word religion that they affected her on scientific rational and moral grounds independent of any merely political one is as patent as that the attack based on them was onesided virulent and often somewhat hypocritical considering the private morals of many of the assailants we knowor ought to knowthat within that religion which seemed to the philosophes so distorted and defaced had it become a nightmare dream crushing the life out of mankind there lie elements divine eternal necessary for man in this life and the life to come  but we are bound to askhad they a fair chance of knowing what we know  have we proof that their hatred was against all religion or only against that which they saw around them  have we proof that they would have equally hated had they been in permanent contact with them creeds more free from certain faults which seemed to them in the case of the french church ineradicable and inexpiable  till then we must have charitywhich is justiceeven for the philosophes of the eighteenth century  this view of the case had been surely overlooked by m de tocqueville when he tried to explain by the fear of revolutions the fact that both in america and in england while the boldest political doctrines of the eighteenthcentury philosophers have been adopted their antireligious doctrines have made no way  he confesses that among the english french irreligious philosophy had been preached even before the greater part of the french philosophers were born  it was bolingbroke who set up voltaire  throughout the eighteenth century infidelity had celebrated champions in england  able writers and profound thinkers espoused that cause but they were never able to render it triumphant as in france  of these facts there can be no doubt but the cause which he gives for the failure of infidelity will surely sound new and strange to those who know the english literature and history of that century  it was he says inasmuch as all those who had anything to fear from revolutions eagerly came to the rescue of the established faith  surely there was no talk of revolutions no wish expressed or concealed to overthrow either government or society in the aristocratic clique to whom english infidelity was confined  such was at least the opinion of voltaire who boasted that all the works of the modern philosophers together would never make as much noise in the world as was made in former days by the disputes of the cordeliers about the shape of their sleeves and hoods  if as m de tocqueville says bolingbroke set up voltaire neither master nor pupil had any more leaning than hobbes had toward a democracy which was not dreaded in those days because it had never been heard of  and if as m de tocqueville heartily allows the english apologists of christianity triumphed at least for the time being the cause of their triumph must be sought in the plain fact that such men as berkeley butler and paley each according to his light fought the battle fairly on the common ground of reason and philosophy instead of on that of tradition and authority and that the forms of christianity current in englandwhether quaker puritan or anglicanoffended less than that current in france the commonsense and the human instincts of the many or of the sceptics themselves  but the eighteenth century saw another movement all the more powerful perhaps because it was continually changing its shape even its purpose and gaining fresh life and fresh adherents with every change  propagated at first by men of the school of locke it became at last a protest against the materialism of that school on behalf of all that is or calls itself supernatural and mysterious  abjuring and honestly all politics it found itself sucked into the political whirlpool in spite of itself as all human interests which have any life in them must be at last  it became an active promoter of the revolution then it helped to destroy the revolution when that had under napoleon become a levelling despotism then it helped as actively to keep revolutionary principles alive after the reaction of 1815a protean institution whose power we in england are as apt to undervalue as the governments of the continent were apt during the eighteenth century to exaggerate it  i mean of course freemasonry and the secret societies which honestly and honourably disowned by freemasonry yet have either copied it or actually sprung out of it  in england freemasonry never was it seems more than a liberal and respectable benefitclub for secret societies are needless for any further purposes amid free institutions and a free press  but on the continent during the eighteenth century freemasonry excited profound suspicion and fear on the part of statesmen who knew perfectly well their friends from their foes and whose precautions were from their point of view justified by the results  i shall not enter into the deep question of the origin of freemasonry one uninitiate as i am has no right to give an opinion on the great questions of the mediaeval lodge of kilwinning and its scotch degrees on the seven templars who after poor jacques molay was burnt at paris took refuge on the isle of mull in scotland found there another templar and brother mason ominously named harris took to the trowel in earnest and revived the orderon the masons who built magdeburg cathedral in 876 on the english masons assembled in pagan times by st albone that worthy knight on the revival of english masonry by edwin son of athelstan on magnus grecus who had been at the building of solomons temple and taught masonry to charles martel on the pillars jachin and boaz on the masonry of hiram of tyre and indeed of adam himself of whose first figleaf the masonic apron may be a typeon all these matters i dare no more decide than on the making of the trojan horse the birth of romulus and remus or the incarnation of vishnoo  all i dare say is that freemasonry emerges in its present form into history and fact seemingly about the beginning of george is reign among englishmen and noblemen notably in four lodges in the city of london 1 at the goose and gridiron alehouse in st pauls churchyard 2 at the crown alehouse near drury lane 3 at the apple tree tavern near covent garden 4 at the rummer and grapes tavern in charnel row westminster  that its principles were brotherly love and good fellowship which included in those days port sherry claret and punch that it was founded on the ground of mere humanity in every sense of the word being as was to be expected from the temper of the times both aristocratic and liberal admitting to its ranks virtuous gentlemen obliged says an old charge only to that religion wherein all men agree leaving their particular opinions to themselves that is to be good men and true or men of honour and honesty by whatever denominations or persuasions they may be distinguished whereby masonry becomes the centre of union and means of conciliating true friendship among persons that otherwise must have remained at a distance  little did the honest gentlemen who established or reestablished their society on these grounds and fenced it with quaint ceremonies old or new conceive the importance of their own act we looking at it from a distance may see all that such a society involved which was quite new to the world just then and see that it was the very child of the ancien regimeof a time when men were growing weary of the violent factions political and spiritual which had torn europe in pieces for more than a century and longed to say after all we are all alike in one thingfor we are at least men  its spread through england and scotland and the seceding bodies which arose from it as well as the supposed jacobite tendency of certain scotch lodges do not concern us here  the point interesting to us just now is that freemasonry was imported to the continent exclusively by english and scotch gentlemen and noblemen  lord derwentwater is said by some to have founded the loge anglaise in paris in 1725 the duke of richmond one in his own castle of aubigny shortly after  it was through hanoverian influence that the movement seems to have spread into germany in 1733 for instance the english grand master lord strathmore permitted eleven german gentlemen and good brethren to form a lodge in hamburg  into this english society was frederick the great when crown prince initiated in spite of strict old frederick williams objections who had heard of it as an english invention of irreligious tendency francis i of austria was made a freemason at the hague lord chesterfield being in the chair and then became a master in london under the name of brother lothringen to the discontent of maria theresa whose womans wit saw farther than her husband  englishmen and scotchmen introduced the new society into russia and into geneva  sweden and poland seem to have received it from france while in the south it seems to have been exclusively an english plant  sackville duke of middlesex is said to have founded the first lodge at florence in 1733 lord coleraine at gibraltar and madrid one gordon in portugal and everywhere at the commencement of the movement we find either london or scotland the motherlodges introducing on the continent those liberal and humane ideas of which england was then considered to her glory as the only home left on earth  but alas the seed sown grew up into strange shapes according to the soil in which it rooted  false doctrine heresy and schism according to herr findel the learned and rational historian whom i have chiefly followed defiled the new church from its infancy  in france so he bemoans himself first of all there shot up that baneful seed of lies and frauds of vanity and presumption of hatred and discord the mischievous high degrees the misstatement that our order was allied to the templars and existed at the time of the crusades the removal of old charges the bringing in surreptitiously of a multitude of symbols and forms which awoke the love of secrecy knighthood and in fact all which tended to poison freemasonry  herr findel seems to attribute these evils principally to the high degrees  it would have been more simple to have attributed them to the morals of the french noblesse in the days of louis quinze  what could a corrupt tree bring forth but corrupt fruit  if some of the early lodges like those of la felicite and lancre to which women were admitted resembled not a little the bacchic mysteries of old rome and like them called for the interference of the police still no great reform was to be expected when those sovereign masonic princes the emperors of the east and west quarrelledknights of the east against knights of the westtill they were absorbed or crushed by the lodge grand orient with philippe egalite duc de chartres as their grand master and as his representative the hero of the diamond necklace and disciple of count cagliostrolouis prince de rohan  but if freemasonry among the frivolous and sensual french noblesse became utterly frivolous and sensual itself it took a deeper though a questionably fantastic form among the more serious and earnest german nobility  forgetful as they too often were of their duty to their peoplestyrannical extravagant debauched by french opinions french fashions french luxuries till they had begun to despise their native speech their native literature almost their native land and to hide their native homeliness under a clumsy varnish of french outside civilisation which the years 180713 rubbed off them again with a brush of ironthey were yet germans at heart and that german instinct for the unseencall it enthusiasm mysticism what you will you cannot make it anything but a human fact and a most powerful and as i hold most blessed factthat instinct for the unseen i say which gives peculiar value to german philosophy poetry art religion and above all to german family life and which is just the complement needed to prevent our english commonsense matteroffact lockism from degenerating into materialismthat was only lying hidden but not dead in the german spirit  with the germans therefore freemasonry assumed a nobler and more earnest shape  dropping very soon that lockite and philosophe tone which had perhaps recommended it to frederick the great in his youth it became mediaevalist and mystic  it craved after a resuscitation of old chivalrous spirit and the virtues of the knightly ideal and the old german biederkeit und tapferkeit which were all defiled and overlaid by french fopperies  and not in vain as no struggle after a noble aim however confused or fantastic is ever in vain  freemasonry was the direct parent of the tugenbund and of those secret societies which freed germany from napoleon  whatever follies young members of them may have committed whatever jahn and his turnerei whatever the iron youths with their iron decorations and iron bootheels whatever in a word may have been said or done amiss in that childishness which as their own wisest writers often lament so often defaces the noble childlikeness of the german spirit let it be always remembered that under the impulse first given by freemasonry as much as that given by such heroes as stein and scharnhorst germany shook off the chains which had fallen on her in her sleep and stood once more at leipsic were it but for a moment a free people alike in body and in soul  remembering this and the solid benefits which germany owed to masonic influences one shrinks from saying much of the extravagances in which its masonry indulged before the french revolution  yet they are so characteristic of the age so significant to the student of human nature that they must be hinted at though not detailed  it is clear that masonry was at first a movement confined to the aristocracy or at least to the most educated classes and clear too that it fell in with a temper of mind unsatisfied with the dry dogmatism into which the popular creeds had then been frozenunsatisfied with their own frenchified foppery and pseudophilosophyunsatisfied with want of all duty purpose noble thought or noble work  with such a temper of mind it fell in but that very temper was open as it always is to those dreams of a royal road to wisdom and to virtue which have haunted in all ages the luxurious and the idle  those who will may read enough and too much of the wonderful secrets in nature and science and theosophy which men expected to find and did not find in the higher degrees of masonry till old vossthe translator of homerhad to confess that after trying for eleven years to attain a perfect knowledge of the inmost penetralia where the secret is said to be and of its invisible guardians all he knew was that the documents which he had to make known to the initiated were nothing more than a well gotup farce  but the mania was general  the highborn and the virtuous expected to discover some panacea for their own consciences in what voss calls a multitude of symbols which are ever increasing the farther you penetrate and are made to have a moral application through some arbitrary twisting of their meaning as if i were to attempt expounding the chaos on my writingdesk  a rich harvestfield was an aristocracy in such a humour for quacks of every kind richer even than that of france in that the germans were at once more honest and more earnest and therefore to be robbed more easily  the carcass was there and the birds of prey were gathered together  of rosa with his lodge of the three hammers and his potsdam goldmakingof johnson alias leuchte who passed himself off as a grand prior sent from scotland to resuscitate the order of knights templars who informed his disciples that the grand master von hund commanded 26000 men that round the convent what convent does not appear a high wall was erected which was guarded day and night that the english navy was in the hands of the order that they had mss written by hugo de paganis a mythic hero who often figures in these fables that their treasure was in only three places in the world in ballenstadt in the icy mountains of savoy and in china that whosoever drew on himself the displeasure of the order perished

to support and advance the catholic religionone would think the accusation was very unnecessary seeing that their actual dealings were with the philosophers stone and the exorcism of spirits and that the first apostle of the new golden rosicrucian order one schropfer getting into debt and fearing exposure finished his life in an altogether uncatholic manner at leipsic in 1774 by shooting himselfof keller and his urim and thummimof wollner who caught the crown prince frederick william with his three names of chrysophiron heliconus and ophiron and his fourth name of ormesus magnus under which all

severity fell upon these poor foolish illuminati in 1784 throughout bavaria and had them exiled or imprisonedof all this you may read in the pages of dr findel and in many another book  for forgotten as they are now they made noise enough in their time  and so it befell that this eighteenth century which is usually held to be the most materialistic of epochs was in fact a most spiritualistic one in which ghosts demons quacks philosophers stones enchanters wands mysteries and mummeries were as fashionableas they will probably be again some day  you have all heard of cagliostropupil of the sage althotas foster child of the scheriff of mecca probable son of the last king of trebizond named also acharat and unfortunate child of nature by profession healer of diseases abolisher of wrinkles

palermoof him and of his lovely countess seraphinanee lorenza feliciani  you have read what goetheand still more important what mr carlyle has written on him as on one of the most significant personages of the age  remember then that cagliostro was no isolated phenomenon that his successnay his having even conceived the possibility of success in the brain that lay within that brassfaced bullnecked thicklipped headwas made possible by public opinion  had cagliostro lived in our time public opinion would have pointed out to him other roads to honouron which he would doubtless have fared as well  for when the silly dace try to be caught and hope to be caught he is a foolish pike who cannot gorge them but the method most easy for a pikenature like cagliostros was in the eighteenth century as it may be in the latter half of the nineteenth to trade in a materialist age on the unsatisfied spiritual cravings of mankind  for what do all these phantasms betoken but a generation ashamed of its own materialism sensuality insincerity ignorance and striving to escape therefrom by any and every mad superstition which seemed likely to give an answer to the awful questionswhat are we and where and to lay to rest those instincts of the unseen and infinite around it which tormented it like ghosts by day and night a sight ludicrous or pathetic according as it is looked on by a cynical or a human spirit  it is easy to call such a phenomenon absurd improbable  it is rather rational probable say certain to happen  rational i say for the reason of man tells him and has always told him that he is a supernatural being if by nature is meant that which is cognisable by his five senses that his coming into this world his relation to it his exit from itwhich are the three most important facts about himare supernatural not to be explained by any deductions from the impressions of his senses  and i make bold to say that the recent discoveries of physical sciencenotably those of embryologygo only to justify that old and general belief of man  if man be told that the microscope and scalpel show no difference in the first stage of visible existence between him and the lower mammals then he has a right to answeras he will answerso much the worse for the microscope and scalpel so much the better for my old belief that there is beneath my birth life death a substratum of supernatural causes imponderable invisible unknowable by any physical science whatsoever  if you cannot render me a reason how i came hither and what i am i must go to those who will render me one  and if that craving be not satisfied by a rational theory of life it will demand satisfaction from some magical theory as did the mind of the eighteenth century when revolting from materialism it fled to magic to explain the everastounding miracle of life  the old regime  will our age in its turn ever be spoken of as an old regime  will it ever be spoken of as a regime at all as an organised orderly system of society and polity and not merely as a chaos an anarchy a transitory struggle of which the moneylender has been the real guide and lord  but at least it will be spoken of as an age of progress of rapid developments of astonishing discoveries  are you so sure of that  there was an age of progress once  but what is our agewhat is all which has befallen since 1815save afterswells of that great storm which are weakening and lulling into heavy calm  are we on the eve of stagnation  of a long check to the human intellect  of a new byzantine era in which little men will discuss and ape the deeds which great men did in their forefathers days  what progressit is a question which some will receive with almost angry surprisewhat progress has the human mind made since 1815  if the thought be startling do me the great honour of taking it home and verifying for yourselves its truth or its falsehood  i do not say that it is altogether true  no proposition concerning human things stated so broadly can be  but see for yourselves whether it is not at least more true than false whether the ideas the discoveries of which we boast most in the nineteenth century are not really due to the end of the eighteenth  whether other men did not labour and we have only entered into their labours  whether our positivist spirit our content with the collecting of facts our dread of vast theories is not a symptomwholesome prudent modest but still a symptomof our consciousness that we are not as our grandfathers were that we can no longer conceive great ideas which illumine for good or evil the whole mind and heart of man and drive him on to dare and suffer desperately  railroads  electric telegraphs  all honour to them in their place but they are not progress they are only the fruits of past progress  no outward and material thing is progress no machinery causes progress it merely spreads and makes popular the results of progress  progress is inward of the soul  and therefore improved constitutions and improved book instructionnow miscalled educationare not progress they are at best only fruits and signs thereof  for they are outward material and progress i say is inward  the selfhelp and selfdetermination of the independent soulthat is the root of progress and the more human beings who have that the more progress there is in the world  give me a man who though he can neither read nor write yet dares think for himself and do the thing he believes that man will help forward the human race more than any thousand men who have read or written either a thousand books apiece but have not dared to think for themselves  and better for his race and better i believe in the sight of god the confusions and mistakes of that one sincere brave man than the secondhand and cowardly correctness of all the thousand  as for the triumphs of science let us honour with astonishment and awe the genius of those who invented them but let us remember that the things themselves are as a gun or a sword with which we can kill our enemy but with which also our enemy can kill us  like all outward and material things they are equally fit for good and for evil  in england herethey have been as yet as far as i can see nothing but blessings but i have my very serious doubts whether they are likely to be blessings to the whole human race for

impotent  all all outward things be sure of it are good or evil exactly as far as they are in the hands of good men or of bad  moreover paradoxical as it may seem railroads and telegraphs instead of inaugurating an era of progress may possibly only retard it  rester sur un grand succes which was rossinis advice to a young singer who had achieved a triumph is a maxim which the world often follows not only from prudence but from necessity  they have done so much that it seems neither prudent nor possible to do more  they will rest and be thankful  thus gunpowder and printing made rapid changes enough but those changes had no farther development  the new art of war the new art of literature remained stationary or rather receded and degenerated till the end of the eighteenth century  and so it may be with our means of locomotion and intercommunion and what depends on them  the vast and unprecedented amount of capital of social interest of actual human intellect investedi may say locked upin these railroads and telegraphs and other triumphs of industry and science will not enter into competition against themselves  they will not set themselves free to seek new discoveries in directions which are often actually opposed to their own always foreign to it  if the money of thousands are locked up in these great works the brains of hundreds of thousands and of the very shrewdest too are equally locked up therein likewise and are to be subtracted from the gross material of social development and added without personal fault of their owners who may be very good men to the dead weight of vested selfishness ignorance and dislike of change  yes  a byzantine and stationary age is possible yet  perhaps we are now entering upon it an age in which mankind shall be satisfied with the triumphs of science and shall look merely to the greatest comfort call it not happiness of the greatest number and like the debased jews of old having found the life of their hand be therewith content no matter in what mudhole of slavery and superstition  but one hope there is and more than a hopeone certainty that however satisfied enlightened public opinion may become with the results of science and the progress of the human race there will be always a more enlightened private opinion or opinions which will not be satisfied therewith at all a few men of genius a few children of light it may be a few persecuted and a few martyrs for new truths who will wish the world not to rest and be thankful but to be discontented with itself ashamed of itself striving and toiling upward without present hope of gain till it has reached that unknown goal which bacon saw afar off and like all other heroes died in faith not having received the promises but seeking still a polity which has foundations whose builder and maker is god  these will be the men of science whether physical or spiritual  not merely the men who utilise and apply that which is known useful as they plainly are but the men who themselves discover that which was unknown and are generally deemed useless if not hurtful to their race  they will keep the sacred lamp burning unobserved in quiet studies while all the world is gazing only at the gaslights flaring in the street  they will pass that lamp on from hand to hand modestly almost stealthily till the day comes round again when the obscure student shall be discovered once more to be as he has always been the strongest man on earth  for they follow a mistress whose footsteps may often slip yet never fall for she walks forward on the eternal facts of nature which are the acted will of god  a giantess she is young indeed but humble as yet cautious and modest beyond her years  she is accused of trying to scale olympus by some who fancy that they have already scaled it themselves and will of course brook no rival in their fancied monopoly of wisdom  the accusation i believe is unjust  and yet science may scale olympus after all  without intending it almost without knowing it she may find herself hereafter upon a summit of which she never dreamed surveying the universe of god in the light of him who made it and her and remakes them both for ever and ever  on that summit she may stand hereafter if only she goes on as she goes now in humility and in patience doing the duty which lies nearest her lured along the upward road not by ambition vanity or greed but by reverent curiosity for every new pebble and flower and child and savage around her feet     footnotes   1  mr h reeves translation of de tocquevilles france
