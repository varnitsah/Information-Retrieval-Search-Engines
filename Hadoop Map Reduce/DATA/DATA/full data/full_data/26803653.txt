26803653	the bickerstaffpartridge papers  by jonathan swift   jonathan swift et al the bickerstaffpartridge papers etc annus mirabilis     predictions for the year 1708   wherein the month and day of the month are set down the persons named and the great actions and events of next year particularly related as will come to pass  written to prevent the people of england from being farther imposed on by vulgar almanackmakers  by isaac bickerstaff esq   i have long considerd the gross abuse of astrology in this kingdom and upon debating the matter with myself i could not possibly lay the fault upon the art but upon those gross impostors who set up to be the artists i know several learned men have contended that the whole is a cheat that it is absurd and ridiculous to imagine the stars can have any influence at all upon human actions thoughts or inclinations and whoever has not bent his studies that way may be excused for thinking so when he sees in how wretched a manner that noble art is treated by a few mean illiterate traders between us and the stars who import a yearly stock of nonsense lyes folly and impertinence which they offer to the world as genuine from the planets tho they descend from no greater a height than their own brains  i intend in a short time to publish a large and rational defence of this art and therefore shall say no more in its justification at present than that it hath been in all ages defended by many learned men and among the rest by socrates himself whom i look upon as undoubtedly the wisest of uninspird mortals to which if we add that those who have condemned this art though otherwise learned having been such as either did not apply their studies this way or at least did not succeed in their applications their testimony will not be of much weight to its disadvantage since they are liable to the common objection of condemning what they did not understand  nor am i at all offended or think it an injury to the art when i see the common dealers in it the students in astrology the philomaths and the rest of that tribe treated by wise men with the utmost scorn and contempt but rather wonder when i observe gentlemen in the country rich enough to serve the nation in parliament poring in partridges almanack to find out the events of the year at home and abroad not daring to propose a huntingmatch till gadbury or he have fixed the weather  i will allow either of the two i have mentioned or any other of the fraternity to be not only astrologers but conjurers too if i do not produce a hundred instances in all their almanacks to convince any reasonable man that they do not so much as understand common grammar and syntax that they are not able to spell any word out of the usual road nor even in their prefaces write common sense or intelligible english then for their observations and predictions they are such as will equally suit any age or country in the world this month a certain great person will be threatened with death or sickness this the newspapers will tell them for there we find at the end of the year that no month passes without the death of some person of note and it would be hard if it should be otherwise when there are at least two thousand persons of not in this kingdom many of them old and the almanackmaker has the liberty of chusing the sickliest season of the year where he may fix his prediction again this month an eminent clergyman will be preferrd of which there may be some hundreds half of them with one foot in the grave then such a planet in such a house shews great machinations plots and conspiracies that may in time be brought to light after which if we hear of any discovery the astrologer gets the honour if not his prediction still stands good and at last god preserve king william from all his open and secret enemies amen when if the king should happen to have died the astrologer plainly foretold it otherwise it passes but for the pious ejaculation of a loyal subject though it unluckily happend in some of their almanacks that poor king william was prayd for many months after he was dead because it fell out that he died about the beginning of the year  to mention no more of their impertinent predictions what have we to do with their advertisements about pills and drink for the venereal disease or their mutual quarrels in verse and prose of whig and tory wherewith the stars have little to do  having long observed and lamented these and a hundred other abuses of this art too tedious to repeat i resolved to proceed in a new way which i doubt not will be to the general satisfaction of the kingdom i can this year produce but a specimen of what i design for the future having employd most part of my time in adjusting and correcting the calculations i made some years past because i would offer nothing to the world of which i am not as fully satisfied as that i am now alive for these two last years i have not failed in above one or two particulars and those of no very great moment i exactly foretold the miscarriage at toulon with all its particulars and the loss of admiral shovel tho i was mistaken as to the day placing that accident about thirtysix hours sooner than it happend but upon reviewing my schemes i quickly found the cause of that error i likewise foretold the battle of almanza to the very day and hour with the loss on both sides and the consequences thereof all which i shewed to some friends many months before they happened that is i gave them papers sealed up to open at such a time after which they were at liberty to read them and there they found my predictions true in every article except one or two very minute  as for the few following predictions i now offer the world i forbore to publish them till i had perused the several almanacks for the year we are now enterd on i find them in all the usual strain and i beg the reader will compare their manner with mine and here i make bold to tell the world that i lay the whole credit of my art upon the truth of these predictions and i will be content that partridge and the rest of his clan may hoot me for a cheat and impostor if i fail in any singular particular of moment i believe any man who reads this paper will look upon me to be at least a person of as much honesty and understanding as a common maker of almanacks i do not lurk in the dark i am not wholly unknown in the world i have set my name at length to be a mark of infamy to mankind if they shall find i deceive them  in one thing i must desire to be forgiven that i talk more sparingly of homeaffairs as it will be imprudence to discover secrets of state so it would be dangerous to my person but in smaller matters and that are not of publick consequence i shall be very free and the truth of my conjectures will as much appear from those as the other as for the most signal events abroad in france flanders italy and spain i shall make no scruple to predict them in plain terms some of them are of importance and i hope i shall seldom mistake the day they will happen therefore i think good to inform the reader that i all along make use of the old style observed in england which i desire he will compare with that of the newspapers at the time they relate the actions i mention  i must add one word more i know it hath been the opinion of several of the learned who think well enough of the true art of astrology that the stars do only incline and not force the actions or wills of men and therefore however i may proceed by right rules yet i cannot in prudence so confidently assure the events will follow exactly as i predict them  i hope i have maturely considered this objection which in some cases is of no little weight for example a man may by the influence of an overruling planet be disposed or inclined to lust rage or avarice and yet by the force of reason overcome that bad influence and this was the case of socrates but as the great events of the world usually depend upon numbers of men it cannot be expected they should all unite to cross their inclinations from pursuing a general design wherein they unanimously agree besides the influence of the stars reaches to many actions and events which are not any way in the power of reason as sickness death and what we commonly call accidents with many more needless to repeat  but now it is time to proceed to my predictions which i have begun to calculate from the time that the sun enters into aries and this i take to be properly the beginning of the natural year i pursue them to the time that he enters libra or somewhat more which is the busy period of the year the remainder i have not yet adjusted upon account of several impediments needless here to mention besides i must remind the reader again that this is but a specimen of what i design in succeeding years to treat more at large if i may have liberty and encouragement  my first prediction is but a trifle yet i will mention it to show how ignorant those sottish pretenders to astrology are in their own concerns it relates to partridge the almanackmaker i have consulted the stars of his nativity by my own rules and find he will infallibly die upon the 29th of march next about eleven at night of a raging fever therefore i advise him to consider of it and settle his affairs in time  the month of april will be observable for the death of many great persons on the 4th will die the cardinal de noailles archbishop of paris on the 11th the young prince of asturias son to the duke of anjou on the 14th a great peer of this realm will die at his countryhouse on the 19th an old layman of great fame for learning and on the 23rd an eminent goldsmith in lombardstreet i could mention others both at home and abroad if i did not consider it is of very little use or instruction to the reader or to the world  as to publick affairs on the 7th of this month there will be an insurrection in dauphine occasiond by the oppressions of the people which will not be quieted in some months  on the 15th will be a violent storm on the southeast coast of france which will destroy many of their ships and some in the very harbour  the 19th will be famous for the revolt of a whole province or kingdom excepting one city by which the affairs of a certain prince in the alliance will take a better face  may against common conjectures will be no very busy month in europe but very signal for the death of the dauphin which will happen on the 7th after a short fit of sickness and grievous torments with the strangury he dies less lamented by the court than the kingdom  on the 9th a mareschal of france will break his leg by a fall from his horse i have not been able to discover whether he will then die or not  on the 11th will begin a most important siege which the eyes of all europe will be upon i cannot be more particular for in relating affairs that so nearly concern the confederates and consequently this kingdom i am forced to confine myself for several reasons very obvious to the reader  on the 15th news will arrive of a very surprizing event than which nothing could be more unexpected  on the 19th three noble ladies of this kingdom will against all expectation prove with child to the great joy of their husbands  on the 23rd a famous buffoon of the playhouse will die a ridiculous death suitable to his vocation  june this month will be distinguishd at home by the utter dispersing of those ridiculous deluded enthusiasts commonly calld the prophets occasiond chiefly by seeing the time come that many of their prophecies should be fulfilld and then finding themselves deceivd by contrary events it is indeed to be admird how any deceiver can be so weak to foretel things near at hand when a very few months must of necessity discover the impostor to all the world in this point less prudent than common almanackmakers who are so wise to wonder in generals and talk dubiously and leave to the reader the business of interpreting  on the 1st of this month a french general will be killed by a random shot of a cannonball  on the 6th a fire will break out in the suburbs of paris which will destroy above a thousand houses and seems to be the foreboding of what will happen to the surprize of all europe about the end of the following month  on the 10th a great battle will be fought which will begin at four of the clock in the afternoon and last till nine at night with great obstinacy but no very decisive event i shall not name the place for the reasons aforesaid but the commanders on each left wing will be killedi see bonfires and hear the noise of guns for a victory  on the 14th there will be a false report of the french kings death  on the 20th cardinal portocarero will die of a dysentery with great suspicion of poison but the report of his intention to revolt to king charles will prove false  july the 6th of this month a certain general will by a glorious action recover the reputation he lost by former misfortunes  on the 12th a great commander will die a prisoner in the hands of his enemies  on the 14th a shameful discovery will be made of a french jesuit giving poison to a great foreign general and when he is put to the torture will make wonderful discoveries  in short this will prove a month of great action if i might have liberty to relate the particulars  at home the death of an old famous senator will happen on the 15th at his countryhouse worn with age and diseases  but that which will make this month memorable to all posterity is the death of the french king lewis the fourteenth after a weeks sickness at marli which will happen on the 29th about six oclock in the evening it seems to be an effect of the gout in his stomach followed by a flux and in three days after monsieur chamillard will follow his master dying suddenly of an appoplexy  in this month likewise an ambassador will die in london but i cannot assign the day  august the affairs of france will seem to suffer no change for a while under the duke of burgundys administration but the genius that animated the whole machine being gone will be the cause of mighty turns and revolutions in the following year the new king makes yet little change either in the army or the ministry but the libels against his grandfather that fly about his very court give him uneasiness  i see an express in mighty haste with joy and wonder in his looks arriving by break of day on the 26th of this month having travelld in three days a prodigious journey by land and sea in the evening i hear bells and guns and see the blazing of a thousand bonfires  a young admiral of noble birth does likewise this month gain immortal honour by a great achievement  the affairs of poland are this month entirely settled augustus resigns his pretensions which he had again taken up for some time stanislaus is peaceably possessd of the throne and the king of sweden declares for the emperor  i cannot omit one particular accident here at home that near the end of this month much mischief will be done at bartholomew fair by the fall of a booth  september this month begins with a very surprizing fit of frosty weather which will last near twelve days  the pope having long languishd last month the swellings in his legs breaking and the flesh mortifying will die on the 11th instant and in three weeks time after a mighty contest be succeeded by a cardinal of the imperial faction but native of tuscany who is now about sixtyone years old  the french army acts now wholly on the defensive strongly fortifyd in their trenches and the young french king sends overtures for a treaty of peace by the duke of mantua which because it is a matter of state that concerns us here at home i shall speak no farther of it  i shall add but one prediction more and that in mystical terms which shall be included in a verse out of virgil  alter erit jam tethys  altera quae vehat argo delectos heroas  upon the 25th day of this month the fulfilling of this prediction will be manifest to every body  this is the farthest i have proceeded in my calculations for the present year i do not pretend that these are all the great events which will happen in this period but that those i have set down will infallibly come to pass it will perhaps still be objected why i have not spoke more particularly of affairs at home or of the success of our armies abroad which i might and could very largely have done but those in power have wisely discouraged men from meddling in publick concerns and i was resolvd by no means to give the least offence this i will venture to say that it will be a glorious campaign for the allies wherein the english forces both by sea and land will have their full share of honour that her majesty queen anne will continue in health and prosperity and that no ill accident will arrive to any of the chief ministry  as to the particular events i have mentiond the readers may judge by the fulfilling of em whether i am on the level with common astrologers who with an old paultry cant and a few pothook for planets to amuse the vulgar have in my opinion too long been sufferd to abuse the world but an honest physician ought not to be despisd because there are such things as mountebanks i hope i have some share of reputation which i would not willingly forfeit for a frolick or humour and i believe no gentleman who reads this paper will look upon it to be of the same cast or mould with the common scribblers that are every day hawkd about my fortune has placed me above the little regard of scribbling for a few pence which i neither value or want therefore let no wise men too hastily condemn this essay intended for a good design to cultivate and improve an ancient art long in disgrace by having fallen into mean and unskilful hands a little time will determine whether i have deceived others or myself and i think it is no very unreasonable request that men would please to suspend their judgments till then i was once of the opinion with those who despise all predictions from the stars till the year 1686 a man of quality shewd me written in his album that the most learned astronomer captain h assured him he would never believe any thing of the stars influence if there were not a great revolution in england in the year 1688 since that time i began to have other thoughts and after eighteen years diligent study and application i think i have no reason to repent of my pains i shall detain the reader no longer than to let him know that the account i design to give of next years events shall take in the principal affairs that happen in europe and if i be denied the liberty of offering it to my own country i shall appeal to the learned world by publishing it in latin and giving order to have it printed in holland        the accomplishment of the first of mr bickerstaffs predictions  being an account of the death of mr partridge the almanackmaker upon the 29th instant  in a letter to a person of honour written in the year 1708  my lord  in obedience to your lordships commands as well as to satisfy my own curiosity i have for some days past enquired constantly after partridge the almanackmaker of whom it was foretold in mr bickerstaffs predictions publishd about a month ago that he should die on the 29th instant about eleven at night of a raging fever i had some sort of knowledge of him when i was employd in the revenue because he used every year to present me with his almanack as he did other gentlemen upon the score of some little gratuity we gave him i saw him accidentally once or twice about ten days before he died and observed he began very much to droop and languish tho i hear his friends did not seem to apprehend him in any danger about two or three days ago he grew ill and was confind first to his chamber and in a few hours after to his bed where dr case and mrs kirleus were sent for to visit and to prescribe to him upon this intelligence i sent thrice every day one servant or other to enquire after his health and yesterday about four in the afternoon word was brought me that he was past hopes upon which i prevailed with myself to go and see him partly out of commiseration and i confess partly out of curiosity he knew me very well seemd surprizd at my condescension and made me compliments upon it as well as he could in the condition he was the people about him said he had been for some time delirious but when i saw him he had his understanding as well as ever i knew and spake strong and hearty without any seeming uneasiness or constraint after i told him how sorry i was to see him in those melancholy circumstances and said some other civilities suitable to the occasion i desired him to tell me freely and ingeniously whether the predictions mr bickerstaff had publishd relating to his death had not too much affected and worked on his imagination he confessd he had often had it in his head but never with much apprehension till about a fortnight before since which time it had the perpetual possession of his mind and thoughts and he did verily believe was the true natural cause of his present distemper for said he i am thoroughly persuaded and i think i have very good reasons that mr bickerstaff spoke altogether by guess and knew no more what will happen this year than i did myself i told him his discourse surprized me and i would be glad he were in a state of health to be able to tell me what reason he had to be convincd of mr bickerstaffs ignorance he replyd i am a poor ignorant fellow bred to a mean trade yet i have sense enough to know that all pretences of foretelling by astrology are deceits for this manifest reason because the wise and the learned who can only know whether there be any truth in this science do all unanimously agree to laugh at and despise it and none but the poor ignorant vulgar give it any credit and that only upon the word of such silly wretches as i and my fellows who can hardly write or read i then asked him why he had not calculated his own nativity to see whether it agreed with bickerstaffs prediction at which he shook his head and said oh sir this is no time for jesting but for repenting those fooleries as i do now from the very bottom of my heart by what i can gather from you said i the observations and predictions you printed with your almanacks were mere impositions on the people he replyd if it were otherwise i should have the less to answer for we have a common form for all those things as to foretelling the weather we never meddle with that but leave it to the printer who takes it out of any old almanack as he thinks fit the rest was my own invention to make my almanack sell having a wife to maintain and no other way to get my bread for mending old shoes is a poor livelihood and added he sighing i wish i may not have done more mischief by my physick than my astrology tho i had some good receipts from my grandmother and my own compositions were such as i thought could at least do no hurt  i had some other discourse with him which now i cannot call to mind and i fear i have already tired your lordship i shall only add one circumstance that on his deathbed he declared himself a nonconformist and had a fanatick preacher to be his spiritual guide after half an hours conversation i took my leave being half stifled by the closeness of the room i imagine he could not hold out long and therefore withdrew to a little coffeehouse hard by leaving a servant at the house with orders to come immediately and tell me as near as he could the minute when partridge should expire which was not above two hours after when looking upon my watch i found it to be above five minutes after seven by which it is clear that mr bickerstaff was mistaken almost four hours in his calculation in the other circumstances he was exact enough but whether he has not been the cause of this poor mans death as well as the predictor may be very reasonably disputed however it must be confessd the matter is odd enough whether we should endeavour to account for it by chance or the effect of imagination for my own part tho i believe no man has less faith in these matters yet i shall wait with some impatience and not without some expectation the fulfilling of mr bickerstaffs second prediction that the cardinal de noailles is to die upon the fourth of april and if that should be verified as exactly as this of poor partridge i must own i should be wholly surprized and at a loss and should infallibly expect the accomplishment of all the rest        an elegy on the supposed death of partridge the almanackmaker            well tis as bickerstaff has guessd           tho we all took it for a jest           partridge is dead nay more he dyd           ere he could prove the good squire lyd           strange an astrologer shoud die           without one wonder in the sky           not one of all his crony stars           to pay their duty at his herse           no meteor no eclipse appeard           no comet with a flaming beard           the sun has rose and gone to bed           just as if partridge were not dead           nor hid himself behind the moon           to make a dreadful night at noon           he at fit periods walks through aries           howeer our earthly motion varies           and twice a year hell cut th equator           as if there had been no such matter            some wits have wonderd what analogy           there is twixt cobbling and astrology           how partridge made his optics rise           from a shoesole to reach the skies            a list of coblers temples ties           to keep the hair out of their eyes           from whence tis plain the diadem           that princes wear derives from them           and therefore crowns are nowadays           adornd with golden stars and rays           which plainly shews the near alliance           twixt cobling and the planets science            besides that slowpacd sign bootes           as tis miscalld we know not who tis           but partridge ended all disputes           he knew his trade and calld it boots            the horned moon which heretofore           upon their shoes the romans wore           whose wideness kept their toes from corns           and whence we claim our shooinghorns           shows how the art of cobling bears           a near resemblance to the spheres            a scrap of parchment hung by geometry           a great refinement in barometry           can like the stars foretel the weather           and what is parchment else but leather           which an astrologer might use           either for almanacks or shoes            thus partridge by his wit and parts           at once did practise both these arts           and as the boading owl or rather           the bat because her wings are leather           steals from her private cell by night           and flies about the candlelight           so learned partridge could as well           creep in the dark from leathern cell           and in his fancy fly as fair           to peep upon a twinkling star            besides he could confound the spheres           and set the planets by the ears           to shew his skill he mars could join           to venus in aspect malin           then call in mercury for aid           and cure the wounds that venus made            great scholars have in lucian read           when philip king of greece was dead           his soul and spirit did divide           and each part took a diffrent side           one rose a star the other fell           beneath and mended shoes in hell            thus partridge still shines in each art           the cobling and stargazing part           and is installd as good a star           as any of the caesars are            triumphant star some pity shew           on coblers militant below           whom roguish boys in stormy nights           torment by pissing out their lights           or thro a chink convey their smoke           inclosd artificers to choke            thou high exalted in thy sphere           mayst follow still thy calling there           to thee the bull will lend his hide           by phoebus newly tannd and dryd           for thee they argos hulk will tax

  as he himself could when above        partridges reply  squire bickerstaff detected or the astrological impostor convicted  by john partridge student in physick and astrology  it is hard my dear countrymen of these united nations it is very hard that a briton born a protestant astrologer a man of revolution principles an assertor of the liberty and property of the people should cry out in vain for justice against a frenchman a papist an illiterate pretender to science that would blast my reputation most inhumanly bury me alive and defraud my native country of those services that in my double capacity i daily offer to the publick  what great provocations i have receivd let the impartial reader judge and how unwillingly even in my own defence i now enter the lists against falsehood ignorance and envy but i am exasperated at length to drag out this cacus from the den of obscurity where he lurks detect him by the light of those stars he has so impudently traduced and shew theres not a monster in the skies so pernicious and malevolent to mankind as an ignorant pretender to physick and astrology i shall not directly fall on the many gross errors nor expose the notorious absurdities of this prostituted libeller till i have let the learned world fairly into the controversy depending and then leave the unprejudiced to judge of the merits and justice of the cause  it was towards the conclusion of the year 1707 when an impudent pamphlet crept into the world intituled predictions etc by isaac bickerstaff esqamongst the many arrogant assertions laid down by that lying spirit of divination he was pleasd to pitch on the cardinal de noailles and myself among many other eminent and illustrious persons that were to die within the compass of the ensuing year and peremptorily fixes the month day and hour of our deaths this i think is sporting with great men and publick spirits to the scandal of religion and reproach of power and if sovereign princes and astrologers must make diversion for the vulgar why then farewel say i to all governments ecclesiastical and civil but i thank my better stars i am alive to confront this false and audacious predictor and to make him rue the hour he ever affronted a man of science and resentment the cardinal may take what measures he pleases with him as his excellency is a foreigner and a papist he has no reason to rely on me for his justification i shall only assure the world he is alive but as he was bred to letters and is master of a pen let him use it in his own defence in the mean time i shall present the publick with a faithful narrative of the ungenerous treatment and hard usage i have received from the virulent papers and malicious practices of this pretended astrologer  a true and impartial account of the proceedings of isaac bickerstaff esq against me  the 28th of march anno dom 1708 being the night this shamprophet had so impudently fixd for my last which made little impression on myself but i cannot answer for my whole family for my wife with a concern more than usual prevailed on me to take somewhat to sweat for a cold and between the hours of eight and nine to go to bed the maid as she was warming my bed with a curiosity natural to young wenches runs to the window and asks of one passing the street who the bell tolld for dr partridge says he that famous almanackmaker who died suddenly this evening the poor girl provoked told him he lyd like a rascal the other very sedately replyd the sexton had so informed him and if false he was to blame for imposing upon a stranger she asked a second and a third as they passed and every one was in the same tone now i dont say these are accomplices to a certain astrological squire and that one bickerstaff might be sauntring thereabouts because i will assert nothing here but what i dare attest and plain matter of fact my wife at this fell into a violent disorder and i must own i was a little discomposed at the oddness of the accident in the mean time one knocks at my door betty runs down and opening finds a sober grave person who modestly enquires if this was dr partridges she taking him for some cautious citypatient that came at that time for privacy shews him into the dining room as soon as i could compose myself i went to him and was surprized to find my gentleman mounted on a table with a twofoot rule in his hand measuring my walls and taking the dimensions of the room pray sir says i not to interrupt you have you any business with me only sir replies he order the girl to bring me a better light for this is but a very dim one sir says i my name is partridge oh the doctors brother belike cries he the staircase i believe and these two apartments hung in close mourning will be sufficient and only a strip of bays round the other rooms the doctor must needs die rich he had great dealings in his way for many years if he had no family coat you had as good use the escutcheons of the company they are as showish and will look as magnificent as if he was descended from the blood royal with that i assumed a great air of authority and demanded who employd him or how he came there why i was sent sir by the company of undertakers says he and they were employed by the honest gentleman who is executor to the good doctor departed and our rascally porter i believe is fallen fast asleep with the black cloth and sconces or he had been here and we might have been tacking up by this time sir says i pray be advisd by a friend and make the best of your speed out of my doors for i hear my wifes voice which by the by is pretty distinguishable and in that corner of the room stands a good cudgel which somebody has felt ere now if that light in her hands and she know the business you come about without consulting the stars i can assure you it will be employed very much to the detriment of your person sir cries he bowing with great civility i perceive extreme grief for the loss of the doctor disorders you a little at present but early in the morning ill wait on you with all necessary materials now i mention no mr bickerstaff nor do i say that a certain stargazing squire has been playing my executor before his time but i leave the world to judge and if he puts things and things fairly together it wont be much wide of the mark  well once more i got my doors closd and prepard for bed in hopes of a little repose after so many ruffling adventures just as i was putting out my light in order to it another bounces as hard as he can knock i open the window and ask whos there and what he wants i am ned the sexton replies he and come to know whether the doctor left any orders for a funeral sermon and where he is to be laid and whether his grave is to be plain or bricked why sirrah says i you know me well enough you know i am not dead and how dare you affront me in this manner alackaday replies the fellow why tis in print and the whole town knows you are dead why theres mr white the joiner is but fitting screws to your coffin hell be here with it in an instant he was afraid you would have wanted it before this time sirrah sirrah says i you shall know tomorrow to your cost that i am alive and alive like to be why tis strange sir says he you should make such a secret of your death to us that are your neighbours it looks as if you had a design to defraud the church of its dues and let me tell you for one that has lived so long by the heavens thats unhandsomely done hist hist says another rogue that stood by him away doctor in your flannel gear as fast as you can for heres a whole pack of dismals coming to you with their black equipage and how indecent will it look for you to stand frightning folks at your window when you should have been in your coffin this three hours in short what with undertakers imbalmers joiners sextons and your damnd elegy hawkers upon a late practitioner in physick and astrology i got not one wink of sleep that night nor scarce a moments rest ever since now i doubt not but this villainous squire has the impudence to assert that these are entirely strangers to him he good man knows nothing of the matter and honest isaac bickerstaff i warrant you is more a man of honour than to be an accomplice with a pack of rascals that walk the streets on nights and disturb good people in their beds but he is out if he thinks the whole world is blind for there is one john partridge can smell a knave as far as grubstreettho he lies in the most exalted garret and writes himself squire  but ill keep my temper and proceed in the narration  i could not stir out of doors for the space of three months after this but presently one comes up to me in the street mr partridge that coffin you was last buried in i have not been yet paid for doctor cries another dog how dye think people can live by making of graves for nothing next time you die you may een toll out the bell yourself for ned a third rogue tips me by the elbow and wonders how i have the conscience to sneak abroad without paying my funeral expences lord says one i durst have swore that was honest dr partridge my old friend but poor man he is gone i beg your pardon says another you look so like my old acquaintance that i used to consult on some private occasions but alack hes gone the way of all flesh look look look cries a third after a competent space of staring at me would not one think our neighbour the almanackmaker was crept out of his grave to take tother peep at the stars in this world and shew how much he is improvd in fortunetelling by having taken a journey to the other  nay the very reader of our parish a good sober discreet person has sent two or three times for me to come and be buried decently or send him sufficient reasons to the contrary if i have been interrd in any other parish to produce my certificate as the act requires my poor wife is almost run distracted with being called widow partridge when she knows its false and once a term she is cited into the court to take out letters of administration but the greatest grievance is a paultry quack that takes up my calling just under my nose and in his printed directions with nb says he lives in the house of the late ingenious mr john partridge an eminent practitioner in leather physick and astrology  but to show how far the wicked spirit of envy malice and resentment can hurry some men my nameless old persecutor had provided me a monument at the stonecutters and would have erected it in the parishchurch and this piece of notorious and expensive villany had actually succeeded had i not used my utmost interest with the vestry where it was carried at last but by two voices that i am still alive that stratagem failing out comes a long sable elegy bedeckd with hourglasses mattocks sculls spades and skeletons with an epitaph as confidently written to abuse me and my profession as if i had been under ground these twenty years  and after such barbarous treatment as this can the world blame me when i ask what is become of the freedom of an englishman and where is the liberty and property that my old glorious friend came over to assert we have drove popery out of the nation and sent slavery to foreign climes the arts only remain in bondage when a man of science and character shall be openly insulted in the midst of the many useful services he is daily paying to the publick was it ever heard even in turkey or algiers that a stateastrologer was banterd out of his life by an ignorant impostor or bawld out of the world by a pack of villanous deepmouthd hawkers though i print almanacks and publish advertisements though i produce certificates under the ministers and churchwardens hands i am alive and attest the same on oath at quartersessions out comes a full and true relation of the death and interment of john partridge truth is bore down attestations neglected the testimony of sober persons despised and a man is looked upon by his neighbours as if he had been seven years dead and is buried alive in the midst of his friends and acquaintance  now can any man of common sense think it consistent with the honour of my profession and not much beneath the dignity of a philosopher to stand bawling before his own door alive alive ho the famous dr partridge no counterfeit but all alive as if i had the twelve celestial monsters of the zodiac to shew within or was forced for a livelihood to turn retailer to may and bartholomew fairs therefore if her majesty would but graciously be pleased to think a hardship of this nature worthy her royal consideration and the next parliament in their great wisdom cast but an eye towards the deplorable case of their old philomath that annually bestows his poetical good wishes on them i am sure there is one isaac bickerstaff esq would soon be trussd up for his bloody predictions and putting good subjects in terror of their lives and that henceforward to murder a man by way of prophecy and bury him in a printed letter either to a lord or commoner shall as legally entitle him to the present possession of tyburn as if he robbd on the highway or cut your throat in bed  i shall demonstrate to the judicious that france and rome are at the bottom of this horrid conspiracy against me and that culprit aforesaid is a popish emissary has paid his visits to st germains and is now in the measures of lewis xiv that in attempting my reputation there is a general massacre of learning designed in these realms and through my sides there is a wound given to all the protestant almanackmakers in the universe  vivat regina        a vindication of isaac bickerstaff esq  against what is objected to him by mr partridge in his almanack for the present year 1709  by the said isaac bickerstaff esq  written in the year 1709  mr partridge hath been lately pleased to treat me after a very rough manner in that which is called his almanack for the present year such usage is very undecent from one gentleman to another and does not at all contribute to the discovery of truth which ought to be the great end in all disputes of the learned to call a man fool and villain and impudent fellow only for differing from him in a point meer speculative is in my humble opinion a very improper style for a person of his education i appeal to the learned world whether in my last years predictions i gave him the least provocation for such unworthy treatment philosophers have differed in all ages but the discreetest among them have always differed as became philosophers scurrility and passion in a controversy among scholars is just so much of nothing to the purpose and at best a tacit confession of a weak cause my concern is not so much for my own reputation as that of the republick of letters which mr partridge hath endeavoured to wound through my sides if men of publick spirit must be superciliously treated for their ingenious attempts how will true useful knowledge be ever advanced i wish mr partridge knew the thoughts which foreign universities have conceived of his ungenerous proceedings with me but i am too tender of his reputation to publish them to the world that spirit of envy and pride which blasts so many rising geniuss in our nation is yet unknown among professors abroad the necessity of justifying myself will excuse my vanity when i tell the reader that i have near a hundred honorary letters from several parts of europe some as far as muscovy in praise of my performance besides several others which as i have been credibly informed were opend in the postoffice and never sent me tis true the inquisition in portugal was pleased to burn my predictions and condem the author and readers of them but i hope at the same time it will be considerd in how deplorable a state learning lies at present in that kingdom and with the profoundest veneration for crownd heads i will presume to add that it a little concerned his majesty of portugal to interpose his authority in behalf of a scholar and a gentleman the subject of a nation with which he is now in so strict an alliance but the other kingdoms and states of europe have treated me with more candor and generosity if i had leave to print the latin letters transmitted to me from foreign parts they would fill a volume and be a full defence against all that mr partridge or his accomplices of the portugal inquisition will be able to object who by the way are the only enemies my predictions have ever met with at home or abroad but i hope i know better what is due to the honour of a learned correspondence in so tender a point yet some of those illustrious persons will perhaps excuse me from transcribing a passage or two in my own vindication the most learned monsieur leibnits thus addresses to me his third letter illustrissimo bickerstaffio astrologiae instauratori etc monsieur le clerc quoting my predictions in a treatise he published last year is pleased to say ita nuperrime bickerstaffius magnum illud angliae fidus another great professor writing of me has these words bickerstaffius nobilis anglus astrologorum hujusce saeculi facile princeps signior magliabecchi the great dukes famous librarykeeper spends almost his whole letter in compliments and praises tis true the renowned professor of astronomy at utrecht seems to differ from me in one article but it is in a modest manner that becomes a philosopher as pace tanti viri dixerim and pag55 he seems to lay the error upon the printer as indeed it ought and says vel forsan error typographi cum alioquin bickerstaffius ver doctissimus etc  if mr partridge had followed this example in the controversy between us he might have spared me the trouble of justifying myself in so publick a manner i believe few men are readier to own their errors than i or more thankful to those who will please to inform me of them but it seems this gentleman instead of encouraging the progress of his own art is pleased to look upon all attempts of that kind as an invasion of his province he has been indeed so wise to make no objection against the truth of my predictions except in one single point relating to himself and to demonstrate how much men are blinded by their own partiality i do solemnly assure the reader that he is the only person from whom i ever heard that objection offered which consideration alone i think will take off all its weight  with my utmost endeavours i have not been able to trace above two objections ever made against the truth of my last years prophecies the first was of a french man who was pleased to publish to the world that the cardinal de noailles was still alive notwithstanding the pretended prophecy of monsieur biquerstaffe but how far a frenchman a papist and an enemy is to be believed in his own case against an english protestant who is true to his government i shall leave to the candid and impartial reader  the other objection is the unhappy occasion of this discourse and relates to an article in my predictions which foretold the death of mr partridge to happen on march 29 1708 this he is pleased to contradict absolutely in the almanack he has published for the present year and in that ungentlemanly manner pardon the expression as i have above related in that work he very roundly asserts that he is not only now alive but was likewise alive upon that very 29th of march when i had foretold he should die this is the subject of the present controversy between us which i design to handle with all brevity perspicuity and calmness in this dispute i am sensible the eyes not only of england but of all europe will be upon us and the learned in every country will i doubt not take part on that side where they find most appearance of reason and truth  without entering into criticisms of chronology about the hour of his death i shall only prove that mr partridge is not alive and my first argument is thus above a thousand gentelmen having bought his almanacks for this year merely to find what he said against me at every line they read they would lift up their eyes and cry out betwixt rage and laughter they were sure no man alive ever writ such damnd stuff as this neither did i ever hear that opinion disputed so that mr partridge lies under a dilemma either of disowning his almanack or allowing himself to be no man alive but now if an uninformed carcase walks still about and is pleased to call itself partridge mr bickerstaff does not think himself any way answerable for that neither had the said carcase any right to beat the poor boy who happend to pass by it in the street crying a full and true account of dr partridges death etc  secondly mr partridge pretends to tell fortunes and recover stolen goods which all the parish says he must do by conversing with the devil and other evil spirits and no wise man will ever allow he could converse personally with either till after he was dead  thirdly i will plainly prove him to be dead out of his own almanack for this year and from the very passage which he produces to make us think him alive he there says he is not only now alive but was also alive on the very 29th of march which i foretold he should die on by this he declares his opinion that a man may be alive now who was not alive a twelvemonth ago and indeed there lies the sophistry of this argument he dares not assert he was alive ever since that 29th of march but that he is now alive and was so on that day i grant the latter for he did not die till night as appears by the printed account of his death in a letter to a lord and whether he is since revived i leave the world to judge this indeed is perfect cavilling and i am ashamed to dwell any longer upon it  fourthly i will appeal to mr partridge himself whether it be probable i could have been so indiscreet to begin my predictions with the only falsehood that ever was pretended to be in them and this in an affair at home where i had so many opportunities to be exact and must have given such advantages against me to a person of mr partridges wit and learning who if he could possibly have raised one single objection more against the truth of my prophecies would hardly have spared me  and here i must take occasion to reprove the above mentiond writer of the relation of mr partridges death in a letter to a lord who was pleased to tax me with a mistake of four whole hours in my calculation of that event i must confess this censure pronounced with an air of certainty in a matter that so nearly concerned me and by a grave judicious author moved me not a little but tho i was at that time out of town yet several of my friends whose curiosity had led them to be exactly informed for as to my own part having no doubt at all in the matter i never once thought of it assured me i computed to something under half an hour which i speak my private opinion is an error of no very great magnitude that men should raise a clamour about it i shall only say it would not be amiss if that author would henceforth be more tender of other mens reputations as well as his own it is well there were no more mistakes of that kind if there had i presume he would have told me of them with as little ceremony  there is one objection against mr partridges death which i have sometimes met with though indeed very slightly offered that he still continues to write almanacks but this is no more than what is common to all that profession gadbury poor robin dove wing and several others do yearly publish their almanacks though several of them have been dead since before the revolution now the natural reason of this i take to be that whereas it is the privilege of other authors to live after their deaths almanackmakers are alone excluded because their dissertations treating only upon the minutes as they pass become useless as those go off in consideration of which time whose registers they are gives them a lease in reversion to continue their works after their death  i should not have given the publick or myself the trouble of this vindication if my name had not been made use of by several persons to whom i never lent it one of which a few days ago was pleased to father on me a new sett of predictions but i think those are things too serious to be trifled with it grieved me to the heart when i saw my labours which had cost me so much thought and watching bawld about by common hawkers which i only intended for the weighty consideration of the gravest persons this prejudiced the world so much at first that several of my friends had the assurance to ask me whether i were in jest to which i only answered coldly that the event would shew but it is the talent of our age and nation to turn things of the greatest importance into ridicule when the end of the year had verified all my predictions out comes mr partridges almanack disputing the point of his death so that i am employed like the general who was forced to kill his enemies twice over whom a necromancer had raised to life if mr partridge has practised the same experiment upon himself and be again alive long may he continue so that does not in the least contradict my veracity but i think i have clearly proved by invincible demonstration that he died at farthest within half an hour of the time i foretold and not four hours sooner as the abovementioned author in his letter to a lord hath maliciously suggested with design to blast my credit by charging me with so gross a mistake        a famous prediction of merlin the british wizard  written above a thousand years ago and relating to the year 1709 with explanatory notes  last year was publishd a paper of predictions pretended to be written by one isaac bickerstaff esq but the true design of it was to ridicule the art of astrology and expose its professors as ignorant or impostors against this imputation dr partridge hath vindicated himself in his almanack for that year  for a farther vindication of this famous art i have thought fit to present the world with the following prophecy the original is said to be of the famous merlin who lived about a thousand years ago and the following translation is two hundred years old for it seems to be written near the end of henry the sevenths reign i found it in an old edition of merlins prophecies imprinted at london by john hawkins in the year 1530 page 39 i set it down word for word in the old orthography and shall take leave to subjoin a few explanatory notes            seven and ten addyd to nyne           of fraunce her woe this is the sygne           tamys rivere twys yfrozen           walke sans wetyng shoes ne hozen           then comyth foorthe ich understonde           from town of stoffe to farryn londe           an herdye chyftan woe the morne           to fraunce that evere he was born           than shall the fyshe beweyle his bosse           nor shall grin berrys make up the losse           yonge symnele shall again miscarrye           and norways pryd again shall marrye           and from the tree where blosums feele           ripe fruit shall come and all is wele           reaums shall daunce honde in honde           and it shall be merrye in old inglonde           then old inglonde shall be no more           and no man shall be sorre therefore           geryon shall have three hedes agayne           till hapsburge makyth them but twayne  explanatory notes  seven and ten this line describes the year when these events shall happen seven and ten makes seventeen which i explain seventeen hundred and this number added to nine makes the year we are now in for it must be understood of the natural year which begins the first of january  tamys rivere twys etc the river thames frozen twice in one year so as men to walk on it is a very signal accident which perhaps hath not fallen out for several hundred years before and is the reason why some astrologers have thought that this prophecy could never be fulfilled because they imagine such a thing would never happen in our climate  from town of stoffe etc this is a plain designation of the duke of marlborough one kind of stuff used to fatten land is called marle and every body knows that borough is a name for a town and this way of expression is after the usual dark manner of old astrological predictions  then shall the fyshe etc by the fish is understood the dauphin of france as their kings eldest sons are called tis here said he shall lament the loss of the duke of burgundy called the bosse which is an old english word for humpshoulder or crookback as that duke is known to be and the prophecy seems to mean that he should be overcome or slain by the green berrys in the next line is meant the young duke of berry the dauphins third son who shall not have valour or fortune enough to supply the loss of his eldest brother  yonge symnele etc by symnele is meant the pretended prince of wales who if he offers to attempt anything against england shall miscarry as he did before lambert symnele is the name of a young man noted in our histories for personating the son as i remember of edward the fourth  and norways pryd etc i cannot guess who is meant by norways pride perhaps the reader may as well as the sense of the two following lines  reaums shall etc reums or as the word is now realms is the old name for kingdoms and this is a very plain prediction of our happy union with the felicities that shall attend it it is added that old england shall be no more and yet no man shall be sorry for it and indeed properly speaking england is now no more for the whole island is one kingdom under the name of britain  geryon shall etc this prediction tho somewhat obscure is wonderfully adapt geryon is said to have been a king of spain whom hercules slew it was a fiction of the poets that he had three heads which the author says he shall have again that is spain shall have three kings which is now wonderfully verified for besides the king of portugal which properly is part of spain there are now two rivals for spain charles and philip but charles being descended fro the count of hapsburgh founder of the austrian family shall soon make those heads but two by overturning philip and driving him out of spain  some of these predictions are already fulfilled and it is highly probable the rest may be in due time and i think i have not forced the words by my explication into any other sense than what they will naturally bear if this be granted i am sure it must be also allowd that the author whoever he were was a person of extraordinary sagacity and that astrology brought to such perfection as this is by no means an art to be despised whatever mr bickerstaff or other merry gentlemen are pleased to think as to the tradition of these lines having been writ in the original by merlin i confess i lay not much weight upon it but it is enough to justify their authority that the book from whence i have transcribd them was printed 170 years ago as appears by the titlepage for the satisfaction of any gentleman who may be either doubtful of the truth or curious to be informd i shall give order to have the very book sent to the printer of this paper with directions to let anybody see it that pleases because i believe it is pretty scarce        dr john arbuthnot and alexander pope  annus mirabilis or the wonderful effects of the approaching conjunction of the planets jupiter mars and saturn  by mart scriblerus philomath  in nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas corpora  i suppose every body is sufficiently apprizd of and duly prepard for the famous conjunction to be celebrated the 29th of this instant december 1722 foretold by all the sages of antiquity under the name of the annus mirabilis or the metamorphostical conjunction a word which denotes the mutual transformation of sexes the effect of that configuration of the celestial bodies the human males being turnd into females and the human females into males  the egyptians have represented this great transformation by several significant hieroglyphicks particularly one very remarkable there are carvd upon an obelisk a barber and a midwife the barber delivers his razor to the midwife and she her swadlingcloaths to the barber accordingly thales milesius who like the rest of his countrymen borrowd his learning from the egyptians after having computed the time of this famous conjunction then says he shall men and women mutually exchange the pangs of shaving and childbearing  anaximander modestly describes this metamorphosis in mathematical terms then says he shall the negative quantity of the women be turnd into positive their  into  ie their minus into plus  plato not only speaks of this great change but describes all the preparations towards it long before the bodily transformation says he nature shall begin the most difficult part of her work by changing the ideas and inclinations of the two sexes men shall turn effeminate and women manly wives shall domineer and husbands obey ladies shall ride a horseback dressd like cavaliers princes and nobles appear in nightrails and petticoats men shall squeak upon theatres with female voices and women corrupt virgins lords shall knot and cut paper and even the northern people a greek phrase which for modestys sake i forbear to translate which denotes a vice too frequent amongst us  that the ministry foresaw this great change is plain from the callicoact whereby it is now become the occupation of women all over england to convert their useless female habits into beds windowcurtains chairs and jointstools undressing themselves as it were before their transformation  the philosophy of this transformation will not seem surprizing to people who search into the bottom of things madam bourignon a devout french lady has shewn us how man was at first created male and female in one individual having the faculty of propagation within himself a circumstance necessary to the state of innocence wherein a mans happiness was not to depend upon the caprice of another it was not till after he had made a faux pas that he had his female mate many such transformations of individuals have been well attested particularly one by montaigne and another by the late bishop of salisbury from all which it appears that this system of male and female has already undergone and may hereafter suffer several alterations every smatterer in anatomy knows that a woman is but an introverted man a new fusion and flatus will turn the hollow bottom of a bottle into a convexity but i forbear for the sake of my modest menreaders who are in a few days to be virgins  in some subjects the smallest alterations will do some men are sufficiently spread about the hips and contrivd with female softness that they want only the negative quantity to make them buxom wenches and there are women who are as it were already the ebauche of a good sturdy man if nature coud be puzzld it will be how to bestow the redundant matter of the exuberant bubbies that now appear about town or how to roll out the short dapper fellows into wellsizd women  this great conjunction will begin to operate on saturday the 29th instant accordingly about eight at night as senezino shall begin at the opera si videte he shall be observd to make an unusual motion upon which the audience will be affected with a red suffusion over their countenance and because a strong succession of the muscles of the belly is necessary towards performing this great operation both sexes will be thrown into a profuse involuntary laughter then to use the modest terms of anaximander shall negative quantity be turnd into positive etc time never beheld nor will it ever assemble such a number of untouchd virgins within those walls but alas such will be the impatience and curiosity of people to act in their new capacity that many of them will be compleated men and women that very night to prevent the disorders that may happen upon this occasion is the chief design of this paper  gentlemen have begun already to make use of this conjunction to compass their filthy purposes they tell the ladies forsooth that it is only parting with a perishable commodity hardly of so much value as a callico underpetticoat since like its mistress it will be useless in the form it is now in if the ladies have no regard to the dishonour and immorality of the action i desire they will consider that nature who never destroys her own productions will exempt bigbellyd women till the time of their lyingin so that not to be transformed will be the same as to be pregnant if they dont think it worth while to defend a fortress that is to be demolishd in a few days let them reflect that it will be a melancholy thing nine months hence to be brought to bed of a bastard a posthumous bastard as it were to which the quondam father can be no more than a dry nurse  this wonderful transformation is the instrument of nature to balance matters between the sexes the cruelty of scornful mistresses shall be returnd the slighted maid shall grow into an imperious gallant and reward her undoer with a big belly and a bastard  it is hardly possible to imagine the revolutions that this wonderful phaenomenon will occasion over the face of the earth i long impatiently to see the proceedings of the parliament of paris as to the title of succession to the crown this being a case not provided for by the salique law there will be no preventing disorders amongst friars and monks for certainly vows of chastity do not bind but under the sex in which they were made the same will hold good with marriages tho i think it will be a scandal amongst protestants for husbands and wives to part since there remains still a possibility to perform the debitus conjugale by the husband being femme couverte i submit it to the judgment of the gentlemen of the long robe whether this transformation does not discharge all suits of rapes  the pope must undergo a new groping but the false prophet mahomet has contrivd matters well for his successors for as the grand signior has now a great many fine women he will then have as many fine young gentelmen at his devotion  these are surprizing scenes but i beg leave to affirm that the solemn operations of nature are subjects of contemplation not of ridicule therefore i make it my earnest request to the merry fellows and giggling girls about town that they would not put themselves in a high twitter when they go to visit a general lyingin of his first child his officers serving as midwives nurses and rockers dispensing caudle or if they behold the reverend prelates dressing the heads and airing the linnen at court i beg they will remember that these offices must be filld with people of the greatest regularity and best characters for the same reason i am sorry that a certain prelate who notwithstanding his confinement in december 1723 still preserves his healthy chearful countenance cannot come in time to be a nurse at court  i likewise earnestly intreat the maids of honour then ensigns and captains of the guard that at their first setting out they have some regard to their former station and do not run wild through all the infamous houses about town that the present grooms of the bedchamber then maids of honour would not eat chalk and lime in their greensickness and in general that the men would remember they are become retromingent and not by inadvertency lift up against walls and posts  petticoats will not be burdensome to the clergy but balls and assemblies will be indecent for some time  as for you coquettes bawds and chambermaids the future ministers plenipotentiaries and cabinetcounsellors to the princes of the earth manage the great intrigues that will be committed to your charge with your usual secrecy and conduct and the affairs of your masters will go better than ever  o ye exchange women our right worshipful representatives that are to be be not so griping in the sale of your ware as your predecessors but consider that the nation like a spendthrift heir has run out be likewise a little more continent in your tongues than you are at present else the length of debates will spoil your dinners  you housewifely good women who not preside over the confectionary henceforth commissioners of the treasury be so good as to dispense the sugarplumbs of the government with a more impartial and frugal hand  ye prudes and censorious old maids the hopes of the bench exert but your usual talent of finding faults and the laws will be strictly executed only i would not have you proceed upon such slender evidences as you have done hitherto  it is from you eloquent oystermerchants of billingsgate just ready to be called to the bar and quoifd like your sisterserjants that we expect the shortening the time and lessening the expences of lawsuits for i think you are observd to bring your debates to a short issue and even custom will restrain you from taking the oyster and leaving only the shell to your client  o ye physicians who in the figure of old women are to clean the tripe in the markets scour it as effectually as you have done that of your patients and the town will fare most deliciously on saturdays  i cannot but congratulate human nature upon this happy transformation the only expedient left to restore the liberties and tranquillity of mankind this is so evident that it is almost an affront to common sense to insist upon the proof if there can be any such stupid creature as to doubt it i desire he will make but the following obvious reflection there are in europe alone at present about a million of sturdy fellows under the denomination of standing forces with arms in their hands that those are masters of the lives liberties and fortunes of all the rest i believe no body will deny it is no less true in fact that reams of paper and above a square mile of skins of vellum have been employd to no purpose to settle peace among those sons of violence pray who is he that will say unto them go and disband yourselves but lo by this transformation it is done at once and the halcyon days of publick tranquillity return for neither the military temper nor discipline can taint the soft sex for a whole age to come bellaque matribus invisa war odious to mothers will not grow immediately palatable in their paternal state  nor will the influence of this transformation be less in family tranquillity than it is in national great faults will be amended and frailties forgiven on both sides a wife who has been disturbd with late hours and choakd with the hautgout of a sot will remember her sufferings and avoid the temptations and will for the same reason indulge her mate in his female capacity in some passions which she is sensible from experience are natural to the sex such as vanity of fine cloaths being admird etc and how tenderly must she use her mate under the breeding qualms and labourpains which she hath felt her self in short all unreasonable demands upon husbands must cease because they are already satisfyd from natural experience that they are impossible  that the ladies may govern the affairs of the world and the gentlemen those of their household better than either of them have hitherto done is the hearty desire of their most sincere wellwisher ms
