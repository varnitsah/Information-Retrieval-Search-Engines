octopus marooned   a trust is its weakest point said jeff peters  that said i sounds like one of those unintelligible remarks such as why is a policeman  it is not said jeff there are no relations between a trust and a policeman my remark was an epitograman axisa kind of mulctem in parvo what it means is that a trust is like an egg and it is not like an egg if you want to break an egg you have to do it from the outside the only way to break up a trust is from the inside keep sitting on it until it hatches look at the brood of young colleges and libraries thats chirping and peeping all over the country yes sir every trust bears in its own bosom the seeds of its destruction like a rooster that crows near a georgia colored methodist camp meeting or a republican announcing himself a candidate for governor of texas  i asked jeff jestingly if he had ever during his checkered plaided mottled pied and dappled career conducted an enterprise of the class to which the word trust had been applied somewhat to my surprise he acknowledged the corner  once said he and the state seal of new jersey never bit into a charter that opened up a solider and safer piece of legitimate octopusing we had everything in our favorwind water police nerve and a clean monopoly of an article indispensable to the public there wasnt a trust buster on the globe that could have found a weak spot in our scheme it made rockefellers little kerosene speculation look like a bucket shop but we lost out  some unforeseen opposition came up i suppose i said  no sir it was just as i said we were selfcurbed it was a case of autosuppression there was a rift within the loot as albert tennyson says  you remember i told you that me and andy tucker was partners for some years that man was the most talented conniver at stratagems i ever saw whenever he saw a dollar in another mans hands he took it as a personal grudge if he couldnt take it any other way andy was educated too besides having a lot of useful information he had acquired a big amount of experience out of books and could talk for hours on any subject connected with ideas and discourse he had been in every line of graft from lecturing on palestine with a lot of magic lantern pictures of the annual custommade clothiers association convention at atlantic city to flooding connecticut with bogus wood alcohol distilled from nutmegs  one spring me and andy had been over in mexico on a flying trip during which a philadelphia capitalist had paid us 2500 for a half interest in a silver mine in chihuahua oh yes the mine was all right the other half interest must have been worth two or three thousand i often wondered who owned that mine  in coming back to the united states me and andy stubbed our toes against a little town in texas on the bank of the rio grande the name of it was bird city but it wasnt the town had about 2000 inhabitants mostly men i figured out that their principal means of existence was in living close to tall chaparral some of em were stockmen and some gamblers and some horse peculators and plenty were in the smuggling line me and andy put up at a hotel that was built like something between a roofgarden and a sectional bookcase it began to rain the day we got there as the saying is juniper aquarius was sure turning on the water plugs on mount amphibious  now there were three saloons in bird city though neither andy nor me drank but we could see the townspeople making a triangular procession from one to another all day and half the night everybody seemed to know what to do with as much money as they had  the third day of the rain it slacked up awhile in the afternoon so me and andy walked out to the edge of town to view the mudscape bird city was built between the rio grande and a deep wide arroyo that used to be the old bed of the river the bank between the stream and its old bed was cracking and giving away when we saw it on account of the high water caused by the rain andy looks at it a long time that mans intellects was never idle and then he unfolds to me a instantaneous idea that has occurred to him right there was organized a trust and we walked back into town and put it on the market  first we went to the main saloon in bird city called the blue snake and bought it it cost us 1200 and then we dropped in casual at mexican joes place referred to the rain and bought him out for 500 the other one came easy at 400  the next morning bird city woke up and found itself an island the river had busted through its old channel and the town was surrounded by roaring torrents the rain was still raining and there was heavy clouds in the northwest that presaged about six more mean annual rainfalls during the next two weeks but the worst was yet to come  bird city hopped out of its nest waggled its pin feathers and strolled out for its matutinal toot lo mexican joes place was closed and likewise the other little dobe life saving station so naturally the body politic emits thirsty ejaculations of surprise and ports hellum for the blue snake and what does it find there  behind one end of the bar sits jefferson peters octopus with a sixshooter on each side of him ready to make change or corpses as the case may be there are three bartenders and on the wall is a ten foot sign reading all drinks one dollar andy sits on the safe in his neat blue suit and goldbanded cigar on the lookout for emergencies the town marshal is there with two deputies to keep order having been promised free drinks by the trust  well sir it took bird city just ten minutes to realize that it was in a cage we expected trouble but there wasnt any the citizens saw that we had em the nearest railroad was thirty miles away and it would be two weeks at least before the river would be fordable so they began to cuss amiable and throw down dollars on the bar till it sounded like a selection on the xylophone  there was about 1500 grownup adults in bird city that had arrived at years of indiscretion and the majority of em required from three to twenty drinks a day to make life endurable the blue snake was the only place where they could get em till the flood subsided it was beautiful and simple as all truly great swindles are  about ten oclock the silver dollars dropping on the bar slowed down to playing twosteps and marches instead of jigs but i looked out the window and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at bird city savings and loan co and i knew they were borrowing more money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus  at the fashionable hour of noon everybody went home to dinner we told the bartenders to take advantage of the lull and do the same then me and andy counted the receipts we had taken in 1300 we calculated that if bird city would only remain an island for two weeks the trust would be able to endow the chicago university with a new dormitory of padded cells for the faculty and present every worthy poor man in texas with a farm provided he furnished the site for it  andy was especial inroaded by selfesteem at our success the rudiments of the scheme having originated in his own surmises and premonitions he got off the safe and lit the biggest cigar in the house   illustration andy was especial inroaded by selfesteem   jeff says he i dont suppose that anywhere in the world you could find three cormorants with brighter ideas about downtreading the proletariat than the firm of peters satan and tucker incorporated we have sure handed the small consumer a giant blow in the sole apoplectic region no  well says i it does look as if we would have to take up gastritis and golf or be measured for kilts in spite of ourselves this little turn in bug juice is verily all to the skibo and i can stand it says i id rather batten than bant any day  andy pours himself out four fingers of our best rye and does with it as was so intended it was the first drink i had ever known him to take  by way of liberation says he to the gods  and then after thus doing umbrage to the heathen diabetes he drinks another to our success and then he begins to toast the trade beginning with raisuli and the northern pacific and on down the line to the little ones like the school book combine and the oleomargarine outrages and the lehigh valley and great scott coal federation  its all right andy says i to drink the health of our brother monopolists but dont overdo the wassail you know our most eminent and loathed multicorruptionists live on weak tea and dog biscuits  andy went in the back room awhile and came out dressed in his best clothes there was a kind of murderous and soulful look of gentle riotousness in his eye that i didnt like i watched him to see what turn the whiskey was going to take in him there are two times when you never can tell what is going to happen one is when a man takes his first drink and the other is when a woman takes her latest  in less than an hour andys skate had turned to an ice yacht he was outwardly decent and managed to preserve his aquarium but inside he was impromptu and full of unexpectedness  jeff says he do you know that im a cratera living crater  thats a selfevident hypothesis says i but youre not irish why dont you say creature according to the rules and syntax of america  im the crater of a volcano says he im all aflame and crammed inside with an assortment of words and phrases that have got to have an exodus i can feel millions of synonyms and parts of speech rising in me says he and ive got to make a speech of some sort drink says andy always drives me to oratory  it could do no worse says i  from my earliest recollections says he alcohol seemed to stimulate my sense of recitation and rhetoric why in bryans second campaign says andy they used to give me three gin rickeys and id speak two hours longer than billy himself could on the silver question finally they persuaded me to take the gold cure  if youve got to get rid of your excess verbiage says i why not go out on the river bank and speak a piece it seems to me there was an old spellbinder named cantharides that used to go and disincorporate himself of his windy numbers along the seashore  no says andy i must have an audience i feel like if i once turned loose people would begin to call senator beveridge the grand young sphinx of the wabash ive got to get an audience together jeff and get this oral distension assuaged or it may turn in on me and id go about feeling like a deckleedge edition de luxe of mrs e d e n southworth  on what special subject of the theorems and topics does your desire for vocality seem to be connected with i asks  i aint particular says andy i am equally good and varicose on all subjects i can take up the matter of russian immigration or the poetry of john w keats or the tariff or kabyle literature or drainage and make my audience weep cry sob and shed tears by turns  well andy says i if you are bound to get rid of this accumulation of vernacular suppose you go out in town and work it on some indulgent citizen me and the boys will take care of the business everybody will be through dinner pretty soon and salt pork and beans makes a man pretty thirsty we ought to take in 1500 more by midnight  so andy goes out of the blue snake and i see him stopping men on the street and talking to em by and by he has half a dozen in a bunch listening to him and pretty soon i see him waving his arms and elocuting at a goodsized crowd on a corner when he walks away they string out after him talking all the time and he leads em down the main street of bird city with more men joining the procession as they go it reminded me of the old legerdemain that id read in books about the pied piper of heidsieck charming the children away from the town   illustration and he leads em down the main street of bird city   one oclock came and then two and three got under the wire for place and not a bird citizen came in for a drink the streets were deserted except for some ducks and ladies going to the stores there was only a light drizzle falling then  a lonesome man came along and stopped in front of the blue snake to scrape the mud off his boots  pardner says i what has happened this morning there was hectic gaiety afoot and now it seems more like one of them ruined cities of tyre and siphon where the lone lizard crawls on the walls of the main portcullis  the whole town says the muddy man is up in sperrys wool warehouse listening to your sidekicker make a speech he is some gravy on delivering himself of audible sounds relating to matters and conclusions says the man  well i hope hell adjourn sine qua non pretty soon says i for trade languishes  not a customer did we have that afternoon at six oclock two mexicans brought andy to the saloon lying across the back of a burro we put him in bed while he still muttered and gesticulated with his hands and feet  then i locked up the cash and went out to see what had happened i met a man who told me all about it andy had made the finest two hour speech that had ever been heard in texas he said or anywhere else in the world  what was it about i asked  temperance says he and when he got through every man in bird city signed the pledge for a year     jeff peters as a personal magnet   jeff peters has been engaged in as many schemes for making money as there are recipes for cooking rice in charleston sc  best of all i like to hear him tell of his earlier days when he sold liniments and cough cures on street corners living hand to mouth heart to heart with the people throwing heads or tails with fortune for his last coin  i struck fisher hill arkansaw said he in a buckskin suit moccasins long hair and a thirtycarat diamond ring that i got from an actor in texarkana i dont know what he ever did with the pocket knife i swapped him for it  i was dr waughhoo the celebrated indian medicine man i carried only one best bet just then and that was resurrection bitters it was made of lifegiving plants and herbs accidentally discovered by taquala the beautiful wife of the chief of the choctaw nation while gathering truck to garnish a platter of boiled dog for the annual corn dance  business hadnt been good in the last town so i only had five dollars i went to the fisher hill druggist and he credited me for half a gross of eightounce bottles and corks i had the labels and ingredients in my valise left over from the last town life began to look rosy again after i got in my hotel room with the water running from the tap and the resurrection bitters lining up on the table by the dozen   illustration life began to look rosy again   fake no sir there was two dollars worth of fluid extract of cinchona and a dimes worth of aniline in that halfgross of bitters ive gone through towns years afterwards and had folks ask for em again  i hired a wagon that night and commenced selling the bitters on main street fisher hill was a low malarial town and a compound hypothetical pneumocardiac antiscorbutic tonic was just what i diagnosed the crowd as needing the bitters started off like sweetbreadsontoast at a vegetarian dinner i had sold two dozen at fifty cents apiece when i felt somebody pull my coat tail i knew what that meant so i climbed down and sneaked a five dollar bill into the hand of a man with a german silver star on his lapel   illustration i commenced selling the bitters on main street   constable says i its a fine night  have you got a city license he asks to sell this illegitimate essence of spooju that you flatter by the name of medicine  i have not says i i didnt know you had a city if i can find it tomorrow ill take one out if its necessary  ill have to close you up till you do says the constable  i quit selling and went back to the hotel i was talking to the landlord about it  oh you wont stand no show in fisher hill says he dr hoskins the only doctor here is a brotherinlaw of the mayor and they wont allow no fake doctor to practice in town  i dont practice medicine says i ive got a state peddlers license and i take out a city one wherever they demand it  i went to the mayors office the next morning and they told me he hadnt showed up yet they didnt know when hed be down so doc waughhoo hunches down again in a hotel chair and lights a jimpsonweed regalia and waits  by and by a young man in a blue necktie slips into the chair next to me and asks the time  halfpast ten says i and you are andy tucker ive seen you work wasnt it you that put up the great cupid combination package on the southern states lets see it was a chilian diamond engagement ring a wedding ring a potato masher a bottle of soothing syrup and dorothy vernonall for fifty cents  andy was pleased to hear that i remembered him he was a good street man and he was more than thathe respected his profession and he was satisfied with 300 per cent profit he had plenty of offers to go into the illegitimate drug and garden seed business but he was never to be tempted off of the straight path  i wanted a partner so andy and me agreed to go out together i told him about the situation in fisher hill and how finances was low on account of the local mixture of politics and jalap andy had just got in on the train that morning he was pretty low himself and was going to canvass the whole town for a few dollars to build a new battleship by popular subscription at eureka springs so we went out and sat on the porch and talked it over  the next morning at eleven oclock when i was sitting there alone an uncle tom shuffles into the hotel and asked for the doctor to come and see judge banks who it seems was the mayor and a mighty sick man  im no doctor says i why dont you go and get the doctor  boss says he doc hoskins am done gone twenty miles in de country to see some sick persons hes de only doctor in de town and massa banks am powerful bad off he sent me to ax you to please suh come  as man to man says i ill go and look him over so i put a bottle of resurrection bitters in my pocket and goes up on the hill to the mayors mansion the finest house in town with a mansard roof and two cast iron dogs on the lawn  this mayor banks was in bed all but his whiskers and feet he was making internal noises that would have had everybody in san francisco hiking for the parks a young man was standing by the bed holding a cup of water  doc says the mayor im awful sick im about to die cant you do nothing for me  mr mayor says i im not a regular preordained disciple of s q lapius i never took a course in a medical college says i ive just come as a fellow man to see if i could be off assistance  im deeply obliged says he doc waughhoo this is my nephew mr biddle he has tried to alleviate my distress but without success oh lordy owowow he sings out  i nods at mr biddle and sets down by the bed and feels the mayors pulse let me see your liveryour tongue i mean says i then i

and listening youve got a bad attack of superinflammation of the right clavicle of the harpsichord  good lord says he with a groan cant you rub something on it or set it or anything  i picks up my hat and starts for the door  you aint going doc says the mayor with a howl you aint going away and leave me to die with thissuperfluity of the clapboards are you  common humanity dr whoaha says mr biddle ought to prevent your deserting a fellowhuman in distress  dr waughhoo when you get through plowing says i and then i walks back to the bed and throws back my long hair  mr mayor says i there is only one hope for you drugs will do you no good but there is another power higher yet although drugs are high enough says i  and what is that says he  scientific demonstrations says i the triumph of mind over sarsaparilla the belief that there is no pain and sickness except what is produced when we aint feeling well declare yourself in arrears demonstrate  what is this paraphernalia you speak of doc says the mayor you aint a socialist are you  i am speaking says i of the great doctrine of psychic financieringof the enlightened school of longdistance subconscientious treatment of fallacies and meningitisof that wonderful indoor sport known as personal magnetism  can you work it doc asks the mayor  im one of the sole sanhedrims and ostensible hooplas of the inner pulpit says i the lame talk and the blind rubber whenever i make a pass at em i am a medium a coloratura hypnotist and a spirituous control it was only through me at the recent seances at ann arbor that the late president of the vinegar bitters company could revisit the earth to communicate with his sister jane you see me peddling medicine on the street says i to the poor i dont practice personal magnetism on them i do not drag it in the dust says i because they havent got the dust  will you treat my case asks the mayor  listen says i ive had a good deal of trouble with medical societies everywhere ive been i dont practice medicine but to save your life ill give you the psychic treatment if youll agree as mayor not to push the license question  of course i will says he and now get to work doc for them pains are coming on again  my fee will be 25000 cure guaranteed in two treatments says i  all right says the mayor ill pay it i guess my lifes worth that much  i sat down by the bed and looked him straight in the eye  now says i get your mind off the disease you aint sick you havent got a heart or a clavicle or a funny bone or brains or anything you havent got any pain declare error now you feel the pain that you didnt have leaving dont you  i do feel some little better doc says the mayor darned if i dont now state a few lies about my not having this swelling in my left side and i think i could be propped up and have some sausage and buckwheat cakes  i made a few passes with my hands  now says i the inflammations gone the right lobe of the perihelion has subsided youre getting sleepy you cant hold your eyes open any longer for the present the disease is checked now you are asleep  the mayor shut his eyes slowly and began to snore  you observe mr tiddle says i the wonders of modern science  biddle says he when will you give uncle the rest of the treatment dr poohpooh  waughhoo says i ill come back at eleven tomorrow when he wakes up give him eight drops of turpentine and three pounds of steak good morning  the next morning i was back on time well mr riddle says i when he opened the bedroom door and how is uncle this morning  he seems much better says the young man  the mayors color and pulse was fine i gave him another treatment and he said the last of the pain left him  now says i youd better stay in bed for a day or two and youll be all right its a good thing i happened to be in fisher hill mr mayor says i for all the remedies in the cornucopia that the regular schools of medicine use couldnt have saved you and now that error has flew and pain proved a perjurer lets allude to a cheerfuller subjectsay the fee of 250 no checks please i hate to write my name on the back of a check almost as bad as i do on the front  ive got the cash here says the mayor pulling a pocket book from under his pillow  he counts out five fiftydollar notes and holds em in his hand  bring the receipt he says to biddle  i signed the receipt and the mayor handed me the money i put it in my inside pocket careful  now do your duty officer says the mayor grinning much unlike a sick man  mr biddle lays his hand on my arm  youre under arrest dr waughhoo alias peters says he for practising medicine without authority under the state law  who are you i asks  ill tell you who he is says mr mayor sitting up in bed hes a detective employed by the state medical society hes been following you over five counties he came to me yesterday and we fixed up this scheme to catch you i guess you wont do any more doctoring around these parts mr fakir what was it you said i had doc the mayor laughs compoundwell it wasnt softening of the brain i guess anyway  a detective says i  correct says biddle ill have to turn you over to the sheriff  lets see you do it says i and i grabs biddle by the throat and half throws him out the window but he pulls a gun and sticks it under my chin and i stand still then he puts handcuffs on me and takes the money out of my pocket   illustration and i grabs biddle by the throat   i witness says he that theyre the same bank bills that you and i marked judge banks ill turn them over to the sheriff when we get to his office and hell send you a receipt theyll have to be used as evidence in the case  all right mr biddle says the mayor and now doc waughhoo he goes on why dont you demonstrate cant you pull the cork out of your magnetism with your teeth and hocuspocus them handcuffs off  come on officer says i dignified i may as well make the best of it and then i turns to old banks and rattles my chains  mr mayor says i the time will come soon when youll believe that personal magnetism is a success and youll be sure that it succeeded in this case too  and i guess it did  when we got nearly to the gate i says we might meet somebody now andy i reckon you better take em off and hey why of course it was andy tucker that was his scheme and thats how we got the capital to go into business together     modern rural sports   jeff peters must be reminded whenever he is called upon pointedly for a story he will maintain that his life has been as devoid of incident as the longest of trollopes novels but lured he will divulge therefore i cast many and divers flies upon the current of his thoughts before i feel a nibble  i notice said i that the western farmers in spite of their prosperity are running after their old populistic idols again  its the running season said jeff for farmers shad maple trees and the connemaugh river i know something about farmers i thought i struck one once that had got out of the rut but andy tucker proved to me i was mistaken once a farmer always a sucker said andy hes the man thats shoved into the front row among bullets ballots and the ballet hes the funnybone and gristle of the country said andy and i dont know who we would do without him  one morning me and andy wakes up with sixtyeight cents between us in a yellow pine hotel on the edge of the predigested hoecake belt of southern indiana how we got off the train there the night before i cant tell you for she went through the village so fast that what looked like a saloon to us through the car window turned out to be a composite view of a drug store and a water tank two blocks apart why we got off at the first station we could belongs to a little oroide gold watch and alaska diamond deal we failed to pull off the day before over the kentucky line  when i woke up i heard roosters crowing and smelt something like the fumes of nitromuriatic acid and heard something heavy fall on the floor below us and a man swearing  cheer up andy says i were in a rural community somebody has just tested a gold brick downstairs well go out and get whats coming to us from a farmer and then yoicks and away  farmers was always a kind of reserve fund to me whenever i was in hard luck id go to the crossroads hook a finger in a farmers suspender recite the prospectus of my swindle in a mechanical kind of a way look over what he had give him back his keys whetstone and papers that was of no value except to owner and stroll away without asking any questions farmers are not fair game to me as high up in our business as me and andy was but there was times when we found em useful just as wall street does the secretary of the treasury now and then  when we went down stairs we saw we was in the midst of the finest farming section we ever see about two miles away on a hill was a big white house in a grove surrounded by a widespread agricultural agglomeration of fields and barns and pastures and outhouses  whose house is that we asked the landlord  that says he is the domicile and the arboreal terrestrial and horticultural accessories of farmer ezra plunkett one of our countys most progressive citizens  after breakfast me and andy with eight cents capital left casts the horoscope of the rural potentate  let me go alone says i two of us against one farmer would look as onesided as roosevelt using both hands to kill a grizzly  all right says andy i like to be a true sport even when im only collecting rebates from the rutabag raisers what bait are you going to use for this ezra thing andy asks me  oh i says the first thing that come to hand in the suit case i reckon ill take along some of the new income tax receipts and the recipe for making clover honey out of clabber and apple peelings and the order blanks for the mcguffeys readers which afterwards turn out to be mccormicks reapers and the pearl necklace found on the train and a pocketsize goldbrick and a  thatll be enough says andy any one of the lot ought to land on ezra and say jeff make that succotash fancier give you nice clean new bills its a disgrace to our department of agriculture civil service and pure food law the kind of stuff some of these farmers hand out to use ive had to take rolls from em that looked like bundles of microbe cultures captured out of a red cross ambulance  so i goes to a livery stable and hires a buggy on my looks i drove out to the plunkett farm and hitched there was a man sitting on the front steps of the house he had on a white flannel suit a diamond ring golf cap and a pink ascot tie summer boarder says i to myself  id like to see farmer ezra plunkett says i to him  you see him says he what seems to be on your mind  i never answered a word i stood still repeating to myself the rollicking lines of that merry jingle the man with the hoe when i looked at this farmer the little devices i had in my pocket for buncoing the pushedback brows seemed as hopeless as trying to shake down the beef trust with a mittimus and a parlor rifle  well says he looking at me close speak up i see the left pocket of your coat sags a good deal out with the goldbrick first im rather more interested in the bricks than i am in the trick sixtyday notes and the lost silver mine story  i had a kind of cerebral sensation of foolishness in my ideas of ratiocination but i pulled out the little brick and unwrapped my handkerchief off it  one dollar and eighty cents says the farmer hefting it in his hand is it a trade  the lead in it is worth more than that says i dignified i put it back in my pocket  all right says he but i sort of wanted it for the collection im starting i got a 5000 one last week for 210  just then a telephone bell rings in the house  come in bunk says the farmer and look at my place its kind of lonesome here sometimes i think thats new york calling  we went inside the room looked like a broadway stockbrokerslight oak desks two phones spanish leather upholstered chairs and couches oil paintings in gilt frames a foot deep and a ticker hitting off the news in one corner  hello hello says this funny farmer is that the regent theatre yes this is plunkett of woodbine centre reserve four orchestra seats for friday eveningmy usual ones yes fridaygoodbye  i run over to new york every two weeks to see a show says the farmer hanging up the receiver i catch the eighteenhour flyer at indianapolis spend ten hours in the heyday of night on the yappian way and get home in time to see the chickens go to roost fortyeight hours later oh the pristine hubbard squasherino of the cavedwelling period is getting geared up some for the annual meeting of the dontblowoutthegas association dont you think mr bunk  i seem to perceive says i a kind of hiatus in the agrarian traditions in which heretofore i have reposed confidence  sure bunk says he the yellow primrose on the rivers brim is getting to look to us reubs like a holiday edition de luxe of the language of flowers with deckle edges and frontispiece  just then the telephone calls him again  hello hello says he oh thats perkins at milldale i told you 800 was too much for that horse have you got him there good let me see him get away from the transmitter now make him trot in a circle faster yes i can hear him keep onfaster yet  thatll do now lead him up to the phone closer get his nose nearer there now wait no i dont want that horse what no not at any price he interferes and hes windbroken goodbye  now bunk says the farmer do you begin to realize that agriculture has had a hair cut you belong in a bygone era why tom lawson himself knows better than to try to catch an uptodate agriculturalist napping its saturday the fourteenth on the farm you bet now look here and see how we keep up with the days doings  he shows me a machine on a table with two things for your ears like the pennyintheslot affairs i puts it on and listens a female voice starts up reading headlines of murders accidents and other political casualities  what you hear says the farmer is a synopsis of todays news in the new york chicago st louis and san francisco papers it is wired in to our rural news bureau and served hot to subscribers on this table you see the principal dailies and weeklies of the country also a special service of advance sheets of the monthly magazines  i picks up one sheet and sees that its headed special advance proofs in july 1909 the century will sayand so forth  the farmer rings up somebodyhis manager i reckonand tells him to let that herd of 15 jerseys go at 600 a head and to sow the 900acre field in wheat and to have 200 extra cans ready at the station for the milk trolley car then he passes the henry clays and sets out a bottle of green chartreuse and goes over and looks at the ticker tape  consolidated gas up two points says he oh very well  ever monkey with copper i asks  stand back says he raising his hand or ill call the dog i told you not to waste your time  after a while he says bunk if you dont mind my telling you your company begins to cloy slightly ive got to write an article on the chimera of communism for a magazine and attend a meeting of the race track association this afternoon of course you understand by now that you cant get my proxy for your remedy whatever it may be  well sir all i could think of to do was to go out and get in the buggy the horse turned round and took me back to the hotel i hitched him and went in to see andy in his room i told him about this farmer word for word and i sat picking at the table cover like one bereft of sagaciousness  i dont understand it says i humming a sad and foolish little song to cover my humiliation  andy walks up and down the room for a long time biting the left end of his mustache as he does when in the act of thinking  jeff says he finally i believe your story of this expurgated rustic but i am not convinced it looks incredulous to me that he could have inoculated himself against all the preordained systems of bucolic bunco now you never regarded me as a man of special religious proclivities did you jeff says andy  well says i no but says i not to wound his feelings i have also observed many church members whose said proclivities were not so outwardly developed that they would show on a white handkerchief if you rubbed em with it  i have always been a deep student of nature from creation down says andy and i believe in an ultimatum design of providence farmers was made for a purpose and that was to furnish a livelihood to men like me and you else why was we given brains it is my belief that the manna that the israelites lived on for forty years in the wilderness was only a figurative word for farmers and they kept up the practice to this day and now says andy i am going to test my theory once a farmer always a comeon in spite of the veneering and the orifices that a spurious civilization has brought to him  youll fail same as i did says i this ones shook off the shackles of the sheepfold hes entrenched behind the advantages of electricity education literature and intelligence  ill try said andy there are certain laws of nature that free rural delivery cant overcome  andy fumbles around awhile in the closet and comes out dressed in a suit with brown and yellow checks as big as your hand his vest is red with blue dots and he wears a high silk hat i noticed hed soaked his sandy mustache in a kind of blue ink  great barnums says i youre a ringer for a circus thimblerig man  right says andy is the buggy outside wait here till i come back i wont be long  two hours afterwards andy steps into the room and lays a wad of money on the table  eight hundred and sixty dollars said he let me tell you he was in he looked me over and began to guy me i didnt say a word but got out the walnut shells and began to roll the little ball on the table i whistled a tune or two and then i started up the old formula  step up lively gentlemen says i and watch the little ball it costs you nothing to look there you see it and there you dont guess where the little joker is the quickness of the hand deceives the eye  i steals a look at the farmer man i see the sweat coming out on his forehead he goes over and closes the front door and watches me some more directly he says ill bet you twenty i can pick the shell the balls under now  after that goes on andy there is nothing new to relate he only had 860 cash in the house when i left he followed me to the gate there was tears in his eyes when he shook hands  bunk says he thank you for the only real pleasure ive had in years it brings up happy old days when i was only a farmer and not an agriculturalist god bless you  here jeff peters ceased and i inferred that his story was done  then you thinki began  yes said jeff something like that you let the farmers go ahead and amuse themselves with politics farmings a lonesome life and theyve been against the shell game before     the chair of philanthromathematics   i see that the cause of education has received the princely gift of more than fifty millions of dollars said i  i was gleaning the stray items from the evening papers while jeff peters packed his briar pipe with plug cut  which same said jeff calls for a new deck and a recitation by the entire class in philanthromathematics  is that an allusion i asked  it is said jeff i never told you about the time when me and andy tucker was philanthropists did i it was eight years ago in arizona andy and me was out in the gila mountains with a twohorse wagon prospecting for silver we struck it and sold out to parties in tucson for 25000 they paid our check at the bank in silvera thousand dollars in a sack we loaded it in our wagon and drove east a hundred miles before we recovered our presence of intellect twentyfive thousand dollars doesnt sound like so much when youre reading the annual report of the pennsylvania railroad or listening to an actor talking about his salary but when you can raise up a wagon sheet and kick around your bootheel and hear every one of em ring against another it makes you feel like you was a nightandday bank with the clock striking twelve  the third day out we drove into one of the most specious and tidy little towns that nature or rand and mcnally ever turned out it was in the foothills and mitigated with trees and flowers and about 2000 head of cordial and dilatory inhabitants the town seemed to be called floresville and nature had not contaminated it with many railroads fleas or eastern tourists  me and andy deposited our money to the credit of peters and tucker in the esperanza savings bank and got rooms at the skyview hotel after supper we lit up and sat out on the gallery and smoked then was when the philanthropy idea struck me i suppose every grafter gets it sometime  when a man swindles the public out of a certain amount he begins to get scared and wants to return part of it and if youll watch close and notice the way his charity runs youll see that he tries to restore it to the same people he got it from as a hydrostatical case take lets say a a made his millions selling oil to poor students who sit up nights studying political economy and methods for regulating the trusts so back to the universities and colleges goes his conscience dollars  theres b got his from the common laboring man that works with his hands and tools hows he to get some of the remorse fund back into their overalls  aha says b ill do it in the name of education ive skinned the laboring man says he to himself but according to the old proverb charity covers a multitude of skins  so he puts up eighty million dollars worth of libraries and the boys with the dinner pail that builds em gets the benefit  wheres the books asks the reading public  i dinna ken says b i offered ye libraries and there they are i suppose if id given ye preferred steel trust stock instead yed have wanted the water in it set out in cut glass decanters hoot for ye  but as i said the owning of so much money was beginning to give me philanthropitis it was the first time me and andy had ever made a pile big enough to make us stop and think how we got it  andy says i were wealthynot beyond the dreams of average but in our humble way we are comparatively as rich as greasers i feel as if id like to do something for as well as to humanity  i was thinking the same thing jeff says he weve been gouging the public for a long time with all kinds of little schemes from selling selfigniting celluloid collars to flooding georgia with hoke smith presidential campaign buttons id like myself to hedge a bet or two in the graft game if i could do it without actually banging the cymbalines in the salvation army or teaching a bible class by the bertillon system  whatll we do says andy give free grub to the poor or send a couple of thousand to george cortelyou  neither says i weve got too much money to be implicated in plain charity and we havent got enough to make restitution so well look about for something thats about half way between the two  the next day in walking around floresville we see on a hill a big red brick building that appears to be disinhabited the citizens speak up and tell us that it was begun for a residence several years before by a mine owner after running up the house he finds he only had 280 left to furnish it with so he invests that in whiskey and jumps off the roof on a spot where he now requiescats in pieces  as soon as me and andy saw that building the same idea struck both of us we would fix it up with lights and pen wipers and professors and put an iron dog and statues of hercules and father john on the lawn and start one of the finest free educational institutions in the world right there  so we talks it over to the prominent citizens of floresville who falls in fine with the idea they give a banquet in the engine house to us and we make our bow for the first time as benefactors to the cause of progress and enlightenment andy makes an hourandahalf speech on the subject of irrigation in lower egypt and we have a moral tune on the phonograph and pineapple sherbet  andy and me didnt lose any time in philanthropping we put every man in town that could tell a hammer from a step ladder to work on the building dividing it up into class rooms and lecture halls we wire to frisco for a car load of desks footballs arithmetics penholders dictionaries chairs for the professors slates skeletons sponges twentyseven cravenetted gowns and caps for the senior class and an open order for all the truck that goes with a firstclass university i took it on myself to put a campus and a curriculum on the list but the telegraph operator must have got the words wrong being an ignorant man for when the goods come we found a can of peas and a currycomb among em  while the weekly papers was having chalkplate cuts of me and andy we wired an employment agency in chicago to express us fob six professors immediatelyone english literature one uptodate dead languages one chemistry one political economydemocrat preferredone logic and one wise to painting italian and music with union card the esperanza bank guaranteed salaries which was to run between 800 and 80050  well sir we finally got in shape over the front door was carved the words the worlds university peters  tucker patrons and proprietors and when september the first got a crossmark on the calendar the comeons begun to roll in first the faculty got off the triweekly express from tucson they was mostly young spectacled and redheaded with sentiments divided between ambition and food andy and me got em billeted on the floresvillians and then laid for the students  they came in bunches we had advertised the university in all the state papers and it did us good to see how quick the country responded two hundred and nineteen husky lads aging along from 18 up to chin whiskers answered the clarion call of free education they ripped open that town sponged the seams turned it lined it with new mohair and you couldnt have told it from harvard or goldfields at the march term of court  they marched up and down the streets waving flags with the worlds university colorsultramarine and blueand they certainly made a lively place of floresville andy made them a speech from the balcony of the skyview hotel and the whole town was out celebrating  in about two weeks the professors got the students disarmed and herded into classes i dont believe theres any pleasure equal to being a philanthropist me and andy bought high silk hats and pretended to dodge the two reporters of the floresville gazette the paper had a man to kodak us whenever we appeared on the street and ran our pictures every week over the column headed educational notes andy lectured twice a week at the university and afterward i would rise and tell a humorous story once the gazette printed my pictures with abe lincoln on one side and marshall p wilder on the other  andy was as interested in philanthropy as i was we used to wake up of nights and tell each other new ideas for booming the university  andy says i to him one day theres something we overlooked the boys ought to have dromedaries  whats that andy asks  why something to sleep in of course says i all colleges have em  oh you mean pajamas says andy  i do not says i i mean dromedaries but i never could make andy understand so we never ordered em of course i meant them long bedrooms in colleges where the scholars sleep in a row  well sir the worlds university was a success we had scholars from five states and territories and floresville had a boom a new shooting gallery and a pawn shop and two more saloons started and the boys got up a college yell that went this way      raw raw raw        done done done      peters tucker        lots of fun      bowwowwow        hawheehaw      world university        hip hurrah   the scholars was a fine lot of young men and me and andy was as proud of em as if they belonged to our own family  but one day about the last of october andy comes to me and asks if i have any idea how much money we had left in the bank i guesses about sixteen thousand our balance says andy is 82162  what says i with a kind of a yell do you mean to tell me that them infernal clodhopping doughheaded pupfaced goosebrained gatestealing rabbiteared sons of horse thieves have soaked us for that much  no less says andy  then to helvetia with philanthropy says i  not necessarily says andy philanthropy says he when run on a good business basis is one of the best grafts going ill look into the matter and see if it cant be straightened out  the next week i am looking over the payroll of our faculty when i run across a new nameprofessor james darnley mccorkle chair of mathematics salary 100 per week i yells so loud that andy runs in quick  whats this says i a professor of mathematics at more than 5000 a year how did this happen did he get in through the window and appoint himself  i wired to frisco for him a week ago says andy in ordering the faculty we seemed to have overlooked the chair of mathematics  a good thing we did says i we can pay his salary two weeks and then our philanthropy will look like the ninth hole on the skibo golf links  wait a while says andy and see how things turn out we have taken up too noble a cause to draw out now besides the further i gaze into the retail philanthropy business the better it looks to me i never thought about investigating it before come to think of it now goes on andy all the philanthropists i ever knew had plenty of money i ought to have looked into that matter long ago and located which was the cause and which was the effect  i had confidence in andys chicanery in financial affairs so i left the whole thing in his hands the university was flourishing fine and me and andy kept our silk hats shined up and floresville kept on heaping honors on us like we was millionaires instead of almost busted philanthropists  the students kept the town lively and prosperous some stranger came to town and started a faro bank over the red front livery stable and began to amass money in quantities me and andy strolled up one night and piked a dollar or two for sociability there were about fifty of our students there drinking rum punches and shoving high stacks of blues and reds about the table as the dealer turned the cards up  why dang it andy says i these freeschoolhunting ganderheaded silksocked little sons of sapsuckers have got more money than you and me ever had look at the rolls theyre pulling out of their pistol pockets  yes says andy a good many of them are sons of wealthy miners and stockmen its very sad to see em wasting their opportunities this way  at christmas all the students went home to spend the holidays we had a farewell blowout at the university and andy lectured on modern music and prehistoric literature of the archipelagos each one of the faculty answered to toasts and compared me and andy to rockefeller and the emperor marcus autolycus i pounded on the table and yelled for professor mccorkle but it seems he wasnt present on the occasion i wanted a look at the man that andy thought could earn 100 a week in philanthropy that was on the point of making an assignment  the students all left on the night train and the town sounded as quiet as the campus of a correspondence school at midnight when i went to the hotel i saw a light in andys room and i opened the door and walked in  there sat andy and the faro dealer at a table dividing a twofoot high stack of currency in thousanddollar packages  correct says andy thirtyone thousand apiece come in jeff says he this is our share of the profits of the first half of the scholastic term of the worlds university incorporated and philanthropated are you convinced now says andy that philanthropy when practiced in a business way is an art that blesses him who gives as well as him who receives  great says i feeling fine ill admit you are the doctor this time  well be leaving on the morning train says andy youd better get your collars and cuffs and press clippings together  great says i ill be ready but andy says i i wish i could have met that professor james darnley mccorkle before we went i had a curiosity to know that man  thatll be easy says andy turning around to the faro dealer  jim says andy shake hands with mr peters     the hand that riles the world   many of our great men said i apropos of many things have declared that they owe their success to the aid and encouragement of some brilliant woman  i know said jeff peters ive read in history and mythology about joan of arc and mme yale and mrs caudle and eve and other noted females of the past but in my opinion the woman of today is of little use in politics or business whats she best in anywaymen make the best cooks milliners nurses housekeepers stenographers clerks hairdressers and launderers about the only job left that a woman can beat a man in is female impersonator in vaudeville  i would have thought said i that occasionally anyhow you would have found the wit and intuition of woman valuable to you in your lines oferbusiness  now wouldnt you said jeff with an emphatic nodwouldnt you have imagined that but a woman is an absolutely unreliable partner in any straight swindle shes liable to turn honest on you when you are depending upon her the most i tried em once  bill humble an old friend of mine in the territories conceived the illusion that he wanted to be appointed united states marshall at that time me and andy was doing a square legitimate business of selling walking canes if you unscrewed the head of one and turned it up to your mouth a half pint of good rye whiskey would go trickling down your throat to reward you for your act of intelligence the deputies was annoying me and andy some and when bill spoke to me about his officious aspirations i saw how the appointment as marshall might help along the firm of peters  tucker   illustration selling walking canes   jeff says bill to me you are a man of learning and education besides having knowledge and information concerning not only rudiments but facts and attainments  i do says i and i have never regretted it i am not one says i who would cheapen education by making it free tell me says i which is of the most value to mankind literature or horse racing  whyer playing the poi mean of course the poets and the great writers have got the call of course says bill  exactly says i then why do the master minds of finance and philanthropy says i charge us 2 to get into a racetrack and let us into a library free is that distilling into the masses says i a correct estimate of the relative value of the two means of selfculture and disorder  you are arguing outside of my faculties of sense and rhetoric says bill what i wanted you to do is to go to washington and dig out this appointment for me i havent no ideas of cultivation and intrigue im a plain citizen and i need the job ive killed seven men says bill ive got nine children ive been a good republican ever since the first of may i cant read nor write and i see no reason why i aint illegible for the office and i think your partner mr tucker goes on bill is also a man of sufficient ingratiation and connected system of mental delinquency to assist you in securing the appointment i will give you preliminary says bill 1000 for drinks bribes and carfare in washington if you land the job i will pay you 1000 more cash down and guarantee you impunity in bootlegging whiskey for twelve months are you patriotic to the west enough to help me put this thing through the whitewashed wigwam of the great father of the most eastern flag station of the pennsylvania railroad says bill   illustration im a plain citizen and i need the job   well i talked to andy about it and he liked the idea immense andy was a man of an involved nature he was never content to plod along as i was selling to the peasantry some little tool like a combination steak beater shoe horn marcel waver monkey wrench nail file potato masher and multum in parvo tuning fork andy had the artistic temper which is not to be judged as a preachers or a moral mans is by purely commercial deflections so we accepted bills offer and strikes out for washington  says i to andy when we get located at a hotel on south dakota avenue gssw now andy for the first time in our lives weve got to do a real dishonest act lobbying is something weve never been used to but weve got to scandalize ourselves for bill humbles sake in a straight and legitimate business says i we could afford to introduce a little foul play and chicanery but in a disorderly and heinous piece of malpractice like this it seems to me that the straightforward and aboveboard way is the best i propose says i that we hand over 500 of this money to the chairman of the national campaign committee get a receipt lay the receipt on the presidents desk and tell him about bill the president is a man who would appreciate a candidate who went about getting office that way instead of pulling wires  andy agreed with me but after we talked the scheme over with the hotel clerk we give that plan up he told us that there was only one way to get an appointment in washington and that was through a lady lobbyist he gave us the address of one he recommended a mrs avery who he said was high up in sociable and diplomatic rings and circles  the next morning at 10 oclock me and andy called at her hotel and was shown up to her reception room  this mrs avery was a solace and a balm to the eyesight she had hair the color of the back of a twenty dollar gold certificate blue eyes and a system of beauty that would make the girl on the cover of a july magazine look like a cook on a monongahela coal barge  she had on a low necked dress covered with silver spangles and diamond rings and ear bobs her arms was bare and she was using a desk telephone with one hand and drinking tea with the other  well boys says she after a bit what is it   illustration well boys what is it   i told her in as few words as possible what we wanted for bill and the price we could pay  those western appointments says she are easy leme see now says she who could put that through for us no use fooling with the territorial delegates i guess says she that senator sniper would be about the man hes from somewheres in the west lets see how he stands on my private menu card she takes some papers out of a pigeonhole with the letter s over it  yes says she hes marked with a star that means ready to serve now lets see age 55 married twice presbyterian likes blondes tolstoi poker and stewed terrapin sentimental at third bottle of wine yes she goes on i am sure i can have your friend mr bummer appointed minister to brazil  humble says i and united states marshal was the berth  oh yes says mrs avery i have so many deals of this sort i sometimes get them confused give me all the memoranda you have of the case mr peters and come back in four days i think it can be arranged by then  so me and andy goes back to our hotel and waits andy walks up and down and chews the left end of his mustache  a woman of high intellect and perfect beauty is a rare thing jeff says he  as rare says i as an omelet made from the eggs of the fabulous bird known as the epidermis says i  a woman like that says andy ought to lead a man to the highest positions of opulence and fame  i misdoubt says i if any woman ever helped a man to secure a job any more than to have his meals ready promptly and spread a report that the other candidates wife had once been a shoplifter they are no more adapted for business and politics says i than algernon charles swinburne is to be floor manager at one of chuck connors annual balls i know says i to andy that sometimes a woman seems to step out into the kalsomine light as the charge daffaires of her mans political job but how does it come out say they have a neat little berth somewhere as foreign consul of record to afghanistan or lockkeeper on the delaware and raritan canal one day this man finds his wife putting on her overshoes and three months supply of bird seed into the canarys cage sioux falls he asks with a kind of hopeful light in his eye no arthur says she washington were wasted here says she you ought to be toady extraordinary to the court of st bridget or head porter of the island of porto rico im going to see about it  then this lady i says to andy moves against the authorities at washington with her baggage and munitions consisting of five dozen indiscriminating letters written to her by a member of the cabinet when she was 15 a letter of introduction from king leopold to the smithsonian institution and a pink silk costume with canary colored spats  well and then what i goes she has the letters printed in the evening papers that match her costume she lectures at an informal tea given in the palm room of the b  o depot and then calls on the president the ninth assistant secretary of commerce and labor the first aidedecamp of the blue room and an unidentified colored man are waiting there to grasp her by the handsand feet they carry her out to sw b street and leave her on a cellar door that ends it the next time we hear of her she is writing postcards to the chinese minister asking him to get arthur a job in a tea store  then says andy you dont think mrs avery will land the marshalship for bill  i do not says i i do not wish to be a septic but i doubt if she can do as well as you and me could have done  i dont agree with you says andy ill bet you she does im proud of having a higher opinion of the talent and the powers of negotiation of ladies  we was back at mrs averys hotel at the time she appointed she was looking pretty and fine enough as far as that went to make any man let her name every officer in the country but i hadnt much faith in looks so i was certainly surprised when she pulls out a document with the great seal of the united states on it and william henry humble in a fine big hand on the back  you might have had it the next day boys says mrs avery smiling i hadnt the slightest trouble in getting it says she i just asked for it thats all now id like to talk to you a while she goes on but im awfully busy and i know youll excuse me ive got an ambassadorship two consulates and a dozen other minor applications to look after i can hardly find time to sleep at all youll give my compliments to mr humble when you get home of course  well i handed her the 500 which she pitched into her desk drawer without counting i put bills appointment in my pocket and me and andy made our adieus  we started back for the territory the same day we wired bill job landed get the tall glasses ready and we felt pretty good  andy joshed me all the way about how little i knew about women  all right says i ill admit that she surprised me but its the first time i ever knew one of em to manipulate a piece of business on time without getting it bungled up in some way says i  down about the edge of arkansas i got out bills appointment and looked it over and then i handed it to andy to read andy read it but didnt add any remarks to my silence  the paper was for bill all right and a genuine document but it appointed him postmaster of dade city fla  me and andy got off the train at little rock and sent bills appointment to him by mail then we struck northeast toward lake superior  i never saw bill humble after that     the exact science of matrimony   as i have told you before said jeff peters i never had much confidence in the perfidiousness of woman as partners or coeducators in the most innocent line of graft they are not trustworthy  they deserve the compliment said i i think they are entitled to be called the honest sex  why shouldnt they be said jeff theyve got the other sex either grafting or working overtime for em theyre all right in business until they get their emotions or their hair touched up too much then you want to have a flat footed heavy breathing man with sandy whiskers five kids and a building and loan mortgage ready as an understudy to take her desk now there was that widow lady that me and andy tucker engaged to help us in that little matrimonial agency scheme we floated out in cairo  when youve got enough advertising capitalsay a roll as big as the little end of a wagon tonguetheres money in matrimonial agencies we had about 6000 and we expected to double it in two months which is about as long as a scheme like ours can be carried on without taking out a new jersey charter  we fixed up an advertisement that read about like this      charming widow beautiful home loving 32 years possessing    3000 cash and owning valuable country property would remarry    would prefer a poor man with affectionate disposition to one with    means as she realizes that the solid virtues are oftenest to be    found in the humble walks of life no objection to elderly man    or one of homely appearance if faithful and true and competent    to manage property and invest money with judgment address with    particulars     lonely    care of peters  tucker agents cairo ill   so far so pernicious says i when we had finished the literary concoction and now says i where is the lady  andy gives me one of his looks of calm irritation  jeff says he i thought you had lost them ideas of realism in your art why should there be a lady when they sell a lot of watered stock on wall street would you expect to find a mermaid in it what has a matrimonial ad got to do with a lady  now listen says i you know my rule andy that in all my illegitimate inroads against the legal letter of the law the article sold must be existent visible producible in that way and by a careful study of city ordinances and train schedules i have kept out of all trouble with the police that a five dollar bill and a cigar could not square now to work this scheme weve got to be able to produce bodily a charming widow or its equivalent with or without the beauty hereditaments and appurtenances set forth in the catalogue and writ of errors or hereafter be held by a justice of the peace  well says andy reconstructing his mind maybe it would be safer in case the post office or the peace commission should try to investigate our agency but where he says could you hope to find a widow who would waste time on a matrimonial scheme that had no matrimony in it  i told andy that i thought i knew of the exact party an old friend of mine zeke trotter who used to draw soda water and teeth in a tent show had made his wife a widow a year before by drinking some dyspepsia cure of the old doctors instead of the liniment that he always got boozed up on i used to stop at their house often and i thought we could get her to work with us  twas only sixty miles to the little town where she lived so i jumped out on the i c and finds her in the same cottage with the same sunflowers and roosters standing on the washtub mrs trotter fitted our ad first rate except maybe for beauty and age and property valuation but she looked feasible and praiseworthy to the eye and it was a kindness to zekes memory to give her the job  is this an honest deal you are putting on mr peters she asks me when i tell her what we want  mrs trotter says i andy tucker and me have computed the calculation that 3000 men in this broad and unfair country will endeavor to secure your fair hand and ostensible money and property through our advertisement out of that number something like thirty hundred will expect to give you in exchange if they should win you the carcass of a lazy and mercenary loafer a failure in life a swindler and contemptible fortune seeker  me and andy says i propose to teach these preyers upon society a lesson it was with difficulty says i that me and andy could refrain from forming a corporation under the title of the great moral and millennial malevolent matrimonial agency does that satisfy you  it does mr peters says she i might have known you wouldnt have gone into anything that wasnt opprobrious but what will my duties be do i have to reject personally these 3000 ramscallions you speak of or can i throw them out in bunches  your job mrs trotter says i will be practically a cynosure you will live at a quiet hotel and will have no work to do andy and i will attend to all the correspondence and business end of it  of course says i some of the more ardent and impetuous suitors who can raise the railroad fare may come to cairo to personally press their suit or whatever fraction of a suit they may be wearing in that case you will be probably put to the inconvenience of kicking them out face to face we will pay you 25 per week and hotel expenses  give me five minutes says mrs trotter to get my powder rag and leave the front door key with a neighbor and you can let my salary begin  so i conveys mrs trotter to cairo and establishes her in a family hotel far enough away from mine and andys quarters to be unsuspicious and available and i tell andy  great says andy and now that your conscience is appeased as to the tangibility and proximity of the bait and leaving mutton aside suppose we revenoo a noo fish  so we began to insert our advertisement in newspapers covering the country far and wide one ad was all we used we couldnt have used more without hiring so many clerks and marcelled paraphernalia that the sound of the gum chewing would have disturbed the postmastergeneral  we placed 2000 in a bank to mrs trotters credit and gave her the book to show in case anybody might question the honesty and good faith of the agency i knew mrs trotter was square and reliable and it was safe to leave it in her name  with that one ad andy and me put in twelve hours a day answering letters  about one hundred a day was what came in i never knew there was so many large hearted but indigent men in the country who were willing to acquire a charming widow and assume the burden of investing her money   illustration about 100 a day was what came in   most of them admitted that they ran principally to whiskers and lost jobs and were misunderstood by the world but all of em were sure that they were so chock full of affection and manly qualities that the widow would be making the bargain of her life to get em  every applicant got a reply from peters  tucker informing him that the widow had been deeply impressed by his straightforward and interesting letter and requesting them to write again stating more particulars and enclosing photograph if convenient peters  tucker also informed the applicant that their fee for handing over the second letter to their fair client would be 2 enclosed therewith  there you see the simple beauty of the scheme about 90 per cent of them domestic foreign noblemen raised the price somehow and sent it in that was all there was to it except that me and andy complained an amount about being put to the trouble of slicing open them envelopes and taking the money out  some few clients called in person we sent em to mrs trotter and she did the rest except for three or four who came back to strike us for carfare after the letters began to get in from the rfd districts andy and me were taking in about 200 a day  one afternoon when we were busiest and i was stuffing the two and ones into cigar boxes and andy was whistling no wedding bells for her a small slick man drops in and runs his eye over the walls like he was on the trail of a lost gainesborough painting or two as soon as i saw him i felt a glow of pride because we were running our business on the level  i see you have quite a large mail today says the man  i reached and got my hat  come on says i weve been expecting you ill show you the goods how was teddy when you left washington  i took him down to the riverview hotel and had him shake hands with mrs trotter then i showed him her bank book with the 2000 to her credit  it seems to be all right says the secret service  it is says i and if youre not a married man ill leave you to talk a while with the lady we wont mention the two dollars  thanks says he if i wasnt i might good day mrs peters  toward the end of three months we had taken in something over 5000 and we saw it was time to quit we had a good many complaints made to us and mrs trotter seemed to be tired of the job a good many suitors had been calling to see her and she didnt seem to like that  so we decides to pull out and i goes down to mrs trotters hotel to pay her last weeks salary and say farewell and get her check for the 2000  when i got there i found her crying like a kid that dont want to go to school  now now says i whats it all about somebody sassed you or you getting homesick  no mr peters says she ill tell you you was always a friend of zekes and i dont mind mr peters im in love i just love a man so hard i cant bear not to get him hes just the ideal ive always had in mind   illustration mr peters im in love   then take him says i that is if its a mutual case does he return the sentiment according to the specifications and painfulness you have described  he does says she but hes one of the gentlemen thats been coming to see me about the advertisement and he wont marry me unless i give him the 2000 his name is william wilkinson and then she goes off again in the agitations and hysterics of romance  mrs trotter says i theres no man more sympathizing with a womans affections than i am besides you was once the life partner of one of my best friends if it was left to me id say take this 2000 and the man of your choice and be happy  we could afford to do that because we have cleaned up over 5000 from these suckers that wanted to marry you but says i andy tucker is to be consulted  he is a good man but keen in business he is my equal partner financially i will talk to andy says i and see what can be done  i goes back to our hotel and lays the case before andy  i was expecting something like this all the time says andy you cant trust a woman to stick by you in any scheme that involves her emotions and preferences  its a sad thing andy says i to think that weve been the cause of the breaking of a womans heart  it is says andy and i tell you what im willing to do jeff youve always been a man of a soft and generous heart and disposition perhaps ive been too hard and worldly and suspicious for once ill meet you half way go to mrs trotter and tell her to draw the 2000 from the bank and give it to this man shes infatuated with and be happy  i jumps up and shakes andys hand for five minutes and then i goes back to mrs trotter and tells her and she cries as hard for joy as she did for sorrow  two days afterward me and andy packed up to go  wouldnt you like to go down and meet mrs trotter once before we leave i asks him shed like mightily to know you and express her encomiums and gratitude  why i guess not says andy i guess wed better hurry and catch that train  i was strapping our capital around me in a memory belt like we always carried it when andy pulls a roll of large bills out of his pocket and asks me to put em with the rest  whats this says i   illustration whats this says i   its mrs trotters two thousand says andy  how do you come to have it i asks  she gave it to me says andy ive been calling on her three evenings a week for more than a month  then are you william wilkinson says i  i was says andy     a midsummer masquerade   satan said jeff peters is a hard boss to work for when other people are having their vacation is when he keeps you the busiest as old dr watts or st paul or some other diagnostician says he always finds somebody for idle hands to do  i remember one summer when me and my partner andy tucker tried to take a layoff from our professional and business duties but it seems that our work followed us wherever we went  now with a preacher its different he can throw off his responsibilities and enjoy himself on the 31st of may he wraps mosquito netting and tin foil around the pulpit grabs his niblick breviary and fishing pole and hikes for lake como or atlantic city according to the size of the loudness with which he has been called by his congregation and sir for three months he dont have to think about business except to hunt around in deuteronomy and proverbs and timothy to find texts to cover and exculpate such little midsummer penances as dropping a couple of looey door on rouge or teaching a presbyterian widow to swim  but i was going to tell you about mine and andys summer vacation that wasnt one  we was tired of finance and all the branches of unsanctified ingenuity even andy whose brain rarely ever stopped working began to make noises like a tennis cabinet  heigh ho says andy im tired ive got that steam up the yacht corsair and ho for the riviera feeling i want to loaf and indict my soul as walt whittier says i want to play pinochle with merry del val or give a knouting to the tenants on my tarrytown estates or do a monologue at a chautauqua picnic in kilts or something summery and outside the line of routine and sandbagging  patience says i youll have to climb higher in the profession before you can taste the laurels that crown the footprints of the great captains of industry now what id like andy says i would be a summer sojourn in a mountain village far from scenes of larceny labor and overcapitalization im tired too and a month or so of sinlessness ought to leave us in good shape to begin again to take away the white mans burdens in the fall  andy fell in with the rest cure at once so we struck the general passenger agents of all the railroads for summer resort literature and took a week to study out where we should go i reckon the first passenger agent in the world was that man genesis but there wasnt much competition in his day and when he said the lord made the earth in six days and all very good he hadnt any idea to what extent the press agents of the summer hotels would plagiarize from him later on  when we finished the booklets we perceived easy that the united states from passadumkeg maine to el paso and from skagway to key west was a paradise of glorious mountain peaks crystal lakes new laid eggs golf girls garages cooling breezes straw rides open plumbing and tennis and all within two hours ride  so me and andy dumps the books out the back window and packs our trunk and takes the 6 oclock tortoise flyer for crow knob a kind of a dernier resort in the mountains on the line of tennessee and north carolina   illustration dumps the books out of the back window   we was directed to a kind of private hotel called woodchuck inn and thither me and andy bent and almost broke our footsteps over the rocks and stumps the inn set back from the road in a big grove of trees and it looked fine with its broad porches and a lot of women in white dresses rocking in the shade the rest of crow knob was a post office and some scenery set an angle of fortyfive degrees and a welkin  well sir when we got to the gate who do you suppose comes down the walk to greet us old smokeemout smithers who used to be the best open air painless dentist and electric liver pad faker in the southwest  old smokeemout is dressed clericorural and has the mingled air of a landlord and a claim jumper which aspect he corroborates by telling us that he is the host and perpetrator of woodchuck inn i introduces andy and we talk about a few volatile topics such as will go around at meetings of boards of directors and old associates like us three were old smokeemout leads us into a kind of summer house in the yard near the gate and took up the harp of life and smote on all the chords with his mighty right  gents says he im glad to see you maybe you can help me out of a scrape im getting a bit old for street work so i leased this dogdays emporium so the good things would come to me two weeks before the season opened i gets a letter signed lieut peary and one from the duke of marlborough each wanting to engage board for part of the summer  well sir you gents know what a big thing for an obscure hustlery it would be to have for guests two gentlemen whose names are famous from long association with icebergs and the coburgs so i prints a lot of handbills announcing that woodchuck inn would shelter these distinguished boarders during the summer except in places where it leaked and i sends em out to towns around as far as knoxville and charlotte and fish dam and bowling green  and now look up there on the porch gents says smokeemout at them disconsolate specimens of their fair sex waiting for the arrival of the duke and the lieutenant the house is packed from rafters to cellar with hero worshippers  theres four normal school teachers and two abnormal theres three high school graduates between 37 and 42 theres two literary old maids and one that can write theres a couple of society women and a lady from haw river two elocutionists are bunking in the corn crib and ive put cots in the hay loft for the cook and the society editress of the chattanooga opera glass you see how names draw gents  well says i how is it that you seem to be biting your thumbs at good luck you didnt use to be that way  i aint through says smokeemout yesterday was the day for the advent of the auspicious personages i goes down to the depot to welcome em two apparently animate substances gets off the train both carrying bags full of croquet mallets and these magic lanterns with pushbuttons  i compares these integers with the original signatures to the letters and well gents i reckon the mistake was due to my poor eyesight instead of being the lieutenant the daisy chain and wild verbena explorer was none other than levi t peevy a soda water clerk from asheville and the duke of marlborough turned out to be theo drake of murfreesborough a bookkeeper in a grocery what did i do i kicked em both back on the train and watched em depart for the lowlands the low   illustration instead of the lieut and the duke   now you see the fix im in gents goes on smokeemout smithers i told the ladies that the notorious visitors had been detained on the road by some unavoidable circumstances that made a noise like an ice jam and an heiress but they would arrive a day or two later when they find out that theyve been deceived says smokeemout every yard of cross barred muslin and natural waved switch in the house will pack up and leave its a hard deal says old smokeemout  friend says andy touching the old man on the æsophagus why this jeremiad when the polar regions and the portals of blenheim are conspiring to hand you prosperity on a hallmarked silver salver we have arrived  a light breaks out on smokeemouts face  can you do it gents he asks could ye do it could ye play the polar man and the little duke for the nice ladies will ye do it   illustration can ye do it gents he asks   i see that andy is superimposed with his old hankering for the oral and polyglot system of buncoing that man had a vocabulary of about 10000 words and synonyms which arrayed themselves into contraband sophistries and parables when they came out  listen says andy to old smokeemout can we do it you behold before you mr smithers two of the finest equipped men on earth for inveigling the proletariat whether by word of mouth sleightofhand or swiftness of foot dukes come and go explorers go and get lost but me and jeff peters says andy go after the comeons forever if you say so were the two illustrious guests you were expecting and youll find says andy that well give you the true local color of the title rôles from the aurora borealis to the ducal portcullis  old smokeemout is delighted he takes me and andy up to the inn by an arm apiece telling us on the way that the finest fruits of the can and luxuries of the fast freights should be ours without price as long as we would stay  on the porch smokeemout says ladies i have the honor to introduce his gracefulness the duke of marlborough and the famous inventor of the north pole lieut peary  the skirts all flutter and the rocking chairs squeak as me and andy bows and then goes on in with old smokeemout to register and then we washed up and turned our cuffs and the landlord took us to the rooms hed been saving for us and got out a demijohn of north carolina real mountain dew  i expected trouble when andy began to drink he has the artistic metempsychosis which is half drunk when sober and looks down on airships when stimulated  after lingering with the demijohn me and andy goes out on the porch where the ladies are to begin to earn our keep we sit in two special chairs and then the schoolmaams and literaterrers hunched their rockers close around us  one lady says to me how did that last venture of yours turn out sir  now id clean forgot to have an understanding with andy which i was to be the duke or the lieutenant and i couldnt tell from her question whether she was referring to arctic or matrimonial expeditions so i gave an answer that would cover both cases  well maam says i it was a freeze outright smart of a freeze out maam  and then the flood gates of andys perorations was opened and i knew which one of the renowned ostensible guests i was supposed to be i wasnt either andy was both and still furthermore it seemed that he was trying to be the mouthpiece of the whole british nobility and of arctic exploration from sir john franklin down it was the union of corn whiskey and the conscientious fictional form that mr w d howletts admires so much  ladies says andy smiling semicircularly i am truly glad to visit america i do not consider the magna charta says he or gas balloons or snowshoes in any way a detriment to the beauty and charm of your american women skyscrapers or the architecture of your icebergs the next time says andy that i go after the north pole all the vanderbilts in greenland wont be able to turn me out in the coldi mean make it hot for me  tell us about one of your trips lieutenant says one of the normals  sure says andy getting the decision over a hiccup it was in the spring of last year that i sailed the castle of blenheim up to latitude 87 degrees fahrenheit and beat the record ladies says andy it was a sad sight to see a duke allied by a civil and liturgical chattel mortgage to one of your first families lost in a region of semiannual days and then he goes on at four bells we sighted westminster abbey but there was not a drop to eat at noon we threw out five sandbags and the ship rose fifteen knots higher at midnight continues andy the restaurants closed sitting on a cake of ice we ate seven hot dogs all around us was snow and ice six times a night the boatswain rose up and tore a leaf off the calendar so we could keep time with the barometer at 12 says andy with a lot of anguish on his face three huge polar bears sprang down the hatchway into the cabin and then  what then lieutenant says a schoolmaam excitedly  andy gives a loud sob  the duchess shook me he cries out and slides out of the chair and weeps on the porch  well of course that fixed the scheme the women boarders all left the next morning the landlord wouldnt speak to us for two days but when he found we had money to pay our way he loosened up  so me and andy had a quiet restful summer after all coming away from crow knob with 1100 that we enticed out of old smokeemout playing seven up     shearing the wolf   jeff peters was always eloquent when the ethics of his profession was under discussion  the only times said he that me and andy tucker ever had any hiatuses in our cordial intents was when we differed on the moral aspects of grafting andy had his standards and i had mine i didnt approve of all of andys schemes for levying contributions from the public and he thought i allowed my conscience to interfere too often for the financial good of the firm we had high arguments sometimes one word led on to another till he said i reminded him of rockefeller  i dont know how you mean that andy says i but we have been friends too long for me to take offense at a taunt that you will regret when you cool off i have yet says i to shake hands with a subpoena server  one summer me and andy decided to rest up a spell in a fine little town in the mountains of kentucky called grassdale we was supposed to be horse drovers and good decent citizens besides taking a summer vacation the grassdale people liked us and me and andy declared a cessation of hostilities never so much as floating the fly leaf of a rubber concession prospectus or flashing a brazilian diamond while we was there  one day the leading hardware merchant of grassdale drops around to the hotel where me and andy stopped and smokes with us sociable on the side porch we knew him pretty well from pitching quoits in the afternoons in the court house yard he was a loud red man breathing hard but fat and respectable beyond all reason   illustration pitching quoits in the afternoon in the court house yard   after we talk on all the notorious themes of the day this murkison for such was his entitlementstakes a letter out of his coat pocket in a careful careless way and hands it to us to read  now what do you think of that says he laughinga letter like that to me  me and andy sees at a glance what it is but we pretend to read it through it was one of them old time typewritten green goods letters explaining how for 1000 you could get 5000 in bills that an expert couldnt tell from the genuine and going on to tell how they were made from plates stolen by an employee of the treasury at washington  think of em sending a letter like that to me says murkison again   illustration think of em sending a letter like that to me   lots of good men get em says andy if you dont answer the first letter they let you drop if you answer it they write again asking you to come on with your money and do business  but think of em writing to me says murkison  a few days later he drops around again  boys says he i know you are all right or i wouldnt confide in you i wrote to them rascals again just for fun they answered and told me to come on to chicago they said telegraph to j smith when i would start when i get there im to wait on a certain street corner till a man in a gray suit comes along and drops a newspaper in front of me then i am to ask him how the water is and he knows its me and i know its him  ah yes says andy gaping its the same old game ive often read about it in the papers then he conducts you to the private abattoir in the hotel where mr jones is already waiting they show you brand new real money and sell you all you want at five for one you see em put it in a satchel for you and know its there of course its brown paper when you come to look at it afterward   illustration of course its brown paper   oh they couldnt switch it on me says murkison i havent built up the best paying business in grassdale without having witticisms about me you say its real money they show you mr tucker  ive alwaysi see by the papers that it always is says andy  boys says murkison ive got it in my mind that them fellows cant fool me i think ill put a couple of thousand in my jeans and go up there and put it all over em if bill murkison gets his eyes once on them bills they show him hell never take em off of em they offer 5 for 1 and theyll have to stick to the bargain if i tackle em thats the kind of trader bill murkison is yes i jist believe ill drop up chicago way and take a 5 to 1 shot on j smith i guess the waterll be fine enough  me and andy tries to get this financial misquotation out of murkisons head but we might as well have tried to keep the man who rolls peanuts with a toothpick from betting on bryans election no sir he was going to perform a public duty by catching these green goods swindlers at their own game maybe it would teach em a lesson  after murkison left us me and andy sat a while prepondering over our silent meditations and heresies of reason in our idle hours we always improved our higher selves by ratiocination and mental thought  jeff says andy after a long time quite unseldom i have seen fit to impugn your molars when you have been chewing the rag with me about your conscientious way of doing business i may have been often wrong but here is a case where i think we can agree i feel that it would be wrong for us to allow mr murkison to go alone to meet those chicago green goods men there is but one way it can end dont you think we would both feel better if we was to intervene in some way and prevent the doing of this deed  i got up and shook andy tuckers hand hard and long  andy says i i may have had one or two hard thoughts about the heartlessness of your corporation but i retract em now you have a kind nucleus at the interior of your exterior after all it does you credit i was just thinking the same thing that you have expressed it would not be honorable or praiseworthy says i for us to let murkison go on with this project he has taken up if he is determined to go let us go with him and prevent this swindle from coming off  andy agreed with me and i was glad to see that he was in earnest about breaking up this green goods scheme  i dont call myself a religious man says i or a fanatic in moral bigotry but i cant stand still and see a man who has built up his business by his own efforts and brains and risk be robbed by an unscrupulous trickster who is a menace to the public good  right jeff says andy well stick right along with murkison if he insists on going and block this funny business id hate to see any money dropped in it as bad as you would  well we went to see murkison  no boys says he i cant consent to let the song of this chicago siren waft by me on the summer breeze ill fry some fat out of this ignis fatuus or burn a hole in the skillet but id be plumb diverted to death to have you all go along with me maybe you could help some when it comes to cashing in the ticket to that 5 to 1 shot yes id really take it as a pastime and regalement if you boys would go along too  murkison gives it out in grassdale that he is going for a few days with mr peters and mr tucker to look over some iron ore property in west virginia he wires j smith that he will set foot in the spider web on a given date and the three of us lights out for chicago  on the way murkison amuses himself with premonitions and advance pleasant recollections  in a gray suit says he on the southwest corner of wabash avenue and lake street he drops the paper and i ask how the water is oh my my my and then he laughs all over for five minutes  sometimes murkison was serious and tried to talk himself out of his cogitations whatever they was  boys says he i wouldnt have this to get out in grassdale for ten times a thousand dollars it would ruin me there but i know you all are all right i think its the duty of every citizen says he to try to do up these robbers that prey upon the public ill show em whether the waters fine five dollars for onethats what j smith offers and hell have to keep his contract if he does business with bill murkison  we got into chicago about 7 pm murkison was to meet the gray man at half past 9 we had dinner at a hotel and then went up to murkisons room to wait for the time to come  now boys says murkison lets get our gumption together and inoculate a plan for defeating the enemy suppose while im exchanging airy bandage with the gray capper you gents come along by accident you know and holler hello murk and shake hands with symptoms of surprise and familiarity then i take the capper aside and tell him you all are jenkins and brown of grassdale groceries and feed good men and maybe willing to take a chance while away from home  bring em along hell say of course if they care to invest now how does that scheme strike you  what do you say jeff says andy looking at me  why ill tell you what i say says i i say lets settle this thing right here now i dont see any use of wasting any more time i took a nickelplated 38 out of my pocket and clicked the cylinder around a few times  you undevout sinful insidious hog says i to murkison get out that two thousand and lay it on the table obey with velocity says i for otherwise alternatives are impending i am preferably a man of mildness but now and then i find myself in the middle of extremities such men as you i went on after he had laid the money out is what keeps the jails and court houses going you come up here to rob these men of their money does it excuse you i asks that they were trying to skin you no sir you was going to rob peter to stand off paul you are ten times worse says i than that green goods man you go to church at home and pretend to be a decent citizen but youll come to chicago and commit larceny from men that have built up a sound and profitable business by dealing with such contemptible scoundrels as you have tried to be today how do you know says i that that green goods man hasnt a large family dependent upon his extortions its you supposedly respectable citizens who are always on the lookout to get something for nothing says i that support the lotteries and wildcat mines and stock exchanges and wire tappers of this country if it wasnt for you theyd go out of business the green goods man you was going to rob says i studied maybe for years to learn his trade every turn he makes he risks his money and liberty and maybe his life you come up here all sanctified and vanoplied with respectability and a pleasing post office address to swindle him if he gets the money you can squeal to the police if you get it he hocks the gray suit to buy supper and says nothing mr tucker and me sized you up says i and came along to see that you got what you deserved hand over the money says i you grass fed hypocrite  i put the two thousand which was all in 20 bills in my inside pocket  now get out your watch says i to murkison no i dont want it says i lay it on the table and you sit in that chair till it ticks off an hour then you can go if you make any noise or leave any sooner well handbill you all over grassdale i guess your high position there is worth more than 2000 to you  then me and andy left  on the train andy was a long time silent then he says jeff do you mind my asking you a question  two says i or forty  was that the idea you had says he when we started out with murkison  why certainly says i what else could it have been wasnt it yours too  in about half an hour andy spoke again i think there are times when andy dont exactly understand my system of ethics and moral hygiene  jeff says he some time when you have the leisure i wish youd draw off a diagram and footnotes of that conscience of yours id like to have it to refer to occasionally     innocents of broadway   i hope some day to retire from business said jeff peters and when i do i dont want anybody to be able to say that i ever got a dollar of any mans money without giving him a quid pro rata for it ive always managed to leave a customer some little gewgaw to paste in his scrapbook or stick between his seth thomas clock and the wall after we are through trading  there was one time i came near having to break this rule of mine and do a profligate and illaudable action but i was saved from it by the laws and statutes of our great and profitable country  one summer me and andy tucker my partner went to new york to lay in our annual assortment of clothes and gents furnishings we was always pompous and regardless dressers finding that looks went further than anything else in our business except maybe our knowledge of railroad schedules and an autograph photo of the president that loeb sent us probably by mistake andy wrote a nature letter once and sent it in about animals that he had seen caught in a trap lots of times loeb must have read it triplets instead of trap lots and sent the photo anyhow it was useful to us to show people as a guarantee of good faith  me and andy never cared much to do business in new york it was too much like pothunting catching suckers in that town is like dynamiting a texas lake for bass all you have to do anywhere between the north and east rivers is to stand in the street with an open bag marked drop packages of money here no checks or loose bills taken you have a cop handy to club pikers who try to chip in post office orders and canadian money and thats all there is to new york for a hunter who loves his profession so me and andy used to just nature fake the town wed get out our spyglasses and watch the woodcocks along the broadway swamps putting plaster casts on their broken legs and then wed sneak away without firing a shot  one day in the papier mâché palm room of a chloral hydrate and hops agency in a side street about eight inches off broadway me and andy had thrust upon us the acquaintance of a new yorker we had beer together until we discovered that each of us knew a man named hellsmith traveling for a stove factory in duluth this caused us to remark that the world was a very small place and then this new yorker busts his string and takes off his tin foil and excelsior packing and starts in giving us his ellen terris beginning with the time he used to sell shoelaces to the indians on the spot where tammany hall now stands  this new yorker had made his money keeping a cigar store in beekman street and he hadnt been above fourteenth street in ten years moreover he had whiskers and the time had gone by when a true sport will do anything to a man with whiskers no grafter except a boy who is soliciting subscribers to an illustrated weekly to win the prize air rifle or a widow would have the heart to tamper with the man behind with the razor he was a typical city reubid bet the man hadnt been out of sight of a skyscraper in twentyfive years  well presently this metropolitan backwoodsman pulls out a roll of bills with an old blue sleeve elastic fitting tight around it and opens it up  theres 5000 mr peters says he shoving it over the table to me saved during my fifteen years of business put that in your pocket and keep it for me mr peters im glad to meet you gentlemen from the west and i may take a drop too much i want you to take care of my money for me now lets have another beer   illustration i want you to take care of my money for me   youd better keep this yourself says i we are strangers to you and you cant trust everybody you meet put your roll back in your pocket says i and youd better run along home before some farmhand from the kaw river bottoms strolls in here and sells you a copper mine  oh i dont know says whiskers i guess little old new york can take care of herself i guess i know a man thats on the square when i see him ive always found the western people all right i ask you as a favor mr peters says he to keep that roll in your pocket for me i know a gentleman when i see him and now lets have some more beer  in about ten minutes this fall of manna leans back in his chair and snores andy looks at me and says i reckon id better stay with him for five minutes or so in case the waiter comes in  i went out the side door and walked half a block up the street and then i came back and sat down at the table  andy says i i cant do it its too much like swearing off taxes i cant go off with this mans money without doing something to earn it like taking advantage of the bankrupt act or leaving a bottle of eczema lotion in his pocket to make it look more like a square deal  well says andy it does seem kind of hard on ones professional pride to lope off with a bearded pards competency especially after he has nominated you custodian of his bundle in the sappy insouciance of his urban indiscrimination suppose we wake him up and see if we can formulate some commercial sophistry by which he will be enabled to give us both his money and a good excuse  we wakes up whiskers he stretches himself and yawns out the hypothesis that he must have dropped off for a minute and then he says he wouldnt mind sitting in at a little gentlemans game of poker he used to play some when he attended high school in brooklyn and as he was out for a good time whyand so forth  andy brights up a little at that for it looks like it might be a solution to our financial troubles so we all three go to our hotel further down broadway and have the cards and chips brought up to andys room i tried once more to make this babe in the horticultural gardens take his five thousand but no  keep that little roll for me mr peters says he and oblige ill ask you fer it when i want it i guess i know when im among friends a man thats done business on beekman street for twenty years right in the heart of the wisest old village on earth ought to know what hes about i guess i can tell a gentleman from a con man or a flimflammer when i meet him ive got some odd change in my clothes enough to start the game with i guess  he goes through his pockets and rains 20 gold certificates on the table till it looked like a 10000 autumn day in a lemon grove picture by turner in the salons andy almost smiled  the first round that was dealt this boulevardier slaps down his hand claims low and jack and big casino and rakes in the pot  andy always took a pride in his poker playing he got up from the table and looked sadly out of the window at the street cars  well gentlemen says the cigar man i dont blame you for not wanting to play ive forgotten the fine points of the game i guess its been so long since i indulged now how long are you gentlemen going to be in the city  i told him about a week longer he says thatll suit him fine his cousin is coming over from brooklyn that evening and they are going to see the sights of new york his cousin he says is in the artificial limb and lead casket business and hasnt crossed the bridge in eight years they expect to have the time of their lives and he winds up by asking me to keep his roll of money for him till next day i tried to make him take it but it only insulted him to mention it  ill use what ive got in loose change says he you keep the rest for me ill drop in on you and mr tucker tomorrow afternoon about 6 or 7 says he and well have dinner together be good  after whiskers had gone andy looked at me curious and doubtful  well jeff says he it looks like the ravens are trying to feed us two elijahs so hard that if we turned em down again we ought to have the audubon society after us it wont do to put the crown aside too often i know this is something like paternalism but dont you think opportunity has skinned its knuckles about enough knocking at our door  i put my feet up on the table and my hands in my pockets which is an attitude unfavorable to frivolous thoughts  andy says i this man with the hirsute whiskers has got us in a predicament we cant move hand or foot with his money you and me have got a gentlemans agreement with fortune that we cant break weve done business in the west where its more of a fair game out there the people we skin are trying to skin us even the farmers and the remittance men that the magazines send out to write up goldfields but theres little sport in new york city for rod reel or gun they hunt here with either one of two thingsa slungshot or a letter of introduction the town has been stocked so full of carp that the game fish are all gone if you spread a net here do you catch legitimate suckers in it such as the lord intended to be caughtfresh guys who know it all sports with a little coin and the nerve to play another mans game street crowds out for the fun of dropping a dollar or two and village smarties who know just where the little pea is no sir says i what the grafters live on here is widows and orphans and foreigners who save up a bag of money and hand it out over the first counter they see with an iron railing to it and factory girls and little shopkeepers that never leave the block they do business on thats what they call suckers here theyre nothing but canned sardines and all the bait you need to catch em is a pocketknife and a soda cracker  now this cigar man i went on is one of the types hes lived twenty years on one street without learning as much as you would in getting a onceover shave from a lockjawed barber in a kansas crossroads town but hes a new yorker and hell brag about that all the time when he isnt picking up live wires or getting in front of street cars or paying out money to wiretappers or standing under a safe thats being hoisted into a skyscraper when a new yorker does loosen up says i its like the spring decomposition of the ice jam in the allegheny river hell swamp you with cracked ice and backwater if you dont get out of the way  its mighty lucky for us andy says i that this cigar exponent with the parsley dressing saw fit to bedeck us with his childlike trust and altruism for says i this money of his is an eyesore to my sense of rectitude and ethics we cant take it andy you know we cant says i for we havent a shadow of a title to itnot a shadow if there was the least bit of a way we could put in a claim to it id be willing to see him start in for another twenty years and make another 5000 for himself but we havent sold him anything we havent been embroiled in a trade or anything commercial he approached us friendly says i and with blind and beautiful idiocy laid the stuff in our hands well have to give it back to him when he wants it   illustration we cant take it andy   your arguments says andy are past criticism or comprehension no we cant walk off with the moneyas things now stand i admire your conscious way of doing business jeff says andy and i wouldnt propose anything that wasnt square in line with your theories of morality and initiative  but ill be away tonight and most of tomorrow jeff says andy ive got some business affairs that i want to attend to when this free greenbacks party comes in tomorrow afternoon hold him here till i arrive weve all got an engagement for dinner you know  well sir about 5 the next afternoon in trips the cigar man with his eyes half open  been having a glorious time mr peters says he took in all the sights i tell you new york is the onliest only now if you dont mind says he ill lie down on that couch and doze off for about nine minutes before mr tucker comes im not used to being up all night and tomorrow if you dont mind mr peters ill take that five thousand i met a man last night thats got a sure winner at the racetrack tomorrow excuse me for being so impolite as to go to sleep mr peters  and so this inhabitant of the second city in the world reposes himself and begins to snore while i sit there musing over things and wishing i was back in the west where you could always depend on a customer fighting to keep his money hard enough to let your conscience take it from him  at halfpast 5 andy comes in and sees the sleeping form  ive been over to trenton says andy pulling a document out of his pocket i think ive got this matter fixed up all right jeff look at that  i open the paper and see that it is a corporation charter issued by the state of new jersey to the peters  tucker consolidated and amalgamated aerial franchise development company limited  its to buy up rights of way for airship lines explained andy the legislature wasnt in session but i found a man at a postcard stand in the lobby that kept a stock of charters on hand there are 100000 shares says andy expected to reach a par value of 1 i had one blank certificate of stock printed  andy takes out the blank and begins to fill it in with a fountain pen  the whole bunch says he goes to our friend in dreamland for 5000 did you learn his name  make it out to bearer says i  we put the certificate of stock in the cigar mans hand and went out to pack our suit cases   illustration we put the certificate of stock in the cigarmans hand   on the ferryboat andy says to me is your conscience easy about taking the money now jeff  why shouldnt it be says i are we any better than any other holding corporation     conscience in art   i never could hold my partner andy tucker down to legitimate ethics of pure swindling said jeff peters to me one day  andy had too much imagination to be honest he used to devise schemes of moneygetting so fraudulent and highfinancial that they wouldnt have been allowed in the bylaws of a railroad rebate system  myself i never believed in taking any mans dollars unless i gave him something for itsomething in the way of rolled gold jewelry garden seeds lumbago lotion stock certificates stove polish or a crack on the head to show for his money i guess i must have had new england ancestors away back and inherited some of their stanch and rugged fear of the police  but andys family tree was in different kind i dont think he could have traced his descent any further back than a corporation  one summer while we was in the middle west working down the ohio valley with a line of family albums headache powders and roach destroyer andy takes one of his notions of high and actionable financiering  jeff says he ive been thinking that we ought to drop these rutabaga fanciers and give our attention to something more nourishing and prolific if we keep on snapshooting these hinds for their egg money well be classed as nature fakers how about plunging into the fastnesses of the skyscraper country and biting some big bull caribous in the chest  well says i you know my idiosyncrasies i prefer a square nonillegal style of business such as we are carrying on now when i take money i want to leave some tangible object in the other fellows hands for him to gaze at and to distract his attention from my spoor even if its only a komical kuss trick finger ring for squirting perfume in a friends eye but if youve got a fresh idea andy says i lets have a look at it im not so wedded to petty graft that i would refuse something better in the way of a subsidy  i was thinking says andy of a little hunt without horn hound or camera among the great herd of the midas americanus commonly known as the pittsburg millionaires  in new york i asks  no sir says andy in pittsburg thats their habitat they dont like new york they go there now and then just because its expected of em  a pittsburg millionaire in new york is like a fly in a cup of hot coffeehe attracts attention and comment but he dont enjoy it new york ridicules him for blowing so much money in that town of sneaks and snobs and sneers the truth is he dont spend anything while he is there i saw a memorandum of expenses for a ten days trip to bunkum town made by a pittsburg man worth 15000000 once heres the way he set it down      r r fare to and from            21 00    cab fare to and from hotel            2 00    hotel bill  5 per day             50 00    tips                   5750 00                                                 total                5823 00   thats the voice of new york goes on andy the towns nothing but a head waiter if you tip it too much itll go and stand by the door and make fun of you to the hat check boy when a pittsburger wants to spend money and have a good time he stays at home thats where well go to catch him  well to make a dense story more condensed me and andy cached our paris green and antipyrine powders and albums in a friends cellar and took the trail to pittsburg andy didnt have any especial prospectus of chicanery and violence drawn up but he always had plenty of confidence that his immoral nature would rise to any occasion that presented itself  as a concession to my ideas of selfpreservation and rectitude he promised that if i should take an active and incriminating part in any little business venture that we might work up there should be something actual and cognizant to the senses of touch sight taste or smell to transfer to the victim for the money so my conscience might rest easy after that i felt better and entered more cheerfully into the foul play  andy says i as we strayed through the smoke along the cinderpath they call smithfield street had you figured out how we are going to get acquainted with these coke kings and pig iron squeezers not that i would decry my own worth or system of drawing room deportment and work with the olive fork and pie knife says i but isnt the entree nous into the salons of the stogie smokers going to be harder than you imagined  if theres any handicap at all says andy its our own refinement and inherent culture pittsburg millionaires are a fine body of plain wholehearted unassuming democratic men  they are rough but uncivil in their manners and though their ways are boisterous and unpolished under it all they have a great deal of impoliteness and discourtesy nearly every one of em rose from obscurity says andy and theyll live in it till the town gets to using smoke consumers if we act simple and unaffected and dont go too far from the saloons and keep making a noise like an import duty on steel rails we wont have any trouble in meeting some of em socially  well andy and me drifted about town three or four days getting our bearings we got to knowing several millionaires by sight  one used to stop his automobile in front of our hotel and have a quart of champagne brought out to him when the waiter opened it hed turn it up to his mouth and drink it out of the bottle that showed he used to be a glassblower before he made his money  one evening andy failed to come to the hotel for dinner about 11 oclock he came into my room  landed one jeff says he twelve millions oil rolling mills real estate and natural gas hes a fine man no airs about him made all his money in the last five years hes got professors posting him up now in educationart and literature and haberdashery and such things  when i saw him hed just won a bet of 10000 with a steel corporation man that thered be four suicides in the allegheny rolling mills today so everybody in sight had to walk up and have drinks on him he took a fancy to me and asked me to dinner with him we went to a restaurant in diamond alley and sat on stools and had a sparkling moselle and clam chowder and apple fritters  then he wanted to show me his bachelor apartment on liberty street hes got ten rooms over a fish market with privilege of the bath on the next floor above he told me it cost him 18000 to furnish his apartment and i believe it  hes got 40000 worth of pictures in one room and 20000 worth of curios and antiques in another his names scudder and hes 45 and taking lessons on the piano and 15000 barrels of oil a day out of his wells  all right says i preliminary canter satisfactory but kay vooly voo what good is the art junk to us and the oil  now that man says andy sitting thoughtfully on the bed aint what you would call an ordinary scutt when he was showing me his cabinet of art curios his face lighted up like the door of a coke oven he says that if some of his big deals go through hell make j p morgans collection of sweatshop tapestry and augusta me beadwork look like the contents of an ostrichs craw thrown on a screen by a magic lantern  and then he showed me a little carving went on andy that anybody could see was a wonderful thing it was something like 2000 years old he said it was a lotus flower with a womans face in it carved out of a solid piece of ivory  scudder looks it up in a catalogue and describes it an egyptian carver named khafra made two of em for king rameses ii about the year bc the other one cant be found the junkshops and antique bugs have rubbered all europe for it but it seems to be out of stock scudder paid 2000 for the one he has  oh well says i this sounds like the purling of a rill to me i thought we came here to teach the millionaires business instead of learning art from em  be patient says andy kindly maybe we will see a rift in the smoke ere long  all the next morning andy was out i didnt see him until about noon he came to the hotel and called me into his room across the hall he pulled a roundish bundle about as big as a goose egg out of his pocket and unwrapped it it was an ivory carving just as he had described the millionaires to me  i went in an old second hand store and pawnshop a while ago says andy and i see this half hidden under a lot of old daggers and truck the pawnbroker said hed had it several years and thinks it was soaked by some arabs or turks or some foreign dubs that used to live down by the river  i offered him 2 for it and i must have looked like i wanted it for he said it would be taking the pumpernickel out of his childrens mouths to hold any conversation that did not lead up to a price of 35 i finally got it for 25  jeff goes on andy this is the exact counterpart of scudders carving its absolutely a dead ringer for it hell pay 2000 for it as quick as hed tuck a napkin under his chin and why shouldnt it be the genuine other one anyhow that the old gypsy whittled out  why not indeed says i and how shall we go about compelling him to make a voluntary purchase of it  andy had his plan all ready and ill tell you how we carried it out  i got a pair of blue spectacles put on my black frock coat rumpled my hair up and became prof pickleman i went to another hotel registered and sent a telegram to scudder to come to see me at once on important art business the elevator dumped him on me in less than an hour he was a foggy man with a clarion voice smelling of connecticut wrappers and naphtha  hello profess he shouts hows your conduct  i rumpled my hair some more and gave him a blue glass stare  sir says i are you cornelius t scudder of pittsburg pennsylvania  i am says he come out and have a drink  ive neither the time nor the desire says i for such harmful and deleterious amusements i have come from new york says i on a matter of busion a matter of art  i learned there that you are the owner of an egyptian ivory carving of the time of rameses ii representing the head of queen isis in a lotus flower there were only two of such carvings made one has been lost for many years i recently discovered and purchased the other in a pawnin an obscure museum in vienna i wish to purchase yours name your price  well the great ice jams profess says scudder have you found the other one me sell no i dont guess cornelius scudder needs to sell anything that he wants to keep have you got the carving with you profess  i shows it to scudder he examines it careful all over  its the article says he its a duplicate of mine every line and curve of it tell you what ill do he says i wont sell but ill buy give you 2500 for yours  since you wont sell i will says i large bills please im a man of few words i must return to new york tonight i lecture tomorrow at the aquarium  scudder sends a check down and the hotel cashes it he goes off with his piece of antiquity and i hurry back to andys hotel according to arrangement  andy is walking up and down the room looking at his watch  well he says  twentyfive hundred says i cash  weve got just eleven minutes says andy to catch the b  o westbound grab your baggage  whats the hurry says i it was a square deal and even if it was only an imitation of the original carving itll take him some time to find it out he seemed to be sure it was the genuine article  it was says andy it was his own when i was looking at his curios yesterday he stepped out of the room for a moment and i pocketed it now will you pick up your suit case and hurry  then says i why was that story about finding another one in the pawn  oh says andy out of respect for that conscience of yours come on     the man higher up   across our two dishes of spaghetti in a corner of provenzanos restaurant jeff peters was explaining to me the three kinds of graft  every winter jeff comes to new york to eat spaghetti to watch the shipping in east river from the depths of his chinchilla overcoat and to lay in a supply of chicagomade clothing at one of the fulton street stores during the other three seasons he may be found further westhis range is from spokane to tampa in his profession he takes a pride which he supports and defends with a serious and unique philosophy of ethics his profession is no new one he is an incorporated uncapitalized unlimited asylum for the reception of the restless and unwise dollars of his fellowmen  in the wilderness of stone in which jeff seeks his annual lonely holiday he is glad to palaver of his many adventures as a boy will whistle after sundown in a wood wherefore i mark on my calendar the time of his coming and open a question of privilege at provenzanos concerning the little winestained table in the corner between the rakish rubber plant and the framed palazzio della something on the wall  there are two kinds of graft said jeff that ought to be wiped out by law i mean wall street speculation and burglary  nearly everybody will agree with you as to one of them said i with a laugh  well burglary ought to be wiped out too said jeff and i wondered whether the laugh had been redundant  about three months ago said jeff it was my privilege to become familiar with a sample of each of the aforesaid branches of illegitimate art i was sine qua grata with a member of the housebreakers union and one of the john d napoleons of finance at the same time  interesting combination said i with a yawn did i tell you i bagged a duck and a groundsquirrel at one shot last week over in the ramapos i knew well how to draw jeffs stories  let me tell you first about these barnacles that clog the wheels of society by poisoning the springs of rectitude with their upaslike eye said jeff with the pure gleam of the muckraker in his own  as i said three months ago i got into bad company there are two times in a mans life when he does thiswhen hes dead broke and when hes rich  now and then the most legitimate business runs out of luck it was out in arkansas i made the wrong turn at a crossroad and drives into this town of peavine by mistake it seems i had already assaulted and disfigured peavine the spring of the year before i had sold 600 worth of young fruit trees thereplums cherries peaches and pears the peaviners were keeping an eye on the country road and hoping i might pass that way again i drove down main street as far as the crystal palace drugstore before i realized i had committed ambush upon myself and my white horse bill  the peaviners took me by surprise and bill by the bridle and began a conversation that wasnt entirely disassociated with the subject of fruit trees a committee of em ran some tracechains through the armholes of my vest and escorted me through their gardens and orchards  their fruit trees hadnt lived up to their labels most of em had turned out to be persimmons and dogwoods with a grove or two of blackjacks and poplars the only one that showed any signs of bearing anything was a fine young cottonwood that had put forth a hornets nest and half of an old corsetcover  the peaviners protracted our fruitless stroll to the edge of town they took my watch and money on account and they kept bill and the wagon as hostages they said the first time one of them dogwood trees put forth an amsdens june peach i might come back and get my things then they took off the trace chains and jerked their thumbs in the direction of the rocky mountains and i struck a lewis and clark lope for the swollen rivers and impenetrable forests  when i regained intellectualness i found myself walking into an unidentified town on the a t  s f railroad the peaviners hadnt left anything in my pockets except a plug of chewingthey wasnt after my lifeand that saved it i bit off a chunk and sits down on a pile of ties by the track to recogitate my sensations of thought and perspicacity  and then along comes a fast freight which slows up a little at the town and off of it drops a black bundle that rolls for twenty yards in a cloud of dust and then gets up and begins to spit soft coal and interjections i see it is a young man broad across the face dressed more for pullmans than freights and with a cheerful kind of smile in spite of it all that made phoebe snows job look like a chimneysweeps  fall off says i  nunk says he got off arrived at my destination what town is this  havent looked it up on the map yet says i i got in about five minutes before you did how does it strike you  hard says he twisting one of his arms around i believe that shoulderno its all right  he stoops over to brush the dust off his clothes when out of his pocket drops a fine nineinch burglars steel jimmy he picks it up and looks at me sharp and then grins and holds out his hand  brother says he greetings didnt i see you in southern missouri last summer selling colored sand at halfadollar a teaspoonful to put into lamps to keep the oil from exploding  oil says i never explodes its the gas that forms that explodes but i shakes hands with him anyway  my names bill bassett says he to me and if youll call it professional pride instead of conceit ill inform you that you have the pleasure of meeting the best burglar that ever set a gumshoe on ground drained by the mississippi river  well me and this bill bassett sits on the ties and exchanges brags as artists in kindred lines will do it seems he didnt have a cent either and we went into close caucus he explained why an able burglar sometimes had to travel on freights by telling me that a servant girl had played him false in little rock and he was making a quick getaway  its part of my business says bill bassett to play up to the ruffles when i want to make a riffle as raffles tis loves that makes the bit go round show me a house with a swag in it and a pretty parlormaid and you might as well call the silver melted down and sold and me spilling truffles and that chateau stuff on the napkin under my chin while the police are calling it an inside job just because the old ladys nephew teaches a bible class i first make an impression on the girl says bill and when she lets me inside i make an impression on the locks but this one in little rock done me says he she saw me taking a trolley ride with another girl and when i came round on the night she was to leave the door open for me it was fast and i had keys made for the doors upstairs but no sir she had sure cut off my locks she was a delilah says bill bassett  it seems that bill tried to break in anyhow with his jimmy but the girl emitted a succession of bravura noises like the topriders of a tallyho and bill had to take all the hurdles between there and the depot as he had no baggage they tried hard to check his departure but he made a train that was just pulling out  well says bill bassett when we had exchanged memories of our dead lives i could eat this town dont look like it was kept under a yale lock suppose we commit some mild atrocity that will bring in temporary expense money i dont suppose youve brought along any hair tonic or rolled gold watchchains or similar lawdefying swindles that you could sell on the plaza to the pikers of the paretic populace have you  no says i i left an elegant line of patagonian diamond earrings and rainyday sunbursts in my valise at peavine but theyre to stay there until some of those blackgum trees begin to glut the market with yellow clings and japanese plums i reckon we cant count on them unless we take luther burbank in for a partner  very well says bassett well do the best we can maybe after dark ill borrow a hairpin from some lady and open the farmers and drovers marine bank with it  while we were talking up pulls a passenger train to the depot near by a person in a high hat gets off on the wrong side of the train and comes tripping down the track towards us he was a little fat man with a big nose and rats eyes but dressed expensive and carrying a handsatchel careful as if it had eggs or railroads bonds in it he passes by us and keeps on down the track not appearing to notice the town  come on says bill bassett to me starting after him  where i asks  lordy says bill had you forgot you was in the desert didnt you see colonel manna drop down right before your eyes dont you hear the rustling of general ravens wings im surprised at you elijah  we overtook the stranger in the edge of some woods and as it was after sundown and in a quiet place nobody saw us stop him bill takes the silk hat off the mans head and brushes it with his sleeve and puts it back  what does this mean sir says the man  when i wore one of these says bill and felt embarrassed i always done that not having one now i had to use yours i hardly know how to begin sir in explaining our business with you but i guess well try your pockets first  bill bassett felt in all of them and looked disgusted  not even a watch he says aint you ashamed of yourself you whited sculpture going about dressed like a headwaiter and financed like a count you havent even got carfare what did you do with your transfer  the man speaks up and says he has no assets or valuables of any sort but bassett takes his handsatchel and opens it out comes some collars and socks and a half a page of a newspaper clipped out bill reads the clipping careful and holds out his hand to the heldup party  brother says he greetings accept the apologies of friends i am bill bassett the burglar mr peters you must make the acquaintance of mr alfred e ricks shake hands mr peters says bill stands about halfway between me and you mr ricks in the line of havoc and corruption he always gives something for the money he gets im glad to meet you mr ricksyou and mr peters this is the first time i ever attended a full gathering of the national synod of sharks housebreaking swindling and financiering all represented please examine mr ricks credentials mr peters  the piece of newspaper that bill bassett handed me had a good picture of this ricks on it it was a chicago paper and it had obloquies of ricks in every paragraph by reading it over i harvested the intelligence that said alleged ricks had laid off all that portion of the state of florida that lies under water into town lots and sold em to alleged innocent investors from his magnificently furnished offices in chicago after he had taken in a hundred thousand or so dollars one of these fussy purchasers that are always making trouble ive had em actually try gold watches ive sold em with acid took a cheap excursion down to the land where it is always just before supper to look at his lot and see if it didnt need a new paling or two on the fence and market a few lemons in time for the christmas present trade he hires a surveyor to find his lot for him they run the line out and find the flourishing town of paradise hollow so advertised to be about 40 rods and 16 poles s 27 degrees e of the middle of lake okeechobee this mans lot was under thirtysix feet of water and besides had been preempted so long by the alligators and gars that his title looked fishy  naturally the man goes back to chicago and makes it as hot for alfred e ricks as the morning after a prediction of snow by the weather bureau ricks defied the allegation but he couldnt deny the alligators one morning the papers came out with a column about it and ricks come out by the fireescape it seems the alleged authorities had beat him to the safedeposit box where he kept his winnings and ricks has to westward ho with only feetwear and a dozen 15andahalf english pokes in his shopping bag he happened to have some mileage left in his book and that took him as far as the town in the wilderness where he was spilled out on me and bill bassett as elijah iii with not a raven in sight for any of us  then this alfred e ricks lets out a squeak that he is hungry too and denies the hypothesis that he is good for the value let alone the price of a meal and so there was the three of us representing if we had a mind to draw syllogisms and parabolas labor and trade and capital now when trade has no capital there isnt a dicker to be made and when capital has no money theres a stagnation in steak and onions that put it up to the man with the jimmy  brother bushrangers says bill bassett never yet in trouble did i desert a pal hard by in yon wood i seem to see unfurnished lodgings let us go there and wait till dark  there was an old deserted cabin in the grove and we three took possession of it after dark bill bassett tells us to wait and goes out for half an hour he comes back with a armful of bread and spareribs and pies  panhandled em at a farmhouse on washita avenue says he eat drink and be leary  the full moon was coming up bright so we sat on the floor of the cabin and ate in the light of it and this bill bassett begins to brag  sometimes says he with his mouth full of country produce i lose all patience with you people that think you are higher up in the profession than i am now what could either of you have done in the present emergency to set us on our feet again could you do it ricksy  i must confess mr bassett says ricks speaking nearly inaudible out of a slice of pie that at this immediate juncture i could not perhaps promote an enterprise to relieve the situation large operations such as i direct naturally require careful preparation in advance i  i know ricksy breaks in bill bassett you neednt finish you need 500 to make the first payment on a blond typewriter and four roomsful of quartered oak furniture and you need 500 more for advertising contracts and you need two weeks time for the fish to begin to bite your line of relief would be about as useful in an emergency as advocating municipal ownership to cure a man suffocated by eightycent gas and your graft aint much swifter brother peters he winds up  oh says i i havent seen you turn anything into gold with your wand yet mr good fairy most anybody could rub the magic ring for a little leftover victuals  that was only getting the pumpkin ready says bassett braggy and cheerful the coach and sixll drive up to the door before you know it miss cinderella maybe youve got some scheme under your sleeveholders that will give us a start  son says i im fifteen years older than you are and young enough yet to take out an endowment policy ive been broke before we can see the lights of that town not half a mile away i learned under montague silver the greatest street man that ever spoke from a wagon there are hundreds of men walking those streets this moment with grease spots on their clothes give me a gasoline lamp a drygoods box and a twodollar bar of white castile soap cut into little  wheres your two dollars snickered bill bassett into my discourse there was no use arguing with that burglar  no he goes on youre both babesinthewood finance has closed the mahogany desk and trade has put the shutters up both of you look to labor to start the wheels going all right you admit it tonight ill show you what bill bassett can do  bassett tells me and ricks not to leave the cabin till he comes back even if its daylight and then he starts off toward town whistling gay  this alfred e ricks pulls off his shoes and his coat lays a silk handkerchief over his hat and lays down on the floor  i think i will endeavor to secure a little slumber he squeaks the day has been fatiguing goodnight my dear mr peters  my regards to morpheus says i i think ill sit up a while  about two oclock as near as i could guess by my watch in peavine home comes our laboring man and kicks up ricks and calls us to the streak of bright moonlight shining in the cabin door then he spreads out five packages of one thousand dollars each on the floor and begins to cackle over the nestegg like a hen  ill tell you a few things about that town says he its named rocky springs and theyre building a masonic temple and it looks like the democratic candidate for mayor is going to get soaked by a pop and judge tuckers wife who has been down with pleurisy is getting some better i had a talk on these liliputian thesises before i could get a siphon in the fountain of knowledge that i was after and theres a bank there called the lumbermans fidelity and plowmans savings institution it closed for business yesterday with 23000 cash on hand it will open this morning with 18000all silver thats the reason i didnt bring more there you are trade and capital now will you be bad  my young friend says alfred e ricks holding up his hands have you robbed this bank dear me dear me  you couldnt call it that says bassett robbing sounds harsh all i had to do was to find out what street it was on that town is so quiet that i could stand on the corner and hear the tumblers clicking in that safe lockright to 45 left twice to 80 right once to 60 left to 15as plain as the yale captain giving orders in the football dialect now boys says bassett this is an early rising town they tell me the citizens are all up and stirring before daylight i asked what for and they said because breakfast was ready at that time and what of merry robin hood it must be yoicks and away with the tinkers chorus ill stake you how much do you want speak up capital  my dear young friend says this ground squirrel of a ricks standing on his hind legs and juggling nuts in his paws i have friends in denver who would assist me if i had a hundred dollars i  basset unpins a package of the currency and throws five twenties to ricks  trade how much he says to me  put your money up labor says i i never yet drew upon honest toil for its hardearned pittance the dollars i get are surplus ones that are burning the pockets of damfools and greenhorns when i stand on a street corner and sell a solid gold diamond ring to a yap for 300 i make just 260 and i know hes going to give it to a girl in return for all the benefits accruing from a 12500 ring his profits are 12200 which of us is the biggest fakir  and when you sell a poor woman a pinch of sand for fifty cents to keep her lamp from exploding says bassett what do you figure her gross earnings to be with sand at forty cents a ton  listen says i i instruct her to keep her lamp clean and well filled if she does that it cant burst and with the sand in it she knows it cant and she dont worry its a kind of industrial christian science she pays fifty cents and gets both rockefeller and mrs eddy on the job it aint everybody that can let the golddust twins do their work  alfred e ricks all but licks the dust off of bill bassetts shoes  my dear young friend says he i will never forget your generosity heaven will reward you but let me implore you to turn from your ways of violence and crime  mousie says bill the hole in the wainscoting for yours your dogmas and inculcations sound to me like the last words of a bicycle pump what has your high moral elevatorservice system of pillage brought you to penuriousness and want even brother peters who insists upon contaminating the art of robbery with theories of commerce and trade admitted he was on the lift both of you live by the gilded rule brother peters says bill youd better choose a slice of this embalmed currency youre welcome  i told bill bassett once more to put his money in his pocket i never had the respect for burglary that some people have i always gave something for the money i took even if it was only some little trifle for a souvenir to remind em not to get caught again  and then alfred e ricks grovels at bills feet again and bids us adieu he says he will have a team at a farmhouse and drive to the station below and take the train for denver it salubrified the atmosphere when that lamentable bollworm took his departure he was a disgrace to every nonindustrial profession in the country with all his big schemes and fine offices he had wound up unable even to get an honest meal except by the kindness of a strange and maybe unscrupulous burglar i was glad to see him go though i felt a little sorry for him now that he was ruined forever what could such a man do without a big capital to work with why alfred e ricks as we left him was as helpless as turtle on its back he couldnt have worked a scheme to beat a little girl out of a penny slatepencil  when me and bill bassett was left alone i did a little sleightofmind turn in my head with a trade secret at the end of it thinks i ill show this mr burglar man the difference between business and labor he had hurt some of my professional selfadulation by casting his persians upon commerce and trade  i wont take any of your money as a gift mr bassett says i to him but if youll pay my expenses as a travelling companion until we get out of the danger zone of the immoral deficit you have caused in this towns finances tonight ill be obliged  bill bassett agreed to that and we hiked westward as soon as we could catch a safe train  when we got to a town in arizona called los perros i suggested that we once more try our luck on terracotta that was the home of montague silver my old instructor now retired from business i knew monty would stake me to web money if i could show him a fly buzzing round the locality bill bassett said all towns looked alike to him as he worked mainly in the dark so we got off the train in los perros a fine little town in the silver region  i had an elegant little sure thing in the way of a commercial slungshot that i intended to hit bassett behind the ear with i wasnt going to take his money while he was asleep but i was going to leave him with a lottery ticket that would represent in experience to him 4755i think that was the amount he had when we got off the train but the first time i hinted to him about an investment he turns on me and disencumbers himself of the following terms and expressions  brother peters says he it aint a bad idea to go into an enterprise of some kind as you suggest i think i will but if i do it will be such a cold proposition that nobody but robert e peary and charlie fairbanks will be able to sit on the board of directors  i thought you might want to turn your money over says i  i do says he frequently i cant sleep on one side all night ill tell you brother peters says he im going to start a poker room i dont seem to care for the humdrum in swindling such as peddling eggbeaters and working off breakfast food on barnum and bailey for sawdust to strew in their circus rings but the gambling business says he from the profitable side of the table is a good compromise between swiping silver spoons and selling penwipers at a waldorfastoria charity bazar  then says i mr bassett you dont care to talk over my little business proposition  why says he do you know you cant get a pasteur institute to start up within fifty miles of where i live i bite so seldom  so bassett rents a room over a saloon and looks around for some furniture and chromos the same night i went to monty silvers house and he let me have 200 on my prospects then i went to the only store in los perros that sold playing cards and bought every deck in the house the next morning when the store opened i was there bringing all the cards back with me i said that my partner that was going to back me in the game had changed his mind and i wanted to sell the cards back again the storekeeper took em at half price  yes i was seventyfive dollars loser up to that time but while i had the cards that night i marked every one in every deck that was labor and then trade and commerce had their innings and the bread i had cast upon the waters began to come back in the form of cottage pudding with wine sauce  of course i was among the first to buy chips at bill bassetts game he had bought the only cards there was to be had in town and i knew the back of every one of them better than i know the back of my head when the barber shows me my haircut in the two mirrors  when the game closed i had the five thousand and a few odd dollars and all bill bassett had was the wanderlust and a black cat he had bought for a mascot bill shook hands with me when i left  brother peters says he i have no business being in business i was preordained to labor when a no 1 burglar tries to make a james out of his jimmy he perpetrates an improfundity you have a welloiled and efficacious system of luck at cards says he peace go with you and i never afterward sees bill bassett again    well jeff said i when the autolycan adventurer seemed to have divulged the gist of his tale i hope you took care of the money that would be a respectathat is a considerable working capital if you should choose some day to settle down to some sort of regular business  me said jeff virtuously you can bet ive taken care of that five thousand  he tapped his coat over the region of his chest exultantly  gold mining stock he explained every cent of it shares par value one dollar bound to go up 500 per cent within a year nonassessable the blue gopher mine just discovered a month ago better get in yourself if youve any spare dollars on hand  sometimes said i these mines are not  oh this ones solid as an old goose said jeff fifty thousand dollars worth of ore in sight and 10 per cent monthly earnings guaranteed  he drew out a long envelope from his pocket and cast it on the table  always carry it with me said he so the burglar cant corrupt or the capitalist break in and water it  i looked at the beautifully engraved certificate of stock  in colorado i see said i and by the way jeff what was the name of the little man who went to denverthe one you and bill met at the station  alfred e ricks said jeff was the toads designation  i see said i the president of this mining company signs himself a l fredericks i was wondering  let me see that stock said jeff quickly almost snatching it from me  to mitigate even though slightly the embarrassment i summoned the waiter and ordered another bottle of the barbera i thought it was the least i could do     a tempered wind   the first time my optical nerves was disturbed by the sight of buckingham skinner was in kansas city i was standing on a corner when i see buck stick his strawcolored head out of a thirdstory window of a business block and holler whoa there whoa like you would in endeavoring to assuage a team of runaway mules  i looked around but all the animals i see in sight is a policeman having his shoes shined and a couple of delivery wagons hitched to posts then in a minute downstairs tumbles this buckingham skinner and runs to the corner and stands and gazes down the other street at the imaginary dust kicked up by the fabulous hoofs of the fictitious team of chimerical quadrupeds and then b skinner goes back up to the thirdstory room again and i see that the lettering on the window is the farmers friend loan company  by and by strawtop comes down again and i crossed the street to meet him for i had my ideas yes sir when i got close i could see where he overdone it he was reub all right as far as his blue jeans and cowhide boots went but he had a matinee actors hands and the rye straw stuck over his ear looked like it belonged to the property man of the old homestead co curiosity to know what his graft was got the best of me  was that your team broke away and run just now i asks him polite i tried to stop em says i but i couldnt i guess theyre half way back to the farm by now  gosh blame them darned mules says strawtop in a voice so good that i nearly apologized theyre alus bustin loose and then he looks at me close and then he takes off his hayseed hat and says in a different voice id like to shake hands with parleyvoo pickens the greatest street man in the west barring only montague silver which you can no more than allow  i let him shake hands with me  i learned under silver i said i dont begrudge him the lead but whats your graft son i admit that the phantom flight of the nonexisting animals at which you remarked whoa has puzzled me somewhat how do you win out on the trick  buckingham skinner blushed  pocket money says he thats all i am temporarily unfinanced this little coup de rye straw is good for forty dollars in a town of this size how do i work it why i involve myself as you perceive in the loathsome apparel of the rural dub thus embalmed i am jonas stubblefielda name impossible to improve upon i repair noisily to the office of some loan company conveniently located in the thirdfloor front there i lay my hat and yarn gloves on the floor and ask to mortgage my farm for 2000 to pay for my sisters musical education in europe loans like that always suit the loan companies its ten to one that when the note falls due the foreclosure will be leading the semiquavers by a couple of lengths  well sir i reach in my pocket for the abstract of title but i suddenly hear my team running away i run to the window and emit the wordor exclamation whichever it may beviz whoa then i rush downstairs and down the street returning in a few minutes dang them mules i says they done run away and busted the doubletree and two traces now i got to hoof it home for i never brought no money along reckon well talk about that loan some other time genlemen  then i spreads out my tarpaulin like the israelites and waits for the manna to drop  why no mr stubblefield says the lobstercolored party in the specs and dotted pique vest oblige us by accepting this tendollar bill until tomorrow get your harness repaired and call in at ten well be pleased to accommodate you in the matter of this loan  its a slight thing says buckingham skinner modest but as i said only for temporary loose change  its nothing to be ashamed of says i in respect for his mortification in case of an emergency of course its small compared to organizing a trust or bridge whist but even the chicago university had to be started in a small way  whats your graft these days buckingham skinner asks me  the legitimate says i im handling rhinestones and dr oleum sinapis electric headache battery and the swiss warblers bird call a small lot of the new queer ones and twos and the bonanza budget consisting of a rolledgold wedding and engagement ring six egyptian lily bulbs a combination pickle fork and nailclipper and fifty engraved visiting cardsno two names alikeall for the sum of 38 cents  two months ago says buckingham skinner i was doing well down in texas with a patent instantaneous fire kindler made of compressed wood ashes and benzine i sold loads of em in towns where they like to burn niggers quick without having to ask somebody for a light and just when i was doing the best they strikes oil down there and puts me out of business your machines too slow now pardner they tells me we can have a coon in hell with this here petroleum before your old flintandtinder truck can get him warm enough to perfess religion and so i gives up the kindler and drifts up here to kc this little curtainraiser you seen me doing mr pickens with the simulated farm and the hypothetical teams aint in my line at all and im ashamed you found me working it  no man says i kindly need to be ashamed of putting the skibunk on a loan corporation for even so small a sum as ten dollars when he is financially abashed still it wasnt quite the proper thing its too much like borrowing money without paying it back  i liked buckingham skinner from the start for as good a man as ever stood over the axles and breathed gasoline smoke and pretty soon we gets thick and i let him in on a scheme id had in mind for some time and offers to go partners  anything says buck that is not actually dishonest will find me willing and ready let us perforate into the inwardness of your proposition i feel degraded when i am forced to wear property straw in my hair and assume a bucolic air for the small sum of ten dollars actually mr pickens it makes me feel like the ophelia of the great occidental allstar onenight consolidated theatrical aggregation  this scheme of mine was one that suited my proclivities by nature i am some sentimental and have always felt gentle toward the mollifying elements of existence i am disposed to be lenient with the arts and sciences and i find time to instigate a cordiality for the more human works of nature such as romance and the atmosphere and grass and poetry and the seasons i never skin a sucker without admiring the prismatic beauty of his scales i never sell a little auriferous beauty to the man with the hoe without noticing the beautiful harmony there is between gold and green and thats why i liked this scheme it was so full of outdoor air and landscapes and easy money  we had to have a young lady assistant to help us work this graft and i asked buck if he knew of one to fill the bill  one says i that is cool and wise and strictly business from her pompadour to her oxfords no extoedancers or gumchewers or crayon portrait canvassers for this  buck claimed he knew a suitable feminine and he takes me around to see miss sarah malloy the minute i see her i am pleased she looked to be the goods as ordered no sign of the three ps about herno peroxide patchouli nor peau de soie about twentytwo brown hair pleasant waysthe kind of a lady for the place  a description of the sandbag if you please she begins  why maam says i this graft of ours is so nice and refined and romantic it would make the balcony scene in romeo and juliet look like secondstory work  we talked it over and miss malloy agreed to come in as a business partner she said she was glad to get a chance to give up her place as stenographer and secretary to a suburban lot company and go into something respectable  this is the way we worked our scheme first i figured it out by a kind of a proverb the best grafts in the world are built up on copybook maxims and psalms and proverbs and esaus fables they seem to kind of hit off human nature our peaceful little swindle was constructed on the old saying the whole push loves a lover  one evening buck and miss malloy drives up like blazes in a buggy to a farmers door she is pale but affectionate clinging to his arm always clinging to his arm any one can see that she is a peach and of the cling variety they claim they are eloping for to be married on account of cruel parents they ask where they can find a preacher farmer says bgum there aint any preacher nigher than reverend abels four miles over on caney creek farmeress wipes her hand on her apron and rubbers through her specs   illustration she is a peach and of the cling variety   then lo and look ye up the road from the other way jogs parleyvoo pickens in a gig dressed in black white necktie long face sniffing his nose emitting a spurious kind of noise resembling the long meter doxology  bjinks says farmer if thar aint a preacher now  it transpires that i am rev abijah green travelling over to little bethel schoolhouse for to preach next sunday  the young folks will have it they must be married for pa is pursuing them with the plow mules and the buckboard so the reverend green after hesitating marries em in the farmers parlor and farmer grins and has in cider and says bgum and farmeress sniffles a bit and pats the bride on the shoulder and parleyvoo pickens the wrong reverend writes out a marriage certificate and farmer and farmeress sign it as witnesses and the parties of the first second and third part gets in their vehicles and rides away oh that was an idyllic graft true love and the lowing kine and the sun shining on the red barnsit certainly had all other impostures i know about beat to a batter   so the reverend green after hesitations marries em in the farmers parlor   i suppose i happened along in time to marry buck and miss malloy at about twenty farmhouses i hated to think how the romance was going to fade later on when all them marriage certificates turned up in banks where wed discounted em and the farmers had to pay them notes of hand theyd signed running from 300 to 500  on the 15th day of may us three divided about 6000 miss malloy nearly cried with joy you dont often see a tenderhearted girl or one that is bent on doing right   illustration on the 15th day of may us three divided about 6000   boys says she dabbing her eyes with a little handkerchief this stake comes in handier than a powder rag at a fat mens ball it gives me a chance to reform i was trying to get out of the real estate business when you fellows came along but if you hadnt taken me in on this neat little proposition for removing the cuticle of the rutabaga propagators im afraid id have got into something worse i was about to accept a place in one of these womens auxiliary bazars where they build a parsonage by selling a spoonful of chicken salad and a creampuff for seventyfive cents and calling it a business mans lunch  now i can go into a square honest business and give all them queer jobs the shake im going to cincinnati and start a palm reading and clairvoyant joint as madame saramaloi the egyptian sorceress i shall give everybody a dollars worth of good honest prognostication goodby boys take my advice and go into some decent fake get friendly with the police and newspapers and youll be all right  so then we all shook hands and miss malloy left us me and buck also rose up and sauntered off a few hundred miles for we didnt care to be around when them marriage certificates fell due  with about 4000 between us we hit that bumptious little town off the new jersey coast they call new york  if there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that yaptownonthehudson cosmopolitan they call it you bet sos a piece of flypaper you listen close when theyre buzzing and trying to pull their feet out of the sticky stuff little old new yorks good enough for usthats what they sing  theres enough reubs walk down broadway in one hour to buy up a weeks output of the factory in augusta maine that makes knaughty knovelties and the little phine phun oroide gold finger ring that sticks a needle in your friends hand  youd think new york people was all wise but no they dont get a chance to learn everythings too compressed even the hayseeds are baled hayseeds but what else can you expect from a town thats shut off from the world by the ocean on one side and new jersey on the other  its no place for an honest grafter with a small capital theres too big a protective tariff on bunco even when giovanni sells a quart of warm worms and chestnut hulls he has to hand out a pint to an insectivorous cop and the hotel man charges double for everything in the bill that he sends by the patrol wagon to the altar where the duke is about to marry the heiress  but old badvillenearconey is the ideal burg for a refined piece of piracy if you can pay the bunco duty imported grafts come pretty high the customhouse officers that look after it carry clubs and its hard to smuggle in even a bibandtucker swindle to work brooklyn with unless you can pay the toll but now me and buck having capital descends upon new york to try and trade the metropolitan backwoodsmen a few glass beads for real estate just as the vans did a hundred or two years ago  at an east side hotel we gets acquainted with romulus g atterbury a man with the finest head for financial operations i ever saw it was all bald and glossy except for gray side whiskers seeing that head behind an office railing and youd deposit a million with it without a receipt this atterbury was well dressed though he ate seldom and the synopsis of his talk would make the conversation of a siren sound like a cab drivers kick he said he used to be a member of the stock exchange but some of the big capitalists got jealous and formed a ring that forced him to sell his seat  atterbury got to liking me and buck and he begun to throw on the canvas for us some of the schemes that had caused his hair to evacuate he had one scheme for starting a national bank on 45 that made the mississippi bubble look as solid as a glass marble he talked this to us for three days and when his throat was good and sore we told him about the roll we had atterbury borrowed a quarter from us and went out and got a box of throat lozenges and started all over again this time he talked bigger things and he got us to see em as he did the scheme he laid out looked like a sure winner and he talked me and buck into putting our capital against his burnished dome of thought it looked all right for a kidgloved graft it seemed to be just about an inch and a half outside of the reach of the police and as moneymaking as a mint it was just what me and buck wanteda regular business at a permanent stand with an open air spieling with tonsilitis on the street corners every evening  so in six weeks you see a handsome furnished set of offices down in the wall street neighborhood with the golconda gold bond and investment company in gilt letters on the door and you see in his private room with the door open the secretary and treasurer mr buckingham skinner costumed like the lilies of the conservatory with his high silk hat close to his hand nobody yet ever saw buck outside of an instantaneous reach for his hat  and you might perceive the president and general manager mr r g atterbury with his priceless polished poll busy in the main office room dictating letters to a shorthand countess who has got pomp and a pompadour that is no less than a guarantee to investors   illustration busy in the main office room dictating letters to a shorthand countess   there is a bookkeeper and an assistant and a general atmosphere of varnish and culpability  at another desk the eye is relieved by the sight of an ordinary man attired with unscrupulous plainness sitting with his feet up eating apples with his obnoxious hat on the back of his head that man is no other than colonel tecumseh once parleyvoo pickens the vicepresident of the company  no recherché rags for me i says to atterbury when we was organizing the stage properties of the robbery im a plain man says i and i do not use pajamas french or military hairbrushes cast me for the role of the rhinestoneintherough or i dont go on exhibition if you can use me in my natural though displeasing form do so  dress you up says atterbury i should say not just as you are youre worth more to the business than a whole roomful of the things they pin chrysanthemums on youre to play the part of the solid but disheveled capitalist from the far west you despise the conventions youve got so many stocks you can afford to shake socks conservative homely rough shrewd savingthats your pose its a winner in new york keep your feet on the desk and eat apples whenever anybody comes in eat an apple let em see you stuff the peelings in a drawer of your desk look as economical and rich and rugged as you can  i followed out atterburys instructions i played the rocky mountain capitalist without ruching or frills the way i deposited apple peelings to my credit in a drawer when any customers came in made hetty green look like a spendthrift i could hear atterbury saying to victims as he smiled at me indulgent and venerating thats our vicepresident colonel pickens    fortune in western investments    delightfully plain manners but    could sign his check for half a million    simple as a child    wonderful head    conservative and careful almost to a fault   illustration thats our vicepresident colonel pickens   atterbury managed the business me and buck never quite understood all of it though he explained it to us in full it seems the company was a kind of cooperative one and everybody that bought stock shared in the profits first we officers bought up a controlling interestwe had to have thatof the shares at 50 cents a hundredjust what the printer charged usand the rest went to the public at a dollar each the company guaranteed the stockholders a profit of ten per cent each month payable on the last day thereof  when any stockholder had paid in as much as 100 the company issued him a gold bond and he became a bondholder i asked atterbury one day what benefits and appurtenances these gold bonds was to an investor more so than the immunities and privileges enjoyed by the common sucker who only owned stock atterbury picked up one of them gold bonds all gilt and lettered up with flourishes and a big red seal tied with a blue ribbon in a bowknot and he looked at me like his feelings was hurt  my dear colonel pickens says he you have no soul for art think of a thousand homes made happy by possessing one of these beautiful gems of the lithographers skill think of the joy in the household where one of these gold bonds hangs by a pink cord to the whatnot or is chewed by the baby caroling gleefully upon the floor ah i see your eye growing moist coloneli have touched you have i not  you have not says i for ive been watching you the moisture you see is apple juice you cant expect one man to act as a human ciderpress and an art connoisseur too  atterbury attended to the details of the concern as i understand it they was simple the investors in stock paid in their money and well i guess thats all they had to do the company received it and i dont call to mind anything else me and buck knew more about selling corn salve than we did about wall street but even we could see how the golconda gold bond investment company was making money you take in money and pay back ten per cent of it its plain enough that you make a clean legitimate profit of 90 per cent less expenses as long as the fish bite  atterbury wanted to be president and treasurer too but buck winks an eye at him and says you was to furnish the brains do you call it good brain work when you propose to take in money at the door too think again i hereby nominate myself treasurer ad valorem sine die and by acclamation i chip in that much brain work free me and pickens we furnished the capital and well handle the unearned increment as it incremates  it costs us 500 for office rent and first payment on furniture 1500 more went for printing and advertising atterbury knew his business three months to a minute well last says he a day longer than that and well have to either go under or go under an alias by that time we ought to clean up 60000 and then a money belt and a lower berth for me and the yellow journals and the furniture men can pick the bones  our ads done the work country weeklies and washington handpress dailies of course says i when we was ready to make contracts  man says atterbury as its advertising manager you would cause a limburger cheese factory to remain undiscovered during a hot summer the game were after is right here in new york and brooklyn and the harlem readingrooms theyre the people that the streetcar fenders and the answers to correspondents columns and the pickpocket notices are made for we want our ads in the biggest city dailies top of column next to editorials on radium and pictures of the girl doing health exercises  pretty soon the money begins to roll in buck didnt have to pretend to be busy his desk was piled high up with money orders and checks and greenbacks people began to drop in the office and buy stock every day  most of the shares went in small amounts10 and 25 and 50 and a good many 2 and 3 lots and the bald and inviolate cranium of president atterbury shines with enthusiasm and demerit while colonel tecumseh pickens the rude but reputable croesus of the west consumes so many apples that the peelings hang to the floor from the mahogany garbage chest that he calls his desk  just as atterbury said we ran along about three months without being troubled buck cashed the paper as fast as it came in and kept the money in a safe deposit vault a block or so away buck never thought much of banks for such purposes we paid the interest regular on the stock wed sold so there was nothing for anybody to squeal about we had nearly 50000 on hand and all three of us had been living as high as prize fighters out of training  one morning as me and buck sauntered into the office fat and flippant from our noon grub we met an easylooking fellow with a bright eye and a pipe in his mouth coming out we found atterbury looking like hed been caught a mile from home in a wet shower  know that man he asked us  we said we didnt  i dont either says atterbury wiping off his head but ill bet enough gold bonds to paper a cell in the tombs that hes a newspaper reporter  what did he want asks buck  information says our president said he was thinking of buying some stock he asked me about nine hundred questions and every one of em hit some sore place in the business i know hes on a paper you cant fool me you see a man about half shabby with an eye like a gimlet smoking cut plug with dandruff on his coat collar and knowing more than j p morgan and shakespeare put togetherif that aint a reporter i never saw one i was afraid of this i dont mind detectives and postoffice inspectorsi talk to em eight minutes and then sell em stockbut them reporters take the starch out of my collar boys i recommend that we declare a dividend and fade away the signs point that way  me and buck talked to atterbury and got him to stop sweating and stand still that fellow didnt look like a reporter to us reporters always pull out a pencil and tablet on you and tell you a story youve heard and strikes you for the drinks but atterbury was shaky and nervous all day  the next day me and buck comes down from the hotel about tenthirty on the way we buys the papers and the first thing we see is a column on the front page about our little imposition it was a shame the way that reporter intimated that we were no blood relatives of the late george w childs he tells all about the scheme as he sees it in a rich racy kind of a guying style that might amuse most anybody except a stockholder yes atterbury was right it behooveth the gaily clad treasurer and the pearly pated president and the rugged vicepresident of the golconda gold bond and investment company to go away real sudden and quick that their days might be longer upon the land  me and buck hurries down to the office we finds on the stairs and in the hall a crowd of people trying to squeeze into our office which is already jammed full inside to the railing theyve nearly all got golconda stock and gold bonds in their hands me and buck judged theyd been reading the papers too  we stopped and looked at our stockholders some surprised it wasnt quite the kind of a gang we supposed had been investing they all looked like poor people there was plenty of old women and lots of young girls that youd say worked in factories and mills some was old men that looked like war veterans and some was crippled and a good many was just kidsbootblacks and newsboys and messengers some was workingmen in overalls with their sleeves rolled up not one of the gang looked like a stockholder in anything unless it was a peanut stand but they all had golconda stock and looked as sick as you please   illustration but they all had golconda stock and looked as sick as you please   i saw a queer kind of a pale look come on bucks face when he sized up the crowd he stepped up to a sickly looking woman and says madam do you own any of this stock  i put in a hundred dollars says the woman faint like it was all i had saved in a year one of my children is dying at home now and i havent a cent in the house i came to see if i could draw out some the circulars said you could draw it at any time but they say now i will lose it all  there was a smart kind of kid in the gangi guess he was a newsboy i got in twentyfi mister he says looking hopeful at bucks silk hat and clothes dey paid me twofifty a mont on it say a man tells me dey cant do dat and be on de square is dat straight do you guess i can get out my twentyfi  some of the old women was crying the factory girls was plumb distracted theyd lost all their savings and theyd be docked for the time they lost coming to see about it  there was one girla pretty onein a red shawl crying in a corner like her heart would dissolve buck goes over and asks her about it  it aint so much losing the money mister says she shaking all over though ive been two years saving it up but jakey wont marry me now hell take rosa steinfeld i know jjjakey shes got 400 in the savings bank ai ai ai she sings out   illustration jakey wont marry me now hell take rosa steinfeld   buck looks all around with that same funny look on his face and then we see leaning against the wall puffing at his pipe with his eye shining at us this newspaper reporter buck and me walks over to him  youre a real interesting writer says buck how far do you mean to carry it anything more up your sleeve  oh im just waiting around says the reporter smoking away in case any news turns up its up to your stockholders now some of them might complain you know isnt that the patrol wagon now he says listening to a sound outside no he goes on thats doc whittlefords old cadaver coupé from the roosevelt i ought to know that gong yes i suppose ive written some interesting stuff at times  you wait says buck im going to throw an item of news in your way  buck reaches in his pocket and hands me a key i knew what he meant before he spoke confounded old buccaneeri knew what he meant they dont make them any better than buck  pick says he looking at me hard aint this graft a little out of our line do we want jakey to marry rosa steinfeld  youve got my vote says i ill have it here in ten minutes and i starts for the safe deposit vaults  i comes back with the money done up in a big bundle and then buck and me takes the journalist reporter around to another door and we let ourselves into one of the office rooms  now my literary friend says buck take a chair and keep still and ill give you an interview you see before you two grafters from graftersville grafter county arkansas me and pick have sold brass jewelry hair tonic song books marked cards patent medicines connecticut smyrna rugs furniture polish and albums in every town from old point comfort to the golden gate weve grafted a dollar whenever we saw one that had a surplus look to it but we never went after the simoleon in the toe of the sock under the loose brick in the corner of the kitchen hearth theres an old saying you may have heard fussily decency averniwhich means its an easy slide from the street fakers dry goods box to a desk in wall street weve took that slide but we didnt know exactly what was at the bottom of it now you ought to be wise but you aint youve got new york wiseness which means that you judge a man by the outside of his clothes that aint right you ought to look at the lining and seams and the buttonholes while we are waiting for the patrol wagon you might get out your little stub pencil and take notes for another funny piece in the paper  and then buck turns to me and says i dont care what atterbury thinks he only put in brains and if he gets his capital out hes lucky but what do you say pick  me says i you ought to know me buck i didnt know who was buying the stock  all right says buck and then he goes through the inside door into the main office and looks at the gang trying to squeeze through the railing atterbury and his hat was gone and buck makes em a short speech  all you lambs get in line youre going to get your wool back dont shove so get in a linea linenot in a pile lady will you please stop bleating your moneys waiting for you here sonny dont climb over that railing your dimes are safe dont cry sis you aint out a cent get in line i say here pick come and straighten em out and let em through and out by the other door  buck takes off his coat pushes his silk hat on the back of his head and lights up a reina victoria he sets at the table with the boodle before him all done up in neat packages i gets the stockholders strung out and marches em single file through from the main room and the reporter man passes em out of the side door into the hall again as they go by buck takes up the stock and the gold bonds paying em cash dollar for dollar the same as they paid in the shareholders of the golconda gold bond and investment company cant hardly believe it they almost grabs the money out of bucks hands some of the women keep on crying for its a custom of the sex to cry when they have sorrow to weep when they have joy and to shed tears whenever they find themselves without either   illustration the shareholders of the golconda gold bond and investment company cant hardly believe it   the old womens fingers shake when they stuff the skads in the bosom of their rusty dresses the factory girls just stoop over and flap their dry goods a second and you hear the elastic go pop as the currency goes down in the ladies department of the old domestic lislethread bank  some of the stockholders that had been doing the jeremiah act

of course says buck with his hand on the door knob me and pick aint wall streeters like you know em we never allowed to swindle sick old women and working girls and take nickels off of kids in the lines of graft weve worked we took money from the people the lord made to be buncoedsports and rounders and smart alecks and street crowds that always have a few dollars to throw away and farmers that wouldnt ever be happy if the grafters didnt come around and play with em when they sold their crops we never cared to fish for the kind of suckers that bite here no sir we got too much respect for the profession and for ourselves goodby to you mr receiver  here says the journalist reporter wait a minute theres a broker i know on the next floor wait till i put this truck in his safe i want you

the west side ferry landings we was in a little back room and i was filling up a gross of sixounce bottles with hydrant water colored red with aniline and flavored with cinnamon buck was smoking contented and he wore a decent brown derby in place of his silk hat  its a good thing pick says he as he drove in the corks that we got brady to lend us his horse and wagon for a week well rustle up the stake by then this hair tonicll sell right along over in jersey bald heads aint popular over there on account of the mosquitoes  directly i dragged out my valise and went down in it for labels

passage over the ferry  plenty of the shaketheshakes chill cure labels says i after looking  what more do you want says buck slap em on the chill season is just opening up in the hackensack low grounds whats hair anyway if you have to shake it off  we pasted on the chill cure labels about half an hour and buck says  making an honest livins better than that wall street anyhow aint it pick  you bet says i     hostages to momus   i  i never got inside of the legitimate line of graft but once but one time as i say i reversed the decision of the revised statutes and undertook a thing that id have to apologize for even under the new jersey trust laws  me and caligula polk of muskogee in the creek nation was down in the mexican state of tamaulipas running a peripatetic lottery and monte game now selling lottery tickets is a government graft in mexico just like selling fortyeight cents worth of postagestamps for fortynine cents is over here so uncle porfirio he instructs the rurales to attend to our case  rurales theyre a sort of country police but dont draw any mental crayon portraits of the worthy constables with a tin star and a gray goatee the ruraleswell if wed mount our supreme court on broncos arm em with winchesters and start em out after john doe et al wed have about the same thing  when the rurales started for us we started for the states they chased us as far as matamoras we hid in a brickyard and that night we swum the rio grande caligula with a brick in each hand absentminded which he drops upon the soil of texas forgetting he had em  from there we emigrated to san antone and then over to new orleans where we took a rest and in that town of cotton bales and other adjuncts to female beauty we made the acquaintance of drinks invented by the creoles during the period of louey cans in which they are still served at the side doors the most i can remember of this town is that me and caligula and a frenchman named mccartywait a minute adolph mccartywas trying to make the french quarter pay up the back tradingstamps due on the louisiana purchase when somebody hollers that the johndarms are coming i have an insufficient recollection of buying two yellow tickets through a window and i seemed to see a man swing a lantern and say all aboard i remembered no more except that the train butcher was covering me and caligula up with augusta j evanss works and figs  when we become revised we find that we have collided up against the state of georgia at a spot hitherto unaccounted for in time tables except by an asterisk which means that trains stop every other thursday on signal by tearing up a rail we was waked up in a yellow pine hotel by the noise of flowers and the smell of birds yes sir for the wind was banging sunflowers as big as buggy wheels against the weatherboarding and the chicken coop was right under the window me and caligula dressed and went downstairs the landlord was shelling peas on the front porch he was six feet of chills and fever and hongkong in complexion though in other respects he seemed amenable in the exercise of his sentiments and features  caligula who is a spokesman by birth and a small man though redhaired and impatient of painfulness of any kind speaks up  pardner says he goodmorning and be darned to you would you mind telling us why we are at we know the reason we are where but cant exactly figure out on account of at what place  well gentlemen says the landlord i reckoned youall would be inquiring this morning youall dropped off of the ninethirty train here last night and you was right tight yes you was right smart in liquor i can inform you that you are now in the town of mountain valley in the state of georgia  on top of that says caligula dont say that we cant have anything to eat  sit down gentlemen says the landlord and in twenty minutes ill call you to the best breakfast you can get anywhere in town  that breakfast turned out to be composed of fried bacon and a yellowish edifice that proved up something between pound cake and flexible sandstone the landlord calls it corn pone and then he sets out a dish of the exaggerated breakfast food known as hominy and so me and caligula makes the acquaintance of the celebrated food that enabled every johnny reb to lick one and twothirds yankees for nearly four years at a stretch  the wonder to me is says caligula that uncle robert lees boys didnt chase the grant and sherman outfit clear up into hudsons bay it would have made me that mad to eat this truck they call mahogany  hog and hominy i explains is the staple food of this section  then says caligula they ought to keep it where it belongs i thought this was a hotel and not a stable now if we was in muskogee at the st lucifer house id show you some breakfast grub antelope steaks and fried liver to begin on and venison cutlets with chili con carne and pineapple fritters and then some sardines and mixed pickles and top it off with a can of yellow clings and a bottle of beer you wont find a layout like that on the bill of affairs of any of your eastern restauraws  too lavish says i ive traveled and im unprejudiced therell never be a perfect breakfast eaten until some man grows arms long enough to stretch down to new orleans for his coffee and over to norfolk for his rolls and reaches up to vermont and digs a slice of butter out of a springhouse and then turns over a beehive close to a white clover patch out in indiana for the rest then hed come pretty close to making a meal on the amber that the gods eat on mount olympia  too ephemeral says caligula id want ham and eggs or rabbit stew anyhow for a chaser what do you consider the most edifying and casual in the way of a dinner  ive been infatuated from time to time i answers with fancy ramifications of grub such as terrapins lobsters reed birds jambolaya and canvascovered ducks but after all theres nothing less displeasing to me than a beefsteak smothered in mushrooms on a balcony in sound of the broadway streetcars with a handorgan playing down below and the boys hollering extras about the latest suicide for the wine give me a reasonable ponty cany and thats all except a demitasse  well says caligula i reckon in new york you get to be a conniseer and when you go around with the demitasse you are naturally bound to buy em stylish grub  its a great town for epicures says i youd soon fall into their ways if you was there  ive heard it was says caligula but i reckon i wouldnt i can polish my fingernails all they need myself    ii  after breakfast we went out on the front porch lighted up two of the landlords flor de upas perfectos and took a look at georgia  the installment of scenery visible to the eye looked mighty poor as far as we could see was red hills all washed down with gullies and scattered over with patches of piny woods blackberry bushes was all that kept the rail fences from falling down about fifteen miles over to the north was a little range of welltimbered mountains  that town of mountain valley wasnt going about a dozen people permeated along the sidewalks but what you saw mostly was rainbarrels and roosters and boys poking around with sticks in piles of ashes made by burning the scenery of uncle tom shows  and just then there passes down on the other side of the street a high man in a long black coat and a beaver hat all the people in sight bowed and some crossed the street to shake hands with him folks came out of stores and houses to holler at him women leaned out of windows and smiled and all the kids stopped playing to look at him our landlord stepped out on the porch and bent himself double like a carpenters rule and sung out goodmorning colonel when he was a dozen yards gone by  and is that alexander pa says caligula to the landlord and why is he called great  that gentlemen says the landlord is no less than colonel jackson t rockingham the president of the sunrise  edenville tap railroad mayor of mountain valley and chairman of the perry county board of immigration and public improvements  been away a good many years hasnt he i asked  no sir colonel rockingham is going down to the postoffice for his mail his fellowcitizens take pleasure in greeting him thus every morning the colonel is our most prominent citizen besides the height of the stock of the sunrise  edenville tap railroad he owns a thousand acres of that land across the creek mountain valley delights sir to honor a citizen of such worth and public spirit  for an hour that afternoon caligula sat on the back of his neck on the porch and studied a newspaper which was unusual in a man who despised print when he was through he took me to the end of the porch among the sunlight and drying dishtowels i knew that caligula had invented a new graft for he chewed the ends of his mustache and ran the left catch of his suspenders up and down which was his way  what is it now i asks just so it aint floating mining stocks or raising pennsylvania pinks well talk it over  pennsylvania pinks oh that refers to a coinraising scheme of the keystoners they burn the soles of old womens feet to make them tell where their moneys hid  caligulas words in business was always few and bitter  you see them mountains said he pointing and you seen that colonel man that owns railroads and cuts more ice when he goes to the postoffice than roosevelt does when he cleans em out what were going to do is to kidnap the latter into the former and inflict a ransom of ten thousand dollars  illegality says i shaking my head  i knew youd say that says caligula at first sight it does seem to jar peace and dignity but it dont i got the idea out of that newspaper would you commit aspersions on a equitable graft that the united states itself has condoned and indorsed and ratified  kidnapping says i is an immoral function in the derogatory list of the statutes if the united states upholds it it must be a recent enactment of ethics along with race suicide and rural delivery  listen says caligula and ill explain the case set down in the papers here was a greek citizen named burdick harris says he captured for a graft by africans and the united states sends two gunboats to the state of tangiers and makes the king of morocco give up seventy thousand dollars to raisuli  go slow says i that sounds too international to take in all at once its like thimble thimble whos got the naturalization papers  twas press despatches from constantinople says caligula youll see six months from now theyll be confirmed by the monthly magazines and then it wont be long till youll notice em alongside the photos of the mount pelee eruption photos in the whileyougetyourhaircut weeklies its all right pick this african man raisuli hides burdick harris up in the mountains and advertises his price to the governments of different nations now you wouldnt think for a minute goes on caligula that john hay would have chipped in and helped this graft along if it wasnt a square game would you  why no says i ive always stood right in with bryans policies and i couldnt consciously say a word against the republican administration just now but if harris was a greek on what system of international protocols did hay interfere  it aint exactly set forth in the papers says caligula i suppose its a matter of sentiment you know he wrote this poem little breeches and them greeks wear little or none but anyhow john hay sends the brooklyn and the olympia over and they cover africa with thirtyinch guns and then hay cables after the health of the persona grata and how are they this morning he wires is burdick harris alive yet or mr raisuli dead and the king of morocco sends up the seventy thousand dollars and they turn burdick harris loose and theres not half the hard feelings among the nations about this little kidnapping matter as there was about the peace congress and burdick harris says to the reporters in the greek language that hes often heard about the united states and he admires roosevelt next to raisuli who is one of the whitest and most gentlemanly kidnappers that he ever worked alongside of so you see pick winds up caligula weve got the law of nations on our side well cut this colonel man out of the herd and corral him in them little mountains and stick up his heirs and assigns for ten thousand dollars  well you seldom little redheaded territorial terror i answers you cant bluff your uncle tecumseh pickens ill be your company in this graft but i misdoubt if youve absorbed the inwardness of this burdick harris case calig and if on any morning we get a telegram from the secretary of state asking about the health of the scheme i propose to acquire the most propinquitous and celeritous mule in this section and gallop diplomatically over into the neighboring and peaceful nation of alabama    iii  me and caligula spent the next three days investigating the bunch of mountains into which we proposed to kidnap colonel jackson t rockingham we finally selected an upright slice of topography covered with bushes and trees that you could only reach by a secret path that we cut out up the side of it and the only way to reach the mountain was to follow up the bend of a branch that wound among the elevations  then i took in hand an important subdivision of the proceedings i went up to atlanta on the train and laid in a twohundredandfiftydollar supply of the most gratifying and efficient lines of grub that money could buy i always was an admirer of viands in their more palliative and revised stages hog and hominy are not only inartistic to my stomach but they give indigestion to my moral sentiments and i thought of colonel jackson t rockingham president of the sunrise  edenville tap railroad and how he would miss the luxury of his home fare as is so famous among wealthy southerners so i sunk half of mine and caligulas capital in as elegant a layout of fresh and canned provisions as burdick harris or any other professional kidnappee ever saw in a camp  i put another hundred in a couple of cases of bordeaux two quarts of cognac two hundred havana regalias with gold bands and a camp stove and stools and folding cots i wanted colonel rockingham to be comfortable and i hoped after he gave up the ten thousand dollars he would give me and caligula as good a name for gentlemen and entertainers as the greek man did the friend of his that made the united states his bill collector against africa  when the goods came down from atlanta we hired a wagon moved them up on the little mountain and established camp and then we laid for the colonel  we caught him one morning about two miles out from mountain valley on his way to look after some of his burnt umber farm land he was an elegant old gentleman as thin and tall as a trout rod with frazzled shirtcuffs and specs on a black string we explained to him brief and easy what we wanted and caligula showed him careless the handle of his fortyfive under his coat  what says colonel rockingham bandits in perry county georgia i shall see that the board of immigration and public improvements hears of this  be so unfoolhardy as to climb into that buggy says caligula by order of the board of perforation and public depravity this is a business meeting and were anxious to adjourn sine qua non  we drove colonel rockingham over the mountain and up the side of it as far as the buggy could go then we tied the horse and took our prisoner on foot up to the camp  now colonel i says to him were after the ransom me and my partner and no harm will come to you if the king of morif your friends send up the dust in the mean time we are gentlemen the same as you and if you give us your word not to try to escape the freedom of the camp is yours  i give you my word says the colonel  all right says i and now its eleven oclock and me and mr polk will proceed to inculcate the occasion with a few welltimed trivialities in the way of grub  thank you says the colonel i believe i could relish a slice of bacon and a plate of hominy  but you wont says i emphatic not in this camp we soar in higher regions than them occupied by your celebrated but repulsive dish  while the colonel read his paper me and caligula took off our coats and went in for a little luncheon de luxe just to show him caligula was a fine cook of the western brand he could toast a buffalo or fricassee a couple of steers as easy as a woman could make a cup of tea he was gifted in the way of knocking together edibles when haste and muscle and quantity was to be considered he held the record west of the arkansas river for frying pancakes with his left hand broiling venison cutlets with his right and skinning a rabbit with his teeth at the same time but i could do things en casserole and à la creole and handle the oil and tobasco as gently and nicely as a french chef  so at twelve oclock we had a hot lunch ready that looked like a banquet on a mississippi river steamboat we spread it on the tops of two or three big boxes opened two quarts of the red wine set the olives and a canned oyster cocktail and a readymade martini by the colonels plate and called him to grub  colonel rockingham drew up his campstool wiped off his specs and looked at the things on the table then i thought he was swearing and i felt mean because i hadnt taken more pains with the victuals but he wasnt he was asking a blessing and me and caligula hung our heads and i saw a tear drop from the colonels eye into his cocktail  i never saw a man eat with so much earnestness and applicationnot hastily like a grammarian or one of the canal but slow and appreciative like a anaconda or a real vive bonjour  in an hour and a half the colonel leaned back i brought him a pony of brandy and his black coffee and set the box of havana regalias on the table  gentlemen says he blowing out the smoke and trying to breathe it back again when we view the eternal hills and the smiling and beneficent landscape and reflect upon the goodness of the creator who  excuse me colonel says i but theres some business to attend to now and i brought out paper and pen and ink and laid em before him who do you want to send to for the money i asks  i reckon says he after thinking a bit to the vicepresident of our railroad at the general offices of the company in edenville  how far is it to edenville from here i asked  about ten miles says he  then i dictated these lines and colonel rockingham wrote them out      i am kidnapped and held a prisoner by two desperate outlaws    in a place which is useless to attempt to find they demand    ten thousand dollars at once for my release the amount must    be raised immediately and these directions followed come    alone with the money to stony creek which runs out of    blacktop mountains follow the bed of the creek till you    come to a big flat rock on the left bank on which is marked    a cross in red chalk stand on the rock and wave a white    flag a guide will come to you and conduct you to where i am    held lose no time   after the colonel had finished this he asked permission to take on a postscript about how he was being treated so the railroad wouldnt feel uneasy in its bosom about him we agreed to that he wrote down that he had just had lunch with the two desperate ruffians and then he set down the whole bill of fare from cocktails to coffee he wound up with the remark that dinner would be ready about six and would probably be a more licentious and intemperate affair than lunch  me and caligula read it and decided to let it go for we being cooks were amenable to praise though it sounded out of place on a sight draft for ten thousand dollars  i took the letter over to the mountain valley road and watched for a messenger by and by a colored equestrian came along on horseback riding toward edenville i gave him a dollar to take the letter to the railroad offices and then i went back to camp    iv  about four oclock in the afternoon caligula who was acting as lookout calls to me  i have to report a white shirt signalling on the starboard bow sir  i went down the mountain and brought back a fat red man in an alpaca coat and no collar  gentlemen says colonel rockingham allow me to introduce my brother captain duval c rockingham vicepresident of the sunrise  edenville tap railroad  otherwise the king of morocco says i i reckon you dont mind my counting the ransom just as a business formality  well no not exactly says the fat man not when it comes i turned that matter over to our second vicepresident i was anxious after brother jacksons safetiness i reckon hell be along right soon what does that lobster salad you mentioned taste like brother jackson  mr vicepresident says i youll oblige us by remaining here till the second v p arrives this is a private rehearsal and we dont want any roadside speculators selling tickets  in half an hour caligula sings out again  sail ho looks like an apron on a broomstick  i perambulated down the cliff again and escorted up a man six foot three with a sandy beard and no other dimension that you could notice thinks i to myself if hes got ten thousand dollars on his person its in one bill and folded lengthwise  mr patterson g coble our second vicepresident announces the colonel  glad to know you gentlemen says this coble i came up to disseminate the tidings that major tallahassee tucker our general passenger agent is now negotiating a peachcrate full of our railroad bonds with the perry county bank for a loan my dear colonel rockingham was that chicken gumbo or cracked goobers on the bill of fare in your note me and the conductor of fiftysix was having a dispute about it  another white wings on the rocks hollers caligula if i see any more ill fire on em and swear they was torpedoboats  the guide goes down again and convoys into the lair a person in blue overalls carrying an amount of inebriety and a lantern i am so sure that this is major tucker that i dont even ask him until we are up above and then i discover that it is uncle timothy the yard switchman at edenville who is sent ahead to flag our understandings with the gossip that judge pendergast the railroads attorney is in the process of mortgaging colonel rockinghams farming lands to make up the ransom  while he is talking two men crawl from under the bushes into camp and caligula with no white flag to disinter him from his plain duty draws his gun but again colonel rockingham intervenes and introduces mr jones and mr batts engineer and fireman of train number fortytwo  excuse us says batts but me and jim have hunted squirrels all over this mounting and we dont need no white flag was that straight colonel about the plum pudding and pineapples and real store cigars  towel on a fishingpole in the offing howls caligula suppose its the firing line of the freight conductors and brakeman  my last trip down says i wiping off my face if the s  e t wants to run an excursion up here just because we kidnapped their president let em well put out our sign the kidnappers cafe and trainmens home  this time i caught major tallahassee tucker by his own confession and i felt easier i asked him into the creek so i could drown him if he happened to be a trackwalker or caboose porter all the way up the mountain he driveled to me about asparagus on toast a thing that his intelligence in life had skipped  up above i got his mind segregated from food and asked if he had raised the ransom  my dear sir says he i succeeded in negotiating a loan on thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds of our railroad and  never mind just now major says i its all right then wait till after dinner and well settle the business all of you gentlemen i continues to the crowd are invited to stay to dinner we have mutually trusted one another and the white flag is supposed to wave over the proceedings  the correct idea says caligula who was standing by me two baggagemasters and a ticketagent dropped out of a tree while you was below the last time did the major man bring the money  he says i answered that he succeeded in negotiating the loan  if any cooks ever earned ten thousand dollars in twelve hours me and caligula did that day at six oclock we spread the top of the mountain with as fine a dinner as the personnel of any railroad ever engulfed we opened all the wine and we concocted entrées and pièces de resistance and stirred up little savory chef de cuisines and organized a mass of grub such as has been seldom instigated out of canned and bottled goods the railroad gathered around it and the wassail and diversions was intense  after the feast me and caligula in the line of business takes major tucker to one side and talks ransom the major pulls out an agglomeration of currency about the size of the price of a town lot in the suburbs of rabbitville arizona and makes this outcry  gentlemen says he the stock of the sunrise  edenville railroad has depreciated some the best i could do with thirty thousand dollars worth of the bonds was to secure a loan of eightyseven dollars and fifty cents on the farming lands of colonel rockingham judge pendergast was able to obtain on a ninth mortgage the sum of fifty dollars you will find the amount one hundred and thirtyseven fifty correct  a railroad president said i looking this tucker in the eye and the owner of a thousand acres of land and yet  gentlemen says tucker the railroad is ten miles long there dont any train run on it except when the crew goes out in the pines and gathers enough lightwood knots to get up steam a long time ago when times was good the net earnings used to run as high as eighteen dollars a week colonel rockinghams land has been sold for taxes thirteen times there hasnt been a peach crop in this part of georgia for two years the wet spring killed the watermelons nobody around here has money enough to buy fertilizer and land is so poor the corn crop failed and there wasnt enough grass to support the rabbits all the people have had to eat in this section for over a year is hog and hominy and  pick interrupts caligula mussing up his red hair what are you going to do with that chickenfeed  i hands the money back to major tucker and then i goes over to colonel rockingham and slaps him on the back  colonel says i i hope youve enjoyed our little joke we dont want to carry it too far kidnappers well wouldnt it tickle your uncle my names rhinegelder and im a nephew of chauncey depew my friends a second cousin of the editor of puck so you can see we are down south enjoying ourselves in our humorous way now theres two quarts of cognac to open yet and then the jokes over  whats the use to go into details one or two will be enough i remember major tallahassee tucker playing on a jewsharp and caligula waltzing with his head on the watch pocket of a tall baggagemaster i hesitate to refer to the cakewalk done by me and mr patterson g coble with colonel jackson t rockingham between us  and even on the next morning when you wouldnt think it possible there was a consolation for me and caligula we knew that raisuli himself never made half the hit with burdick harris that we did with the sunrise  edenville tap railroad     the ethics of pig   on an eastbound train i went into the smoker and found jefferson peters the only man with a brain west of the wabash river who can use his cerebrum cerebellum and medulla oblongata at the same time  jeff is in the line of unillegal graft he is not to be dreaded by widows and orphans he is a reducer of surplusage his favorite disguise is that of the targetbird at which the spendthrift or the reckless investor may shy a few inconsequential dollars he is readily vocalized by tobacco so with the aid of two thick and easyburning brevas i got the story of his latest autolycan adventure  in my line of business said jeff the hardest thing is to find an upright trustworthy strictly honorable partner to work a graft with some of the best men i ever worked with in a swindle would resort to trickery at times  so last summer i thinks i will go over into this section of country where i hear the serpent has not yet entered and see if i can find a partner naturally gifted with a talent for crime but not yet contaminated by success  i found a village that seemed to show the right kind of a layout the inhabitants hadnt found that adam had been dispossessed and were going right along naming the animals and killing snakes just as if they were in the garden of eden they call this town mount nebo and its up near the spot where kentucky and west virginia and north carolina corner together them states dont meet well it was in that neighborhood anyway  after putting in a week proving i wasnt a revenue officer i went over to the store where the rude fourflushers of the hamlet lied to see if i could get a line on the kind of man i wanted  gentlemen says i after we had rubbed noses and gathered round the driedapple barrel i dont suppose theres another community in the whole world into which sin and chicanery has less extensively permeated than this life here where all the women are brave and propitious and all the men honest and expedient must indeed be an idol it reminds me says i of goldsteins beautiful ballad entitled the deserted village which says      ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey        what art can drive its charms away     the judge rode slowly down the lane mother        for im to be queen of the may   why yes mr peters says the storekeeper i reckon we air about as moral and torpid a community as there be on the mounting according to censuses of opinion but i reckon you aint ever met rufe tatum  why no says the town constable he cant hardly have ever that air rufe is shore the monstrousest scalawag that has escaped hangin on the galluses and that puts me in mind that i ought to have turned rufe out of the lockup before yesterday the thirty days he got for killin yance goodloe was up then a day or two more wont hurt rufe any though  shucks now says i in the mountain idiom dont tell me theres a man in mount nebo as bad as that  worse says the storekeeper he steals hogs  i think i will look up this mr tatum so a day or two after the constable turned him out i got acquainted with him and invited him out on the edge of town to sit on a log and talk business  what i wanted was a partner with a natural rural makeup to play a part in some little oneact outrages that i was going to book with the pitfall  gin circuit in some of the western towns and this r tatum was born for the role as sure as nature cast fairbanks for the stuff that kept eliza from sinking into the river  he was about the size of a first baseman and he had ambiguous blue eyes like the china dog on the mantelpiece that aunt harriet used to play with when she was a child his hair waved a little bit like the statue of the dinkusthrower at the vacation in rome but the color of it reminded you of the sunset in the grand canon by an american artist that they hang over the stovepipe holes in the salongs he was the reub without needing a touch youd have known him for one even if youd seen him on the vaudeville stage with one cotton suspender and a straw over his ear  i told him what i wanted and found him ready to jump at the job  overlooking such a trivial little peccadillo as the habit of manslaughter says i what have you accomplished in the way of indirect brigandage or nonactionable thriftiness that you could point to with or without pride as an evidence of your qualifications for the position  why says he in his kind of southern system of procrastinated accents haint you heard tell there aint any man black or white in the blue ridge that can tote off a shoat as easy as i can without bein heard seen or cotched i can lift a shoat he goes on out of a pen from under a porch at the trough in the woods day or night anywhere or anyhow and i guarantee nobody wont hear a squeal its all in the way you grab hold of em and carry em atterwards some day goes on this gentle despoiler of pigpens i hope to become reckernized as the champion shoatstealer of the world  its proper to be ambitious says i and hogstealing will do very well for mount nebo but in the outside world mr tatum it would be considered as crude a piece of business as a bear raid on bay state gas however it will do as a guarantee of good faith well go into partnership ive got a thousand dollars cash capital and with that homewardplods atmosphere of yours we ought to be able to win out a few shares of soon parted preferred in the money market  so i attaches rufe and we go away from mount nebo down into the lowlands and all the way i coach him for his part in the grafts i had in mind i had idled away two months on the florida coast and was feeling all to the ponce de leon besides having so many new schemes up my sleeve that i had to wear kimonos to hold em  i intended to assume a funnel shape and mow a path nine miles wide though the farming belt of the middle west so we headed in that direction but when we got as far as lexington we found binkley brothers circus there and the bluegrass peasantry romping into town and pounding the belgian blocks with their handpegged sabots as artless and arbitrary as an extra session of a datto bryan drama i never pass a circus without pulling the valvecord and coming down for a little key west money so i engaged a couple of rooms and board for rufe and me at a house near the circus grounds run by a widow lady named peevy then i took rufe to a clothing store and gentsoutfitted him he showed up strong as i knew he would after he was rigged up in the readymade rutabaga regalia me and old misfitzky stuffed him into a bright blue suit with a nile green visible plaid effect and riveted on a fancy vest of a light tuskegee normal tan color a red necktie and the yellowest pair of shoes in town  they were the first clothes rufe had ever worn except the gingham layette and the butternut topdressing of his native kraal and he looked as selfconscious as an igorrote with a new nosering  that night i went down to the circus tents and opened a small shell game rufe was to be the capper i gave him a roll of phony currency to bet with and kept a bunch of it in a special pocket to pay his winnings out of no i didnt mistrust him but i simply cant manipulate the ball to lose when i see real money bet my fingers go on a strike every time i try it  i set up my little table and began to show them how easy it was to guess which shell the little pea was under the unlettered hinds gathered in a thick semicircle and began to nudge elbows and banter one another to bet then was when rufe ought to have singlefooted up and called the turn on the little joker for a few tens and fives to get them started but no rufe id seen him two or three times walking about and looking at the sideshow pictures with his mouth full of peanut candy but he never came nigh  the crowd piked a little but trying to work the shells without a capper is like fishing without a bait i closed the game with only fortytwo dollars of the unearned increment while i had been counting on yanking the yeomen for two hundred at least i went home at eleven and went to bed i supposed that the circus had proved too alluring for rufe and that he had succumbed to it concert and all but i meant to give him a lecture on general business principles in the morning  just after morpheus had got both my shoulders to the shuck mattress i hears a houseful of unbecoming and ribald noises like a youngster screeching with greenapple colic i opens my door and calls out in the hall for the widow lady and when she sticks her head out i says mrs peevy maam would you mind choking off that kid of yours so that honest people can get their rest  sir says she its no child of mine its the pig squealing that your friend mr tatum brought home to his room a couple of hours ago and if you are uncle or second cousin or brother to it id appreciate your stopping its mouth sir yourself if you please  i put on some of the polite outside habiliments of external society and went into rufes room he had gotten up and lit his lamp and was pouring some milk into a tin pan on the floor for a dingywhite halfgrown squealing pig  how is this rufe says i you flimflammed in your part of the work tonight and put the game on crutches and how do you explain the pig it looks like backsliding to me  now dont be too hard on me jeff says he you know how long ive been used to stealing shoats its got to be a habit with me and tonight when i see such a fine chance i couldnt help takin it  well says i maybe youve really got kleptopigia and maybe when we get out of the pig belt youll turn your mind to higher and more remunerative misconduct why you should want to stain your soul with such a distasteful feebleminded perverted roaring beast as that i cant understand  why jeff says he you aint in sympathy with shoats you dont understand em like i do this here seems to me to be an animal of more than common powers of ration and intelligence he walked half across the room on his hind legs a while ago  well im going back to bed says i see if you can impress it upon your friends ideas of intelligence that hes not to make so much noise  he was hungry says rufe hell go to sleep and keep quiet now  i always get up before breakfast and read the morning paper whenever i happen to be within the radius of a hoe cylinder or a washington handpress the next morning i got up early and found a lexington daily on the front porch where the carrier had thrown it the first thing i saw in it was a doublecolumn ad on the front page that read like this      five thousand dollars reward     the above amount will be paid and no questions asked    for the return alive and uninjured of beppo the famous    european educated pig that strayed or was stolen from    the sideshow tents of binkley bros circus last night     geo b tapley business manager    at the circus grounds   i folded up the paper flat put it into my inside pocket and went to rufes room he was nearly dressed and was feeding the pig the rest of the milk and some applepeelings  well well well good morning all i says hearty and amiable so we are up and piggy is having his breakfast what had you intended doing with that pig rufe  im going to crate him up says rufe and express him to ma in mount nebo hell be company for her while i am away  hes a mighty fine pig says i scratching him on the back  you called him a lot of names last night says rufe  oh well says i he looks better to me this morning i was raised on a farm and im very fond of pigs i used to go to bed at sundown so i never saw one by lamplight before tell you what ill do rufe i says ill give you ten dollars for that pig  i reckon i wouldnt sell this shoat says he if it was any other one i might  why not this one i asked fearful that he might know something  why because says he it was the grandest achievement of my life there aint airy other man that could have done it if i ever have a fireside and children ill sit beside it and tell em how their daddy toted off a shoat from a whole circus full of people and maybe my grandchildren too theyll certainly be proud a whole passel why says he there was two tents one openin into the other this shoat was on a platform tied with a little chain i seen a giant and a lady with a fine chance of bushy white hair in the other tent i got the shoat and crawled out from under the canvas again without him squeakin as loud as a mouse i put him under my coat and i must have passed a hundred folks before i got out where the streets was dark i reckon i wouldnt sell that shoat jeff id want ma to keep it so thered be a witness to what i done  the pig wont live long enough i says to use as an exhibit in your senile fireside mendacity your grandchildren will have to take your word for it ill give you one hundred dollars for the animal  rufe looked at me astonished  the shoat cant be worth anything like that to you he says what do you want him for  viewing me casuistically says i with a rare smile you wouldnt think that ive got an artistic side to my temper but i have im a collector of pigs ive scoured the world for unusual pigs over in the wabash valley ive got a hog ranch with most every specimen on it from a merino to a poland china this looks like a blooded pig to me rufe says i i believe its a genuine berkshire thats why id like to have it  id shore like to accommodate you says he but ive got the artistic tenement too i dont see why it aint art when you can steal a shoat better than anybody else can shoats is a kind of inspiration and genius with me specially this one i wouldnt take two hundred and fifty for that animal  now listen says i wiping off my forehead its not so much a matter of business with me as it is art and not so much art as it is philanthropy being a connoisseur and disseminator of pigs i wouldnt feel like id done my duty to the world unless i added that berkshire to my collection not intrinsically but according to the ethics of pigs as friends and coadjutors of mankind i offer you five hundred dollars for the animal  jeff says this pork esthete it aint money its sentiment with me  seven hundred says i  make it eight hundred says rufe and ill crush the sentiment out of my heart  i went under my clothes for my moneybelt and counted him out forty twentydollar gold certificates  ill just take him into my own room says i and lock him up till after breakfast  i took the pig by the hind leg he turned on a squeal like the steam calliope at the circus  let me tote him in for you says rufe and he picks up the beast under one arm holding his snout with the other hand and packs him into my room like a sleeping baby  after breakfast rufe who had a chronic case of haberdashery ever since i got his trousseau says he believes he will amble down to misfitzkys and look over some royalpurple socks and then i got as busy as a onearmed man with the nettlerash pasting on wallpaper i found an old negro man with an express wagon to hire and we tied the pig in a sack and drove down to the circus grounds  i found george b tapley in a little tent with a window flap open he was a fattish man with an immediate eye in a black skullcap with a fourounce diamond screwed into the bosom of his red sweater  are you george b tapley i asks  i swear it says he  well ive got it says i  designate says he are you the guinea pigs for the asiatic python or the alfalfa for the sacred buffalo  neither says i ive got beppo the educated hog in a sack in that wagon i found him rooting up the flowers in my front yard this morning ill take the five thousand dollars in large bills if its handy  george b hustles out of his tent and asks me to follow we went into one of the sideshows in there was a jet black pig with a pink ribbon around his neck lying on some hay and eating carrots that a man was feeding to him  hey mac calls g b nothing wrong with the worldwide this morning is there  him no says the man hes got an appetite like a chorus girl at 1 am  howd you get this pipe says tapley to me eating too many pork chops last night  i pulls out the paper and shows him the ad  fake says he dont know anything about it youve beheld with your own eyes the marvelous worldwide porcine wonder of the fourfooted kingdom eating with preternatural sagacity his matutinal meal unstrayed and unstole good morning  i was beginning to see i got in the wagon and told uncle ned to drive to the most adjacent orifice of the nearest alley there i took out my pig got the range carefully for the other opening set his sights and gave him such a kick that he went out the other end of the alley twenty feet ahead of his squeal  then i paid uncle ned his fifty cents and walked down to the newspaper office i wanted to hear it in cold syllables i got the advertising man to his window  to decide a bet says i wasnt the man who had this ad put in last night short and fat with long black whiskers and a clubfoot  he was not says the man he would measure about six feet by four and a half inches with cornsilk hair and dressed like the pansies of the conservatory  at dinner time i went back to mrs peevys  shall i keep some soup hot for mr tatum till he comes back she asks  if you do maam says i youll more than exhaust for firewood all the coal in the bosom of the earth and all the forests on the outside of it  so there you see said jefferson peters in conclusion how hard it is ever to find a fairminded and honest businesspartner  but i began with the freedom of long acquaintance the rule should work both ways if you had offered to divide the reward you would not have lost  jeffs look of dignified reproach stopped me  that dont involve the same principles at all said he mine was a legitimate and moral attempt at speculation buy low and sell high dont wall street endorse it bulls and bears and pigswhats the difference why not bristles as well as horns and fur
