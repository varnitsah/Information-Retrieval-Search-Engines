2377269	the hot swamp by rm ballantyne  chapter one  a romance of old albion  opens with leavetaking  nearly two thousand seven hundred years agoor somewhere about eight hundred years búcúthere dwelt a phoenician seacaptain in one of the eastern seaports of greeceknown at that period or soon after as hellas  this captain was solid square bronzed bluff and resolute as all seacaptains areor ought to bewhether ancient or modern  he owned as well as commanded one of those curious vessels with one mast and a mighty squaresail fifty oars or so doublebanked a dragons tail in the stern and a horses head at the prow in which the phoenicians of old and other mariners were wont to drive an extensive and lucrative trade in the mediterranean sometimes pushing their adventurous keels beyond the pillars of hercules visiting the distant cassiterides or tin isles and albion and even penetrating northward into the baltic in search of tin amber gold and what not  one morning this captain whose name was arkal sauntered up from the harbour to his hut which stood on a conspicuous eminence overlooking the bay  his hands were not thrust into his pockets because he had no pockets to put them intothe simple tunic of the period being destitute of such appendages  indeed the coarse linen tunic referred to constituted the chief part of his costume the only other portions being a pair of rude shoes on his feet a red fez or tarbouche on his bushy brown locks and yards of something wound round his lower limbs to protect them from thorns on shore as well as from the rasping of cordage and cargo at sea  at the door of his hut stood his pretty little greek wife with a solid square bluff and resolute but not yet bronzed baby in her arms  well penelope im off said the captain  at least he used words to that effect as he enveloped wife and baby in a huge embrace  of course he spoke in a dialect of ancient greek of which we render a free translation  the leavetaking was of the briefest for just then a loud halloo from his mate or second in command apprised the captain that all was ready to set sail  but neither penelope nor her husband were anxious souls or addicted to the melting mood  the square baby was rather more given to such conditions  in emulation of the mate it set up a sudden howl which sent its father away laughing to the harbour  no sign of the young men remarked the mate as his superior came within hail  it is ever the way with these halffledged boys who think themselves men while their faces are yet hairless growled the captain casting a glance at his unfailing chronometer the rising sun  they have no more regard for the movements of that ball of fire than if it was set in the sky merely to shine and keep them warm and had no reference whatever to time  if this youth from albion does not appear soon i shall set sail without him prince though he be and leave him to try his hand at swimming to the cassiterides  his comrade and friend dromas assured me they would not keep us waiting but he is no better than the rest of thema shouting singing smoothfaced sixfoot set they are who think they inherit the combined wisdom of all their grandfathers but none of their weaknesses reckless fearnothings fit only for war and the olympic games  nevertheless we could not do well without them returned the mate glancing significantly at the ships crew a large proportion of which was composed of these same stalwart fearnothings of whom his leader spoke so contemptuously at least they would make a fine show at these games and our ventures at sea would not prosper so well if we had not such to help us  true true and i would not speak slightingly of them but they do try ones patience here is the wind failing and we all ready to hoist sail returned the captain with another growl a glance at the sky and a frown at his vessel everything about which betokened readiness for instant departure  the crewpartly composed of slaveswere seated at the oars the fighting men and seamen were all on board arranging their shields round the vessels sides and the great sail was cast loose ready to hoist as soon as the mouth of the harbour should be cleared  just then a band of young men issued from the town and the captains good humour was restored as they hurried towards him  they seemed to be much excited and talked in loud tones as they advanced their manners and costumes indicating that they belonged to the upper ranks of society  one of the band a fair youth towered like saul head and shoulders above his fellows  another of dark complexion handsome features and elegant active frame hurried forward to salute the captain  i fear we have kept you waiting he said with a pleasant expression that disarmed reproof  i will not deny that dromas answered the captain but you have not detained me long  nevertheless i was on the point of sailing without your friend for the winds and waves respect no one  but you are neither a wind nor a wave remarked the youth  true but i am the humble friend of both retorted the captain and am bound to accommodate myself to them  i suppose this is the prince you spoke of he added turning to the towering youth already referred to with the air of a man who had as littleor as muchregard for a prince as a peasant  yes captain arkal this is prince bladud  let me present him to you  as the prince and the seaman joined hands the latter looked up from an altitude of five feet six and squared his broad shoulders with the air of a man ready to defy all creation and anxious rather than otherwise to do so  the prince on the other hand looked down from an eminence of six feet seven and bent his head with a modest grace and a genial smile that indicated a desire to be on good terms if possible with the world at large  although almost equal as to physical strength the inequality of the two men in height rendered their experience in those rude warlike times very dissimilar for whereas the sailor was often compelled to give proof of his strength to tall unbelievers the prince very seldom had occasion to do so  hence partly their difference in manner the one being somewhat pugnacious and the other conciliatory while both were in reality goodnatured peaceloving men  no two men however could have been more unlike in outward aspect  the prince was if we may say so built on the gothic modelfair blueeyed bulky of limb huge muscular massive with a soft beard and moustachefor he had not yet seen twentyfour summersand hair that fell like rippling gold on his shoulders  captain arkal on the contrary was dark with a thick reddish beard luxuriant brown hair piercing black eyes and limbs that were hardened as well as darkened by thirty years of constant exposure to elemental and other warfare  i hope that i may be of some use to you said the prince though i profess not to know more of seamanship than i acquired during my voyage hither and as that voyage occurred six years ago it may be that i have lost the little i had learned  but if pirates should assail us perhaps i may do you some service  little fear i have of that returned the captain with an approving nod  now bid your comrades farewell and get on board for the wind is failing fast and it behoves us to get well forward on our voyage before night  it was evident that the leavetaking which ensued was not merely formal for the youths from whom bladud was parting had been his companions in study for six years as well as his competitors in all the manly games of the period and as he excelled them all in most thingsespecially in athleticssome looked up to the young prince from albion as a sort of demigod while others to whom he had been helpful in many ways regarded him with the warmest affection  come here aside with me i must have a few last words with you alone said bladud taking young dromas by the arm and leading him aside  the princes other friends made no objection to this evidence of preference for dromas had shared the same apartment with him while in athens and engaged in similar studies with bladud for several years had travelled with him in the east and sailed over the sea in his company even as far as egypt besides having been second to him in most of the games practised by the young men  indeed at the high jump he equalled and at the short race had even excelled him  dromas said the prince impressivelycome now my old friend and comrade interrupted the greek youth lightly dont put on such a long face  i foresee that you are about to give me a lecture and i dont want the tone of remonstrance to be the last that i shall hear  i know that im a wild goodfornothing fellow and can guess all you would say to me  let us rather talk of your speedy return to hellas for to tell you the truth i feel as if the loss of you would leave me like a poor man who has been crippled in the wars  i shall be a mere shadow till you return  there was a slight tremor in the voice which showed that much of the gaiety of the young man was forced  nay i have no mind to give you a lecture returned bladud i only ask you to grant me two requests  granted before mentioned for you have ever been a reasonable creature bladud and i trust you to retain your character on the present occasion  well then my first request is that you will often remember the many talks that you and i have had about the gods and the future life and the perplexing conditions in which we now live  remember them exclaimed dromas with animation my difficulty would be to forget them  the questions which you have propounded and attempted to answerfor i do not admit that you have been quite successful in the attempthave started up and rung in my ears at all kinds of unseasonable times  they haunt me often in my dreamsthough to say truth i dream but little save when good fellowship has led me to run supper into breakfastthey worry me during my studies which you know are frequent though not prolonged they come between me and the worthy rhapsodist when he is in the middle of the most interesting or least wearisomepassage of the poem and they even intrude on me at the games  the very last race i ran was lost only by a few inches because our recent talk on the future of cats caused a touch of internal laughter which checked my pace at the most critical moment  you may rest assured that i cannot avoid granting your first request  what is your second  that you promise to visit me in my home in albion  you know that it will be impossible for me ever again to revisit these shores where i have been so happy  my father if he forgives my running away from him will expect me to help him in the management of his affairs  but you have nothing particular to detain you here  you forgetthe old woman interrupted dromas gravely  what old woman asked bladud in surprise  my mother returned his friend  the prince looked a little confused and hastened to apologise  dromas mother was one of those unfortunate people who existed in the olden time as well as in modern days though perhaps not so numerously  she was a confirmed invalid who rarely quitted her house and was seldom seen by any one save her most intimate friends so that she was apt to be forgottenout of sight out of mind then as now  forgive me dromas began bladud but his friend interrupted him  i cannot forgive when i have nothing to forgive  say no more about that  but now i come to consider of it i grant your second request conditionally  if my mother agrees to accompany me to albion you may expect to see me some day or otherperhaps a year or two hence  you see since my father and brother were slain in the last fight with our neighbours i am the only one left to comfort her so i cannot forsake her  then this will be our final parting returned bladud sadly for your mother will never consent to leave home  i dont know that returned dromas with a laugh  the dear old soul is intensely adventurous like myself and i do believe would venture on a voyage to the cassiterides if the fancy were strong upon her  you have no idea how powerfully i can work upon her feelings  i wont say that i can make much impression on her intellect  indeed i have reason to know that she does not believe in intellect except as an unavoidable doorway leading into the feelings  the fact is i tried her the other day with the future of cats and do you know instead of treating that subject with the gravity it merits she laughed in my face and called me namesnot exactly bad names such as the gods might object tobut names that were not creditable to the intelligence of her firstborn now continued dromas with increasing gravity when i paint to her the beauty of your native land the splendour of your fathers court the kindliness of your mother and the exceeding beauty of your sisterfair like yourself blueeyed tallyou said she was tall i think  yesrather tall  of course not quite so tall as yourself say six feet or so with a slight feminine beardno you shake your head well smoothfaced and rosy immense breadth of shouldersah  i have often pictured to myself that sister of yours  hilloa shouted captain arkal in a nautical tone that might almost have been styled modern british in its character  it was an opportune interruption for dromas had been running on with his jesting remarks for the sole purpose of crushing down the feelings that almost unmanned him  with few but fervently uttered words the final farewells were at last spoken  the oars were dipped the vessel shot from the land swept out upon the blue waves of the aegean the sail was hoisted and thus began the long voyage to the almost unknown islands of the far northwest  chapter two  temporary delay through elements and pirates  but it is not our purpose to inflict the entire log of that voyage on our reader adventurous though the voyage was  matter of much greater importance claims our regard  still it would be unjust to our voyagers to pass it over in absolute silence  at the very commencement of it there occurred one of those incidents to which all voyagers are more or less subject  a gale arose the very evening of the day on which they left port which all but swamped the little vessel and the violence of the wind was so great that their huge sail was split from top to bottom  in spite of the darkness and the confusion that ensued captain arkal by his prompt action and skilful management saved the vessel from immediate destruction  fortunately the gale did not last long and during the calm that followed the rent was repaired and the sail reset  then occurred another incident that threatened to cut short the voyage even more disastrously than by swamping  the sea over which they steered swarmed with pirates at the time we write of as it continued to swarm during many centuries after merchantmen fully aware of the fact were in those days also men of war  they went forth on their voyages fully armed with sword javelin and shield as well as with the simple artillery of the periodbows and arrows slings and stones  on the afternoon of the day that followed the gale the vesselwhich her captain and owner had named the penelope in honour of his wife was running before a light breeze along the coast of one of the islands with which that sea is studded  bladud and some of the crew were listening at the time to an account given by a small seaman named maikar of a recent adventure on the sea when a galley about as large as their own was seen to shoot suddenly from the mouth of a cavern in the cliffs in which it had lain concealed it was doublebanked and full of armed men and was rowed in such a way as to cut in advance of the penelope  the vigour with which the oars were plied and the rapidity with which the sail was run up left no doubt as to the nature of the craft or the intentions of those who manned it  the rascals growled arkal with a dark frown i more than half expected to find them here  pirates i suppose said bladud  ayand not much chance of escaping them  give another haul on the sailrope mate and pull men pull if you would save your liberty for these brutes have no mercy  the sail was tightened up a few inches and the vessel was put more directly before the wind  the way in which the slaves bent to the oars showed that the poor fellows fully understood the situation  for a few minutes captain arkal watched the result in stern silence then with an unwonted look and tone of bitterness he said in a low voice  noi thought as much  she sails faster than we do  now friend bladud you shall presently have a chance of proving whether your royal blood is better than that of other men  to this remark the prince made no other reply than by a goodnatured smile as he took up the bronze helmet which lay beside his sword on the thwart and placed it on his head  captain arkal regarded him with a sort of grim satisfaction as he followed up the action by buckling on his sword  the sword in question was noteworthy  it was a singlehanded weapon of iron made in egypt to suit the size and strength of its owner and was large enough to have served as a twohanded sword for most men  you can throw a javelin no doubt asked the captain as he watched the young mans leisurely preparations for the expected combat  yes i have practised throwing the spear a good dealboth in peace and war  good  i have got one here that will suit you  it belonged to my grandfather who was a stout man and made powerful play with it during a neighbouring tribes raidwhen i was a babyto the discomfort i have been told and surprise of his foes  i always keep it by me for luck and have myself used it on occasion though i prefer a lighter one for ordinary use  here it isa pretty weapon he continued drawing a javelin of gigantic proportions from under the gunwale and handing it to bladud  but we must proceed with caution in this matter  take off your helmet at present and try to look frightened if you can  i fear me that will be difficult captain  not in the least  look here nothing is easier when you get used to it  as he spoke arkal caused his stern visage to relax into a look of such amiable sheepishness that bladud could not repress a sudden laugh which recalled and intensified the captains fierce expression instantly  learn to subdue yourself young man he muttered sternly  if these pirates hear laughter do you think they can be made to believe we are afraid of them  forgive me captain if you had seen your own face you would have joined in the laugh  i will be more careful  but how do you mean to proceed and what do you wish me to do  captain arkal who was restored to goodhumour by this compliment to his power of expression as well as by the modesty with which the prince received his rebuke explained his intentionsin low earnest tones however for they were by that time drawing near to the piratical craft  having got well ahead of the penelope it had backed its sail and lay still awaiting her coming up  creep to the bow bladud with your helmet off and show as little of your bulk as may be  show only your head above the bulwarks and look as miserable as i did just nowmore so if you can  take your sword javelin and shield with you  i need say no more to a man of war  use them when you see your opportunity  bladud received his orders in silence and obeyed them with that unquestioning and unhesitating promptitude which is one of the surest evidences of fitness to command  meanwhile the mate who was accustomed to his captains habits and needed no instructions had caused the sailors to lay their shields and swords out of sight at their feet so that they might approach the pirates in the character of simple traders who were completely cowed by the appearance of the foe  to increase this aspect of fear the sail was lowered as they drew near and the oars were used to complete the distance that yet intervened between the two vessels  this humble and submissive approach did not however throw the pirates quite off their guard  they stood to their arms and prepared to spring on board their victim when close enough  as the pirate vessel lay motionless on the water she presented her broadside to the trader  the captain took care to steer so that this relative position should be maintained  the pirate chief a huge man in rude armour with a breastplate of thick bullhide and a shield of the same on his left arm gave orders to pull the oars on one side of his vessel so that the two might be brought alongside  they were about fifty yards apart at the moment  before the order could be carried into effect however arkal uttered a low hiss  instantly the double banks of oars bent almost to the breaking point and the penelope leaped forward like a sentient creature  each man seized sword and shield and sprang up and bladud forgetting both helmet and shield in the hurry of the moment poised the mighty javelin which had so astonished its owners enemies in days gone by and in another moment hurled it shrieking through the air  it flew straight as a thunderbolt at the pirate chief pierced through shield and breastplate and came out at his back sending him headlong into the arms of his horrified crew  the whole incident was so sudden that the pirates had scarcely time to recover from their surprise when the bow of the penelope crashed into the side of their vessel and stove it in for the trader like some of the warvessels of the period was provided with a ram for this very purpose  as the penelope recoiled from the shock a yell of rage burst from the pirates and a volley of javelins and stones followed but owing to the confusion resulting from the shock these were illdirected and such of them as found their mark were caught on the shields  before another discharge could be made the pirate vessel heeled over and sank leaving her crew of miscreants struggling in the sea  some of thembeing strange to say unable to swimwere drowned  others were killed in the water while a few taking their swords in their teeth swam to the trader and made desperate attempts to climb on board  of course they failed and in a few minutes nothing remained of the pirate vessel to tell of the tragedy that had been enacted except an oar or two and a few spars left floating on the sea  would that all the searobbers in these parts could be as easily and thoroughly disposed of remarked the captain as he gave orders to rehoist the sail  ho  bladud my worthy prince come aft here  what detains you  but bladud did not answer to the call  a stone from the enemy had fallen on his defenceless head and knocked him down insensible  four of the men now raised him up  as they did so one of the menthe small seaman maikarwas found underneath him in a state of semiconsciousness  while they carried bladud aft the little sailor began to gasp and sneeze  not killed i see remarked the mate looking into his face with some anxiety  no not quite sighed maikar drawing a long breath and raising himself on one elbow with a slightly dazed look but i never was so nearly burst in all my life  if an ox had fallen on me he could not have squeezed me flatter  do two of you squeeze me the other way to open me out a little theres no room in me left to breathescarcely room to think  oh your battles are not yet over i see said the mate going off to the stern of the vessel where he found bladud just recovering consciousness and smiling at the remarks of the captain who busied himself in stanching the wound just over his frontal bone from which blood was flowing freely  hm this comes of sheer recklessness  i told you to take off your helmet but i did not tell you to keep it off  man you launched that javelin wellbetter than i could have done it myself  indeed i doubt if my old grandfather could have done it with such telling effect straight through and through  i saw full a handbreadth come out at the villains back  what say you mate  little maikar wounded  no not wounded but nearly burst as he says himself and no wonder for bladud fell upon him  didnt i tell you mate said the captain looking up with a grin that nothing will kill little maikar  go to man you pretend to be a judge of men yet you grumbled at me for engaging him as one of our crew  do you feel better now prince  ay greatly better thank you replied bladud putting his hand gently on the bandages with which the captain had skilfully bound his head  that is well  i think now that food will do you service  what say you  nay with your leave i prefer sleep said the prince stretching himself out on the deck  a little rest will suffice for my head is noted for its thickness and my brain for its solidityat least so my good father was wont to say and ive always had great respect for his opinion  ah save when it ran counter to your own suggested arkal and especially that time when you ran away from home and came out here in the long ship of my trading friend  i have regretted that many a time since then and i am now returning home to offer submission  dyou think that hell forgive you  i am sure he will for he is a kind man and i know he loves me though he has never said so  i should like to know that father of yours  i like your description of himso stern of face yet so kind of heart and with such an unchangeable will when he sees what is right  but what is right and what is wrong  aywhat iswho can tell  some people believe that the gods make their will known to man through the delphic oracle  boh exclaimed the captain with a look of supreme contempt  the turn of thought silenced both speakers for a time and when captain arkal turned to resume the conversation he found that his friend was sound asleep  chapter three  on the voyage  weather has always been and we suppose always will be capricious its uncertainty of characterin the levant as in the atlantic in days of old as now was always the samesmiling today frowning tomorrow playful as a lamb one day raging like a lion the next  after the rough handling experienced by the penelope at the beginning of her voyage rude boreas kindly retired and spicy breezes from africa rippled the sea with just sufficient force to intensify its heavenly blue and fill out the great squaresail so that there was no occasion to ply the oars  one dark starlight but moonless night a time of quiet talk prevailed from stem to stern of the vessel as the grizzled mariners spun long yarns of their prowess and experiences on the deep for the benefit of awestricken and youthful shipmates whose careers were only commencing  youve heard no doubt of the great seaserpent observed little maikar who had speedily recovered from the flattening to which bladud had subjected him and was busy enlivening a knot of young fellows in the bow of the ship  of course we have cried one father used to tell me about it when i was but a small boy  he never saw it himself though he had been to the tin isles and albion more than once but he said he had met with men who had spoken with shipmates who had heard of it from men who had seen it only a few days before and who described it exactly  ah remarked another but i have met a man who had seen it himself on his first voyage when he was quite a youth and he said it had a bulls head and horns with a dreadful long body all over scales and something like an asss tail at the end  poohnonsense exclaimed little maikar twirling his thumbs for smoking had not been introduced into the world at that periodand thumbtwirling would seem to have served the ancient world for leisurely pastime quite as well if not betterat least we are led to infer so from the fact that herodotus makes no mention of anything like a vague mysterious sensation of unsatisfied desire to fill the mouth with smoke in those early ages which he would certainly have done had the taste for smoke been a natural craving and thumbtwirling an unsatisfactory occupation  this absolute silence of the father of history we think almost proves our point  nonsense repeated little maikar  the youth of the man who told you about the serpent accounts for his wild description for youth is prone to strange imaginings and  it seems to me interrupted a grave man who twirled his thumbs in that slow deliberate way in which a contemplative man smokesit seems to me that theres no more truth about the great seaserpent than there is about the golden fleece  i dont believe in either of them  dont you  well all i can say is returned the little man gazing fixedly in the grave comrades face that i saw the great seaserpent with my own eyes  no did you exclaimed the group drawing their heads closer together with looks of expectancy  ay that did i mates but you mustnt expect wild descriptions about monsters with bulls horns and asses tails from me  i like truth and the truth is that the brute was so far away at the time we saw it that not a man of us could tell exactly what it was like and when we tried the description we were all so different that we gave it up but we were all agreed on this point that it certainly was the serpent  the listeners seemed rather disappointed at this meagre account and sudden conclusion of what had bidden fair to become a stirring tale of the sea but maikar rearoused their expectations by stating his firm belief that it was all nonsense about there being only one seaserpent  why how could there be only one he demanded ceasing to twirl in order that he might clench his fist and smite his knee with emphasis havent you got a grandfather he asked turning suddenly to the grave man  certainly ive got two of them if you come to that he answered taken rather aback by the brusque and apparently irrelevant nature of the question  just sotwo of them repeated the little man and dont you think it likely that the sea serpent must have had two grandfathers also  undoubtedlyand two grandmothers as well  perhaps hes got them yet replied the grave man with a contemplative look over the side where the rippling sea gleamed with phosphoric brilliancy  exactly so continued maikar in an eager tone and of course these also must have had two grandfathers besides a mother each and it is more than likely that the great seaserpent himself is the father of a large family  which implies a wife suggested one of the seamen  not necessarily objected an elderly seaman who had once been to the lands lying far to the north of albion and had acquired something of that tendency to object to everything at all times which is said to characterise the people of the far north  not necessarily he repeated for the serpent may be a bachelor with no family at all  there was a short laugh at this and an illogical man of the group made some irrelevant observation which led the conversation into a totally different channel and relegated the great seaserpent for the time being to oblivion  while the men were thus engaged philosophising in the bow bladud and the captain were chatting in subdued voices in the stern  it is impossible said the latter in reply to a remark made by the former it is impossible for me to visit your fathers court this year though it would please me much to do so but my cargo is intended for the southwestern cassiterides  to get round to the river on the banks of which your home stands would oblige me to run far towards the cold regions into waters which i have not yet visitedthough i know them pretty well by hearsay  on another voyage i may accomplish it but not on this one  i am sorry for that arkal because things that are put off to another time are often put off altogether  but the men of the tin isles often visit my fathers town in their boats with copper and tin and there are tracks through the forest which horses can traverse  could you not visit us overland  it would not be a journey of many weeks and your trusty mate might look after the ship in your absence  besides the diggers may not have enough of the metal ready to fill your ship so you may be idle a long time  what say you  captain arkal frowned as was his wont when considering a knotty question and shook his head  i doubt if i should be wise to venture so much he said moreover we are not yet at the end of our voyage  it is of little use troubling onesself about the end of anything while we are only at the beginning  nevertheless rejoined bladud to consider the possible end while yet at the beginning seems not unreasonable though undoubtedly we may never reach the end  many a fair ship sets sail and never returns  ay that is true as i know to my cost returned the captain for this is not my first venture  a long time ago i loaded a ship about the size of this one and sent her under command of one of my best friends to the euxine sea for gold  i now think that that old story about jason and his ship argo sailing in search of the golden fleece was running too strong in my youthful brain  besides that of course i had heard the report that there is much gold in that direction and my hopes were strong for you know all the world runs after gold  anyhow my ship sailed and i never saw her or my friend again  since then i have contented myself with copper and tin  a slight increase in the wind at that moment caused the captain to dismiss his golden and other memories and look inquiringly to windward  a squall methinks said bladud  no only a puff replied his friend ordering the steersman to alter the course a little  the squall or puff was only strong enough to cause the penelope to make a graceful bow to the controlling element and cleave the sparkling water with her prow so swiftly that she left a gleaming wake as of lambent fire astern  it was shortlived however and was followed by a calm which obliged little maikar and his comrades to cease their storytelling and ply their fifty oars  thus the pace was kept going though not quite so swiftly as if they were running before a stiff breeze  the gods are propitious said the captain we are going to have a prosperous voyage  how many gods are propitious asked bladud  that is a question much too deep for me to answer  but not too deep to think ofis it  of what use would be my thinking returned the captain lightly  i leave such matters to the learned  now mate he added turning to his subordinate im going to rest a while  see that you keep an open eye for squalls and pirates  both are apt to come down on you when you least expect them  but neither squalls nor pirates were destined to interfere with the penelope during the greater part of that voyage  day after day the skies were clear the sea comparatively smooth and the winds favourable  sometimes they put ashore when the weather became stormy and circumstances were favourable  on such occasions they lighted campfires under the trees the ruddy light of which glowed with a grand effect on the picturesque sailors as they sat stood or reclined around them  at other times they were obliged to keep more in the open sea and occasionally met with traders like themselves returning home with whom of course they were glad to fraternise for a time and exchange views  once only did they meet with anything like a piratical vessel but as that happened to be late in the evening they managed by plying the oars vigorously and under the shade of night to escape a second encounter with those robbers of the sea  thus in course of time the length of the great inland sea was traversed the southern coast of what is now known as france was reached and the captains prophecy with regard to a prosperous voyage was thus far fulfilled  chapter four  the storm and wreck  it was near daybreak on the morning of a night of unclouded splendour when the mate of the penelope aroused his chief with the information that appearances to windward betokened a change of some sort in the weather  if there is a change at all it must be for the worse said arkal raising himself on one elbow rubbing his eyes yawning and then casting a glance over the side where the rippling foam told that the wind was increasing  raising his eyes to the windward horizon he threw aside the sheepskin blanket that covered him and rose up quickly  there is indeed a change coming  rouse the men and reduce the sail mate  bestir you  the squalls are sudden here  the orders were obeyed with promptitude  in a few minutes the sail was reduced to its smallest size and all loose articles about the vessel were made fast  you expect a gale captain asked bladud who was aroused by the noise of the preparations  ayor something like one  when a cloud like that rises up on the horizon there is usually something more than a puff coming  you had better keep well under the lee of the bulwarks when it strikes us  bladuds nautical experience had already taught him what to expect and how to act in the circumstance that threatened  standing close to the side of the ship he laid hold of a stanchion and looked out to windward as most of the crew were by that time doing  captain arkal himself took the helm  the increasing daylight showed them that the bank of cloud was spreading quickly over the sky towards the zenith while a soft hissing sound told of the approaching wind  soon the blackness on the sea intensified and white gleams as of flashing light showed where the waves were torn into foam by the rushing wind  with a warning to hold on fast the captain turned the vessels head so as to meet the blast  so fierce was it that it cut off the crests of the wavelets blowing the sea almost flat for a time and producing what is known as a white squall  the sail was kept fluttering until the fury of the onset was over then the wind was allowed to fill it the penelope bent down until the sea began to bubble over the lee bulwarks and in a few moments more she was springing over the fast rising waves like a nautical racehorse  every moment the gale increased obliging the mariners to show but a corner of the sail  even this had at last to be taken in and during the whole of that dismal day and of the black night which followed the penelope drove helplessly before the wind under a bare pole fortunately the gale was favourable so that they were enabled to lay their course but it required all the skill and seamanship of captain arkal to prevent their being pooped and swamped by the waves that rolled hissing after them as if hungering mightily to swallow them up  to have the right man in the right place at such times of imminent danger is allimportant not only to the safety of the craft but to the peace of mind of those whose lives are in jeopardy  all on board the little vessel during that hurricane felt much comforted by the knowledge that their captain was in the right place  although a square man he had by no means been fitted into a round hole  knowing this prince bladud felt no anxiety as to the management of the craft and gave himself up to contemplate the grandeur of the storm for the howling blast creaking spars and bursts of rattling thunder rendered conversation out of the question  during a slight lull however bladud asked the question whether the captain knew on what part of the coast they were running  not exactly he replied we have been running so long in darkness that i can only guess  if it holds on much longer like this i shall have to put her head to wind and wait for more light  it may be that we have been driven too far to the left and there are islands hereabouts that we must keep well clear of  i would that we had put into some bay for shelter before this befell us  ho mate  ay captain  see that you put our sharpest pair of eyes in the bow and let a second pair watch the first lest the owner of them should go to sleep  little maikar is there sir shouted the mate and i am watching him myself  we shall do well with maikar in the bow for he sees like a weasel and is trustworthy muttered the captain as he glanced uneasily over the stern where the hungry waves were still hissing tumultuously after them as if rendered furious by the delayed meal  at daybreak on the second day the gale moderated a little and they were enabled once more to show a corner of their sail and to encourage the hope that the worst was over  but a fresh outburst of greater fury than before soon dashed these hopes and obliged the captain to throw overboard all the spare spars and some of the heaviest part of the cargo  still the gale increased and the impatient waves began to lip over the poop occasionally as if unable to refrain from tasting  more cargo must go muttered the captain with a gloomy frown  being resolute he gave orders to that effect  presently the order was given to take soundings  when this was done it was found that they were in twenty fathoms water  on taking another cast the depth reported was fifteen fathoms  there were no charts covered with soundings to guide the mariner in those days but it did not require much experience to convince a seaman that land was probably too near with such a sudden change from twenty to fifteen fathoms  arkal was however not unprepared for it and quickly gave orders to stand by to let go the anchors  at that moment the voice of little maikar was heard shouting in stentorian tones land ahead  the captain replied with a sharp let go and four anchors were promptly dropped from the stern  at the same moment he placed the helm fair amidships and made it fast with rudderbands  as the stern of the penelope was formed like the bow a sharp cutwater was by this means instantly presented to the sea thus avoiding the necessity and danger incurred by modern ships in similar circumstances of anchoring by the head and swinging round  the hungry waves hissed tumultuously on but were cleft and passed under the ship disappointed for there was still enough of water beneath to permit of her tossing to and fro and rising to them like a duck as she strained and tugged at the anchors  just as these operations had been performed the mists of darkness seemed to lift a little and revealed a wild rocky line of coast against which the waves were breaking madly  now all hope is over pray to your gods men said the mate whose courage was not quite equal to his position  there are no gods growled the captain bitterly for he saw that he was now a ruined man even though he should escape with life  there is one god said bladud quietly and he does all things well  as he spoke the captain whose eyes had not ceased to look searchingly along the coast observed something like a bay a short way to the left of the place where they lay  it looks like a sandy bay he said  it is a sandy bay exclaimed the anxious mate let us up anchors and run into it  have an easy mind and keep your advice till asked for returned the captain with a look of scorn  if we are destined to escape we shall escape without making haste  if we are doomed to die nothing can save us and it is more manly to die in a leisurely way than in a hurry when we can see clearly we shall know better how to act  although this manner of submitting to the inevitable did not quite suit the mate he felt constrained to repress his impatience while the coolness of the captain had a quieting effect on some of the men who were inclined to give way to panic  the sight of bladudas he sat there leaning on the hilt of his sword with an expression of what appeared to be serene contentmenthad also a quieting effect on the men  when the increasing light showed that the sandy bay was a spot that might possibly be reached in safety orders were given to cut the cables loose the rudderbands and hoist the sail  for a few minutes the vessel ran swiftly towards the bay but before reaching the shore she struck with violence  the fore part of the penelope stuck fast immovably and then at last the ravenous waves attained their longedfor meal  they burst over the stern swept the decks tore up the fastenings revelled among the tackling and began tumultuously to break up the ship  launch the skiff shouted the captain hastening to lend a hand in the operation  the men were not slow to obey and when it touched the water they swarmed into it so that being overloaded it upset and left its occupants struggling in the water  a number of the men who could swim immediately jumped overboard and tried to right the skiff but they failed and in the effort to do so broke the rope that held it  some clung to it  others turned and swam for the shore  a good many of the men however still remained in the wreck which was fast breaking up  to these the captain turned  now men he said those of you who can swim would do well to take to the water at once for it is clear that we shall not have a plank left to stand on soon  come mate show them an example  the man though not very courageous as his pale face betrayed happened to be a good swimmer and at once leaped into the sea  he was followed by all who could swim  those who could not were encouraged to make the attempt with planks and oars to aid them  as for bladud he busied himself like the captain in giving heart to the nonswimmers and showing them how best to use their floats  the last of the men to leave was little maikar  he stood at the bow with his arms crossed on his chest and a look of melancholy interest on his countenance  what not gone yet exclaimed the captain turning to him  i cannot swim said the man  but neither can these returned the captain pointing to the men who had left last  my father used to say rejoined maikar as if murmuring to himself that i was born to be drowned and im inclined to think he was right  surely you are not afraid said arkal  afraid exclaimed maikar with a sarcastic laugh  no captain but im sorry to part with you because youve been a good captain to me  an i bear no illwill to you bladud though you did squeeze most of the life out of me once  farewell both  as he spoke the little man seized an oar leaped overboard and after some trouble in steadying himself and pointing the oar in the right direction struck out for the shore  it was a long way off and often while this scene was being enacted was heard the bubbling cry of men whose powers were failing them  some were carried by currents against a point to the westward and apparently dashed against the rocks  others sank before half the distance had been traversed  bladud and the captain looked at each other when maikar had left them  can you swim asked the captain  like a duck returned the prince and i can help you if required  i swim like a fish returned the captain but it is hard to part from my penelope  she has never failed me till now and as this venture contains all my goods i am a ruined man  but your life still remains said the prince  be of good cheer captain  a stout man can make his fortune more than once  come let us go  a loud cry from maikar at that moment hastened their deliberations  are you going to cumber yourself with your weapons asked arkal as they were about to spring from the side observing that his friend took up his sword and shield  aythat am i  it is not a small matter that will part my good sword and me  both men sprang overboard at the same moment and made for the spot where little maikar was still giving vent to bubbling yells and struggling with his oar  bladud was soon alongside of him and seizing his hair raised him out of the water  got the cramp he shouted  keep still then and do what i tell ye said the prince in a tone of stern command  he caught the poor man under the armpits with both hands turned on his back and drew him on to his chest  swimming thus on his back with captain arkal leading so as to keep them in the right direction the three were ultimately cast in a rather exhausted condition on the shore of the little bay  chapter five  after the wreck  it was on the southern shore of what is now known as france that our hero and his comrades in misfortune were cast  at the time we write of we need hardly say the land was nameless even her old roman name of gaul had not yet been given to her for rome itself had not been founded  the fair land was a vast wilderness known onlyand but slightlyto the adventurous mariners of the east who with the spirit of columbus had pushed their discoveries and trade far beyond the pillars of hercules  of course the land was a vast solitude inhabited sparsely by a few of those wandering tribes which had been driven westwardby conquest or by that desire for adventure which has characterised the human race we suppose ever since adam and eve began to explore the regions beyond eden  like the great wilderness lying to the north of canada at the present time it was also the home of innumerable wild animals which afforded to its uncivilised inhabitants both food and clothing  captain arkal was the only one of the three survivors of the wreck who had seen that coast before or knew anything about it for when bladud had entered the mediterranean many years before he had passed too far to the southward to see the northern land  as they staggered up the beach to a place where the thundering waves sent only their spray bladud looked round with some anxiety  surely he said some of the crew must have escaped  it can hardly be that we three are the only survivors out of so many  the party halted and looked back at the seething waves from which they had just escaped  it would be foul shame to us said the captain if we did not try to lend a helping hand to our comrades but we shall find none of them here  i observed when they started that in spite of my warning they made straight for the land instead of keeping well to windward to avoid being swept round that point of rock to the west  i led you in the right direction and that is why we alone are here  if any of the others have been saved they must be on the other side of that point  while he was speaking the captain had hurried into the woods intending to cross the neck of land which separated them from the bay beyond the point referred to  their strength returned as they ran for their intense desire to render aid to those of their late comrades who might stand in need of it seemed to serve them in the stead of rest  come quick cried little maikar whose catlike activity and strength enabled him to outrun his more bulky companions  we may be too late and some of them cant swimi know  they reached the crest of a ridge a few minutes later and halting looked at each other in dismay for the bay beyond the point was full of great rocks and boulders among which the waves rushed with such fury that they spouted in jets into the air and covered the sea with foam  no living soul can have landed there said the captain in a tone that showed clearly he had given up all hope  but some may have been swept round the next point suggested maikar eagerly commencing to run forward as he spoke  bladud followed at once and so did the captain but it was evident that he regarded any further effort as useless  it proved a longer and more toilsome march than they had expected to pass beyond the second point and when at last it was reached there was not a speck at all resembling a human being to be seen on the coast in all its length of many miles  no hope murmured bladud  none returned the captain  little maikar did not speak but the expression of his countenance showed that he was of the same opinion  now resumed the captain after a brief silence if we would not starve we must go straight back and see whether any provisions have been washed ashore  they did not however return to the spot where they had landed for they knew that the same current which had carried their hapless comrades to the westward must have borne the remains of the wreck in the same direction  descending therefore to the foamcovered bay before referred to they searched its margin carefully but for some time found nothingnot even a scrap of wreck  at last just as they were about to give up in despair and turn to some other method of obtaining food they observed a portion of the wreck that had been driven high up on the beach into a cleft of rock  running eagerly towards it they found that it was only a plank  bladud and the captain looked at it for a moment or two in silence and maikar gave vent to a groan of disappointment  never mind said the prince lifting the plank and laying it on his shoulder in the quiet thoughtful way that was peculiar to him it will serve to make a fire and keep us warm  but we need not to be kept warm for the weather is fine and hot said maikar with a rueful expression  moreover we need food and we cannot eat a plank  the prince did not reply but led the way towards a neighbouring cliff  dont you think we had better make our fire in the woods bladud asked the captain  that would oblige one of us to watch in case natives or wolves should attack us and none of us are in a fit state to watch  we must sleep  but i cant sleep without first eating said maikar in a remonstrative tone  should we not go to the woods first and try to catch something  can you on foot run down the hare the deer the bear the wildboar or even the rabbit  not i  my legs are swift enough though short but they are not equal to that  well then as we have neither bow nor shaft and my good sword would be of little use against such game why waste our time and strength in the woods  but we might find honey suggested maikar  and if we did not find honey what then  berries answered the little man  berries are not nearly ripe yet  true i forgot that  say you did not know it man interposed the captain with a laugh never be ashamed of confessing ignorance in regard to things that youre not bound to know  lead on bladud we will follow  you know more of woodcraft than either of us  if it were the sea we had to do battle with i would claim to lead  on land being only a babe i freely resign the helm to one who knows how to steer  agreeing to this arrangement bladud led his companions up the steep face of a cliff until a projecting ledge was reached which was just wide enough to form a campingground with a perpendicular cliff at the back and with its other sides so precipitous as to render the approach of enemieswhether two or fourleggedexceedingly difficult  by piling a few stones at the head of the path by which it was reached they rendered it impossible for any one to approach without awakening the sleepers  bladud then using his sword as a hatchet chipped off some pieces of the plank and directed his companions to cut away the wet parts of these and reduce the dry parts to shavings  they obeyed this order in silence and wonderingly for a fire seemed useless their encampment being well sheltered from the wind and as we have said the weather was warm  by means of a cord a rude bow and a drill made of a piece of dry wood their leader soon procured fire and in a few minutes a bright flame illumined their persons and the cliff behind them  as the shades of evening were falling by that time the aspect of things was much improved by the change  now comrades said the prince undoing the breast of his tunic and drawing from either side a flat mass of dark substance that resembled old dried cowhide we shall have supper and thento rest  dried meat exclaimed little maikar his eyesand indeed his whole visageblazing with delighted surprise  right  maikar  i knew that you would be hungry when we got ashore so i caught up two pieces of meat and stuffed them into my breast just as we were leavingone for arkal and me the other for you  it may not be quite enough perhaps but will do i hope to keep you quiet till morning  nay i shall content me with my fair share it i may claim a share at all of what i had no hand in procuring  it was wise of you to do this how came you to think of it  to say truth i can lay claim to neither wisdom nor forethought answered the prince dividing the food into equal portions  the meat chanced to be lying close to my hand as i was about to leap into the sea  had i seen it sooner i would have advised all to take some in the same way  there now set to and cook it  for myself i feel so sleepy that im half inclined to eat it raw  the jerked or dried meat which had been thus opportunely brought away may be said to have been half cooked in the drying process and indeed was sometimes eaten in its dried condition when it was inconvenient to cook it  in a few minutes therefore the supper was ready and in a few minutes more it was disposed offor strong jaws sound teeth and good appetite make short work of victuals  by that time the night had set in the gale was moderating the stars had come out and there seemed every prospect of a speedy and favourable change in the weather  with darkness came the wolves and other creatures of the night both furred and feathered  against the former the party was protected by the steep ascent and the barricade but the latter kept swooping down out of darkness ever and anon glaring at them for a moment with round inquiring eyes and sweeping off as if affrighted in unearthly silence  little heed was paid to these sights and sounds however by our adventurers who were filled with sadness at the loss of their ship and comrades  they spoke but little during the meal and after partially drying themselves lay down with their feet towards the fire and almost instantly fell asleep  being trained to a hardy life they did not feel the want of couch or covering and healthy exhaustion prevented dreams from disturbing their repose  gradually the fire died down the howling of the wolves ceased the nightbirds betook them to their haunts and no sound was heard in or around the camp except the soft breathing of the sleepers and the booming of the distant waves  chapter six  first anxieties and troubles  the day that followed the wreck was well advanced before the sleepers awakened  their first thoughts were those of thankfulness for having escaped with life  then arose feelings of loneliness and sorrow at the sad fate of the crew of the penelope for though it was just possible that some of their comrades had reached the shore on the beach that extended to the westward such an event was not very probable  still the bare hope of this induced them to rise in haste  after a hurried breakfast on the remnants of the previous nights supper they proceeded along the coast for several miles carefully searching the shores of every bay  about noon they halted  a few scraps of the dried meat still remained and on these they dined sitting on a grassy slope while they consulted as to their future proceedings  what is now to be done asked the captain of bladud after they had been seated in silence for some minutes  i would rather hear your opinion first returned his friend  you must still continue to act as captain for it is fitting that age should sit at the helm while i will act the part of guide and forester seeing that i am somewhat accustomed to woodcraft  and the remainder of our band said little maikar wiping his mouth after finishing the last morsel will sit in judgment on your deliberations  be it so returned bladud  wisdom it is said lies in small compass so we should find it in you  captain arkal whose knitted brows and downcast eyes showed that his thoughts were busy looked up suddenly  it is not likely he said that any ships will come near this coast for the gale has driven us far out of the usual track of trading ships and there are no towns here large or small that i know of  it would be useless therefore to remain where we are in the hope of being picked up by a passing vessel  to walk back to our home in the east is next to impossible for it is not only far distant but there lie between us and hellas farreaching gulfs and bays besides great mountain ranges which have never yet been crossed for their tops are in the clouds and covered summer and winter with eternal snow  then no hope remains to us said maikar with a sigh except to join ourselves to the wild people of the landif there be any people at all in itand live and die like savages  patience maikar i have not yet finished  besides interpolated bladud a wise judge never delivers an opinion until he has heard both sides of a question  now from my knowledge of the lie of coastlands i feel sure that the isles of the cassiterides must lie there continued the captain pointing westward and if we travel diligently it is not unlikely that we shall come down upon the coast of this land almost opposite to them there we may find or perhaps make a boat in which we could cross overfor the sea at that part is narrow and the white cliffs of the land will be easily distinguished  once there i have no doubt that we shall find a ship belonging to one of my countrymen which will take maikar and me back to our homes while you prince will doubtless be able to return to your fathers court on foot  it will be seen from this speech that the phoenician captain included the southern shore of england in his idea of the cassiterides  his notion of the direction in which the islands lay however was somewhat incorrect being founded partly on experience but partly also on a misconception prevalent at the time that the islands referred to lay only a little way to the north of spain  your plan seems to me a good one said bladud after some thought but i cannot help thinking that you are not quite right in your notion as to the direction of the tin islands  when i left albion i kept a careful note of our daily runsbeing somewhat curious on such points and it is my opinion that they lie there  he pointed almost due north  the captain smiled and shook his head bladud looked at maikar who also smiled and shook his head  if you want my opinion said the little man gravely it is that when two great good and wise men differ so widely it is more than likely the truth lies somewhere between them  in my judgment therefore the cassiterides lie yonder  he pointed with an air of confidence in a northwest direction  it does seem to me said bladud that maikar is right for as you and i seem to be equally confident in our views captain a middle course may be the safest  however if you decide otherwise i of course submit  nay returned the captain i will not abuse the power you have given me  let us decide the matter by lot  ay let us draw lots echoed maikar and so shove the matter off our shoulders on to the shoulders of chance  there is there can be no such thing as chance said bladud in a soliloquising tone  however let it be as you wish  i recognise the justice of two voices overriding one  lots were drawn accordingly and the longest fell to the little seaman without further discussion therefore the course suggested by him was adopted  and now comrades said the prince rising and drawing his knife which like his sword had been procured in egypt and was of white metalwe must set to work to make bows and arrows for animals are not wont to walk up to man and request to be killed and cooked and it wont be long before maikar is shouting for food  sorry am i that the good javelin of my grandfather went down in the carcase of the pirate chief remarked the captain also rising for it seems to me by the way you handled it bladud that you could have killed deer with it as well as men  i have killed deer with such before now truly but the arrow is handier and surer  ay in a sure hand with a good eye to direct it returned arkal but i make no pretence to either  a ship indeed i can manage to hitwhen i am cool which is not often the case in a fightand if there are men in it my shafts are not quite thrown away but as to deer boars and birds i can make nothing of them  if i mistake not maikar is not much better than myself with the bow  i am worse observed the little man quietly  well then said bladud with a laugh you must make me hunter to the party  while conversing thus they had entered the forest and soon found trees suitable to their purpose from which they cut boughsusing their swords as hatchets  we have already shown that the prince had brought his sword shield and knife on shore with him  captain arkal and maikar had also saved their swords and knives these having been attached to their girdles at the time they leaped from the wreck  they were somewhat inferior weapons to those worn by bladud being made of bronze  the swords of the seamen unlike that of the prince were short and doubleedged shaped somewhat like those used long afterwards by the romans and they made up in weight for what they lacked in sharpness  it did not take many hours for the party under the direction of the prince to form three strong and serviceable bows with several arrows the latter being feathered with dropped plumes and shod with flint according to the fashion of the times  bowstrings had to be made at first out of the tough fibrous roots of a tree split into threads and plaited together  of course they are not so good as deersinews for the purpose remarked bladud stringing one of the bows and fitting an arrow to it but we must be content until we kill a deer or some other animal perhaps we shall have an opportunity soon  the remark seemed to have been prophetic for as the last word passed his lips a fawn trotted out of a glade right in front of the party and stood as if paralysed with surprise  the captain and maikar were reduced to much the same condition for they made no attempt to use their bows  ho exclaimed the former but he got no further for at the moment bladuds bow twanged and an arrow quivered in the breast of the fawn which fell dead without a struggle  well done exclaimed the captain heartily  if such luck always attends you prince we shall fare well on our journey  it was not altogether luck returned the other  see you that spot on the bark of yonder treeabout the size of maikars mouth as it now gapes in astonishment  i see it clear enoughjust over the  he stopped abruptly for while he was yet speaking an arrow quivered in the centre of the spot referred to  after that the captain talked no more about luck and maikar shutting his mouth with a snap as if he felt that no words could do justice to his feelings sprang up and hastened to commence the operation of flaying and cutting up the fawn  having thus provided themselves with food they spent the rest of the day in preparing it for the journey by drying it in the sun in making tough and serviceable bowstrings out of the sinews of the fawn fitting on arrowheads and feathers and otherwise arranging for a prolonged march through a country which was entirely unknown to them both as to its character and its inhabitants  it comes into my head said the captain that maikar and i must provide ourselves with shields and spears of some sort for if the people of the land are warlike we may have to defend ourselves  that is as you say returned the prince rising as he spoke and going towards a long straight bough of a neighbouring tree on which he had fixed a critical gaze  with one sweep of his heavy sword he severed it from the stem and returned to his companions  have you taken an illwill at that tree or were you only testing the strength of your arm asked maikar  neither my friend but i must have a javelin to make my equipment complete and i would advise you and the captain to provide yourselves with like weapons for we may meet with fourfooted as well as twolegged foes in these parts  i will show you how to point the things with flint  that is well said returned the seaman rising and going into the woods in search of a suitable branch followed by the captain  it was late that night before the weapons were shaped and pointed with flint and all ready for a start on the following morningthe only thing wanting to complete their armament being a couple of shields  we are sure to meet with a wild boar or a bull before long or it may be a bear said maikar and the hides of any of these will serve our purpose well  that is if we use them well remarked the captain  no one said otherwise retorted maikar  some people are so full of wise thoughts that they blurt them out without reason apparently to get rid of them  just so maikar therefore blurt out no more but hold thy tongue and go to sleep  goodnight  chapter seven  converse and adventures by the way  day was just beginning to break in the east when the prince raised his head from the bundle of leaves that had formed his pillow and looked sleepily around him  his companions lay still sound asleep and sprawling in all the abandon characteristic of the heroes of antiquity  some of these characteristics were wonderfully similar to those of modern heroes  for instance the captain lay flat on his back with his mouth wide open and a musical solo proceeding from his nose while maikar lay on his side with his knees doubled up his arms extended at full length in front of him and his hands tightly clasped as if while pleading with some one for mercy he was suddenly petrified and had fallen over on his side  rising softly bladud took up his bow and quiver and buckling on his sword left the encampment without disturbing the sleepers  he had not proceeded more than a mile when he startled several wild turkeys or birds of that species from their rest  one of these he instantly brought down  following them up he soon shot another and returned to camp where he found his comrades as he had left themthe musical nose being if anything more emphatic than before  although naturally a grave man bladud was by no means destitute of a sense of humour or disinclined on occasion to perpetrate a practical joke  after contemplating the sleepers for a moment he retired a few paces and concealed himself in the long grass from which position he pitched one of the huge birds into the air so that it fell on the captains upturned visage  the snore changed at once into a yell of alarm as the mariner sprang up and grasped his sword which of course lay handy beside him  electrified by the yell maikar also leaped to his feet sword in hand  what dye mean by that cried the captain turning on him fiercely  what mean you by it replied maikar with equal ferocity  he had barely uttered the words when the second turkey hit him full in the face and tumbled him over the ashes of the fortunately extinguished fire  come come interposed the prince stepping forward with a deprecating smile there should be no quarrelling among friends especially at the beginning of a long journey  see i have fetched your breakfast for you  instead of tumbling on the fire and putting it out maikar i think it would be wiser to see if there is a spark left and blow it into a flame  quick  i am hungry  it need hardly be said that these orders were received with a laugh and a prompt obedience on the part of the little man  yesthere is fire he said blowing with tremendous energy until flame was produced  and do you know there is something within me that has a loud voice but only utters one wordfood food food there now you may get the birds ready for the fire will be ready for them in two winks  there was no occasion however to give this advice to his friends for already the birds had been plucked split open at the breast laid flat and their interiors scraped out in a summary manner  the plucking was not indeed all that could be wished but what fingers failed to do a singe in the flames accomplished to the perfect satisfaction of men who were in no way particular  sharppointed sticks were then thrust through the expanded carcases and they were stuck up in front of the blaze to roast  underdone meat is an abomination to some a luxury to othersreminding one of that very ancient proverb tastes differ  we cannot say whether on this occasion the uniformity of action in our heroes was the result of taste or haste but certain it is that before the fowls were only halfroasted on one side they were turned over so as to let the fire get at the other and breakfast was begun while the meat was yet frightfully underdone  thereafter the three men arose like giants refreshedif we may say so for maikar was indeed mentally though not physically a giantbuckled on their swords slung bows and quivers on their backs along with the turkey remains and took up shields and javelins  having laid their course by the stars the night before they set out on their journey through the unknown wilderness  the part of the country through which they passed at the beginning of the march was broken and diversified by hill and dale in some places clothed with forests in others covered with grass on which many wild animals were seen browsing  these however were remarkably timid and fled at the first sign of the approaching travellers so that it was impossible to get within bowshot of them  from this i judge that they are much hunted said bladud halting on a ridge to note the wild flight of a herd of deer which had just caught eight of them  if so we are likely to fall in with the hunters before long i fear remarked the captain  why do you fear asked maikar  because they may be numerous and savage and may take a fancy to make slaves of us and as we number only three we could not resist their fancy without losing our lives  that would be a pity returned maikar for we have only one life to lose  no we have three lives to lose amongst us objected the captain  which makes one each does it not retorted the seaman  true maikar and we must lose them all and more if we had them rather than become slaves  you are right captain  we never never shall be slaves said bladud  they say that history repeats itself  perhaps sentiment does the same at all events the british prince gave utterance that day to a wellknown sentiment which has been embalmed in modern song and shouted by many a briton with tremendous enthusiasmthough not absolute truth  captain arkal said the little seaman as they jogged quietly down the sunny slope of a hill at the bottom of which was a marsh full of rushes how do you manage to find your way through such a tangled country as this  by observing the stars answered the captain  but i have observed the stars since i was a little boy objected maikar and i see nothing but a wild confusion of shining points  how can these guide you  besides there are no stars in the daytime  true maikar but we have the sun during the day  maikar shook his head perplexedly  listen said the captain and i will try to enlighten your dark mind but dont object else youll never understand  all stars are not alikedye understand that  any fool could understand that  well then of course you can understand it  now you have noticed no doubt that some stars are in groups which groups may alter their position with regard to other groups but which never change with regard to each other  each other repeated maikar checking off each statement with a nod and a wave of his javelin  well continued the captain theres one group of starsabout six plainly to be seen on most fine nights two stars of which are always pretty much in a line with a little star a short way in front of them dye see  yes  well that star shows exactly where the cold regions lieover there extending his arm and pointing and of course if you know that the cold regions lie there you know that the hot regions must lie at your backthere and it follows that the pillars of hercules lie there pointing west and home lies somewhere about there pointing eastward  stop cried maikar in great perplexityfor although a seaman he was densely ignorant  hot regions there cold there home and the pillars there and there and there thrusting his arms out in all directions  ive no more idea of where youve got me to now than than  oh never mind interrupted the captain it doesnt matter as you are not our guide  but ho look look down in the hollow thereamong the rushes  whats that  a boar said bladud in a low whisper as he unslung his bow  come now it will take all our united force to slay that brute for if i have not lost my power of judging such game im pretty sure that hes a very big old boar with formidable tusks  while the prince was speaking his comrades had also prepared their weapons and looked to their guide for directions  these were hastily but clearly given  as the boar was evidently asleep in his lair it was arranged that the three friends should stalk him as the broken ground was specially favourable for such a mode of attack  we will advance together said bladud with our bows ready  i will lead you follow close  when we get within range you will do as you see me do and be sure that you aim at the brutes sidenot at his head send your arrows with all the force you can  then drop the bows and get your javelins ready  with eager looks the captain and little sailor nodded assent  they were much excited having often heard tales of boarhunting though neither of them had ever taken part in that work  a few minutes walk brought them to the edge of the rushes where they had a fair view of the monstrous animal as it lay fully extended on its side and not more than thirty yards distant  take him just behind the foreleg whispered bladud as he drew his bow  his companions followed his example  two of the bows twanged simultaneously but the thirdthat of maikarwas pulled with such vigour that it broke with a crash that would have awakened the sleepiest of wild boars had there been nothing else to arouse him  as it was other things helped to quicken his sensibilities  bladuds unfailing arrow went indeed straight for the heart but a strong rib caught and checked its progress  the captains shaft probably by good luck entered deep into the creatures flank not far from the tail  to say that the forest was instantly filled with earsplitting shrieks is to express the result but feebly  we might put it as a sort of indefinite question in the rule of three thusif an ordinary civilised pig with injured feelings can yell as we all know how what must have been the explosion of a wildboar of the eighth century búcú in circumstances such as we have described  railway whistles of the nineteenth century intermittently explosive is the only possible answer to the question and that is but an approximation to the truth  for one instant the infuriated creature paused to look for its assailants  catching sight of them as they were fitting arrows to their bows it gave vent to a prolonged locomotiveexpress yell and charged bladuds arrow hit it fair between the eyes but stuck in the impenetrable skull  the shaft of the captain missed and the javelin of maikar went wildly wide of the mark  by order of bladud the three had separated a few yards from each other even in its rage the monster was perplexed by this for it evidently perceived the impossibility of attacking three foes at the same moment which to go for was the question  like an experienced warrior it went for the little one  maikar had drawn his last weaponthe short sword of bronzeand like a brave man as he was prepared to receive boarelry  another instant and the enemy was upon him  more than that it was over him for trusting to his agilityfor which he was famedhe tried to leap to one side intending to make a vigorous thrust at the same moment  in doing so his foot slipped he fell flat on his side and the boar tripping over him just missed ripping him with its fearful tusks  it fell with a bursting squeak beyond  to leap up and turn was the work of an instant for the boar and would have been the same for the man if he had not been partially stunned by the fall  as it was the captain who was nearest proved equal to the emergency for using his javelin as a spear he plunged it into the boars side  but that side was tougher than he had expected  the spear was broken by a sharp twist as the animal turned on its new foe who now stood disarmed and at its mercy  bladuds ponderous sword however flashed in the air at that moment and fell on the creatures neck with a force that would have made hercules envious if he had been there deep into the brawn it cut through muscle fat and spine almost slicing the head from the trunk and putting a sudden stop to the last yell when it reached the windpipe  the boar rolled head over heels like a shot hare almost overturning bladud as it wrenched the sword from his hand and swept the captain off his legs carrying him along with it in a confusion of blood and bristles  it was truly a terrific encounter and as the prince stood observing the effect of his blow he would probably have burst into a fit of laughter had he not been somewhat solemnised by captain arkals fearful appearance as he arose ensanguined but uninjured from the ground  chapter eight  discovery and flight  being now provided with material for making shields they resolved to spend a day in camp  this was all the more necessary that the shoes or sandals which they had worn at sea were not well suited for the rough travelling which they had now to undertake  accordingly they selected a spot on the brow of a hill from which the surrounding country could be seen in nearly all directions  but they were careful also to see that several bushes shielded themselves from view for it was a matter of uncertainty whether or where natives might make their appearance  here bathed in glorious sunshine with a lovely prospect of land and water tangled wood and flowery plains to gladden their eyes and the savoury smell of pork chops and turkey to tickle their nostrils they spent two days in manufacturing the various necessary articles  captain arkal provided himself with a new javelin  maikar made another bow and both fabricated tough round shields with double plies of the boars hide  out of the same substance bladud made a pair of shoes for each of them  the sandals you wear at home he said are not so good as those used by us in albion  they dont cover the feet sufficiently and they expose the toes too much  yet our sandals are easily and quickly made look herei will show you  his companions paused in their labour and looked on while the prince took up an oblong piece of boarhide over a foot in length and six inches broad which had been soaking in water till it had become quite soft and limp  placing one of his feet on this he drew the pattern of it on the skin with a pointed stick  around this pattern and about a couple of inches from it he bored a row of holes an inch or so apart through these holes he rove a thong of hide and then rounded away the corners of the piece  there said he placing his foot in the centre of it and drawing the thong my sandal is ready  the tightening of the thong drew up the edges of the shoe until they overlapped and entirely encased his foot  good said the captain but that kind of sandal is not new to me ive seen it before not only in your country but in other lands  indeed  well after all it is so simple and so likely to hit the minds of thoughtful men that i doubt not it is used wherever travelling is bad or weather cold  we shall need such sandals in this land for there is no doubt great variety of country also of weather and many thorns  while our travellers were thus labouring and commenting on their work unseen eyes were gazing at them with profound interest and curiosity  a boy or youth just emerging from the state of boyhood lay low in a neighbouring thicket with his head just elevated sufficiently above the grass to enable his black eyes to peer over it  he was what we of the nineteenth century term a savage  that is to say he was unkempt unwashed and almost nakedbut not uneducated though books had nothing to do with his training  the prince chanced to look round and saw the black eyes instantly but being as we have said an adept in woodcraftincluding savage warfarehe did not permit the slightest evidence of recognition to escape him  he continued his gaze in the same direction allowing his eyes slowly to ascend as if he were looking through the treetops at the sky  then turning his head quietly round he resumed his work and whistledfor whistling had been invented even before that time  comrades he said after a few minutes dont look up from your work but listen  we are watched  you go on with your occupations as if all was right and leave me to deal with the watcher  his comrades took the hint at once and went quietly on with their labours while the prince arose stretched himself as if weary of his work  after a few minutes of looking about him as though undecided what to do next he sauntered into the bush at the side of their encampment opposite to that where the watcher lay  the moment he got out of range of the boys eyes however his careless air vanished and he sped through the underwood with the quietness and something of the gait of a pantherstooping low and avoiding to tread on dead twigs  making a wide circle he came round behind the spot where the watcher was hid  but trained though he had been in the art of savage warfare the boy was equal to him  from the first he had observed in bladuds acting the absence of that touch of nature which makes the whole world kin and kept a bright lookout to his rear as well as in his front so that when bladud despite his care trod on a dry stick the boy heard it  next moment he was off and a moment after that he was seen bounding down the hill like a wildcat  the prince knowing the danger of letting the boy escape and carry information to his friends dashed after him at full speedand the rate of his running may be estimated when it is remembered that many a time he had defeated men who had been victors at the olympic games  but the young savage was nearly his match  feeling however that he was being slowly yet surely overtaken the boy doubled like a hare and made for a ridge that lay on his left  by that time the chase was in full view of the two men in camp who rose and craned their necks in some excitement to watch it  hes after something said the captain  a boy said maikar  ay and running him down hand over hand  there seems to be no one else in sight so we dont need to go to his help  if he needs our help hell come for it returned the captain with a laugh and it will puzzle the swiftest runner in the land to beat his long legs  see hes close on the lad now  true responded the other with a sigh of disappointment but we shant see the end of it for the boy will be over the ridge and out of sight before he is caught  maikar was right  even while he spoke the youthful savage gained the summit where his slim agile figure was clearly depicted against the sky  bladud was running at full speed not a hundred yards behind him yet to the amazement of the spectators the boy suddenly stopped turned round and waved his hand with a shout of defiance  next moment he was over the ridge and gone  a few seconds later the prince was seen to halt at the same point but instead of continuing the pursuit he remained immovable for a few minutes gazing in front of him  then he returned toward the encampment with a somewhat dejected air  no wonder you look surprised he said on arriving  the other side of that ridge is a sheer precipice down which i might have gone if i had possessed wings  there was no track visible anywhere but of course there must have been a wellconcealed one somewhere for soon after i reached the top i saw the young wildcat running over the plain far below  on coming to the edge of a long stretch of forest he stopped and capered about like a monkey  i could see even at that distance that he was making faces at me by way of saying farewell  then he entered the woods and that was the end of him  i wish it was the end of him observed the captain with something like a growlfor his voice was very deep and he had a tendency to mutter when disturbed in temper  the monkey will be sure to run home and tell what hes seen and so bring all his tribe about our ears  ay not only his tribe remarked maikar but his uncles brothers fathers nephews and all his kin to the latest walkable generation  are your weapons ready asked bladud taking up his sword and putting on his helmet  all ready answered the captain beginning to collect thingsi have just finished two headpieces out of the boarhide for myself and maikar which will turn an arrow or a swordcut unless delivered by a strong arm  dont you think them handsome  they are suitable at any rate said maikar for they are as ugly as our faces  come then we must make haste for wild men are not slow to act rejoined bladud  by good fortune our way does not lie in the direction the boy took  we shall get as far away from them as possible and travel during the night  in a few minutes the little partyby that time fully equipped for the chase or warwere hurrying down the hillside in the direction of the setting sun  it was growing late in the evening and as they reached the bottom they had to cross a meadow which was rather swampy so that their feet sank in some parts over the ankles  i say guide observed maikar who like his nautical commander had small respect for rank and addressed the prince by what he deemed an appropriate title it has just come into my head that we are leaving a tremendous trail behind us  we seafaring men are not used to trouble our heads on that score for our ships leave no track on the waves but it is not so on the land  wont these naked fellows follow us up and kill us mayhap when were asleep  doubtless they will try answered bladud but we landfaring men are in the habit of troubling our heads on that score and guarding against it  do you see yonder stream or rather the line of bushes that mark its course  ay plainly  well when we reach that you shall see and understand without explanation  on reaching the stream referred to they found that it was a small shallow one with a sluggish current for the plain through which it flowed was almost flat  you see said bladud pausing on the brink that it flows towards the sea in the direction we have come from  now step into the water and follow me down stream  down exclaimed the captain in surprise and with some hesitation we dont want to return to the sea whence we have just come do we  captain arkal returned bladud sternly when you give orders on board ship do you expect to have them questioned or obeyed  lead on guide returned the captain stepping promptly into the water  for about a quarter of a mile the prince led his followers in silence and with much care for it was growing very dark  presently they came to a place where the banks were swampy and the stream deep  here their guide landed and continued to walk a short distance down the bank ordering his followers to conceal their track as much as possible by closing the long grass over each footprint  the result even to the unpractised eyes of the seamen did not seem satisfactory but their leader made no comment  after proceeding about fifty yards further he reentered the stream and continued the descent for about a mile  then he stopped abruptly and turning round said now comrades we will land for a moment then reenter the stream and ascend  the astonishment of captain arkal was so great that he was again on the point of asking an explanation for it seemed to him that wandering down the bed of a stream for the mere purpose of turning and wandering up it when haste was urgent could only be accounted for on the supposition that the prince had gone mad  remembering his previous rebuff however he kept silence  on reaching the swampy part of the bank their leader did not land but held straight on though the water reached nearly to their armpits they were somewhat cooled but not disagreeably so for the night was warm  in course of time they reached the spot where they had first entered the stream  passing it without landing they held on their course for a considerable distance until they came to a place where the stream was not more than ankledeep  here bladud paused a few moments and turned to his companions  now captain he said with a smile that may be said to have been almost audible though not visible do you understand my proceedings  not quite though to say truth i begin to think you are not just so mad as you seemed at first  dont you see continued the prince that when we first came to the stream i entered it so that our footprints on the bank would show clearly that we had gone downwards  this will show our pursuers when they arrive here that though we are wise enough to take to the water because it leaves no footprints we are not experienced enough to be careful as to concealing the direction we have taken  when they reach the swampy bank and deep water they will be led to think we did not like getting wet and the effort made to cover our footprints will make them think that we are very ignorant woodsmen  then with much confidence they will continue to follow down stream looking on the banks now and then for our footprints until they begin to wonder whether we intend to make a highroad of the river all the way to the sea  after that they will become perplexed astonished suspicious as to our stupidity and will scurry round in all directions or hold a council and finally they will try up stream but it will be too late for by that time we shall be far away on our road towards the setting sun  good ejaculated maikar when this explanation was finished  good echoed the captain with an approving nod  you understand your business i see  shove out your oars  we follow  without further remark bladud continued his progress up stream  it was necessarily slow at first but as night advanced the moon rose in her first quarter and shed a feeble but sufficient light on their watery path  at last they came to a place where the leaders sharp eye observed signs of the presence of man  stopping short and listening intently they heard subdued voices not far from the spot where they stood  stay where you are whispered bladud  dont move  ill return immediately  he entered the bushes cautiously and disappeared  standing there without moving and in profound silence under the dark shadow of an overhanging bush it is no wonder that the captain and his comrade began to think the time very long yet it was only a few minutes after he had left them that their guide returned  only a single family he whisperedthree men two women and four children  we have nothing to fear but we must pass on in silence  the discovery of those natives obliged them to continue the march up the bed of the stream much longer than they had intended and the night was far advanced before they thought it prudent to leave the water and pursue the journey on dry land  fortunately the country was open and comparatively free from underwood so that they made progress much more rapidly nevertheless it was not thought safe to take rest until they had placed many a mile between them and the natives who it was thought probable would be started in pursuit of them by the youth to whom bladud had given chase  much wearied and almost falling asleep while they advanced the travellers halted at last in a dense thicket and there lying down without food or fire they were soon buried in profound repose  chapter nine  homecoming  it is beyond the scope of this tale to describe minutely all that befell our adventurers on their long fatiguing and dangerous march through ancient gaul which land at that time had neither name nor history  suffice it to say that after numerous adventures with savage beasts and scarcely less savage men and many hairbreadth escapes and thrilling incidents by flood and field they at last found themselves on the shores of that narrow channel which separated the northern coast of gaul from the white cliffs of old albion  they were guided thereto as we have said by the polestar which shone in our sky in those days with its wonted brilliancy though probably astronomers had not yet given to it a local habitation in their systems or a distinctive name  of course their passage through the land had been attended with great variety of fortune good and bad  in some parts they met with natives who received them hospitably and sent them on their way rejoicing elsewhere they found banditti fortunately in small bands with whom they had to fight and once they were seized and imprisoned by a tribe of inhospitable savages from whom they escaped as it were by the skin of their teeth  in all these vicissitudes the gigantic frame and the mild kindly looks of bladud went far to conciliate the uncertain attract the friendly and alarm the savage for it is a curious fact explain it how we may that the union of immense physical power with childlike sweetness of countenance has a wonderful influence in cowing angry spirits  it may be that strong angry blustering men are capable only of understanding each other  when they meet with strong men with womanlike tenderness they are puzzled and puzzlement we think goes a long way to shake the nerves even of the brave  at all events it is well known that a sudden burst of wrath from one whose state of temper is usually serene exerts a surprising and powerful effect on average mankind  whatever be the truth as to these things it is certain that nearly every one who looked up at the face of bladud liked him and more than once when his ponderous sword sprang from its sheath and his blue eyes flashed and his fair face flushed and his magnificent teeth went together with a snap he has been known to cause a dozen men to turn and flee rather than encounter the shock of his onset  little maikar who was himself as brave as a lion nearly lost his life on one occasion because he was so taken up and charmed with the sight of one of bladuds rushes that he utterly forgot what he was about and would have been crushed by the smite of a savage club if the captain had not promptly turned aside the blow and struck the clubman down  at last exclaimed the prince with a gaze of enthusiasm at the opposite cliffs my native land  well do i love it and well do i know it for i have stood on this shore and seen it from this very spot when i was quite a boy  indeed  how was that asked arkal  i used to be fond of the sea and was wont to travel far from my fathers home to reach it  i made friends with the fishermen and used to go off with them in their little skiffs  one day a storm arose suddenly blew us off shore and when we were yet a long distance from this coast overturned our skiff  what became of my companions i know not  probably they were drowned for i never more saw them but i swam ashore where i think i should have died of exhaustion if i had not been picked up by an old fisherman of this land who carried me to his hut and took care of me  with the old man i remained several months for the fishermen on the two sides of the channel had been quarrelling at the time and the old man did not dare to venture across  i did not care much for i enjoyed playing with his grandson and soon learned their language  after a time the quarrelling ceased and the old man landed me on my own side  that is interesting  i only wish the old fisherman was here now with his skiff for there is no village in sight and no skiff to be seen so how we are to get over i cannot tellswimming being impossible and wings out of the question  ay except in the case of fish and birds observed maikar  true and as we are neither fish nor birds rejoined the captain what is to be done  we must find a skiff said the prince  good but where  on the other side of yon bluff cape replied bladud  it was there that my friend the old fisherman lived  mayhap he may live there still  pushing on along shore they passed the bold cape referred to and there sure enough they found the old mans hut and the old man himself was seated on a boulder outside enjoying the sunshine  great was his surprise on seeing the three strangers approach but greater was his joy on learning that the biggest of the three was the boy whom he had succoured many years before  after the first greetings were over bladud asked if he and his friends could be taken across in a skiff  the old man shook his head  all that i possess he said you are welcome to but my skiff is not here and if it was i am too old to manage it now  my son your old companion has had it away these two days and i dont expect him home till tomorrow  but you can rest in my poor hut till he comes  as there seemed nothing better to be done the travellers agreed to this  next day the son arrived but was so changed in appearance that bladud would not have recognised his old playmate had not his father called him by name  the skiff although primitive and rude in its construction was comparatively large and a considerable advance on the dugouts or wooden canoes and the skin coracles of the period  it had a square or lugsail and was steered by a rudder  my son is a strange man remarked the old fisherman as the party sauntered down to the shore up which the skiff had been dragged  he invented that skiff as well as made it and the curious little thing behind that steers it  able and strange men seem to work their minds in the same way returned bladud for the thing is not altogether new  i have seen something very like it in the east and to my mind it is a great improvement on the long oar when the boat is driven through the water but it is of no use at all when there is no motion  no neither is it of use when one wishes to sweep round in a hurry observed the captain when this was translated to him  if it had not been for my steeringoar bringing you sharp round when we were attacking the pirate you would hardly have managed to spit the chief as you did strong though you be  it was found that the new style of skiff was a good sailer for although the wind was light her lugsail carried her over to the coast of albion in about four hours  there has been some bad feeling of late between the men from the islands and the men of our sidethere often is said the young fisherman who steered  i am not sure that it will be safe to land here  if that be so hold on close along the shore in the direction of the setting sun returned bladud and land us after nightfall  i know the whole country well and can easily guide my comrades through the woods to my fathers town on the great river  the young fisherman did not reply for a few seconds  he seemed in doubt as to this proposal  there has been war lately he said between your father and the southern tribes and it may be dangerous for so small a party to traverse the lands of the enemy  i would gladly go and help you but what could one arm more do to aid you against a host  besides my father is dependent on me now for food  i may not forsake the old one who has fed and guarded me since i was a little boy  concern yourself not about that friend replied the prince  we need no help  during many days we have travelled safely enough through the great woods of the interior and have held our own against all foes  without doubt we are well able to take care of ourselves remarked the captain though it is but fair to admit that we have had some trouble in doing so  ay and some starvation too added maikar but having come safe over the mainland we are not afraid to face the dangers of the isles young man  i said not that you were afraid rejoined the fisherman with something of dignified reproof in his manner but it is not disgraceful for brave men to act with caution  well said my old comrade exclaimed bladud and so we shall be pleased if you will land us here  but your speech leads me to understand that you have had news of my fathers doings lately  is the old man well  ay king hudibras is well and as fond of fighting as ever besides being well able for it  i am not sure that he would be pleased if he heard you call him the old man  indeed  yet nearly fifty winters have passed over his head and that is somewhat old for a warrior  and my mother and sisterhave you heard of them  excellently well i believe  at least so i have been told by the hebrew merchant who came over sea with one of the phoenician ships and wanders over the whole land with his pack of golden ornamentswhich so take the fancy of the women indeed of the men also  how the fellow escapes being robbed on his journeys is more than i can tell  it is said that he travels by night and sleeps in caves during the day  some people even think that he is in league with evil spirits  i doubt that but he told me the other day when i met him on our side of the channel that your sister is about to be married to a neighbouring chiefi forget his namegunrig i thinkwith whom your father wishes to be on friendly terms  married exclaimed bladud with a troubled look  ay and it is said she does not like the match  does my mother approve of it  i think not though the hebrew did not seem to feel quite sure on that point  but your father seems resolved on it and you know he is not easily turned from his purpose when determined to have his way  he is more difficult to move than a woman in that matter  come friend said bladud gravely dont be too free in your remarks on my father  and dont be too hard on the womenfolk added the captain with a grim smile they are not all alike  at least there is one that i know of in the east whose spirit is like that of the lamb and her voice like the notes of the songbird  maikar looked as if he were on the point of adding something to the conversation but his thoughts seemed too deep for utterance for he only sighed  land us in yon creek said bladud promptly  it seems that i have not returned home a moment too soon  there under the cliffso  the skiff ran alongside of a ledge of rock as he spoke and next moment the prince leaped upon the shores of his native land  with a brief farewell to his old playmate he turned led his companions up the neighbouring cliff and plunging into the forest set off at a pace which betrayed the urgency of his desire to reach home  although they travelled almost night and day it took them the better part of two weeks to reach the river on the banks of which king hudibras chief town was built  they arrived at the eastern bank without mishap and found that people were crowding over from the western side to attend some display or fete which was obviously going on there  mingling with the crowd they went to the rivers edge where numerous wooden canoes and coracles were busily engaged in ferrying the people over  approaching a man whose apparel betokened him one of the poorer class bladud addressed him  can you tell me friend what is going on here today  truly you must be a stranger if you know not for every onefar and nearhas heard of the wedding of our kings pretty daughter  is she then married asked the prince scarcely able to conceal his anxiety  not yet but she is to be married tomorrowif no champion comes to claim her  how  what mean you  i mean what i say  gunrig the great chief whom she is to wed is a proud and a stout man  many chiefs have been courting the fair princess and in his pride of heart and strength gunrig has challenged any one to fight him in single combat promising that the bride shall be given to the conqueror  and does mydoes the king agree to such a base proposal  well he objected to it at first but gunrig is such a dangerous enemy and his tribe so powerful that the king has given in at last  besides he knows that the chief is so strong and big and so well able to use his weapons that none of the other chiefs are likely to venture a trial with him or if they do they are sure to get the worst of it  you dont seem to like this gunrig i think  no  i hate him  everybody hates him he is such a proud brute but what can we do when the king commands all must obey  if i was as big and stout as you are added the man with a steady gaze at the prince id go at this fellow and win the fair princess myself  perchance i may have a try returned bladud with a light laugh  does the princess hate him and the queen  ay worse than poison  come let us go and see the sport said the prince to his companions as he hurried away from the river  you know our language well enough i think captain to understand what has been said  ay the most of it and there is no doubt you are much wanted at this feast  in a few minutes our travellers arrived at the suburbs of the little town which was embosomed among trees and green fields  as hundreds of people had come in from all the country round and some of them were phoenician mariners from ships then in port our three adventurers might not have attracted much attention had it not been for the towering height stalwart frame and noble bearing of bladud  as it was people commented on them bestowing looks of admiration particularly on the prince but they did not address or molest them in any waysupposing of course that they had come from a distance to see the show though many wondered that such a strapping fellow as the tall one could have come to the land without having been heard of  perhaps he has only just arrived in one of the ships was the sagacious remark of one  but the ships have been here a long time and we have seen all their crews was the comment of another  on arriving at the scene of festivities they found that an immense assemblage encircled the arena in which a number of young men were competing in athletic sports  the captain and maikar gently elbowed their way to the front where they could see what was going on  i will remain in the back row where i can see well enough said bladud  keep a lookout for me when you feel lost  i dont mean to make myself known just yet  chapter ten  the sports  at the further end of the ground enclosed for the sports a slightly raised platform had been prepared for the king and his household  the royal party ascended it soon after the travellers arrived but the distance was too great to permit of faces being distinguished  bladud could easily perceive however the tall form of his father and the graceful figure of his mother as they took their places closely followed by the chief warriors  these however did not bring their womenthat privilege being reserved for the household of the king only close behind the king and queen walked the young princess hafrydda she was not only graceful but beautiful being very fair like her mother with lightblue eyes like those of her brother bladud she had peachbloom cheeks and a brow of snow save where her cap failed to protect it from the sun  after the princess and shrinking behind her as if to escape the gaze of the courtiers or rather warriors who crowded the platform came a girl of about nineteen summers the companion of hafrydda  branwen was a complete contrast to her friend in complexion  she was the daughter of a famous northern chief and was quite as beautiful as the princess while her jetblack eyes and curly brown hair gave more of force and character to features which were delicately moulded  there was reason for poor branwens desire to escape observation for the proud gunrig was paying her attentions which were far too pointed and familiar in one who was about to marry the kings daughter  indeed it was whispered that he had changed his mind since he had seen branwen and would have even resigned the princess in her favour if he had dared to offer such an affront to the king  hudibras himself was the last to ascend the platform  he was a finelooking portly man with a great shock of black hair a long beard and limbs so well proportioned that he did not seem taller than other men until he stood beside them  he was a worthy sire of such a son as bladud though three inches shorter  there was a sort of barbaric splendour in the costumes of both men and women combined with some degree of graceful simplicity  the king was clothed in a softlydressed deerskin jacket over which he wore a wolfskin with the hair outside  a tunic of purple cotton brought by phoenician ships from the far east covered him as far down as the knees which were bare while his lower limbs were swathed in strips of scarlet cloth  leather sandals resembling those made by bladud while in gaul protected his feet  no crown or other token of royalty rested on his brow but over his dark and grizzled locks he wore a species of leather skullcap which being exceeding tough served the purpose of a helmet  on his breast was a profusion of ornaments in the form of beads and bosses of gold and tin the former of which had been brought from the east the latter from the mines of his native land  a bronze sword with an ivory sheath inlaid with gold hung at his left side and a knife of the same material at his right  altogether king hudibras being broad and strong in proportion to his height presented a very regal appearance indeed and bore himself with becoming dignity  he had married the daughter of a norse jarl and his two children bladud and hafrydda had taken after their gentle mother in complexion and disposition though they were not altogether destitute of a subcurrent of their fathers passionate nature  the nobles or rather warriorsfor ability to fight constituted nobility in those dayswere clothed in garments which with sundry modifications resembled those of the king  as for the women of the court their costumes were what may be styled flowing and therefore graceful though difficult to describe  like their lords they were profusely ornamented with precious metals and bands and loops of coloured cloth  hafrydda and her companion branwen allowed their hair to fall after the manner of the times in unrestrained freedom over their shouldersthat of the former resembling a cataract of rippling gold while that of the latter was a wavy mass of auburn  both girls wore wild flowers among their tresses  of course the queen had rolled up her slightly grey hair in the simple knot at the back of the head which is more becoming to age and she wore no ornament of any kind on her head  public games are pretty much the same in all lands and have probably been similar in all times  we shall not weary the reader by describing minutely all that went on  there was racing of course and jumping both with and without a run as well as over a willowwand held high there was also throwing the heavy stone but the method pursued in this feat was not in accordance with modern practice inasmuch as the competitor turned his back to the direction in which the stone was to be thrown heeled instead of toed the line seized the stone with both hands and hurled it backwards over his head  as the games proceeded it was evident that the concourse became much excited and deeply interested in the efforts of the various competitorsthe king and his court not less so than the people  after the conclusion of one of the races captain arkal left the front row and pushing his way towards bladud whispered  it seems to me that you could easily beat the winner of that race smart though he be  what say you  will you try  i fear being discovered by my father if i go so prominently before him and i wish to announce myself in private  pooh discovery is impossible  have you not told me that you were a smoothchinned boy and not grown to near your present height when you left home  how can they ever recognise one who returns a sunburnt giant with a beard that covers half his face  perhaps you are right returned the prince looking as if uncertain how to act but the advice of little maikar corresponding with that of the captain decided him  in those primitive times the rules and ceremonies connected with games were few and simple  entries were not arranged beforehand men came and went and competed or refrained as they pleased though of course there were a few wellknown greyhoundlike men and athletes who competed more or less in all games of the various districts around and whose superlative powers prevented other ambitious men from becoming too numerous  these were we may say the professionals of the time  no special costumes were worn  each man as he stepped to the front divested himself of wolfskin deerskin boarskin or catskin mantle and perchance also of his upper coat and stood forth in attire sufficiently light and simple to leave his limbs unhampered  a long raceten times round the coursewas about to come off and the men were being placed by the judges when bladud pushed through the crowd and made his way to the startingpoint  there was a murmur of admiration as his tall and graceful figure was seen to join the group of competitors in front of the royal stand  he gave the greek letter omicron as his name and no further questions were asked him  divesting himself of the rug or mantle which he wore thrown over one shoulder after the manner of a plaid he stood forth in the thin loose tunic which formed his only garment and tightened his belt as he toed the line  it was with a feeling of satisfaction that he observed several of the kings warriors among the runners and one of these was gunrig  being an agile as well as a stout man he did not consider it beneath his dignity to join in the sports  the king himself gave the signal to start  he descended from his stand for the purpose and bladud was greatly pleased to find that though he looked at him he evidently failed to recognise him  at the signal about twenty powerful fellowsmostly young though some were in the prime of lifestarted out at full speed for a short distance as if to test each other then they began to slow so as not to break their wind by overexertion at the beginning  bladud felt at once that he was more than a match for the best of them unless any one should turn out to have been concealing his powers  he therefore placed himself alongside of gunrig and kept at his elbow about half a foot behind him the first two rounds of the course  at first gunrig took no notice of this but when he perceived that the tall stranger continued to keep the same position he held back a little intending to reverse the position for a time  but bladud also held back and frustrated his intention  exasperated by this gunrig put on what we in these times call a spurt and went ahead at a pace which in a few seconds left most of the runners a good way behind this was received by the spectators with a cheer in which surprise was fully as prominent as satisfaction for although they knew that the chief was celebrated for his speed of foot few of them had actually seen him run before that day and it at once became evident that if his endurance was equal to his speed it would go hard with his competitors  bladud was left behind a few yards but without making a spurt he lengthened his stride a little and in a moment or two had resumed his former position at his rivals elbow  a wild cheer of delight ensued for now it was recognised that in all probability the race would lie between these two  as however all this occurred in the third round of the course and all the other runners seemed to be doing their work with steady resolution there was still the possibility of one or more of them proving themselves by endurance perhaps more than a match for the swiftfooted  the excitement therefore became intense and as round after round of the course was completed the relative position of the various men changed considerably  at the seventh round some who had been husbanding their strength let out and passing others with great ease came close upon the heels of gunrig and bladud  this was of course a signal for enthusiastic cheering  others of the runners feeling that their chance of taking a respectable place was hopeless dropped out of the race altogether and were cheered vociferously as they retired  at last in the eighth round it became practically as had been anticipated a race between the leading two for they were far ahead of all the others by that time but occupied exactly the same relative position as before  gunrig became so exasperated at this that on commencing the ninth round he made a sudden effort which carried him five or six yards ahead of his rival  the spectators could not avoid cheering him at this but the cheer was feeble  the tall man is losing wind cried one in a disappointed tone  i feared his legs were too long observed another  most of the people however looked on in anxious silence  i did not think he would give in so easily murmured little maikar regretfully  he has not given in yet returned the captain with a satisfied nod seehe pulls up  this was true  to the unbounded surprise of the spectators bladud had actually stopped a moment to tighten his belt at the beginning of the tenth round  then to their still greater amazement he put on what we may call an olympic spurt so that he overtook his rival in less than a quarter of a minute passed him easily ran over the rest of the course at a rate which had not been equalled since old albion was created and passed the winningpost full five hundred yards in advance of gunrig amid yells of delight and roars of laughter which continued for some timebursting forth again and again as the novelty and surprise of the thing became more and more forced home to the spectators minds  you have met more than your match today gunrig remarked the king with a laugh as the defeated man strode angrily up to the platform  i have met foul play replied the chief angrily  he pretended that he could not run else would i have put on more force  but it matters not  i will have another opportunity of trying him  meanwhile there is yet the heavy stone to throw  how now wench he added turning fiercely on branwen who had nearly hidden her face in her shawl do you try to hide that you are laughing at me  poor branwen was in anything but a laughing mood  she was too much afraid of the fiery chief for that and had merely covered her face as a modern beauty might drop her veil to avoid his gaze  the fairhaired hafrydda however was not so timid her smile was evidently one of amusement at his defeat which angered him all the more  gunrig said the king drawing himself up and speaking impressively remember that you are my guest and that it ill becomes you to insult my women before my face  pardon me replied the chief with an effort to recover himself  you must remember that i am not accustomed to defeat  true returned the king blandly so now you had better take to the heavy stone and come off the victor  gunrig at once went down into the arena and sent a challenge to bladud  the latter had returned to his place among the spectators but his height rendered him easy to find  he accepted the challenge at once and as no other competitor for the heavy stone offered the two had it all to themselves  this was no matter of wonder for the heaviest stone among those laid out for trial was of a weight that many of the young men or warriors could barely lift while the stoutest of them could not have thrown it more than a few feet  boiling over as he was with indignation gunrig felt as if he was endued with more than usual strength  he lifted the stone with ease faced the platform heeled the line and hurled the stone violently over his head so that it fell with a heavy thud far behind him  then bladud took it up  oh what a stout man he is whispered branwen to hafrydda and what a handsome face  that is true and i hope he will win replied the princess  hush child the king will be displeased if he hears you said her mother earnestly  what ever you think keep silence  the queen spoke with such unwonted energy that hafrydda was surprised but her thoughts were instantly diverted to bladud who made a magnificent cast and sent the stone a yard further than his opponent but gunrig seized it again and hurled it a foot beyond that  well done said the king  go on  it is the best in three heaves that wins  bladud grasped the stone and hurled it back over his head with all his force  up and up it went as if it had resolved to become an aerolite and visit the moon  then down it came with a mighty thud ten yards beyond gunrigs mark  once more the air rang with the enthusiastic plaudits of the multitude while the king ordered the victor to approach the stand  bladud did so with some trepidation for now he knew that he would have to speak and feared that though his appearance had not betrayed him his voice would probably do so  chapter eleven  a notable duel followed by changes and plots  every eye was riveted with admiration and curiosity on the young stranger as he approached  you have acquitted yourself well young man said the king and it becomes us to invite you to our palace and to ask if we can serve you in any way  bladud had a deep voice and by way of increasing his chances of concealing his identity he pitched it a note or two lower than usual as he replied  i thank you sir for your hospitality and gladly accept it  as to your offer to serve me i would count it a favour if you will permit me to enter into combat with one of your friends  indeed exclaimed the king in great surprise that is a strange request but i may not deny you  which of my warriors may it be  it is none of your warriors sir answered bladud but one of your guests who has i am told challenged whoever will to fight him for the hand of your fair daughter  i am here now to accept that challenge and to fight with gunrig if he will  assuredly young man your ambition or presumption seems equal to your prowess returned the king with an offended look know ye not that this challenge was delivered to chiefs of this country not to unknown strangers and although i admit that your tongue seems well accustomed to our language it has a foreign smack about it which does not belong to those who are homebred  i am a chief answered bladud proudly and this is my native land  what is your name then and where come ye from demanded the king  that i may not answer just now but i am here in your power if what i say be not found true you may do what you will with me  meanwhile i ask permission to accept the challenge  at this point gunrig unable to restrain himself longer sprang forward  grant him permission king he cried  if i were not ready to abide by my word i were not worth my salt  nay indeed whether you grant him permission or not i will fight him for he has twice beaten me this day and now insults me therefore there is a deadly feud between us  you were always a hothead gunrig replied the king with a grim smile  but have your way  only it does not follow that if you lose the day i will give my child to the conqueror  be that as you choose said gunrig i am now ready  as he spoke the fiery chief grasped his shield leaped down into the arena and drew his sword  bladud was not slow to follow  in those days action usually followed close on the heels of purpose and as the laws of chivalry had not yet been formulated there was no braying of trumpets or tedious ceremonial to delay the combat  oh  i do hope he will conquer whispered the princess hafrydda to her darkeyed companion and save me from that horrid man  i hope so too returned branwen in a subdued voice but  she stopped abruptly and a blush deepened the rich colour of her cheek which she sought to conceal by drawing her shawl still closer over it this was needless for the clash of swords at the moment as the combatants met in deadly conflict claimed the exclusive attention of the damsels and caused the entire concourse to press close around the barricades with eager interest  a strange way to mark his homecoming muttered captain arkal thrusting himself as near to the scene of action as possible closely followed by maikar who being little kept easily in his wake  he knows well what hes about returned the little man whose admiration for bladud was great and his belief in him unbounded  maikar was one of those menof whom there are no doubt thousandswho powerfully appreciate almost venerate and always recognise the spirit of justice when displayed by their fellows although they may not always be aware of the fact that they do recognise ithence his belief in the prince  a good day for the land if that longlegged fellow slays him remarked one of the crowd  thats true said another  indeed this seemed to be the opinion of most of the spectators there was also a general expression of confidence that the stranger was sure to be victorious but some objectorsof whom there are and necessarily must be a considerable number in the worldheld that gunrig was a stout man to tackle and it was not always length of limb that gained the day  such comments however were not numerous for the concourse soon became too deeply absorbed to indulge in speech  the fight that now ensued gave some weight to the objectors views  at first the combatants rushed at each other with the ferocity of men who mean to settle a dispute by instant and mutual destruction and there was a sort of gasp of excited surprise among the people as the two swords fell at the same moment with something like a thunderclap on the respective shields  feeling that neither could overcome the other by the might of a resistless blow each after one or two rapid cuts thrusts and guards ascertained that his adversary was so nearly his match as to render great care needful  they retired a few paces and then advancing settled down to their work point to point and foot to foot  gunrig although inferior in stature to the prince was about equal to him in strength and weight and being a trained warrior in the prime of life was possessed of a sturdy endurance which to some extent made up for the others superior agility  in other respects they seemed well matched for each was highly trained and expert in the use of his weapons  after a second onset somewhat similar to the first and with much the same result the two went at each other with cut and thrust so rapidly that it was almost impossible to distinguish their swords as they flashed like gleaming flames in the sunshine  suddenly gunrig drew back and springing at the prince with uplifted weapon as if to cut him down changed the attack into a quick thrust which passing under the youths uplifted shield went straight to his breast  but the quick eye of bladud detected the intention in time leaping lightly backward he caused the thrust to come short at the same time he returned with a quick thrust at the chiefs right shoulder which took effect slightly  giving him no time to recover he made a sweeping cut at gunrigs neck which had it fallen would have shorn his head from his shoulders but the chief instead of guarding it suddenly stooped and as the sword passed whistling above him returned with a thrust so fierce that it pierced right through the thick shield opposed to it  here was an opportunity of which bladud was not slow to avail himself although the arm which held it was slightly wounded he gave the shield a violent and sudden twist which not only held the weapon fast but nearly wrenched it out of the chiefs hand  an ordinary sword would have been snapped but gunrigs weapon was a big bronze one that had done service in many a fray and its owners hand was strong  he held it fast but before he could withdraw it and recover himself bladud cut him fair over the head  whether it was accident or design no one could tell but the flat instead of the edge of his sword descended on the headpiece and the blow which should otherwise have cleft his adversary to the chin only stretched him insensible on the field  a great sigh of relief mingled with wild cheers of satisfaction greeted this effective termination of the fight and the king was evidently not illpleased  pick him up some of you he said pointing to the prostrate gunrig and carry him to the palace  see that he is well cared for  go branwen and see that everything is properly done for him  branwen at once left the stand and the king descending into the arena proceeded to congratulate the victor  before he could do so however to his unbounded surprise the queen also descended with her daughter and threw her arms round the princes neck while hafrydda seized his hand and covered it with kisses  body of me am i dreaming cried the king after a few moments of speechless amazement  oh  bladud exclaimed the queen looking up in his smiling face did you really think you could deceive your own mother  fie fie i would have recognised you if you had come with your face painted black  by this time the king had recovered and realised the fact that his longlost son had returned home  he strode towards him and grasping his hand essayed to speak but something in his throat rendered speech impossible  king hudibras was a stern man however and scorned to show womanly weakness before his people  he turned suddenly round kicked a few courtiers out of his way remounted the platform and in a loud voice announced the conclusion of the sports  great was the rejoicing among the people assembled there when the news spread that the longlost prince bladud had returned home and that the tall youth who had defeated gunrig was he and they cheered him with even more zest and energy than they had at the moment of his victory  meanwhile gunrig having been conveyed to the residence of the king was laid on a couch  the palace was we need scarcely say very unlike our modern palaces being merely a large hut or rude shanty of logs surrounded by hundreds of similar but smaller huts which composed this primitive town  the couch on which the chief lay was composed of brushwood and leaves  but gunrig did not lie long upon it  he was a tough man as well as a stout and he had almost recovered consciousness when the princess returning from the games arrived to assist her friend in attending to the kings commands  she found branwen about to enter the chamber in which the chief lay with a bandage  hast heard the news she asked with a gladsome smile  not i replied branwen in a rather sharp tone  whatever it is it seems to have made you happy  truly it has  but let us go in with the bandages first  the news is too good to be told in a hurry  the sound of their voices as they entered aroused gunrig completely and he rose up as they approached  my father sent us said the princess in some confusion to see that you are well cared for  your wounds i hope are not dangerous  dangerous no and they will not prevent me from speedily avenging myself on the young upstart who has appeared so suddenly to claim you for a bride  stay you need not go so quickly or toss your head in pride  i will stand by my word and let him keep who wins  but i have a word to say to you branwen  come along with me  wooers among the ancient albionites were not it would seem celebrated for politenesssome of them at least  the chief seized the shrinking girl by the wrist as he spoke and led her out of the house and into a neighbouring thicket where he bade her sit down on a fallen tree  now he said sitting down beside her and putting his arm round her waist despite her objections this young turkeycock has fairly won hafrydda and he is welcome to her for all that i carethat is if he lives to claim her hand after our next meeting for since ive seen your pretty face branwen i would rather wed you than the fairest lass that ever owned to norland blood  what say you to take the princesss place and become my wife  oh no no exclaimed branwen in great distress trying to disengage his arm you love hafrydda and it is impossible that you can love us both  let me go  im not so sure that i ever really cared for the princess replied the chief but of this i am quite sure that i never loved her half as much as i love you branwen  the girl tore herself away from him and standing up with flushed face and flashing eyes exclaimed  shame would crush you if you were a brave man for uttering such a speech  but you are not brave you are a coward and your late opponent will teach you that  be sure that i will never consent to wed one who is a disgrace to manhood  a fierce scowl crossed gunrigs swarthy countenance but it passed in a moment and a look of admiration replaced it as he looked up with a smile  i like maids with your temper he said still keeping his seat but you forget that if the king so wills it you shall be compelled to accept me and i think the king will scarce dare to thwart my wishes especially now that another man has a right to the princess  i defy you returned the girl still at a white heat of indignation and if the king tries to force me to wed you i will defy him too  the young stranger will be my championor if he should refuse there are other ways by which a helpless girl may escape from tyrants  she turned with these words and fled  gunrig sprang up to pursue but fortunately for the girl a modest bramble that scarce ventured to raise its branches above the ground caught his foot and sent him headlong into a rotten stump which seemed only too ready to receive him  extracting his head from its embrace he stood up in a bewildered frame of mind found that the lightfooted branwen had escaped him and sat down again on the fallen tree to recover his equanimity  meanwhile the poor girl ran back to the palace rushed into hafryddas room threw herself on a couch and burst into tears  this was such an unwonted exhibition of weakness in branwen that the princess stood looking at her for a few moments in silent surprise then she sought to comfort her and made her relate bit by bit with many a sob between what had occurred  but why do you cry so bitterly asked hafrydda  it is so unlike you to give way to despair  besides you defied him you say and you were right to do so for my dear father will never force you to wed against your wishes  i know better returned the other with some bitterness  did he not intend to make you wed against your wishes  that is true replied the gentle hafrydda with a sigh  but i am saved from that now she added brightening up suddenly and that reminds me of the good news  do you know who the handsome youth is who rescued me from this monster  no i dont and im sure i dont care answered branwen with a touch of petulance  at all events i suppose you will be glad of the change of husbands  he will never be my husband returned the princess somewhat amused by her friends tone for she suspected the cause  he is my brother bladudmy longlost brother  the change that came over branwens pretty face on hearing this was remarkable  your brother she exclaimed  no wonder that he is beautiful as well as brave  a merry laugh broke from the princess as she kissed her friend  well but she said what will you do  you know that always when i have been perplexed or in trouble i have come to you for help and advice now that things are turned the other way i know not what advice to give you  i have settled what to do answered branwen drying her eyes and looking up with the air of one whose mind has been suddenly and firmly made up  your father i know will consent to gunrigs wishes  if he did not there would be war againhorrible warbetween the tribes  i will never be the cause of that if i can help it  at the same time it would kill me to wed with gunrig  i would rather die than that thereforei will run away  and leave me exclaimed the princess anxiously  well i should have to leave you at any rate if i stay and am compelled to marry gunrig  but where will you run to  that i will not tell lest you should be tempted to tell lies to your father  just be content to know that i shall not be far away and that in good time you shall hear from me  farewell dear hafrydda i dare not stay for thatthat monster will not be long in hatching and carrying out some vile plotfarewell  chapter twelve  plots and plans  about three miles beyond the outskirts of king hudibras townthe name of which has now like many other things been lost in the proverbial mists of antiquityan old man dwelt in a sequestered part of the forest  his residence was a dry cave at the foot of a cliff or rather a rude hut which resting against the cliff absorbed the cave so to speak into its rear premises  the old man had a somewhat aquiline nose a long white beard and a grave but kindly expression of countenance  he was one of the sons of israelat that time not a despised race  although aged he was neither bowed nor weak but bore himself with the uprightness and vigour of a man in his prime  when at home this man seemed to occupy his time chiefly in gathering firewood cooking food sleeping and reading in a small roll of egyptian papyrus which he carried constantly in his bosom  he was well known far and near as beniah the merchant who trafficked with the phoenician shipmen was a sort of gobetween with them and the surrounding tribes and carried his wares from place to place far and wide through the land  he was possessed of a wonderful amount of curious knowledge and although he spoke little he contrived in the little he said to make a favourable impression on men and women  being obliging as well as kind and also exceedingly useful people not only respected beniah but treated him as a sort of semisacred being who was not to be interfered with in any way  even robbersof whom there were not a few in those daysrespected the hebrews property passed by his hut with looks of solemnity if not of awe and allowed him to come and go unchallenged  most people liked beniah  a few feared him and a still smaller numbercynics who have existed since the days of adamheld him to be in league with evil spirits  he was a tall stalwart man and carried a staff of oak about six feet long as a support during his travels  it had somehow come to be understood that although beniah was preeminently a man of peace it was nevertheless advisable to treat him with civility or to keep well out of the range of that oaken staff possibly this opinion may have been founded on the fact that on one occasion three big runaway phoenician seamen who thought they would prefer a life in the woods to a life on the ocean wave had one evening been directed to beniahs hut as a place where strangers were never refused hospitality when they asked it with civility  as those three seamen made their appearance in the town that same evening in a very sulky state of mind with three broken heads it was conjectured that they had omitted the civilityeither on purpose or by accident  be this as it may beniah and his sixfoot staff had become objects of profound respect  evening was drawing on and beniah was sitting on a stool beside his open door enjoying the sunshine that penetrated his umbrageous retreat and reading the papyrus scroll already referred to when the figure of a woman approached him with timid hesitating steps  at first the hebrew did not observe her but as she drew nearer the crackling of branches under her light footsteps aroused him  he looked up quickly and the woman running forward stood before him with clasped hands  oh sir she exclaimed have pity on me  i come to claim your protection  such protection as you need and i can give you shall have my daughter but it is a strange request to make of such a man in such a place and at such a time  moreover your voice is not quite strange to me added the old man with a perplexed look  surely i have heard it before  ay beniah you know my voice and have seen my face said the woman suddenly removing her shawl and revealing to the astonished eyes of the old man the pretty head and face of branwen with her wealth of curling auburn hair  child exclaimed the hebrew rising and letting fall his roll while he took her hand in both of his what folly have you been guilty of for surely nothing but folly could move you thus to forsake the house of your friends  ay father you say truth returned the girl her courage returning as she noted the kindly tone of the old mans voice  folly is indeed the cause of it but it is the folly of man not of women  branwen then gave him a detailed account of the duel between bladud and gunrig as well as of the subsequent proceedings of the latter with regard to herself  the face of the old man elongated as she proceeded with her narration and as it was long by naturethe face not the narrationits appearance when she had concluded was solemnising in the extreme  assuredly you are right my child for it is amazing folly in such a man as gunrig to suppose he is a fitting mate for youthough it is no folly in him to wish to get you for a wifeand it is no folly in you to flee from such an undesirable union  but how to help you in this matter is more difficult to conceive than anything that has puzzled my brain since the day i left tyre  can you not conceal me here till we have time to think what is best to be done asked branwen simply for i will die rather than wed this this monster gunrig  the hebrew smiled pitifully for he saw in the maidens face and bearing evidence of a brave resolute spirit which would not condescend to boasting and had no thought of using exaggerated language  truly i will conceal youfor a time  but i cannot leave you here alone when i go on my wanderings  besides the king will send out his hunters all over the landmen who are trained to note the slightest track of bear deer and wolf and they will find it easy work to discover your little footprints  no doubt near the town and even here where many wanderers come and go they will fail to pick up the trail but if you venture into the lonely woods the footmarks will certainly betray you and if i go with you my doom will be fixed for my big sandal is as well known to the kings hunters as the big nose on my face or the white beard on my chin  poor branwen became and looked very miserable on hearing this for the idea of hunters and footprints had not once occurred to her  oh what then is to be done she asked with a helpless yet eager look  for some time the old man sat in silence with closed eyes as if in meditation  then he said with a sad smile that he supposed there was nothing for it but to reveal one of his secrets to her  i have not many secrets branwen he said but the one which i am about to reveal to you is important  to make it known would be the ruin of me  yet i feel that i may trust you for surely you are a good girl  no im not cried branwen with a look of firmness yet of transparent honesty that amused her companion greatly at least she continued in a quieter tone i dont feel good and the queen often tells me that i am very naughty though i sometimes think she doesnt mean it  but when i think of thatthat monster and his insult to my dear hafrydda and his impudence in wanting me  oh  i could tear him limb from limb and put the bits in the fire so that they could never come together again  my dear child returned beniah remonstratively while she paused with flashing eyes and parted lips as though she had not yet given vent to half her wrath whatever other folk may say or think of you you are good enough in my esteem but it is wrong to give way thus to wrath come i will reveal my little secret and it behoves us to be quick for they will soon miss you and send the hunters on your track  as he spoke the hebrew led the refugee through his hut and into the cave beyond the darkness at the further end of which was so great that it would have been impossible to see but for a stone lamp which stood in a recess in the wall  this revealed the fact that the place was used as a kitchen  that is my chimney said beniah taking up the lamp and holding it so that a large natural hole or crack could be seen overhead it formed an outlet to the forest abovethough the opening was beyond the reach of vision  the same crack extended below in the form of a yawning chasm five or six feet wide  there seemed to be nothing on the other side of this chasm except the wall of the cliffs but on closer inspection a narrow ledge was seen with a small recess beyond  across the chasm lay a plank which rested on the ledge  this is my secretat least part of it said the hebrew pointing to the plank which bridged the chasm  give me your hand we must cross it  branwen possessed a steady as well as a pretty head  placing her hand unhesitatingly in that of her guide she quickly stood on the ledge close to a short narrow passage by which they reached a smaller cave or natural chamber in the solid rock  here to the girls intense surprise she found herself surrounded by objects many of which she had never seen before while others were familiar enough  against the wall were piled webs of cloth of brilliant colours and garments of various kinds  in one corner was a heap of bronze and iron weapons shields and other pieces of eastern armour while in a recess lay piled in a confused heap many phoenician ornaments of gold silver and bronze similar to those which were worn by the warriors and chief men of king hudibras court  it was in fact the stock in trade of the hebrewthe fount at which he replenished his travelling pack a pack which was a great mystery to most of his friends for however much they might purchase out of it there seemed to be no end to its inexhaustible power of reproduction  here said beniah amused at the girls gaze of astonishment ye will be safe from all your foes till a higher power directs us what shall be done with you for to say truth at this moment my mind is a blank however our present duty is not action but concealment  water and dried fruit you will find in this corner  keep quiet  let not curiosity tempt you to examine these thingsthey might fall and cause noise that would betray us  when danger is past i will come again meanwhile observe now what i am about to do and try to imitate me  he returned to the entrance and taking up the plankbridge drew it into the passage guiding its outer end on a slight branch which seemed to have fallen across the chasm accidentally but which in reality had been placed there for this purpose  then sliding it out again he refixed it in position  is that too hard for you  try  branwen obeyed and succeeded so well that old beniah commended her on her aptitude to learn  now be careful he added when about to recross the bridge  your life may depend on your attention to my instructions  but what if i should let the plank slip said she in sudden anxiety  there is another in the cave on the floor  besides i have two or three planks in the forest ready against such a mishap  fear not but commit yourself to the allseeing one  he crossed over alone leaving the girl on the other side and waited till she had withdrawn the bridge when he returned to the mouth of the outer cave and sat down to continue the perusal of his roll  branwen meanwhile returned to the inner cave or store and sat down to meditate on thoughts which had been awakened by the hebrews reference to the allseeing one  she wondered if there was an allseeing one at all and if there was did he see all the wickedness that was done by men ay and even by women and did he see the thoughts of her mind and the feelings of her heart  it will be gathered from this that the maiden was considerably in advance of the uncivilised age in which she lived for the ancient inhabitants of albion were not addicted to the study of theology either natural or speculative  if i but knew of such an allseeing one she murmured i would ask him to help me  raising her eyes as she spoke she observed the goods piled round the walls and the light of the lampwhich had been left with her glittered on the trinkets opposite  this was too much for her  it must be remembered that besides living in a barbarous age she was an untutored maiden and possessed of a large share of that love for pretty things which isrightly or wronglybelieved to be a peculiar characteristic of the fair sex  theology speculative and otherwise vanished she leaped up and forgetting her hosts warning began to inspect the goods  at first consciencefor she had an active little oneremonstrated  but she replied silently with a very natural tendency to selfjustification although beniah told me not to touch things i did not promise not to do so  true but your silence was equivalent to a promise said something within her  no it wasnt she replied aloud  yes it was retorted the something within her in a tone of exasperating contradiction  this was much too subtle a discussion to be continued  she brushed it aside with a laugh and proceeded to turn over the things with eager admiration on her expressive face  catching up a bright blueandscarlet shawl large enough to cover her person she threw it over her and made great and not quite successful efforts to see her own back  suddenly she became motionless and fixed her lustrous brown eyes on the roof with almost petrified attention  a thought had struck her  and she resolved to strike it back in the sense of pursuing it to a conclusion  the very thing she said recovering from petrification and ill do it  the preliminary step to doing it seemed to be a general turn over of the hebrews shawls all of which though many were beautiful she rejected one after another until she found an old and considerably worn grey one this she shook out and examined with approving nods as if it were the finest fabric that ever had issued from the looms of cashmere  tying her luxuriant hair into a tight knot behind and smoothing it down on each side of her face and well back so as not to be obtrusive she flung the old shawl over her head induced a series of wrinkles to corrugate her fair brow drew in her lips so as to conceal her teeth and by the same action to give an aquiline turn to her nose bowed her back and in short converted herself into a little old woman  at court branwen had been celebrated for her powers of mimicry and had been a source of great amusement to her companions in the usesometimes the abuseof these powers but this was the first occasion on which she had thought of personating an old woman  having thus metamorphosed herself she looked eagerly round as if in search of a mirror  it need scarcely be said that glass had not been heard of by the natives of the tin islands or of albion at that time nevertheless mirrors were not unknown  espying in a corner a great bronze shield that might once have flashed terror at the siege of troywho knowsshe set it up against the wall  it was oval in shape and presented her face with such a wide expanse of cheeks that she laughed lightly and turned it the other way  this arrangement gave her visage such lengthened astonishment of expression that she laughed again but was not ill pleased at her appearance on the whole  to make the illusion perfect she sought and found an article of dress of which the albionic name has been forgotten but which is known to modern women as a petticoat  it was reddish brown in colour and so far in keeping with the grey old shawl  while she was busy tying on this garment and otherwise completing her costume almost quite forgetful in her amusement of the danger which had driven her to that strange place she heard voices in the outer cave and among them one which turned her cheeks pale and banished every thought of fun out of her heart  it was the voice of gunrig  that doughty warriorafter having partially regained the equanimity which he had sat down on the fallen tree to recoverarose and returned to his apartment in the palace for the double purpose of feeding and meditation  being a robust man he did not feel much the worse for the events of the morning and attacked a rib of roast beef with gusto hearing with great surprise that his late antagonist was no other than bladud the longlost son of the king he comforted himself with another rib of roast beef and with the reflection that a prince not less than a manatarms is bound to fight a duel when required to do so  having finished his meal he quaffed a huge goblet of spring water and went out to walk up and down with his hands behind his back  doubtless had he lived in modern days he would have solaced himself with a glass of bitter and a pipe but strong drink had not been discovered in those islands at the time and smoking had not been invented  yet it is generally believed though we have no authentic record of the fact that our ancestors got on pretty well without these comforts  we refrain however from dogmatising on the point but it is our duty to state that gunrig at all events got on swimmingly without them  it is also our duty to be just to opponents and to admit that a pipe might possibly have soothed his wrath  of course on hearing of branwens flight the indignant king summoned his hunters at once and putting the enraged gunrig himself at the head of them sent him fuming into the woods in search of the runaway  they did not strike the trail at once because of as already explained the innumerable footprints in the neighbourhood of the town  we cant be long of finding them now remarked the chief to the principal huntsman as they passed the entrance to beniahs retreat  it may be as well to run up and ask the old man who lives here if he has seen her replied the huntsman  he is a man with sharp eyes for his years  as you will said gunrig sternly for his wrath had not yet been appreciably toned down by exercise  they found the hebrew reading at his door  ho  beniah hast seen the girl branwen pass this way today cried gunrig as he came up  i have not seen her pass replied the hebrew in a tone so mild that the angry chief suspected him  shes not in your hut i suppose he added sharply  the door is open you may search it if you doubt me returned the hebrew with a look of dignity which he knew well how to assume  the chief entered at once and after glancing sharply round the outer room entered the kitchen  here beniah showed him the chimney pointed out the yawning chasm below and commented on the danger of falling into it in the dark  and what is there beyond hebrew asked the chief  beniah held up the lamp  you see he said the rock against which my poor hut rests  then the old man referred to the advantages of the situation for supplying himself with food by hunting in the forest as well as by cultivating the patch of garden beside the hut until his visitor began to show signs of impatience when he apologised for intruding his domestic affairs at such a time and finally offered to join and aid the search party  aid us exclaimed gunrig in contempt  surely we need no aid from you when we have the kings headhuntsman as our guide  that may be true chief nevertheless in the neighbourhood of my own hut i could guide you if i chose to secret and retired spots which it would puzzle even the headhuntsman to find  but i will not thrust my services upon you  you are overproud for your station returned the chief angrily and were it not for your years i would teach you to moderate your language and tone  for a moment the eyes of the old man flashed and his brows contracted as he steadily returned the gaze of gunrig  in his youth he had been a man of war and as we have said his strength was not yet much abated by age but years and deep thought had brought wisdom to some extent with an evident effort he restrained himself and made no reply  the chief deeming his silence to be the result of fear turned contemptuously away and left the hut with his followers  during this colloquy poor branwen had stood in the dark passage listening and trembling lest her hidingplace should be discovered  she was a strange compound of reckless courage and timidityif such a compound be possible  indignation at the man who had slighted her bosom friend hafrydda besides insulting herself caused her to feel at times like a raging lion  the comparative weakness of her slight and graceful frame made her at other times feel like a helpless lamb  it was an exasperating condition  when she thought of gunrig she wished with all her heart and soul that she had been born a big brawny man  when she thought of bladud nothing could make her wish to be other than a woman  as she stood there listening there occurred a slight desire to clear her throat and she almost coughed  the feeling came upon her like a shockwhat if she had let it out  but a sneeze  it was well known that sneezes came even to people the most healthy and at moments the most inopportune and well she knew from experience that to repress a sneeze would ensure an explosion fit to blow the little nose off her face  if a sneeze should come at that moment she was lost  but a sneeze did not come  the olfactory nerves remained placid until the visitors had departed  then she retreated to the inner cave drew the grey shawl over her head and awaited the development of her plans  presently she heard footsteps and the voice of the hebrew calling to her softly but she took no notice  after a moment or two it sounded again somewhat louder  still no answer  then beniah shouted with just a shade of anxiety branwen  receiving no reply he ran in much alarm for one of his spare planks thrust it over the chasm crossed and next moment stood in the inner cave the very embodiment of astonished consternation for branwen was gone and in her place stood a little old woman with a bowed form and a puckeredup mouth gazing at him with halfclosed but piercingly dark eyes  the hebrew was almost destitute of superstition and a man of great courage but this proved too much for him  his eyes opened with amazement so did his mouth and he grew visibly pale  the tables were turned at this point  the mans appearance proved too much for the girl  her eyes opened wide her brilliant teeth appeared and standing erect she burst into a fit of merry laughter  child exclaimed beniah his usually grave mouth relaxing into a broad smile which proved that his teeth were not less sound than his constitution you have shown to me that fear or something marvellously like it is capable of lurking within my old heart  what mean you by this  i mean that there is an idea come into my head which i shall carry outif you will allow me  i had thought at first of staying with you as your granddaughter or your niece but then it came into my head that i could not live long here in such a character without some one who knew me seeing me and finding me outthough let me tell you it would not be easy to find me out for i can change my look and voice so that none but those who know me well could discover me  then the idea of being an old woman came into my head andyou can speak to my success  there is nothing more natural than that you should have an old woman to take care of your house while you go on your travels so i can stay till you go and see my father and tell him to send for me  your father lives very far from here returned the hebrew with the lines of perplexity still resting on his brow  that is true but beniahs legs are long and his body is strong  he can soon let my father know of his daughters misfortune  you know that my father is a powerful chief though his tribe is not so strong in numbers as the tribe of king hudibras or thatthat fiend gunrig  but his young men and my brothers are very brave  well let it be as you say for the present my child and you may consider this cave your private chamber while you remain in my house but let me advise you to keep close when i am absent and do not be tempted to prove the strength of your disguise  it may not be as perfect as you think and your voice may betray you  having agreed upon this temporary plan the hebrew departed to make preparations for a long journey while branwen busied herself in arranging the apartment in which for some time at least she hoped to remain in hiding  chapter thirteen  mother and son  we need scarcely say that the search for branwen proved fruitless gunrig and the hunters returned to town crestfallen at being unable to discover the trail of a girl and the chief went off in undiminished wrath to his own homewhich was distant about a days journey on foot from the capital of king hudibras  even in those savage times warriors were not above taking counsel occasionally with women  the king went to consult on the situation with the queen the princess and bladud while gunrig sought advice and consolation from his mother  of course neither of these men would for a moment have admitted that he needed advice  they only condescended to let their womenfolk know what had occurred and hear what they had to say  why do you think has the ungrateful child fled asked the king in some indignation  i cannot imagine answered the queen  we have all been so kind to her and she was so fond of us and we of her  besides her visit was not half over and her father would not be pleased if she were to return home so soon and so unexpectedly  of course hafrydda knew the cause but she maintained a discreet silence  return home echoed the king in contempt how can a little delicate thing like her return home through miles and miles of forest swarming with wild beasts and not a few wilder men  impossible  my hunters must go out again every day till she is found  i will lead them myself since they seem to have lost the power of their craft  is this little delicate thing as beautiful as my sister describes her to be asked bladud somewhat amused by his fathers tone and manner  ay that she is answered the king  beautiful enough to set not a few of my young men by the ears  did you not see her on the platform at the gamesor were you too much taken up with the scowling looks of gunrig  i saw the figure of a young woman answered the prince but she kept a shawl so close round her head that i failed to see her face  as to gunrig i did not think it worth my while to mind him at all so i saw not whether his looks were scowling or pleased  ha boyhe gave you some trouble notwithstanding  he has gone away in anger at present however so we will let him be till he returns for another fight  gunrig meanwhile having reached his town or village went straight to the hut in which his mother dwelt and laid his troubles before her  she was a calm thoughtful woman very unlike her passionate son  it is a bad business she remarked after the chief had described the situation to her and was striding up and down the little room with his hands behind his back and will require much care in management for king hudibras as you know is very fierce when roused and although he is somewhat afraid of you he is like to be roused to anger when he comes to understand that you have jilted his daughter  but i have not jilted her said gunrig stopping abruptly in his walk and looking down upon his parent  that ass bladud won her and although he does turn out to be her brother that does not interfere with his right to break off the engagement if so disposed  besides i do not want to wed the princess now  i have quite changed my mind  why have you changed your mind my son  because i never cared for her much and since i went to visit her father i have seen another girl who is far more beautiful far more clever more winning in every way  the woman looked sharply at the flushed countenance of her son  you love her she asked  ay that do i as i never loved woman before and truly as i think i never shall love again  then you must get her to wife my son for there is no cure for love  oh yes there is mother was the light reply of the chief as he recommenced to pace the floor  death is a pretty sure and sharp cure for love  surely you would not kill yourself because of a girl  gunrig burst into a loud laugh and said nay truly but death may take the girl or death may take mefor as you know there is plenty of fighting among the tribes and my day will surely come sooner or later  in either case love will be cured  can you guess why this girl has fled asked the woman  gunrigs brows contracted and a grim smile played on his lips as he replied after a brief pause  well i am not quite sure mother  it may be that she is not too fond of mewhich only shows her want of taste  but that can be cured when she finds out what a fine man i am  anyhow i will have her if i should have to hunt the forest for a hundred moons and fight all the tribes put together  and how do you propose to go about it my son  that is the very thing i want you to tell me  if it were fighting that had to be done i would not trouble youbut this is a matter that goes beyond the wisdom of a plain warrior  then if you would gain your end my son i should advise you to send a message to king hudibras by one of your most trusty men and let the message be that you are deeply grieved at the loss of his daughters hand that  but im nothing of the kind mother so that would not be true  what does it matter whether true or not if the king only believes it to be true  i dont quite agree mother with your notions about truth  to my mind a warrior should always be straightforward and say what he means  then go my son and tell the king what you have just told me and he will cut your head off replied the dame in a tone of sarcasm  if i act on that advice i will take my warriors with me and carry my sword in my hand so that his head would stand as good a chance of falling as mine returned gunrig with a laugh  but go on with your advice mother  well say that you feel in honour bound to give up all claim to his daughters hand but that as you want a wife very much to keep your house as your mother is getting too old you will be content to take his visitor branwen and will be glad to help in the search for her  will you send that message  it may be that i will  in any case ill send something like it  so saying the chief turned abruptly on his heel and left the room  chapter fourteen  a terrible calamity  it may be imagined that the return home of prince bladud was the cause of much rejoicing in the whole district as well as in his fathers house  at first the king being as we have said a very stern man felt disposed to stand upon his dignity and severely rebuke the son who had run away from home and remained away so long  but an undercurrent of tenderness and pride in the youths grand appearance and great prowess induced him to give in with a good grace and extend to him unreserved forgiveness  as for the queen she made no attempt to conceal her joy and pride and the same may be said of the princess  there was instituted a series of fetes and games in honour of the return of the prodigal at which he was madenot unwillinglyto show the skill which he had acquired from practising with the competitors at the olympic games about which the islanders had heard from phoenician traders from time to time and great was the interest thus created especially when he showed them among other arts how to use their fists in boxing and their swords in guarding so as to enable them to dispense with a shield  but these festivities did not prevent him from taking an interest in the search that his father and the hunters were still making for branwen  when many days had passed however and no word of her whereabouts was forthcoming it was at last arranged that a message regarding her disappearance should be sent to her fathers tribe by a party of warriors who were to be led by the prince himself  i will go gladly he said to his sister a day or two before the party was to set out  for your sake hafrydda i will do my best to clear up the mystery and i think it highly probable that i shall find the runaway safely lodged in her fathers house  i fear not returned hafrydda with a sad look  it seems impossible that she could have made her way so far alone through the wild forests  but she may not have been alone  friends may have helped her  she had no friends in the town having been here but a short time objected the princess  but do your best to find her bladud for i feel quite sure that you will fall in love with her when you see her  the youth laughed  no fear of that he said many a pretty girl have i seen in the east nevertheless i have as you see left them all without a thought of ever returning again  but i did not say you would fall in love with branwen because she is pretty  i feel sure that you will because she is sweet and merry and goodyet thoughtfulwonderfully thoughtful  ay and you may add said the queen who came into the room just then that she is sometimes thoughtless and wonderfully full of mischief  nay mother you are not just returned the princess  her mischief is only on the surface her thoughtfulness lies deep down  well well whatever may be the truth regarding her i shall not trouble my head about her for i have never yet felt what men call love and i feel sure i never shall  i like to hear you say that brother rejoined hafrydda for i have noticed young though i am that when men say they will never fall in love or marry they are always pretty near the point of doing one or both  but poor bladud was destined to do neither at that time for an event was hanging over him though he knew it not which was to affect very seriously the whole of his after life  for several days previous to the above conversation he had felt a sensation that was almost new to himnamely that of being slightly ill  whether it was the unwonted exertions consequent on his efforts at the games or the excitement of the return home we cannot say but headache accompanied by a slight degree of fever had troubled him like most strong men in the circumstances he adopted the samsonian and useless method of shaking it off  he went down into the arena and performed feats of strength and agility that surprised even himself but the fever which enabled him to do so asserted itself at last and finally compelled him to do what he should have done at firstpocket his pride and give in  of course we do not suggest that giving in to little sensations of ailment is either wise or manly  there are duties which call on men to fight even in sicknessay in spite of sicknessbut showing off in the arena was not one of these  be this as it may bladud came at last to the condition of feeling weakan incomprehensible state of feeling to him  he thereupon went straight home and flinging himself half petulantly on a couch exclaimedmother i am ill  my son i have seen that for many days past and have waited with some anxiety till you should come to the point of admitting it  and now that i have admitted it returned the youth with a languid smile what is to be done  the answer to that question was not the simple one of modern days send for the doctor because no doctors worthy of the name existed  there was indeed a solemnvisaged longheaded elderly man among king hudibras followers who was known as the medicineman to the royal household but his services were not often in request because people were seldom ill save when they were going to die and when that time came it was generally thought best to let them die in peace  this medicineman though a quack in regard to physic was however a true man as far as his knowledge went in surgerythat is to say he was expert at the setting of broken bones when the fractures were not too compound he could bandage ordinary wounds he had even ventured into the realm of experimental surgery so far as to knock out a decayed back tooth with a bronze chisel and a big stone  but his knowledge of drugs was naturally slight and his power of diagnosis feeble  still unworthy though he may be of the title we will for convenience style him the doctor  my poor boy said the queen in answer to his question and laying her hand on his hot brow i am so sorry that we cannot have the services of our doctor for he is away hunting just nowyou know he is very fond of the bow and line  perhaps he may  oh never mind the doctor mother said bladud impatiently with that slighting reference to the faculty which is but too characteristic of youth what do you think ought to be done  you were always doctor enough for me when i was little youll do equally well now that i am big  be not hasty my son  you were always hotheaded and  im hotheaded now at all events and argument wont tend to cool it  do what you will with it for i can stand this no longer  cut it off if you like mother only use a sharp knife and be quick about it  in those days far more than in this our homeopathic era it was the habit of the mothers of families to keep in store certain herbs and roots etcetera which doubtless contained the essences now held in modern globules  with these they contrived decoctions that were unquestionably more or less beneficial to patients when wisely applied to the compounding of something of this sort the queen now addressed herself  after swallowing it the prince fell asleep  this was so far well but in the morning he was still so far from well that the visit to branwens father had to be postponed  several days elapsed before the doctor returned from his hunting expedition  by that time the fever had left the prince  he began to get somewhat better and to go about but still felt very unlike his old self  during this what we may style semiconvalescent period captain arkal and little maikar proved of great use and comfort to him for they not only brought him information about the gameswhich were still kept upbut cheered him with gossipy news of the town in general and with interesting reminiscences of their late voyage and the eastern lands they had so recently left  one day these faithful friends as well as the queen and princess were sitting by bladuds couchto which unaccountable fits of laziness confined him a good dealwhen the medicineman was announced  he proceeded at once to examine the patient while the others stood aside and looked on with that profound respect which ignorance sometimes though not always assumes in the presence of knowledge  the doctor laid his hand on bladuds brow and looked earnestly into his eyes  then he tapped his back and chest as if to induce some one in his interior to open a door and let him invery much as doctors do nowadays  then he made him remove his upper garments and examined his broad and brawny shoulders  a mark or spot of a whitish appearance between the left shoulder and the elbow at once riveted his attention and caused an almost startled expression on his grave countenance  but the expression was momentary  it passed away and left the visage grave and thoughtfulif possible more thoughtful than before  that will do he said turning to the queen  your treatment was the best that could have been applied  i must now see his father the king  alone asked the queen  alone replied the doctor  well what think ye of bladud asked the king when his physician entered his chamber and carefully shut the door  he is smitten with a fatal disease said the doctor in a low earnest voice  not absolutely fatal cried the king with sudden anxiety  as far as i know it is so  there is no cure that i ever heard of bladud is smitten with leprosy  it may be years before it kills him but it will surely do so at last  impossibleimpossible cried the king becoming fierce and unbelieving in his horror  you are too confident my medicineman you may you must be mistaken  there is a cure for everything  not for leprosy returned the doctor with sad but firm emphasis  at least i never heard of a cure being effected except by some of the eastern wise men  then by all the gods that protect our race and family my son shall return to the east and one of these wise men shall cure himelse elsehave ye told the queen  not yet  that is well  i will myself tell her  go  this summary dismissal was nothing new to the doctor who understood the king well and sympathised with his obvious distress  pausing at the door however he said  i have often talked with phoenician captains about this disease and they tell me that it is terribly infectious insomuch that those who are smitten with it are compelled to live apart and keep away from men  if bladud remains here the disease will surely spread through the house and thence through the town  poor hudibras fell into a chair and covered his face with both hands while the doctor quietly retired  it is impossible to describe the consternation that ensued when the terrible fact was made known  of course the news spread into the town and the alarm became general for at various times the phoenician mariners had entertained the islanders with graphic descriptions of the horrors connected with this loathsome disease and it soon became evident that even if the king and his family were willing to run the risk of infection by keeping bladud near them his people and warriors would insist on the banishment of the smitten man  to bladud himself the blow was almost overwhelmingalmost but not quite for the youth was possessed of that unselfish selfsacrificing spirit which in all ages of the worlds history has bid defiance to misfortune by bowing the head in humble submission to the will of god he knew well the nature of the dread disease by which he had been attacked and he shuddered at the thought that however long he might be spared to live it would sap his strength disfigure his person and ultimately render his face hideous to look upon while a life of absolute solitude must from that day forward be his portion  no wonder that in the first rush of his dismay he entertained a wild thought of putting an end to his own existence  there was only one gleam of comfort to him and that was the recollection that he had caught the disease in a good causein the rescue of a poor old woman from destruction  the comfort of the thought was not indeed great still it was something in the awful desolation that overwhelmed him at the time  while travelling in the east a short time previous to setting sail for home he had come across an old woman who was being chased by a wild bull  her flight would have been shortlived in any case for there chanced to be a steep precipice not far from her towards which she ran in her terror and scrambled hastily down until she reached a spot where she could go no further without losing her foothold  to the rock she clung and screamed in her despair  it was her screams that first attracted bladuds attention  rushing forward he was just in time to see the bullwhich could not check its mad careerplunge over the cliff at the bottom of which it was killed by the fall  bladud at once began to descend to the help of the poor woman  as he did so the words unclean unclean met his ear  the woman was a leper and even in her dire extremity the force of habit caused her to give the usual warning which the eastern law requires  a shudder passed through the princes frame for he knew well the meaning of the crybut as he looked down and saw the disfigured face and the appealing eyes turned towards him a gush of intense pity and of that disregard of self which is more or less characteristic of all noble natures induced him to continue his descent until he reached the poor creature grasping her tightly round the waist he assisted her up the perilous ascent and finally placed her in safety at the top of the cliff  for a time bladud felt some anxiety as to the result of the risk he had run but did not mention his adventure to any one  gradually the fear wore off and at length that feeling of invulnerability which is so strong in youth induced him to dismiss the subject from his thoughts altogether  he had quite forgotten it until the doctors statement fell upon him with the stunning violence of a thunderclap  it is usually when deep sorrows and great difficulties are sent to them that men and women find out the quality of their natures  despair followed by listless apathy might well have seized on one who a few days before possessed all the advantages of great physical strength and manly beauty with what appeared to be sound health and a bright life before him  but instead of giving way he silently braced himself for a lifelong conflict  he did not turn in his extremity to the gods of his fatherswhatever these might befor he did not believe in them but he did believe in one good supreme being  to him he raised his heart offered an unspoken prayer and felt comforted as well as strengthened in the act  then being a man of prompt action he thoughtfully but quickly formed his plans having previously made fast his doorfor well he knew that although his strongminded father might keep him at armslength his loving mother and sister would not only come to talk with him but would despite all risks insist on embracing him  that he was not far wrong was proved the same evening for when the king revealed the terrible news to his wife and daughter they went straight to bladuds door and knocked for admission  who goes there demanded the prince  your mother  let me in bladud  i may not do so just now dear mother  tomorrow you shall know all rest content  i feel better  in the dead of night bladud went out softly and sought the hut where captain arkal and maikar slept  he found them conversing in great sorrow about the terrible calamity that had overtaken their friend when he entered  they started up in surprise to receive him  keep off he said shrinking back  touch me not  i know not whether the disease may not be catching even at its present stage  sit down  i will stand here and tell you what i want you to tell my mother in the morning  the two men silently obeyed and the prince continued  i am on the point of leaving homeit may be for ever  the disposer of all things knows that  the disease as you know is thought to be incurable  if so i shall die where no one shall find me  if health returns i shall come back  it will be of no use to search for me but i think that will not be attempted  indeed i know that my father would be compelled to banish me if i wished to remain at home  it is partly to spare him the pain of doing so that i banish myself of my own accord and partly to avoid leaving infection behind me that i go without farewell  let my dear mother and sister understand this clearlyand comfort them if you can  but where will you go to and what will you do asked the captain anxiously  that i do not yet know  the forests are wide  there is plenty of room for man and beast  this only will i reveal to you  tonight i shall call at the hut of beniah the hebrew  he is a wise man and will advise me  if i send news of myself it shall be through him  but tell not this to any one  it would only bring trouble on the old man  farewell my comrades  i will remember you as brothersalways  may the allpowerful one watch over us  unable to restrain himself little maikar sprang up with the obvious intention of rushing at his friend and seizing his hand but the prince stepped back shut the door against him and in another moment was gone  chapter fifteen  an eavesdropper in the cave  an hour later beniah the hebrew who had been obliged to postpone for a time his journey to the north was startled by hearing footsteps approaching his hut in the dell  it was so unusual an event at that hour of the night that he arose quickly and grasped the sixfoot staff which was his only weapon  at a much earlier hour branwen had retired to rest in the inner cave and was buried in that profound sleep which proverbially accompanies innocence and youth  the noise in the outer cave partially aroused her but turning on her other side with a profound sigh she prepared for a little more of the perquisites of innocence and youth  presently she was startled into a condition of absolute wideawakeness by the sound of a wellknown voice but it suddenly changed into that of the hebrew  ive dreamt it i suppose she muttered in a tone of regret nevertheless she listened  come in said beniah evidently to some one outside of his door  i may not enteri am a leper answered the first voice and branwen sat up with her great beautiful eyes opened to the utmost and listening intently though she could not make out clearly what was said  it matters not i have no fear  come in  what  prince bladud exclaimed beniah in astonishment as our hero entered  even so  but how is it that you know me  i saw you once and once seen you are not easily forgotten  but what mean ye about being a leper  keep at a safe distance and i will tell you  hereupon the prince began to give the old man an account of his illness the opinion expressed by the doctor as to its nature and the determination he had formed of forsaking home and retiring to the solitude of some unfrequented part of the forest for the remainder of his life  it would have been a sight worth looking athad there been light to see itthe vision of branwen as she stood in the passage in partial deshabille with her eyes wide her lips parted her heart beating and a wealth of auburn hair curling down her back listening as it were with every power of her soul and body  but she could not hear distinctly  only a disconnected word reached her now and then  in a state of desperate curiosity she returned to her cave  a few minutes later a noise was heard by the two men in the outer cave and a little old woman in a grey shawl was seen to thrust a plank over the chasm and totter across towards them  poor beniah was horrified  he did not know what to do or say  happily he was one of those men whose feelings are never betrayed by their faces  the old woman hobbled forward and sat down on a stool close to them looking up in their faces she smiled and nodded  in doing so she revealed the fact that besides having contorted her face into an unrecognisable shape she had soiled it in several places with streaks of charcoal and earth  who is this asked bladud in surprise  before the old man could reply the old woman put her hand to her ear and looking up in the princes face shouted in tones that were so unlike to her own natural voice that beniah could scarce believe his ears  what say you young man  speak out im very deaf  with a benignant smile bladud said that he had merely asked who she was  havent you got eyes young man  dont you see that im a little old woman  i see that returned the prince with a goodhumoured laugh and i fear youre a deaf old woman too  eh she said advancing her head with her hand up at the ear  you seem indeed to be extremely deaf shouted the prince  what does he say demanded the old woman turning to the hebrew  by this time beniah had recovered his selfpossession  perceiving that the maiden was bent on carrying out her role and that he might as well help her he put his mouth close to her ear and shouted in a voice that bid fair to render her absolutely deaf  he says he thinks you are extremely deaf so i think you had better hold your tongue and let us go on with our conversation  deaf indeed returned the woman in a querulous tone so i am though i hear you well enough when you shout like that  perhaps hell be as deaf as i am when hes as old  theres nothing like youth for pride and impudence  but go on never mind me  shes a poor creature who has sought refuge with me from her persecutors said beniah turning to the prince while the old woman fell to crooning a wild song in a low voice accompanying the musicif such it may be calledby a swaying motion of her body to and fro  seeing that she meant to sit there and that she apparently heard nothing bladud resumed the conversation where it had been interrupted  now as i was saying you know the country in all directions and can tell me of the most likely part where i can find what i wanta solitude where i shall be able to escape from the face of man and build a hut to live in till i die  it may be long it may be short before death relieves me  meanwhile i can hunt and provide myself with food till the time comes  the crooning of the old woman stopped at this point and she sank her face on her hands as if she had fallen asleep  i know of a mana hunter said beniah a wild sort of being who lives a long way from here in a beautiful part of the land where there is a wonderful swamp with a hot spring in the midst of it  besides hunting the man who lives there cultivates the ground a little and keeps a few cattle and pigs  it may be that he can put you in the way of finding what you want and you need not tell him about your disease for you are not yet sure about it  thus you will have an opportunity of keeping out of the way of men until you find out whether the doctor is right about it  he may be wrong you know  diseases sometimes resemble each other without being the same  bladud shook his head  there can be no doubt that i am doomed he said  i know the disease too well  the hebrew also believed that if the doctor was right in his opinion there was no hope for the youth  being unwilling however to dwell upon this point he asked  how did you come by it  very simply answered the prince who thereupon entered into a graphic account of the incident which we have already recorded  having done so he made up his mind after some further talk to pay a visit to the hunter who dwelt in the region of the hot swamp  but you will not surely go without arms said beniah  why not  if i am doomed to die at any rate why should i take the life of any man to save my own  let me at least give you a bow and a sheaf of arrows  you cannot procure food without these  well you are right  i will accept your kind offer  to say truth my heart was so crushed at first by this blow that such matters did not occur to me when i left for it is terrible to think of having to die of a slow disease without father mother or sister to comfort one  it is indeed my son returned beniah with much feeling  if you will accept it i can give you a word of comfort  give it me said bladud for i need it muchif it be but true  it is true returned the hebrew earnestly for in one of the books of our holy men who spoke for the allfather it is written when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up  it is a good word returned the prince and i can well believe it comes from the allfather for is he not also allgood  yet i can scarcely claim it as mine for my father and mother have not forsaken me but i them  a few minutes more and bladud rose to depart  he took the bow and arrows in his left hand and totally forgetting for the moment the duty of keeping himself aloof from his fellowmen he shook hands warmly with beniah patted the old woman kindly on the shoulder and went out into the dark night  the moment he was gone branwen started up with flashing eyes that were still bedewed with tears and seized the old mans hand  child he said thou hast been weeping  who could listen to his telling of that old womans escape from the bull and the precipice without tears she replied  but tell me what is this terrible disease that has smitten the prince  it is one well known and much dreaded in the eastcalled leprosy  here the hebrew went into a painfully graphic account of the disease the frightful disfigurement it caused and its almost if not quite certain termination in death  and have the queen and hudibras actually let him go away to die alone she exclaimed  not so my child  before you interrupted us he told me that he had left home by stealth on purpose  but branwen continued the old man with some severity how could you run such a risk of being discovered  i ran no risk she replied with a laugh  besides it was not fair to pretend to be deaf and thus obtain all his secrets  i dont care whether it was fair or not replied the girl with a wilful shake of her head  and was it fair of you to back me up as you did  your rebuke is just yet it savours of ingratitude  i should not have done so but i was completely taken aback  do you know that your face is dirty  i know it  i made it so on purpose  now tell mewhen are you going away to tell my father and brothers about me  i shall probably start tomorrow  but many days must pass before i can bring them here for as you know their town is a long way off  but child you do not seem to reflect that you have betrayed me  how asked branwen wonderingly  did you not thrust out the plank and cross over before the very eyes of bladud  branwen pursed her lips into the form of an o and opened her eyes wide  i never thought of that she said  but after all it does not matter for the prince took no notice of the plank and he is not the man to go and betray secrets  the hebrew laughed patted the girl on the head and sent her off to rest  then he busied himself in making preparation for his too longdelayed journey  next morning before daybreak he set off leaving branwen in charge of the hut with strict orders to keep well out of sight  if any one should come to it she was to retreat to the inner cavern and withdraw the bridge  they may do as seemeth to them good in the outer hut  there is nothing there worth stealing and they are welcome to make themselves at home  the hebrew went on his mission arrived in due time at his journeys end reported branwens dilemma guided a party of stout warriors under her father gadarn and led them to his hut in the dell in the dead of a dark night for it was no part of the programme to abduct the girl by main force unless peaceful or stealthy measures should prove unsuccessful  when however he reached the dell and entered his dwelling he found that the bird had flown  every nook and cranny of the place was carefully searched but to the consternation of the hebrew and the wrath of gadarn and his men not a vestige of branwen was to be found  chapter sixteen  adventures in the forests  poor branwen it was an unfortunate day for her when in her youthful ignorance and recklessness she took to the wild woods resolved to follow bladud to his destination and secretly wait there and watch over him like a guardian angel as it were until the terrible disease should lay him on his deathbed when she would reveal herself and nurse him to the end  let not the reader suppose there was any lack of maiden modesty in this resolve  it must be borne in mind that branwen was little more than a child in experience that she was of an age at which the world with all its affairs is enveloped in a halo of romance that her soul had been deeply stirred by the story of the rescue of the leprous old woman and her pity powerfully aroused by the calm though hopeless tones of the doomed man when he spoke of his blighted prospects  rather than leave him to die in absolute solitude she would sacrifice everything and in spite of infection and disfigurement and the horrible nature of a disease which eats away the features before it kills she would soothe his dying hours  besides this it must be remembered that our ancestors notions of propriety were somewhat different from ours and well it was about eight hundred years búc  whether love was a factor in her resolve we cannot say but we are firmly convinced that if it were she was ignorant of the fact  it is however one thing to resolvequite another thing to carry resolution into effect  branwen had in an incidental way obtained from her protector beniah information as to the direction in which the hunter of the hot swamp lived and the distance to his dwelling but when she actually found herself in the forest with nothing to guide her save the position of the sunand on cloudy days not even thatshe began to realise somewhat of the difficulties that attended her enterprise and when on the first night she crouched among the forked branches of an old oak and heard the cries of wolves and other wild creatures and even saw them prowling about by the light of the moon as it flickered through the foliage she began to appreciate the dangers  she had not indeed been so foolish as to set out on her expedition without a certain amount of forethoughtwhat she deemed careful and wise consideration  she knew that by noting the position of the sun when at its highest point in the sky she could follow pretty closely the direction which beniah had pointed out to her  she was quite aware that food was absolutely necessary to life and had packed up a large bundle of dried meat and also provided herself with one of her hosts bows and a sheaf of arrows  besides this she knew like every girl of the period how to snare rabbits and was even expert in throwing stones so that if it should come to the worst she could manage to subsist on little birds  as to sleeping at night she had been accustomed as a little girl to climb trees which faculty had not yet departed from her and she knew well that among the branches of many kinds of trees there were cosy restingplaces where neither man nor beast would be likely to discover her  she had also some idea of what it is to follow a trail for she had often heard the kings chief hunter refer to the process  as it was certain that bladud being an enormously big man would leave a very obvious trail behind him she would follow thatof course keeping well in the rear so that he might never dream of her existence or intentions until the fatal time arrived when she should have to appear like a guardian angel and nurse him till he died  poor branwen felt dreadfully depressed when she thought of this termination and was quite unlike her gay reckless self for a time but a vague feeling of unbelief in such a catastrophe and a determination to hope against hope kept her from giving way to absolute despair and nerved her to vigorous exertion  it was in this state of mind that she had set the hebrews house in order carried everything of value to the inner cave removed the plank bridge closed the outer door and had taken her departure  as already said she concealed herself among the branches of an old oak the first night and although somewhat alarmed by the cries of wild animals as well as by the appalling solitude and darkness around she managed to make a fair supper of the dried meat  thenshe could not tell whenshe fell into a profound slumber which was not broken until the sun had risen high and the birds were whistling gaily among the branchessome of them gazing at her in mute surprise as if they had discovered some new species of gigantic acorn  she arose with alacrity her face flushed with abounding health and her eyes dancing with a gush of youthful hope  but memory stepped in and the thought of her sad mission caused a sudden collapse  the collapse however did not last long  her eyes chanced to fall on the bundle of dried meat  appetite immediately supervened  fallingto she made a hearty breakfast and then looking cautiously round to see that no danger was near she slipped down from her perch took up the bow and quiver and bundle of food threw her blanket or striped piece of phoenician cloth over her shoulder and resumed her journey  it was soon after this that branwen found out the misfortune of ignorance and want of experience  ere long she began to feel the cravings of thirst and discovered that she had forgotten to take with her a bottle or any other sort of receptacle for water  about noon her thirst became so great that she half repented having undertaken the mission  then it became so intolerable that she felt inclined to sit down and cry  but such an act was so foreign to her nature that she felt ashamed pursed her lips contracted her brows grasped her bow and strode bravely on  she was rewarded  the tinkling of water broke upon her senses like celestial music  running forward she came to a little spring at which she fell on her knees put her lips to the pool and drank with thankfulness in her heart  arising refreshed she glanced upward and observed a bird of the pheasant species gazing fixedly down  how fortunate exclaimed the maiden fitting an arrow to her bow  it was not fortunate for the pheasant evidently whatever branwen may have meant for next moment the bird fell deadtransfixed with an arrow  being high noon by that time the demands of nature made our huntress think of a midday meal  and now it was that she became aware of another omissionthe result partly of inexperience  having plucked and cleaned the bird she prepared to roast it when a sudden indescribable gaze overspread her pretty face  for a moment she stood as if petrified  then she suddenly laughed but the laugh was not gleeful for it is trying to human nature to possess a good appetite and a good dinner without the means of cooking  she had forgotten to take with her materials for producing fire  she knew indeed that sticks and friction and fungus were the things required but she knew not what sort of sticks or where to find the right kind of fungus or tinder moreover she had never tried her hand at such work before and knew not how to begin  laying the bird on a bank therefore she dined off the dried meatnot however so heartily as before owing to certain vague thoughts about supply and demandthe rudimentary ideas of what now forms part of the science of political economy  the first fittings of a careworn expression across her smooth brow showed at all events that domestic economy had begun to trouble her spirit  for she thought to herself the dried meat wont last long and i cant eat raw thingsdisgustingand ive a long long way to go  even at this early period of her mission her character was beginning to develop a little and to strengthen  for several days she continued her journey through the great solitudes lying to the northwest of king hudibras town keeping carefully out of the way of open places lest wandering hunters should find her and sleeping in the forked branches of trees at night  of course the necessity of thus keeping to the dense woods and making her way through thorny thickets rendered her journey very fatiguing but branwen was unusually strong and healthy though the grace of her slender frame gave her a rather fragile appearance and she did not find herself exhausted even at the end of a long days march while her dresseddeerskin skirt and leggings bid defiance to thorns  so did the rude but serviceable shoes which her friend beniah had constructed for her out of raw hide  one thing that troubled the poor girl much was the fact that she had not yet discovered the trail of bladud  in reality she had crossed it more than once but not being possessed of the keen eye of the hunter she had not observed it until she came to a muddy swamp on the edge of which there was an unmistakable tracka trail which a semiblind man could hardly have missed  stopping for a few minutes to take particular note of it she afterwards went on with renewed hope and energy  but this state of things did not last for the trail became to her indistinguishable the moment the swamp was passed and at last during a very dark wet day she lost herself as well as the trail  at evening of the same day she climbed into a tree  opening out her bundle of dried meat she began to eat and bemoan her fate  tears were in her eyes and there was a slight tendency to sob in her voice as she muttered to herself  ii wouldnt mind being lost so much if i only knew what to do or where to go  and this meat wont hold out another week at the rate ive been eating  but i could hardly help iti have been so hungry indeed im hungry now but i must not eat so much  let me see  i shall divide it into two parts  that will last me twelve days or so by which time i should be thereif im still going in the right direction and now divide the half into sixthereeach of these will do for oh but i forgot thats only enough for breakfast  it will need two portions for each day as it will be impossible to do without supper  i must just eat half of tonights portion and see how it feels  with this complicated end in view she dried her eyes and began supper and when she had finished it she seemed to see that it didnt feel enough for after much earnest consideration she quietly began to eat the second portion and consumed it  she was putting away the remnants and feeling altogether in a more satisfactory state of mind when her eyes fell upon an object which caused her heart to bound with alarm and drove all the colour from her cheeks  at the foot of the tree looking up at her in blank amazementopeneyed and mouthedstood a man a big roughlooking man in hairy garments and with a hairy face which was topped by a head of hair that rendered a cap needless  he stood with his feet apart and an arrow across his bow like one who sees a lovely bird which he is about to bring down  oh dont shoot she cried becoming suddenly and alarmingly aware of the actiondont shoot  its me  iim a girlnot a beast  to make quite sure that the man understood her branwen jumped to the ground quickly and stood before him  recovering himself the man lowered his bow and said something in a dialect so uncouth that the poor girl did not understand him  indeed she perceived to her horror that he was halfwitted and could articulate with difficulty  i dont know what you say good man but i am lost in this forest and belong to king hudibras town  i am on my way to visit the hunter of the hot swamp and i would think it so very very kind if you would guide me to his hut  the idiotfor such he wasevidently understood the maiden though she did not understand him for he threw back his head and gave vent to a prolonged gurgling laugh  branwen felt that her only chance was to put a bold face on matters she therefore by a violent effort subdued her emotion and continued  you know king hudibras  the man nodded and grinned  then i am quite sure that if you behave well and show me the way to the hot swamp he will reward you in a way that will make your heart dance with joy  come guide me  we have a good deal of the day still before us  thus speaking she put her hand quietly within that of the idiot and in a voice of authority saidlead on  regarding the girl with a look of mute surprise the man obeyed but instead of leading her to the region named he conducted her over a neighbouring ridge into what appeared to her to be a robbers den there was nothing for it now but to carry out the role which she had laid down  the desperate nature of the case seemed to strengthen her to play her part for as she was led into the circle of light caused by a campfire round which a band of wildlooking men were standing a spirit of calm determination seemed to take possession of her soul  what strange sort of animal is this you have caught lad demanded one of the band  before an answer could be given a tall fiercelooking woman came out of a booth or temporary hut close to the campfire pushed her way through the crowd of men who fell back respectfully and going up to branwen grasped her by the wrist  never ye mind what animal she is cried the woman shaking her fist at the man who had spoken she is my property  then turning to her captive as she led her into the hut she said  dont be afraid my dear  blackhearted though some of them are not one will dare to touch you as long as you are under my protection  chapter seventeen  branwen in imminent danger  it is a wonderful but at the same time we think a universal and important fact that love permeates the universe  even a female snail if we could only put the question would undoubtedly admit that it loves its little ones  at least we have the strongest presumption from analogy that the idea is correct for do we not find lions and tigers apes and gorillas engaged in lovingly lickingwe dont mean whippingand otherwise fondling their offspring  even in hades we find the lost rich man praying for the deliverance of his brethren from torment and that surely was love in the form of pity  at all events whatever name we may give it there can be no doubt it was unselfish  and even selfishness is love misapplied  yes let us be thankful that in one form or another love permeates the universe and there is no place however unfavourable and no person however unlikely that can altogether escape from its benign influence  we have been led to these reflections by the contemplation of that rugged hardfeatured squareshouldered angry old woman who so opportunely took branwen under her protection  why she did so was a complete mystery to the poor girl for the woman seemed to have no amiable traits of character about her and she spoke so harshly to every oneeven to her timid captivethat branwen could not help suspecting she was actuated by some sinister motive in protecting her  and branwen was right  she had indeed a sinister end in viewbut love was at the bottom even of that  the woman whose name was ortrud had a son who was to the full as ugly and unamiable as herself and she loved that son although he treated her shamefully abused her and sometimes even threatened to beat her  to do him justice he never carried the threat into execution  and strange to say this unamiable blackguard also loved his mothernot very demonstratively it is true except in the abusive manner above mentioned  this rugged creature had a strong objection to the wild lawless life her son was leading for instead of sticking to the tribe to which he belonged and pillaging fighting with and generally maltreating every other tribe that was not at peace with his this mistaken young man had associated himself with a band of likeminded desperadoeswho made him their chiefand took to pillaging the members of every tribe that misfortune cast in his way  now it occurred to ortrud that the best way to wean her son from his evil ways would be to get him married to some gentle pretty affectionate girl whose influence would be exerted in favour of universal peace instead of war and the moment she set eyes on branwen she became convinced that her ambition was on the point of attainment  hence her unexpected and sudden display of interest in the fair captive whom she meant to guard till the return of her son from a special marauding expedition in which he was engaged at the time with a few picked men  whatever opinion the reader may have by this time formed of branwen we wish it to be understood that she had a way with her of insinuating herself into the good graces of all sorts and conditions of men including women and children  she was particularly successful with people of disagreeable and hardened character  it is not possible to explain why but such being the case it is not surprising that she soon wormed herself into the confidence of the old woman to such an extent that the latter was ere long tempted to make her more or less of a confidant  one day about a week after the arrival of our heroine in the camp old ortrud asked her how she would like to live always in the green woods the look of uncertainty with which she put the question convinced the captive that it was a leading one  i should like it well she replied if i had pleasant company to live with  of course of course my dear you would need thatand what company could be more pleasant than that of a good stout man who could keep you in meat and skins and firewood  any one with a quarter of branwens intelligence would have guessed at once that the woman referred to her absent son about whose good qualities she had been descanting at various times for several days past  the poor girl shuddered as the light broke in on her and a feeling of dismay at her helpless condition and being entirely in the power of these savages almost overcame her but her power of selfrestraint did not fail her  she laughed blushed in spite of herself and said she was too young to look at the matter in that light  not a bit not a bit rejoined ortrud  i was younger than you when my husband ran away with me  ran away with you ortrud cried branwen laughing outright  ay i was betterlooking then than i am now and not nigh so heavy  he wouldnt find it so easy said the woman with a sarcastic snort to run away with me now  no and he wouldnt be so much inclined to do so i should think thought branwen but she had the sense not to say so  thats a very very nice hunting shirt you are making remarked branwen anxious to change the subject  the woman was pleased with the compliment  she was making a coat at the time of a dressed deerskin using a fishbone needle with a sinew for a thread  yes it is a pretty one she replied  im making it for my younger son who is away with his brother though hes only a boy yet  do you expect him back soon asked the captive with a recurrence of the sinking heart  in a few days i hope  yes you are right my dear the coat is a pretty one and he is a pretty lad that shall wear itnot very handsome in the face to be sure but what does that matter so long as hes stout and strong and kind  i am sure his elder brother addedomar will be kind to you though he is a bit rough to me sometimes  poor branwen felt inclined to die on the spot at this cool assumption that she was to become a bandits wife but she succeeded in repressing all appearance of feeling as she rose and stretching up her arms gave vent to a careless yawn  i must go and have a ramble now she said  im tired of sitting so long  dont be long my dear cried the old woman as the captive left the hut for the ribs must be nigh roasted by this time  branwen walked quickly till she gained the thick woods then she ran and finally sitting down on a bank burst into a passion of tears  but it was not her nature to remain in a state of inactive woe  having partially relieved her feelings she dried her tears and began to think her thinking was seldom or never barren of results  to escape somehow anyhow everyhow was so urgent that she felt it to be essential to the very existence of the universeher universe at leastthat she should lift herself out of the impossible into the stickatnothing  the thing must be doneby miracle if not otherwise  and she succeedednot by miracle but by natural meansas the reader shall find out all in good time  chapter eighteen  the prince undertakes strange work  when prince bladud entered upon what he really believed would be his last journey he naturally encountered very different experiences being neither so ignorant so helpless nor so improvident as his helpless follower  after a good many days of unflagging perseverance therefore he reached the neighbourhood of the hot swamp in good spirits and in much better health than when he set out  he was indeed almost restored to his usual vigour of body for the fever by which he had been greatly weakened had passed away and the constant walking and sleeping in fresh air had proved extremely beneficial  we know not for certain whether the leprosy by which he had been attacked was identical in all respects with the fatal disease known in the east or whether it was something akin to it or the same in a modified form  the only light which is thrown by our meagre records on this point is that it began with fever and then after a period of what seemed convalescence or inaction it continued to progress slowly but surely  of course the manner in which it had been caught was more than presumptive evidence that it was at least of the nature of the fatal plague of the east  although his immunity from present suffering tended naturally to raise the spirits of the prince it did not imbue him with much if any hope for he knew well he might linger for monthseven for yearsbefore the disease should sap all his strength and finally dry up the springs of life  this assurance was so strong upon him that as we have said he once indeed more than oncethought of taking his own life  but the temptation passed quickly  he was too conscientious and too brave to do that and had none of that moral cowardice which seeks escape from the inevitable in hopedfor oblivion  whether his life was the gift of many gods or of one god he held that it was a sacred trust which he was bound in honour to guard  therefore he fought manfully against depression of spirits as one of the destroyers of life and even encouraged hope frequently looking at the fatal white spot on his shoulder and trying to persuade himself that it was not spreading  in this state of mind bladud arrived one day at the abode of the hunter of the hot swamp  it was not indeed close to the springs which caused the swamp but stood in a narrow sequestered gully quite five miles distant from it  the spot had been chosen as one which was not likely to be discovered by wanderers and could be easily defended if it should be found  moreover its owner as bladud had been warned was a fierce morose man who loved solitude and resented interference of any kind and this was so well known in the thinlypeopled neighbourhood that every one kept carefully out of his way  sometimes this eccentric hunter appeared at the nearest villagetwenty miles distant from his homewith some pigs to barter for the few commodities which he wanted from time to time but he and his horse cow and dogs ate up all the remaining produce of his small farmif such it might be called  it was a beautiful evening when the prince walked up to the door of the little hut in front of which its owner was standing eyeing him with a forbidding scowl as he approached  he was in truth a strange and formidable man such as one would rather not meet with in a lonely place  there appear to have been giants in those days for this hunter of the hot swamp was nearly if not quite as tall as bladud himself and to all appearance fully as strong of limb  a mass of black hair covered his head and chin a skin huntingshirt his body and a hairy boarskin was thrown across his broad shoulders  altogether he seemed to his visitor the very personification of ferocity  a huge bow ready strung leaned against his hut  as bladud advanced with his own bow unstrung the man apparently scorned to take it up but he grasped and leaned upon a staff proportioned to his size  anxious to propitiate this mysterious being the prince approached with steady unaffected ease of manner and a look of goodwill which might have conciliated almost any one but it had no effect on the hunter  what want ye here he demanded when his visitor was near enough  to enter your service  my service exclaimed the man with a look of surprise that for a moment banished the scowl  i want no servant  i can serve myself well enough  and truly it seems to me that a man like you should be ashamed to talk of service  you are more fitted for a master than a servant  i trow you must have some bad motive for seeking service with a man like me  have you murdered any one that you flee from the face of your fellows and seek to hide you here  no i am not a murderer  what then  are you desirous of becoming one and making me your victim asked the hunter with a look of contempt for you will find that no easy job stout though you be  i have a good mind to crack your crown for coming here to disturb my solitude  two can play at that game replied bladud with a seraphic smile but i am truly a man of peace  i merely want to look after your cattle for occupation i will gladly live in the woods away from your dwelling if you will let me serve youmy sole desire being like your own to liveand if need be to diealone  for a few moments there was a softened expression on the hunters face as he asked in a tone that had something almost of sympathy in it  is there a woman at the bottom of this  no  woman has nothing to do with itat least not exactlynot directly returned bladud  hah exclaimed the man paying no regard to the modification implied in the answer and advancing a step with eager look did she tempt you on and then deceive you and scorn you and forsake you for another man  you mistake me  the poor woman i was thinking of was an old one labouring under a deadly disease  on hearing this the hunters softened look vanished and his former scowl returned  go he said sternly i can take care of the cattle myself without help  but stay a man of your peaceful nature and humility may perchance not be too proud to take charge of pigs  bladud flushednot so much because of the proposal as the tone of contempt in which it was uttered but remembering his condition and his object he mastered his feelings  i am willing to take charge of your pigs he said in a quiet tone where do they feed  a goodish bit from here  not far from the hot swamp that lies on the other side of the hill  the man pointed to a high ridge just visible beyond the gully in which his hut lay concealed which was clothed from base to summit with dense forest  there are plenty of pigs there he continued in a milder tone  how many i dont know and dont care  i brought the old ones here and they have multiplied  if you choose to keep them together you are welcome  i want only a few of them now and then  when i do i hunt them together and drive them with my dogs  you may kill and eat of them as you please but dont come nigh my hut mind you else will i put an arrow in your heart  good i will take care returned the prince gravely  and if you come nigh my dwelling is it understood that i am to put an arrow in your heart  i could easily do it for i am a fair marksman  something approaching almost to a smile crossed the hunters swart visage at this reply  it did not last however  go he said  keep your jesting for the pigs if they have a mind to listen  i will try them  mayhap they are more sociable than their owner  and now master might i ask for the loan of one of your dogs  it might be useful in herding  none of them would follow you  yetyes the pup might do so  it has not yet come to care for me much  so saying the man went to the rear of his hut and from the kennel there fetched a young but fullgrown dog somewhat resembling a retriever which gambolled joyously at the prospect of being let out for a run  there take him  he comes of a good breed  keep the leash on his neck till you have given him his first feed hell follow you after that  what is his name asked the prince  no name  like his master in that  taking the leash in his hand bladud said farewell and went away into the woods while the hunter of the swamp turning round stooped as he entered his hut and shut the door behind him  it may seem strange that the prince should thus voluntarily seek for menial occupation but in truth he shrank from the idea of living absolutely to himself alone and felt a strong desire to have some sort of responsibility in connection with a human being however short his life on earth might be or however uncouth the individual with whom he might have to dofor man is intensely social as only those who have dwelt in absolute solitude can thoroughly understand  chapter nineteen  prince bladud takes possession of his estate and begins business  pondering over the circumstances of the strange being from whom he had just parted bladud proceeded to the summit of the hill or ridge of high land on the other side of which lay the region in which he had made up his mind to end his days  it took him full two hours to make his way through the dense underwood to the top but when this point was reached the magnificent panorama of land and water which met his view was a feast to his eyes which for a time caused him to forget his forlorn condition  in all directions wherever he gazed ridges and knolls covered with dense woods and richest vegetation were seen extending from his elevated outlook to the distant horizon  cliffs precipices dells and bright green open spaces varied the landscape and in the bottom of the great valley which lay immediately beneath his feet there meandered a broad river in whose waters were reflected here and there the overhanging trees or green patches of its flowerbespangled banks or the rich browns and yellows of spots where these banks had been broken away by floods while elsewhere were seen glittering patches of the blue sky  far away in the extreme distance a soft cloud of thin transparent vapour hung steadily over a partially open space which he rightly conjectured to be the hot swamp of which he had often heard wondrous stories in his boyhood but which he had not been permitted to visit owing to the tribes living near the springs having been at war with his father during his absence in the east king hudibras had attacked and almost exterminated the tribes in question so that the hot swamp region just at the time when the prince arrived was a land of desolation  though desolate however it was as we have tried to show exceeding lovely so that our wanderer was ravished with the prospect and seated himself on a bank near the top of the ridge to contemplate its beauties in detail  his canine companion sat down beside him and looked up inquiringly in his face  during the first part of the journey the pup had strained a good deal at the leash and had displayed a strong desire to return to its former master as well as a powerful objection to follow its new one  it had also with that perversity of spirit not uncommon in youth exhibited a proneness to advance on the other side of bushes and trees from its companion thus necessitating frequent halts and numerous disentanglements  on all of these occasions bladud had remonstrated in tones so soft and had rectified the error so gently that the pup was evidently impressed  possibly it was an observant pup and appreciated the advantages of human kindness  perhaps it was a sagacious pup and already recognised the difference between the old master and the new  be this as it may bladud had not been long seated there in a state of dreamy abstraction when he became conscious of the inquiring look returning it with interest but without speaking he gazed steadily into the soft brown eyes that were turned up to his  at last the prince opened his lips and the dog turning his head slightly to one side with a look of expectancy cocked his ears  browneyes he said youll grow to be a fine dog if you live  there was the slightest possible tremor in the pups tail  of course there might have been more than a tremor if the caudal appendage had been at liberty instead of being sat upon  it was enough however to indicate a tendency to goodwill  come here browneyes said bladud holding out his hand  but the pup was hardly prepared for such a complete and sudden concession as the invitation implied  he repeated the tremor however and turned his head to the other side by way of a change but sat still  a happy thought occurred to the princejustifying the remark of solomon that there is nothing new under the sun  he opened his wallet took out a small piece of meat and held it out  here brownie have a bit  another justification of solomon for the natural abbreviation of names is not new  the pup advanced with confidence ate the morsel and looked inquiringly for more at the same time wagging its tail with unqualified satisfaction  yes brownie you shall have more  the second morsel was bestowed the tail wagged effusively the name of brownie became irrevocably associated with food and a loving look and tone with favours to come  thus a title and a friendship were established which endured through life and was terminated only by death so trivial sometimes are the incidents on which the great events of life are hinged  we pause here to deprecate the idea that this fine animals affection was gained through its stomach  many a time had its old master thrown it savoury junks and bones of food but a scowl and sometimes a growl had often been thrown into the mess thereby robbing the gift of all grace and checking the outflow of affection  bladuds character similarly was as clearly perceived by the manner of his gifts  indeed it would have been a poor compliment to the intelligence of brownieor of any dog young or oldto suppose it capable of misunderstanding the gentle tone the kindly glance and the patting hand of bladud  at all events the result was that brownie with an expressive wag and bark vowed fidelity from that date to the prince and in the same act renounced allegiance to the hunter of the hot swamp  from that date too the master and the dog entered upon and kept up at frequent though brief intervals a species of conversation or mental intercourse which if not profound was equal to much that passes for intercourse among men and was at all events a source of eminent satisfaction to both  removing the leash bladud descended the hill with brownie gambolling delightedly round him  that night they slept together under the spreading branches of a magnificent oak  there was no need to keep watch against wild beasts for brownie slept as it were with one eye open and the slightest symptom of curiosity among the wild fraternity was met by a growl so significant that the wouldbe intruder sheered off  the sun was high when the prince awoke and arose from his bed of leaves the pup although awake long before had dutifully lain still abiding his masters time  it now arose and shook itself yawned and looked up with an expression of what next  having lighted a fire bladud set up the carcase of a wild duck to roast  he had shot it the day before on his way to the valley of the swamp  as this was a proceeding in which the pup had a prospective interest he sat by attentively  ah  brownie said his master sitting down to wait for the cooking of the bird you little know what a sad life awaits you  no companionship but that of a doomed man and i fear you will be a poor nurse when the end comes though assuredly you will not be an unsympathetic one  but it may be long before the end  thats the worst of it  come have a bit  he threw him a leg as he spoke and the two breakfasted peacefully together on the banks of the shining river slaking their thirst after it was finished at the same pure stream  while doing so the prince observed with satisfaction that large trout were rising freely and that several flocks of wild ducks and other aquatic birds passed both up and down the river  now brownie he said when the meal was concluded you and i must search for a convenient spot on which to build our hut  before starting off however he uncovered his shoulder and looked anxiously at the white spot  it was as obvious as ever but did not seem to him increased since he left home  a very slight matter will sometimes give hope to a despairing man  under the influence of this negative comfort bladud took up his weapons and sallied forth closely followed by the pup  in the haste of departure and the depressed state of his mind he had as has been said forgotten his sword or deliberately left it behind him the only weapon he now possessed besides the bow and arrows given to him by the hebrew was a small bronze hatchet which was however of little use for anything except cutting down small trees and branches for firewood  he carried a little knife also in his girdle but it was much too small to serve the purpose of an offensive weapon though it was well suited to skin wild animals and cut up his food  as for his staff or clubit might be of use in a contest with men but would be of little service against bears or wolves  casting it aside therefore he cut for himself a ponderous oaken staff about five feet long at one end of which there was a heavy knotted mass that gave it great weight the other end he sharpened to a fine point  this formidable weapon he purposed to wield with both hands when using it as a club while if need should arise he might also use it as a spear  i was foolish brownie he remarked while rounding off the head of this club to leave my good sword behind me for though i have no desire to kill men there may arise a needbe to kill bears  however it cannot be helped and verily this little thing will be a pretty fair substitute  he twirled the little thing round his head with one hand in a way that would have rejoiced the heart of a modern irishman had he been there to see and induced the pup to jump aside in surprise with his tail between his legs  a few minutes later and he was striding over the beautiful land in all directions examining and taking possession as it were of his fair domain  in passing over a knoll which was crowned by several magnificent oaks they came suddenly on a family of black pigs which were luxuriating on the acorns that covered the ground  my future care muttered the prince with a grim smile for he hardly believed in the truth of all he was going through and almost expected to awake and find it was a dream  the pigs headed by a huge old boar caught sight of the intruders at the same time and stood for a moment or two grunting in stolid astonishment  with all the gaiety of inexperience the pup went at them singlehanded causing the whole herd to turn and fly with earsplitting screamsthe old boar bringing up the rear and looking round out of the corner of his little eyes with wicked intent  bladud knowing the danger sprang after them shouting to the pup to come back  but brownies warspirit had been aroused and his training in obedience had only just begun  in a moment he was alongside the boar which turned its head and gave him a savage rip with a gleaming tusk  fortunately it just barely reached the pups flank which it cut slightly but quite enough to cause him to howl with anger and pain  before the boar could repeat the operation bladud sent his club whizzing in advance of him  it was well aimed  the heavy head alighted just above the root of the boars curly tail  instantly as if anticipating the inventions of the future fifty steam whistles seemed to burst into full cry  the other pigs in sympathetic alarm joined in chorus and thus yelling inconceivably they plunged into a thicket and disappeared  bladud almost fell to the ground with laughing while brownie in no laughing mood came humbly forward to claim and receive consolation but he received more than consolation for while the prince was engaged in binding up the wound he poured upon him such a flood of solemn remonstrance in a tone of such injured feeling that the pup was evidently cut to the hearthis selfcondemned appealing looks proving beyond a doubt that the meaning of what was said was plain to him though the language might be obscure  on continuing the march brownie limped behind his mastera sadder and a wiser dog  they had not gone far when they came on another family of pigs which fled as before  a little further on another herd was discovered wallowing in a marshy spot  it seemed to bladud that there was no good feeding in that place and that the creatures were dirtying themselves with no obvious end in view so with the pups rather unwilling assistance he drove them to more favourable ground where the acorns were abundant  at this point he reached a secluded part of the valley or rather an offshoot from it where a low precipice rose on one side and thick flowering shrubs protected the other  the spot was considerably elevated above the level of the low ground and from an opening in the shrubbery at the further extremity could be seen the larger valley with all its wealth of forest and meadow its knolls and slopes and wooded uplands with the river winding like a silver thread throughout its whole extent  here the prince resolved to fix his abode and not a little pleased with the successful way in which he had commenced his amateur pigherding he set vigorously and patiently to work with the little bronze hatchet to fell such trees as would be required in the construction of his future home  chapter twenty  a strange abode and a wild visitor  bladuds idea of a palace worthy of a prince was not extravagant  he erected it in three days without assistance or tools except the bronze axe and knifebrownie acting the part of superintendent of the works until it was finished he slept with the forest trees for a shelter and the sky for a canopy  the edifice was nothing better than a small hut or booth constructed of long branches bent in the shape of semihoops the ends of which were thrust into the ground  the whole was thatched with dried grass and bound down with ropes made of the same material  it was further secured against the possible influence of high winds by heavy branches being laid across it and weighted with stones  dried grass also formed the carpeting on the floor  of course it was not so high that its architect could stand up in it but he could sit in it erect and could lie down at full length without showing his heels outside  there was no door but one end was left unfinished as a substitute  neither was there a fireplace the space in front sufficing for a kitchen  while engaged in its erection bladud was too busy to indulge in gloomy thoughts but as soon as it was finished and he had lain down to rest under its shade the terrible almost incredible nature of his position rushed upon him in full force  the opening of the hut had been so arranged as to present a view of the widespreading valley and he gazed upon scenes of surpassing loveliness in which all the sights that met the eye breathed of beauty and repose while the sounds that broke upon the ear were suggestive of bird and beast revelling in the enjoyment of the gifts and sunshine of a bountiful creator  but such sights and sounds only enhanced the misery of the poor man and he started up after a few minutes contemplation and rushed outside in the vain hope of escaping from his misery by energetic action  this will drive me mad he thought as he paused and stood for a few minutes irresolute  better far to return to the east where tyrants reign and people dare not call body and soul their own and die fighting in the front rank for libertybutbutwho would let me join them knowing my disease  unclean  i may not even come within touch of my kind  his head sank on his breast and he tried to banish thought altogether at the same moment his eyes met the meek patient look of brownie  ah pup he exclaimed stooping to fondle the soft brown head as he muttered to himself you teach me a lesson and put me to shame despite your want of speech  you are awaiting my commands ready to give unquestioning obediencewhether to go to the right or left or to lie down  and here am i not only a prince but supposed to be a reasoning man rebelling against the decree of my makermy spiritfather  surely there must be one who called my spirit into beingelse had i never been for i could not create myself and it must be his will that i am smittenand for a good end else he were not good  for a few minutes longer he continued to meditate in silence  then he turned quickly and picked up the axe which lay at the entrance of the hut  come pup he cried cheerfully you and i must build another house you see we shall have plenty of game and venison soon to guard from the wolves and it would be disagreeable to keep it in the palace along with ourselveswouldnt it  so come along brownie  thus appealed to the pup gave its assent by some violent tail activities and in a few minutes had resumed its former post as superintendent of the works while its master toiled like a second samson in the hope of driving mental distress away through the pores of his skin  he was not indeed altogether unsuccessful for so intimate is the mysterious connection between spirit and matter that he felt comparative reliefeven to the extent of cheerfulnesswhen the muscles were in violent action and the perspiration was streaming down his brow but when the second hut or larder was completed his depression returned in greater power than before  then he took to hunting with tremendous energy a plan which was highly approved of by his canine companion  he also devoted himself to his specific duties as swineherd collected the animals from all quarters into several large herds counted them as well as he could and drove them to suitable feedinggrounds  on retiring each day from this work into which he threw all his power he felt so fatigued as to be quite ready for supper and bed  gradually he became accustomed to the life and at length after a considerable time of it a feeling of resignation to his fate began to tell upon him  the effect of prolonged solitude also began even to numb the powers of his mind  he was fully aware of this and tried to shake it off for he shuddered more at the thought of mental than of physical decay  among other things he took to talking more frequently to brownie but although the pup was in many respects a most valuable and sympathetic companion he could not prevent the conversation from being rather onesided  by degrees the summer merged into autumn the foliage assumed the tints of green and gold  then it became russet and finally the cold bleak winds of a northern winter shrieked through the valley and swept the leaves away  during all this time no human being had gone near that region or paid the forlorn prince a visit except once when the hunter of the hot swamp made his appearance  the rebellious tribes retained too vivid a recollection of the slaughter that had taken place during and after the fight with king hudibras to risk a second encounter with that monarch so that the place was at that time absolutely deserted by human beingsthough it was sufficiently peopled by the lower animals  on the occasion when the hunter unexpectedly appeared he demanded of bladud an account of his stewardship  the report was so satisfactory that the hunter became for him quite amiable commended his swineherd and drove off a number of the pigs to market  on his return laden with the few household goods for which he had bartered them he paid the prince another visit and even condescended to accept an invitation to enter his hut and partake of a roast of venison which was at the time being prepared for the midday meal  he was still however very brusque and taciturn  no one has been near me during the whole summer or autumn but yourself observed bladud with an involuntary sigh  you must be pleased at that returned the hunter sharply you said you came here for solitude  truly i did but i had not thought it would be so hard to bear  why do you seek it then if you dont like it asked the hunter in the same brusque impatient manner which characterised all his words and actions  i am forced to seek it by a power which may not be resisted with impunity  there is no such power exclaimed the hunter with a wild demoniac laugh  i can resist any powerall powers  there is nothing that i cannot resist and overcome  the gigantic man with his dishevelled locks and shaggy beard looked so fierce and powerful as he sat on the opposite side of the fire glaring at his host that bladud became impressed with a hope that the maniac for such he evidently waswould not attempt to prove his resistless power there and then  in order to avert such a catastrophe he assumed an air of the most perfect ease and indifference to the boast and asked him with a bland smile if he would have another slice of venison  the hunter seemed to be disconcerted by the question but being a hungry man and a ravenous eater he accepted the offer and began to eat the slice in moody silence  your good pup has been a real blessing to me resumed the prince a few minutes later during which time he had devoted himself to his own portion of food not only in the way of helping me to hunt and drive the pigs but as a companion who can do all but speak  he could speak if you would let him returned the hunter  i speak to my dogs continually and they always answernot with their tongues for that is not doglanguage but with their eyesand i know every word they speak  you would wonder how clever they are and what droll things they say sometimes  he burst into a wild hilarious laugh at this point as if the thought of the canine pleasantries were too much for him then suddenly became grave and scowled furtively at his host as if he felt that he had committed himself  you are right replied bladud affecting not to observe the scowl my pup often speaks to me with his eyes but i am not so good at understanding the language as you appear to be  no doubt i shall acquire it in time  then you dont like being alone said the hunter after a pause during which bladud saw that he was eyeing him keenly though he pretended not to observe this  no i dont like it at all but it cant be helped  well it might have been helped for i could have sent them to you  sent whom  a man and a boy  they were not together but came to my hut at different times inquiring for you but knowing your desire for solitude i turned them away on the wrong scent  im glad you did returned the prince for i want to be troubled by neither man nor boy  yet i wonder who they could be  did they say why they wanted to find me  no they did not say and i would not ask what cared i about their reasons  yet you care enough for me it appears to say you would have sent them to me if you knew i had been lonely  what was the appearance of the man  he was old but very strong though not so big as meor you  his hair was long and white so was his beard  he wore a long dark robe and carried a very big staff  bladud had no difficulty in recognising the description of his friend the hebrew  and the boy what was he like  like all boys active and impudent  i am afraid returned the prince with a slight smile that your acquaintance with boys cannot have been extensivethey are not all active and impudent  most of those that have crossed my path are so  at all events this one was for when i pointed out the direction you had gonewhich was just the opposite way from herehe said i dont believe you and when i leaped on him to give him his deserts he dodged me and fled into the woods like a squirrel  it was as well for i should have killed him  i am not sorry he escaped you then said bladud with a laugh though i scarcely think you would have killed the poor lad even if you had caught him  oh yes i would  and ill kill you if you venture to doubt my word  as he said this the hunter sprang to his feet and drawing his knife seemed about to leap upon his host who however sat perfectly still  i should be sorry that you should die said bladud in a calm voice while he kept his eyes steadily fixed on those of the maniac  you have heard have you not of that terrible disease of the east called leprosy  yesthe shipcaptains have often spoken of it said the madman whose mind like that of a child could be easily turned into new channels  look  i have got that disease  the power which you profess to despise has sent it to me  if you so much as touch me your doom is fixed  he uncovered his shoulder as he spoke and displayed the white spot  bladud felt quite uncertain how this would be received by the madman but he was scarcely prepared for what followed  no sooner did the hunter see the spot and realise what it meant than without a word he turned caught up his bundle uttered a yell of terror and fled from the spot closely followed by his dogs which howled as if in sympathy  chapter twenty one  a strange encounter and a friend in need  about a week after the events narrated in the last chapter an incident occurred which trifling in itself was nevertheless the cause of momentous issues in the life of our hero  he was returning one evening from a long ramble with his dog when the screams of a pig in evident distress attracted his attention  hastening to the place he found that a small member of his charge had fallen over a cliff into a crevice in the rock where it stuck fast and was unable to extricate itself  the violent nature of the porcine family is well known  although very little hurt this little pig felt its position so unbearable that it immediately filled the woods with agonising shrieks until bladud dragged it out of the cleft and carried it in his arms to the foot of the precipice where he set it free  then the whirlwind of its outcry came to a sudden stop thereby proving beyond a doubt that passion not pain was the cause of its demonstrations  from that date many of the pigs became affected by a cutaneous disease which gradually spread among all the herds  it was some time before bladud observed this but when he did notice it he jumped at once to the conclusion that he must have communicated leprosy to his unfortunate herds while rescuing the little pig  whether or not he was right in this conjecture we cannot say but the probability of his mere touch being so contaminating was sufficient to increase greatly the depression of spirits which had been stealing over hima condition which was not a little aggravated by the fact that the white spot on his arm was slowly but surely spreading  still the disease had not so far affected his general health or strength in any serious degree  about that time there set in a long period of fine sunny weather during which bladud busied himself in hunting and drying meat as well as fish which he stored in his larder for future use  he also cut a large quantity of firewood and built another booth in which to protect it from the weather and otherwise made preparation for the winter when it should arrive  one day he had wandered a considerable way into the forest and was about to turn to retrace his steps homeward when he was surprised to hear some creature crashing through the woods towards him  it could not have been startled by himself else it would have run away from him stepping behind a tree he strung his bow called brownie close to his heel and waited  a few seconds later a deer dashed close past him but as his belt was already hung round with game and home was still far distant he did not shoot  besides he was curious to know what had startled the deer  a few minutes revealed that for suddenly the sound of footsteps was heard then the bushes opposite were parted and a boy or youth just emerging from boyhood ran past him at full speed with an arrow sticking through his left sleeve  he was unarmed and gasped like one who runs for his life  catching sight of the prince as he passed the tree that had concealed him the boy doubled like a hare ran up to bladud and grasping one of his hands criedo save mesave me from robbers in the most agonising tones  that will i poor lad if i can  he had barely time to make this reply when a man burst from the shrubbery on the other side of the tree and almost plunged into his arms  so close was he and so unexpected the meeting that the prince had not time or space to use his bow but saluted the mans forehead with such an olympic crack from his fist that he fell prone upon the ground and remained there  bladud had dropped his bow in the act but his club leant handily against the tree  catching it up he wheeled round just in time to face three tall and strong men with bows in their hands  seeing their leader on the ground they simultaneously discharged three arrows which were well aimed and struck the prince full on the chest but they did not penetrate far for in anticipation of some such possible encounter with foes he had covered his chest with a breastplate of thick doubleply hide which effectually checked them  before they could draw other arrows bladud rushed at them with a terrific shout hurling his mighty club in advance  the weapon caught the nearest robber full in the chest and laid him flat on the grass the other two dropping their bows turned and fled  guard them brownie cried bladud as he followed  the dog obediently took up a position between the two fallen men and eyed them in a way and with an ominous growl that meant mischief if they dared to stir  bladud easily overtook the other two grasped them by their necks and using their heads as batteringrams rapped them together  they sank halfstunned upon their knees and begged for mercy  you shall have it said bladud on the condition that you go and tell your comrades that if they ever come within twenty miles of the swamp they shall find a man in the woods who will turn them inside out and roast them all alive  away  they went precipitately as may be readily believed and as the prince had intended spread a report that gave to him thenceforth the rank of a sorcerer and secured him from future annoyance  returning to the tree bladud found the fallen robbers beginning to recover consciousnessthe one being held in submission by the fugitive youth who stood bow in hand pointing an arrow at his throat the other by brownie who merely curled his nose displayed his magnificent teeth and uttered a low growl of remonstrance  get up he said to the one he had knocked down with his fist  but as the order was not obeyed with sufficient promptitude he lifted the man up by the collar like a kitten and sent him staggering against the tree with a violence that astounded him  calling off the dog he gave a similar order to the second robber who displayed much greater agility in his movements  repeating the little threat with which he had dismissed their comrades bladud ordered them to be off  the second robber thankfully turned and took to his heels but the first stooped to pick up his bow whereupon bladud wrenched it from his grasp broke it over his head and belaboured him with the wreck for a couple of hundred yards through the woods while the robber ran as if he thought the evil spirit was at his heels  returning somewhat blown from this unusual exercise he found the youth in a state of great amusement and satisfaction  hah you may laugh my lad but i can assure you it would have been no laughing matter if these scoundrels had caught you  you speak but the sober truth returned the boy still smiling for well assured am i that it would have cost me my life if they had caught me  but believe me i am not only pleased to see such villains get a little of what they deserve but am exceedingly grateful to you for so kindly and effectually coming to my aid  as to that i would aid any one in distressespecially if pursued by robbers  but come sit down and tell me how you fell into their power this bout has winded me a little  i will sit down on this bank do you sit on the bank opposite to me  the explanation is simple and short replied the boy i wanted to have my own way like most other boys so i left home without leave or saying farewell  that was bad said the prince shaking his head  he was on the point of advancing some profitable reflections on this head but the memory of his own boyhood checked him  i know it was bad and assuredly i have been well punished returned the boy for these robbers caught me and have kept me with them for a long time so long that i have quite lost count of the days now  does your father live far from here  yes very very far and i know not where to go or what to do answered the boy with a pitiful look  never mind you are safe at present and no doubt i shall find means of having you sent safe homethough i see not the way just yet  is that blood on your coat asked the lad anxiously as he pointed to the princes breast  it is  the arrowheads must have gone through the breastplate and scratched the skin  i will look to it  let me help you said the boy rising and approaching  back you know not what you do said the prince sternly  you must not touch me  you have done so once today  it may cost you your life ask not why but obey my orders  not less surprised at the nature of these remarks than at the severe tone in which they were uttered the boy reseated himself in silence while bladud removed the breastplate and examined his wounds  they were deeper than he had imagined the three arrowheads being half imbedded in his flesh  nothing serious he said drawing out the heads and stanching the flow of blood with a little moss  come now i will show you my home and give you something to eat before you tell me more of your history  you shall have a couch in one of my outhouses  have a care as you walk with me that you do not come against me or touch me even with a finger  my reasons you may not know butremember what i say  bladud spoke the last words with the severity that he had assumed before then dismissing the subject he commented on the beauty of the landscape the wickedness of robbers the liveliness of animated nature and things in general with the cheerful air that had been habitual to him before he was compelled to flee the face of man  the pleasure he had felt in his brief intercourse with the gruff hunter of the swamp had remained a bright spot in his lonely life  he naturally enjoyed with much greater zest the company of the lively boy who had thus unexpectedly crossed his path but when he retired for the nighthaving told the lad to make for himself a couch in the firewood hutthe utter desolation of his life became if possible more deeply impressed on him  during the night his wounds inflamed and became much more painful and in the morningwhether from this cause or not we cannot sayhe found himself in a high fever  his new friend like most healthy boys was a profound sleeper and when the time for breakfast arrived he found it necessary to get up and awake him  ho lad rise he cried at the entrance to the firewood hut you slumber soundly  come out and help me to get ready our morning meal  the lad obeyed at once  what is your name he asked as the lad appeared  cormac he replied  well cormac do you roast the meat this morning  truly it seems that you have come just in the nick of time for i feel so ill that my head seems like a lump of stone and my skin is burning  it is not often that i have had to ask the aid of man in such matters  will you get me a draught of water from the spring hard by  i will lie down again for a little  cormac willingly ran to a neighbouring spring and filled thereat a cup made of the bark of the birch tree with which he returned to bladuds hut  just put it inside the door where i can reach it shouted the prince do not enter on any account  lifting a corner of the skin that covered the entrance the lad placed the cup inside and then sitting down by the fire outside proceeded to prepare breakfast  when it was ready he called to bladud to say whether he would have some at the same time thrusting a savoury rib underneath the curtain but the prince declined it  i cannot eat he said let me lie and rest if possible  my poor boy this is inhospitable treatment  yet i cannot help it  never mind me returned cormac lightly  i like to nurse the sick and ill keep you well supplied with water and cook venison or birds too if you want them  i can even shoot them if required  no need for that returned bladud there is plenty of food laid up for winter  but dont come inside my hut remember  it will be death if you do  all that day the lad sat by the fire or went to the well for water of which his patient drank continuously  during the night the prince was very restless and groaned a good deal so the boy resolved to sit up and watch by the fire  next morning bladud was delirious and as he could not rise even to fetch from the door the water for which he thirsted cormac resolved to disobey orders and risk the consequences entering the hut therefore and sitting down beside the patient he tended him for many days and nightstaking what rest he could obtain by snatches beside the campfire  chapter twenty two  the pigs cure  it was not long before our hero recovered from his delirium  leading as he had been doing an abstemious and healthy life ordinary disease could not long maintain its grasp of him  his superabundant life seemed to cast it off with the ease with which his physical frame was able to cast aside human foes  but he could not thus shake off the leprosy  one of the first things he did on recovering consciousness was to uncover his arm  the fatal spot had increased considerably in size with something of a shudder he looked round his little hut endeavouring to remember where he was and to recall recent events  he was alone at the time and he fancied the fight with the robbers and rescue of the boy must have been all a dream  the name cormac however puzzled him not a little  many a time before that had he dreamed of vivid scenes and thrilling incidents but never in his recollection had he dreamt a name  being thoughtfully disposed he lay meditating listlessly on this point in that tranquil frame of mind which often accompanies convalescence and had almost fallen asleep when a slight noise outside awoke him  the curtaindoor was lifted and cormac entering sat quietly down on a block of wood beside him  bladud became suddenly aware that he had not been dreaming but he did not move  through his slightly opened eyelids he watched the lad while he mixed some berries in a cup of water  as he lay thus silently observant he was deeply impressed with the handsome countenance of his nurse and the graceful movements of his slight figure  presently the thought of his disease recurred to himit was seldom indeed absent from his mindand the strict injunctions which he had given to his young companion  boyboy he cried suddenly with a vigour that caused the boy to start off his seat and almost capsize the cup did i not forbid you to enter my hut or to touch me  at first cormac looked alarmed but seeing that a decided change for the better had taken place in his patient his brow smoothed and he laughed softly  how dared you to disobey me exclaimed bladud again in stern tones  i dared because i saw you were unable to prevent me returned the lad with a quiet smile  besides you were too ill to feed yourself so of course i had to do it for you  do you suppose i am so ungrateful to the man who saved my life as to stand aside and let him die for want of a helping hand  come now be reasonable and let me give you this drink  he approached as he spoke  keep offkeep off i say shouted the prince in a voice so resolute that cormac was fain to obey  it is bad enough to come into my hut but you must not touch me  why noti have touched you already  how when  i have lifted your head many a time to enable you to drink when you could not lift it yourself  a groan escaped bladud  then it is too late  look at this he cried suddenly uncovering his arm  what is that asked the boy with a look of curiosity  it isleprosy  i am not afraid of leprosy  not afraid of it exclaimed the prince that may well be for you have the air of one who fears nothing but it will kill you for all that unless the maker of all defends you for it is a dreada terribledisease that no strength can resist or youth throw off  it undermines the health and eats the flesh off the bones renders those whom it attacks horrible to look at and in the end it kills them  but it is possible that you may not yet have caught the infection poor lad so you must keep away from me now and let not a finger touch me henceforth  your life i say may depend on it  i will obey you as to that replied cormac now that you are beginning to recover but i must still continue to put food and water within your reach  be it so rejoined the prince turning away with a slight groan for his excitement not less than the conversation had exhausted him  in a few minutes more he was asleep with an expression of profound anxiety stereotyped on his countenance  it was not long after the fever left him that returning strength enabled bladud to crawl out of his hut and soon after that he was able to ramble through the woods in company with cormac and with browniethat faithful friend who had lain by his masters side during all his illness  the sparkling river gladdened the eyes and the bracing air and sunshine strengthened the frame of the prince so that with the cheerful conversation of cormac and the gambols of his canine friend he was sometimes led to forget for a time the dark cloud that hung over him  one day he was struck by something in the appearance of his dog and sitting down on a bank he called it to him  after a few minutes careful examination he turned to cormac with a look of deep anxiety  my boy he said i verily believe that the hound is smitten with my own complaint  in his faithful kindness he has kept by me until i have infected him  that cannot be returned cormac for during my rambles alone when you were too ill to move i saw that a great many of the pigs were affected by a skin disease something like that on the dog and you know you could not have infected the pigs for you have never touched them  bladuds anxiety was not removed but deepened when he heard this for he called to remembrance the occasion when he had rescued one of the little pigs and carried it for some distance in his arms  and do you know continued the lad i have observed a strange thing i have seen that many of the pigs affected with this complaint have gone down to the place where the hot waters rise and after bathing there have returned all covered with mud and these pigs seem to have got better of the disease while many of those which did not go down to the swamp have died  that is strange indeed returned the prince i must see to this for if these waters cure the pigs why not the dog  ay rejoined cormac and why not the man  because my disease is well known to be incurable  are you sure  we can hardly be sure of anything not even of killing our midday meal rejoined the prince  see there goes a bird that is big enough to do for both of us  try your hand  that will be but losing an opportunity for as you know i am not a good marksman returned the youth fitting an arrow quickly to his bow nevertheless and discharging it  although the bird in question was large and not far off the arrow missed the mark but startled the bird so that it took wing  before it had risen a yard from the ground however an arrow from bladuds bow transfixed it  that night after the bird had been eaten when brownie was busy with the scraps and cormac had retired to his couch in the firewood booth bladud lay in his hut unable to sleep because of what he had heard and seen that day  hope springs eternal in the human breastnot less in the olden time than now  at all events it welled up in the breast of the royal outcast with unusual power as he waited anxiously for the first dawn of day  up to this time although living within a few miles of it the prince had not paid more than one or two visits to the hot swamp because birds and other game did not seem to inhabit the place and the ground was difficult to traverse  he had of course speculated a good deal as to the cause of the springs but had not come to any conclusions more satisfactory than have been arrived at by the scientific minds of modern days  that heat of some sort was the cause applied in one fashion or another to the water so as to make it almost boil he had no manner of doubt but what caused the heat he could not imagine and it certainly did not occur to him that the interior of the earth was a lake of fire the lovely world of vision being a mere crust  at least if it did he was never heard to say so  but now he went down to the swamp with a renewed feeling of hope that gave fresh impulse to his heart and elasticity to his tread  arrived at the place he observed that numbers of his porcine family were there before him  on seeing him they retreated with indignant gruntstheir hasty retreat being accelerated by a few remarks from brownie  making his way to what he believed to be the main fountain of the spring the prince and the dog stood contemplating it for some time then the former dipped his hand in but instantly withdrew it for he found the water to be unbearably hot  following its course however and testing it as he went along he soon came to a spot where the temperature was sufficiently cool to render it agreeable  here finding a convenient hole big enough to hold him he stripped and bathed brownie who seemed much interested and enlivened by his masters proceedings joined him on invitation and appeared to enjoy himself greatly  thereafter they returned home to breakfast and found cormac already up and roasting venison ribs before the fire  i thought you were still sound asleep in your hut he said in surprise as they came up and i have been doing my best to make little noise for fear of awaking you  have you been bathing at the springs i see the hounds coat is muddy  thanks for your care cormac  ay we have indeed had a bathbrownie and i  you see i have taken your advice and am trying the pigs cure  right bladud  wiser men have learned lessons from pigs  are you not presumptuous my lad to suggest that there may be a wiser man than i  truly no for taking the advice of a mere stripling like me is not a sign of wisdom in a man  in the present case you are perhaps right but there are some striplings whose wisdom is sufficient to guide men  however i will hope that even you with all your presumption may be right this time  that encourages me to offer additional advice retorted the lad with a laugh namely that you should devote your attention to these ribs for you will find them excellent and even a fullgrown man can hardly fail to know that without food no cure can be effected  you are right my boy  sit down and set me an example for youth not less than age must be supported  without more words they set to work first throwing a bone to the hound in order as bladud remarked that they might all start on equal terms  from that day the health of the prince began to mendslowly but steadily the spot on his arm also began to diminish and to assume a more healthy aspect  brownie also became convalescent and much to the joy of bladud cormac showed no symptoms of having caught the disease still as a precaution they kept studiously apart and the prince observedand twitted the boy with the factthat the more he gained in health and the less danger there was of infection the more anxious did he seem to be to keep away from him  things were in this state when one evening they received a visit which claims a new chapter to itself  chapter twenty three  in which very perplexing events occur  the visitor referred to in the last chapter was a tall broadshouldered old man with a snowy head of hair and a flowing white beard a long loose black garment and a stout staff about six feet long  cormac had gone to a spring for water at the time he arrived and bladud was lying on his back inside his hut  is any one within demanded the stranger lifting a corner of the curtain  enter not here whoever you are replied the prince quickly springing upstayi will come out to you  you are wonderfully inhospitable returned the stranger as the prince issued from the hut and stood up with an inquiring look which suddenly changed to one of astonishment  beniah he exclaimed  even so replied the hebrew holding out his hand but bladud drew back  what will you neither permit me to enter your house nor shake your hand  i was not so churlish when you visited my dwelling  you know well old man that i do not grudge hospitality but fear to infect you  yes i know it well rejoined the hebrew smiling and knowing that you were here i turned aside on my journey to inquire as to your welfare  i have much to say about my welfare and strange things to tell you but first let me know what has brought you to this part of the landfor if you have turned aside to see meseeing me has not been your main object  you are right  yet it pleases me well to use this opportunity and to see by your looks and bearing that the disease seems to have been arrested  yes thanks be to the allseeing one i am well or nearly so  but proceed to explain the reason of your journey  the cause of it is the unaccountable disappearance of the girl named branwen  what she who is the bosom friend of my sister hafrydda  the same  she had fled you may remember from your fathers court for fear of being compelled to wed with gunrig the chief whose crown you cracked so deftly on the day of your arrival  she poor thing took refuge at first with me  i hid her for some time  then interrupted the prince she must have been hidden in your hut at the time of my visit  she was  but that was no business of yours  surely it was old man for my fathers business is my business  yea but it was not my business to enlighten you or the king either while i had reason to know that he meant unduly to coerce the maiden however there she was hidden as i tell you  now you are aware that branwens father gadarn is a great chief whose people live far away in the northern part of albion  i bade branwen remain close in my hut in a secret chamber while i should go and acquaint her father with her position and fetch him down with a strong band of his retainers to rescue her  you should have seen the visage of gadarn when i told him the news  a wild boar of the woods could scarce have shown his tusks more fiercely  he not only ordered an armed band to get ready instantly but he roused the whole country around and started off that same day with all his followers armed to the teeth  of course i led them  in due course we arrived at my hut whenlo  i found that the bird was flown  i could see by the appearance of things continued the hebrew that the foolish girl had left of her own will for there was no evidence of violence anywherewhich would doubtless have been the case if robbers had found her and carried her away for they would certainly have carried off some of my goods along with her  the rage of her father on making this discovery was terrible  he threatened at once to cut off my old head and even drew his sword with intent to act the part of executioner  but i reminded him that if he did so he would cut off the only head that knew anything about his daughter and that i had still some knowledge regarding her with which he was not acquainted  this arrested his hand just in time for i actually fancied that i had begun to feel the edge of his sword slicing into my spinal marrow  when he had calmed himself enough to listen i told him that branwen had spoken about paying a visit to the hot springsthat i knew she was bent on going there for some reason that i could not understand and that i thought it more than likely she had gone  axemen to the front  form long line hooroo yelled the chiefor something of that sort for im a man of peace and dont understand warlike orders and away went the whole host at a run winding through the forest like a great snake gadarn and i leading them except when the thickets became impenetrable and then the axemen were ordered to the front and soon broke them down and so in course of time we came within a few miles of the hot swamp andand as i have said i have been permitted to turn aside to visit you  truly a strange tale remarked the prince  and is the armed host of gadarn actually within a few miles of us  it is and to say truth i have come out to search for you chiefly to inquire whether you have seen any young woman at all resembling branwen during your wanderings in this region  the hebrew looked keenly at the prince as he put this question  you forget i have never seen this girl and therefore could not know her even if i had met her  but in truth i have not seen any woman young or old since i came here  nor have i seen any human being save my mad master konar and a poor youth whom i rescued some time ago from the hands of robbers  he has nursed me through a severe illness and is even now with me  but what makes you think that branwen intended to come to the swamp  becausebecause she had reasons of her own  i do not profess to understand the workings of a young girls mind answered the hebrew  and what will you do said bladud now that you find she has not been here  methinks that when gadarn hears of your failure to find her at the swamp your spinal marrow and his sword will still stand a good chance of becoming acquainted  the hebrew looked perplexed but before he could answer brownie came bounding gaily round the corner of the hut  seeing a stranger he stopped suddenly displayed his teeth and growled  down pup  he is not accustomed to visitors you see said his master apologetically  at that moment cormac turned the corner of the hut bearing an earthen jar of water on his shoulder  his eyes opened wide with surprise so did those of the hebrew and the jar dropped to the ground where it broke and brownie quick to see and seize his opportunity began to lap its contents  the princealso wideeyedgazed from one to the other it was a grand tableau vivant  the first to recover himself and break the spell was cormac  leaping forward he grasped the old man by the hand and turning so as to present his back to bladud gave the hebrew a look so powerfully significant that that son of israel was quite disconcerted  my old kind friendis itcan itbe really yourself  so far from homeso unexpected  it makes me so glad to see you said the youth then turning to bladud a very old friend of mine who helped me once in a time of great distress  i am so rejoiced for now he will guide me back to my own home  you know i have sometimes talked of leaving you lately bladud  you say truth my young friend  frequently of late since i have been getting well you have hinted at a wish to go home though you have not yet made it clear to me where that home is and sad will be the day when you quit me  i verily believe that i should have died outright beniah but for the kind care of this amiable lad  but it is selfish of me to wish you to stayespecially now that you have found a friend who it would seem is both able and willing to guard you through the woods in safety  yet now i think my complaint is so nearly cured that i might venture to do that myself  not so returned the lad quickly  you are far from cured yet  to give up using the waters at this stage of the cure would be fatal  it would perhaps let the disease come back as bad as before  nay but the difficulty lies here returned the prince smiling at the boys eagerness  this good old man is at present engaged as guide to an army and dare not leave his post  a foolish girl named branwen fled some time ago from my fathers house intending it is supposed to go to some friends living not far from the hot swamp  they have been searching for her in all directions and at last her father with a host at his heels has been led to within a few miles of this place but the girl has not yet been discovered so the search will doubtless be continued  is that so asked cormac of the hebrew pointedly  it is so  what is the name of the chief whose daughter has been so foolish as to run away from her friends  gadarn answered beniah  oh  i know him exclaimed cormac in some excitement and i know many of his people  i lived with them once long long ago  how far off is the camp did you say  an hours walk or so  in that direction asked cormac pointing  yes in that direction  then i will go and see them said the lad picking up his bow and arrows  you can wait here till i come back beniah and keep bladud companyfor he is accustomed to company now  who knows but i may pick up this foolish girl on my way to the camp  the lad hurried into the woods without waiting a reply but he had not gone a hundred yards when he turned and shouted hi beniah at the same time beckoning with his hand  the hebrew hurried towards him  beniah said the lad impressively as he drew near go back and examine bladuds arm and let me know when we meet again what you think of it  but howwhywherefore came you exclaimed the hebrew pausing in perplexity  ask no questions old man returned the youth with a laugh  there is no time to explain  he will suspectrobbersold motherbad son escapeboys dressfill up that story if you can  more hereafter butobserve if you say one word about me to anybody gadarns sword is sharp and his arm strong  you promise  i promise  solemnlyon your word as a hebrew  solemnlyon my word as a hebrew  but  with another laugh the boy interrupted him turned and disappeared in the woods  a strange though a good and affectionate boy remarked bladud when the hebrew returned  what said he  he bade me examine your arm and tell him what i think of it on his return  that is of a piece with all the dear boys conduct returned the prince  you have no idea what a kind nurse he has been to me at a time when i was helpless with fever  indeed if i had not been helpless and delirious i would not have allowed him to come near me  you have known him before it seems  yes i have known him for some time  from this point the prince pushed the hebrew with questions which the latterbearing in remembrance the sharpness of gadarns sword and the solemnity of his promisedid his best to evade and eventually succeeded in turning the conversation by questioning bladud as to his intercourse with the hunter of the swamp and his mode of life since his arrival in that region  then he proceeded to examine the arm critically  it is a wonderful cure he said after a minute inspection  almost miraculous  cure exclaimed the prince  do you then think me cured  indeed i doat least very nearly so  i have had some experience of your complaint in the east and it seems to me that a perfect cure is at most certainif it has not been already effected  chapter twenty four  describes an ardent search  while the prince and the hebrew were thus conversing cormac was speeding towards the camp of gadarn  he quickly arrived and was immediately arrested by one of the sentinels  taken before one of the chief officers he was asked who he was and where he came from  that i will tell only to your chief said the lad  i am a chief replied the officer proudly  that may be so but i want to speak with your chief and i must see him alone  assuredly thou art a saucy knave and might be improved by a switching  possibly but instead of wasting our time in useless talk it would be well to convey my message to gadarn for my news is urgent and i would not give much for your head if you delay  the officer laughed but there was that in the boys tone and manner that induced him to obey  gadarn the chief was seated on a treestump inside of a booth of boughs leaves and birchbark that had been hastily constructed for his accommodation  he was a great rugged northcountry man of immense physical poweras most chiefs were in those days  he seemed to be brooding over his sorrows at the time his officer entered  a prisoner waits without said the officer  he is a stripling and says he has urgent business to communicate to you alone  send him hither and let every one get out of earshot said gadarn gruffly  a minute later cormac appeared and looked wistfully at the chief who looked up with a frown  are you the pris  he stopped suddenly and springing to his feet advanced a step with glaring eyes and fastcoming breath as he held out both hands  with a cry of joy cormac sprang forward and threw his arms round gadarns neck exclaiming  fatherdear father  for a few moments there was silence and a sight was seen which had not been witnessed for many a daytwo or three gigantic tears rolled down the warriors rugged cheeks one of them trickling to the end of his weatherbeaten nose and dropping on his irongrey beard  my child he said at length wherehow came youwhy this  yes yes father interrupted the lad with a tearful laugh  ill tell you all about it in good time but ive got other things to speak of which are more interesting to both of us  sit down and let me sit on your knee as i used to do long ago  gadarn meekly obeyed  now listen said cormac putting his mouth to his fathers ear and whispering  the chief listened and the first effect of the whispering was to produce a frown  this gradually and slowly faded and gave place to an expression of doubt  are you sure childsure that you  quitequite sure interrupted cormac with emphasis  but that is not alllisten  gadarn listened again and as the whispering continued there came the wrinkles of humour over his rugged face then a snort that caused cormac to laugh ere he resumed his whispering  and he knows it cried gadarn interrupting and suppressing a laugh  yes knows all about it  and the other doesnt  has not the remotest idea  thinks that youre a  here the chief broke off got up placed his hands on both his sides and roared with laughter until the anxious sentinels outside believed that he had gone mad  with the energy of a strong nature he checked himself and became suddenly grave  listen he said you have made me listen a good deal to you  it is my turn now  before the sun stands there pointing you will be on your way to the court of king hudibras while i remain and make this hebrew lead me all over the country in search ofha hamy daughter we must search and search every hole and corner of the land for we mustwe must find heror perish  again the chief exploded but subdued himself immediately and going to the entrance of the booth summoned his lieutenant who started forward with the promptitude of an apparition and with an expression of some curiosity on his countenance for he also had heard the laughter  get ready forty men said the chief to convey this lad in safety to the court of king hudibras  he is well known there  say not that i sent you but that in ranging the country you found him lost in the woods and understanding him to belong to the household of the king you brought him in  without a word the lieutenant withdrew and the plotters looked at each other with that peculiarly significant expression which has been the characteristic of intriguers in all ages  thou wilt know how to act my little one said the chief  yes better even than you imagine my big one replied cormac  what is there something beyond my ken simmering in thy noddle thou pert squirrel  perchance there is father dear  a sound at the root of gadarns nose betrayed suppressed laughter as he turned away  quarter of an hour later a band of footsoldiers defiled out of the camp with cormac in their midst mounted on a small pony and gadarn calling another of his lieutenants told him to let it be known throughout the camp that if any officer or man should allow his tongue to wag with reference to the lad who had just left the camp his tongue would be silenced for all future time and an oak limb be decorated with an acorn that never grew on it  you know and they know that im a man of my wordaway said the chief returning to the privacy of his booth  while these events were happening at the camp bladud and beniah were discussing many subjectsreligion among others for they were both philosophical as well as seriouslyminded  but neither their philosophy nor their religion were profound enough at that time to remove anxiety about the youth who had just left them  i wish that i were clear of the whole business remarked the hebrew uneasily almost petulantly  why do you fear that any evil can happen to the boy asked bladud anxiously  oh  i fear not for him  it is not that  he will be among friends at the campbutbut i know not how gadarn may take it  take what demanded the prince in surprise  taketake my failure to find his daughter  ha to be sure he may be illpleased at that  but if i thought there was any chance of evil befalling cormac in the camp by all the gods of the east west north and south cried the prince carried away by the strength of his feelings into improper and even boastful language i would go and demand his liberation or fight the whole tribe singlehanded  a pretty boast for a man in present safety remarked the hebrew with a remonstrative shake of the head  most true returned the prince flushing i spoke in haste yet it was not altogether a boast for i could challenge gadarn to single combat and no rightminded chief could well refuse to let the issue of the matter rest on that  verily he would not refuse for although not so tall as you are he is quite as stout and it is a saying among his people that he fears not the face of any mansomething like his daughter in that  is she so bold then  nay not bold butcourageous  humph that is a distinction no doubt but the soft and gentle qualities in women commend themselves more to me than those which ought chiefly to characterise man  however be this as it may if cormac does not return soon after daybreak tomorrow i will hie me to the camp to see how it fares with him  as next morning brought no cormac or any news of him bladud started for the camp accompanied by the anxious hebrew  they found the chief at a late breakfast  he looked up without rising when they were announced  ha my worthy hebrewis it thou  what news of my child  have you heard of her whereabouts  not yet sir answered beniah with a look of intense perplexity  but i had thought thatthat is by this time  what no news cried the chief springing up in fierce ire and dropping the chop with which he had been engaged  did you not say that you felt sure you would hear of her from your friend  is this the friend that you spoke of  he turned a keen look of inquiry with not a little admiration in it on bladud  this is indeed he answered beniah and i havebut but did not a lada fair youthvisit your camp yesterday  nono lad came near the camp yesterday answered the chief gruffly  here was cause for wonder both for the hebrew and the prince  forgive me sir said the latter with a deferential air that greatly pleased the warrior forgive me if i venture to intrude my own troubles on one whose anxiety must needs be greater but this youth left my hut yesterday to visit you saying that he knew you well and if he has not arrived some evil must have befallen him for the distance he had to traverse was very short  that is sad returned the chief in a tone of sympathy for he must either have been caught by robbers or come by an accident on the way did you not follow his footsteps as you came along  we never thought of following themthe distance being so short returned the prince with increasing anxiety  are you then so fond of this lad asked the chief  ay that am i and with good reason for he has tended me with selfdenying care during illness and in circumstances which few men would have faced  in truth i feel indebted to him for my life  say you so cried the chief with sudden energy then shall we search for him as well as for my daughter  and you hebrew shall help us doubtless young man you will aid us by your knowledge of the district i have secured the services of the hunter of the swamp so we can divide into three bands and scour the whole country round  we cannot fail to find them for neither of them can have got far away whether they be lost or stolen  ho there  assemble the force instantly divide it into three bands  my lieutenant shall head one  you bladud shall lead another and i myself will head the third guided by beniah away  with a wave of both hands gadarn dismissed those around him and retired to his booth to arm himself and prepare for the pending search  the hebrew was sorely tempted just then to speak out but his solemn promise to branwen sealed his lips  the fact also that the girl seemed really to have disappeared filled him with alarm as well as surprise and made him anxious to participate in the search  in a perplexed state of mind and unenviable temper he went away with bladud to the place where the force was being marshalled  strange that fate should send us on a double search of this kind remarked the prince as they hurried along  whether fate sent us or some mischievous sprite i know not growled the hebrew but there is no need for more than one search  how exclaimed bladud sternly  think you that my poor lads fate is not of as much interest to me as that of gadarns daughter is to him  nay verily i presume not to gauge the interest of princes and chiefs returned beniah with an exasperated air  all i know is that if we find the lad we are full sure to find the lass not far off  how  you speak in riddles today  ay and there are like to be more riddles tomorrow for what the upshot of it will be is more than i can tell  see you not that as the two were lost about the same time and near the same place they will probably be found together  your wits seem to be shaken today old man rejoined bladud smiling for these two were not lost about the same place or time  fortunately for the hebrews peace of mind an officer accosted them at that moment and directing the one to head a band just ready to march led the other to the force which was to be commanded by the chief in person  in a few minutes the three bands were in motion the main bodies marching north south and east while strong parties were sent out from each to skirmish in all directions  think you we shall find them hebrew asked the chief who seemed to be in a curiously impulsive state of mind  i trust we may  it seems to me almost certain  i hope so for your sake as well as my own old man for if we do not i will surely cut your head off for bringing me here for nothing  does it not seem unjust to punish a man for doing his best asked beniah  it may seem so to you men of the east but to the men of the west justice is not held of much account  proceeding round by the hot springs the party led by gadarn made a careful inspection of every cavern defile glade and thicket returning at evening towards the camp from which they set out it having been arranged that they were all to meet there and start again to renew the search in a wider circle on the following morning  no success remarked gadarn sternly unbuckling his sword and flinging it violently on the ground  not yet but we may have better fortune tomorrow said beniah  dont you think the small footprints we saw near the springs were those of the boy  they may have been  and those that we saw further on but lost sight of in the rocky grounddid they not look like those of a girl  they certainly did  and yet strangely like to each other said the chief  marvellously returned beniah  a slight sound in gadarns nose caused the hebrew to look up quickly but the chief was gazing with stern gravity out at the opening of his booth where the men of his force could be seen busily at work felling trees kindling fires and otherwise preparing for the evening meal  chapter twenty five  more secrets and surprises  all went well with the party that conducted branwen to king hudibras town until they reached the hut of beniah the hebrew when the lad suggested to the leader of the escort that they should put up there as it was too late to think of intruding on the king that night  as the lieutenant had been told to pay particular regard to the wishes of his charge he at once agreed  indeed during the journey cormac as we may here continue to call the girl had expressed his wishes with such a quiet matterofcourse air of authority that the officer in charge had come to the conclusion that the youth must be the son of some person of importanceperhaps even of king hudibras himself  he therefore accorded him implicit obedience and deference  the hut is too small for all of us said cormac the greater number of your men must sleep outside but that does not matter on so fine a night  true it matters nothing replied the officer  we will all of us sup and sleep round the campfires  nay you and your lieutenant will sup with me  afterwards you can join the men  bytheby there is an old woman here who takes chargeor ought to take chargeof the hebrews dwelling during his absence  i have not seen her said the officer  truebut she will no doubt make her appearance soon  let her come and go as she pleases without hindrance  it is not safe to thwart her for her temper is none of the sweetest and she is apt to scratch  supper was soon over for the party had travelled all day and were weary  when it was finished cormac again cautioned the officers not to interfere with the old woman for she was dangerous  i will have a care said the officer laughing as he and his subaltern rose bade their charge goodnight and took their leave  the instant they were gone branwen pushed the plankbridge across the chasm and disappeared in the secret cave  half an hour later the two officers were seated with some of the men at the campfire nearest the hut making preparations for going to rest when they were startled by the creaking of the hut door  to their intense surprise it opened wide enough to let a little old woman step out  she was much bent wore an old grey shawl over her head and leaned on a staff  for some moments she looked from side to side as if in search of something  see the old woman murmured the officer in a low whisper  true but we did not see her enter the hut replied the sub with a solemn look  in those days witchcraft was implicitly believed in so when they saw the old creature hobble towards them they experienced feelings of alarm that had never yet affected their manly bosoms in danger or in war their faces paled a little but their courage stood the test for they sat still till she came close enough to let her piercing dark eyes be seen peering at them like those of a basilisk from out the folds of the shawl that enveloped her  yyou are thethe old woman i suppose said the officer in a deferential tone  yes i am the old woman young man and you will be an old woman too when you reach my time of life she replied in a deep metallic voice  i hope not returned the officer sincerely  at all events youll be a dead man before long if you dont attend to what i say continued the woman  your young master in the hut there told me to tell you that he is tired and wants a good long rest so you are not to disturb him in the morning till he calls you  dyou hear  i hear and will obey  eh  what  speak out  im deaf  i hear and will attend to your wishes  humph it will be worse for you if you dont muttered the old hag as she turned away hobbled into the woods and slowly disappeared  it need scarcely be said that the lieutenant and his sub did not sleep much that night  they discussed the subject of witches their powers and propensities and the bad luck likely to attend those who actually had the misfortune to see them until the hair on their heads betrayed a tendency to rise and the grey dawn began to appear  then they lay down and indulged in some fitful slumber  but the discomforts of the night were as nothing to the anxieties of the morning for the lazy cormac seemed to have gone in for an extent of slumber that was out of all reason considering his circumstances  the ordinary breakfast hour arrived but there was no intimation of his having awoke  hours passed but there was no call from the hut and the officer with everincreasing anxiety bade his men to kick up a rowor words to that effect  no command they ever received was more easy of fulfilment they laughed and talked they cut down trees and cleaned their breakfast utensils with overwhelming demonstration they shouted they even sang and roared in chorus but without effect  noon arrived and passed still cormac slept on  it was worse than perplexingit was becoming desperate  the officer commanding the party was a brave man so was the sub  their native courage overcame their superstitious fears  ill be battleaxed exclaimed the first using a very objectionable old british oath if i dont rouse him though all the witches in albion should withstand me  and ill back you up said the sub with a frown that spoke volumes perhaps considering the times we should have writtenrolls of papyrus  accordingly the two went towards the hut with pluck and misgiving contending for the mastery  perchance the witch may have returned while we slept said the sub in a low voice  or she may have reentered the hut invisiblyas she did at first replied the other  the door was found to be on the latch  the lieutenant opened it a little and peeped in  ho  cormac he shouted hi ho hooroo hooh but he shouted in vain  becoming accustomed to the dim light he perceived that there was no one within to answer to the call so he suddenly sprang in followed by the sub and a few of the more daring spirits among the men  a hasty search revealed the fact that the lad was not to be seen  a more minute and thorough inspection showed clearly that no one was there  they did not of course discover the cave for the plank had been removed but they gazed solemnly into the depths of the dark chasm and wondered if poor cormac had committed suicide there or if the witch had murdered him and thrown him in  having neither rope nor ladder and the chasm appearing to be bottomless they had no means of settling the question  but now a point of far greater moment pressed on their consideration what was to be said to king hudibras about the disappearance of the lad would he believe them  it was not likely  and on the other hand what would gadarn say  would he believe them  he might indeed for he knew them to be faithful but that would not mitigate his wrath and when he was roused by neglected duty they knew too well that their lives would hang on a thread  what was to be done  to go forward or backward seemed to involve death  one only resource was left namely for the whole band to go off on its own account and take to the woods as independent robbersor huntersor both combined  in an unenviable frame of mind the lieutenant and his sub sat down to the discussion of these knotty points and their midday meal  meanwhile the witch who had been the occasion of all this distress having got out of sight in the woods assumed a very upright gait and stepped out with a degree of bounding elasticity that would have done credit to a girl of nineteen  the sun was just rising in a flood of glorious light when she entered the suburbs of king hudibras townhaving previously resumed her stoop and hobbling gait  the king was lazy  he was still abed snoring  but the household was up and at breakfast when the witchpassing the guards who looked upon her as too contemptible to questionknocked at the palace door  it was the backdoor for even at that time palaces had such convenient apertures for purposes no doubt of undignified retreat  a menial answered the knockafter wearisome delay  is the princess hafrydda within  she is answered the menial with a supercilious look but she is at breakfast and does not see poor people at such an hour  would she see rich people if they were to call at such an hour demanded the witch sharply  perperhaps she would replied the menial with some hesitation  then ill wait here till she has finished breakfast  is the king up  nno  he still slumbers  hah  like him  he was always lazy in the mornings  go fetch me a stool  the manner of the old woman with her magnificent dark eyes and deep metallic voice and her evident knowledge of the kings habits were too much for the meniala chord of superstition had been touched it vibrated and he was quelled  humbly but quickly he fetched a stool  wont you step in he said  no ill stop out she replied and sat herself doggedly down with the air of one who had resolved never more to go away  meanwhile in the breakfast room of the palace which was on the ground floorindeed all the rooms of the palace were on the ground floor for there was no upper onethe queen and her fair daughter hafrydda were entertaining a stranger who had arrived the day before  he was an exceedingly handsome man of about sixandtwenty moderately tall and strong but with an air of graceful activity in all his movements that gave people somehow the belief that whatever he chose to attempt he could do  both his olive complexion and his tongue betokened him a foreigner for although the language he spoke was albionic it was what we now style brokenvery much broken indeed with a small head short curly black hair a very young beard and small pointed moustache fine intellectual features and an expression of imperturbable goodhumour he presented an appearance which might have claimed the regard of any woman  at all events the queen had formed a very high opinion of himand she was a woman of much experience having seen many men in her day  hafrydda though of course not so experienced fully equalled her mother if she did not excel her in her estimate of the young stranger  as we should be unintelligible if we gave the youths words in the broken dialect we must render his speech in fair english  i cannot tell how deeply i am grieved to hear this dreadful news of my dear friend he said with a look of profound sorrow that went home to the mothers heart  and did you really come to this land for the sole purpose of seeing my dear boy asked the queen  i did  you cannot imagine how much we loved each other  we were thrown together dailyalmost hourly  we studied together we competed when i was preparing for the olympic games we travelled in egypt and hunted together  indeed if it had not been for my dear old mother we should have travelled to this land in the same ship  your mother did not wish you to leave her i suppose  nay it was i who would not leave her  her unselfish nature would have induced her to make any sacrifice to please me  it was only when she died that my heart turned with unusual longing to my old companion bladud and i made up my mind to quit home and traverse the great sea in search of him  a grateful look shot from hafryddas blue eyes but it was lost on the youth who sat gazing at the floor as if engrossed with his great disappointment  i cannot understand he continued in an almost reproachful tone how you could ever make up your minds to banish him no matter how deadly the disease that had smitten him  the princesss fair face flushed deeply and she shook back her golden curlsher eyes flashing as she replied  we did not make up our minds to banish him  the warriors and people would have compelled us to do it whether we liked or not for they have heard alas of the terrible nature of the disease  but the dear boy knowing this went off in the night unknown to us and without even saying farewell  we have sent out parties to search for him several times but without success  the youth was evidently affected by this burst of feeling  ah he returned with a look of admiration at the princess that was like himlike his noble selfdenying nature  but i will find him out you may depend on it for i shall search the land in all directions till i discover his retreat  if king hudibras will grant me a few men to help mewell  if not i will do it by myself  thank you good dromas for your purpose and your sympathy said the queen  the king will be only too glad to help youbut here he comes to speak for himself  the curtain door was tossed aside at the moment and hudibras strode into the room with a beaming smile and a rolling gait that told of redundant health and showed that the cares of state sat lightly on him  welcome good dromas to our board  i was too sleepy to see much of you after your arrival last night  mine eyes blinked like those of an owl  kiss me wife and daughter he added giving the ladies a salute that resounded through the room  have they told you yet about our poor son bladud  the visitor had not time to reply when a domestic appeared and said there was an old woman at the door who would not go away  give her some cakes and send her off cried the king with a frown  but she will not go till she has had converse with the princess  i will go to her said hafrydda rising  ay go my girl and if thy sweet tongue fails to prevail stuff her mouth with meat and drink till she is too stout to walk  come my queen what have we this morning for breakfast  the very talking of meat makes me hungry  at this juncture several dogs burst into the room and gambolled with their royal master as with one who is a familiar friend  when the princess reached the outer door she found the woman standing and evidently in a rage  is this the way king hudibras teaches his varlets to behave to poor people who are better than themselves  forgive them granny said the princess who was inclined to laugh but strove to keep her gravity they are but stupid rogues at worst  nay but they are sly rogues at best retorted the old woman  the first that came took me for a witch and was moderately civil but the second took away my stool and threatened to set the dogs at me  if this be so i will have him cowhided but tell mewhat would you with me  can i help you  is it food that you want or rest  truly it is both food and rest that i want at the proper times but what i want with you now is to take me to your own room and let me talk to you  that is a curious desire returned hafrydda smiling but i will not deny you  come this way  have you anything secret to tell me she asked when they were alone  ay that have i answered the woman in her natural voice throwing off her shawl and standing erect  the princess remained speechless for her friend branwen stood before her  before i utter a word of explanation she said let me say that your brother is found and safe and wellor nearly so  this is the main thing but i will not tell you anything more unless you give me your solemn promise not to tell a word of it all to any one till i give you leave  do you promise  hafrydda was so taken aback that she could do nothing for some time but gaze in the girls face  then she laughed in an imbecile sort of way then she burst into tears of joy threw her arms round her friends neck hugged her tight and promised anythingeverythingthat she chose to demand  when an hour later the princess hafrydda returned to the breakfast room she informed the king and queen that the old woman was not a beggar that she had kept her listening to a long story about lost men and women and robbers that she was a thorough deceiver that some of the servants believed her to be a witch and that she had sent her away  with an invitation to come back again ill be bound cried the king interrupting  its always your way my girlany one can impose on you  well father she did impose on me and i did ask her to come back again  i knew it returned the king with a loud laugh and shell come for certain  she will you may be quite sure of that rejoined the princess with a gleeful laugh as she left the room  about the same time the little old woman left the palace and returned to the hut of the hebrew  here as she expected she found that her escort had flown and a brief inspection of their footprints showed that instead of proceeding towards the town they had returned the way they came  chapter twenty six  further searchings and perplexities  while these events were taking place at court the bold chief gadarn was ranging the country far and wide in search of his daughter branwen  there was something in his manner which puzzled his followers not a little for he seemed to have changed his characterat least to have added to it a strange wild hilarity which suggested the idea that he enjoyed the hunt and was in no hurry that it should come to an end those who knew him best began at last to fear that anxiety had unsettled his reason and bladud who liked the mans gay reckless disposition and hearty goodhumour intermingled with occasional bursts of fierce passion was not only puzzled but distressed by the wild inconsistency of his proceedings  the hebrew knowing to some extent the cause of what he did and feeling bound by his promise to conceal his knowledge was reduced to a state of mind that is not describable  on the one hand there was the mystery of cormacs total disappearance in a short walk of three miles  on the other hand there was the utter uselessness of searching for branwen yet the urgent need of searching diligently for cormac  then there was the fear of consequences when the fiery gadarn should come to find out how he had been deceived or rather what moderns might style humbugged add to which he was debarred the solace of talking the subject over with bladud besides being in consequence of his candid disposition in danger of blurting out words that might necessitate a revelation  one consequence was that for the time at least the grave and amiable hebrew became an abrupt unsociable taciturn man  what ails you just now beniah asked bladud one evening as they walked together to gadarns booth having been invited to supper  you seem out of condition mentally if not bodily as if some one had rubbed you the wrong way  do i answered beniah with a frown and something between a grin and a laugh  well it is not easy to understand ones mental complaints much less to explain them  fortunately their arrival at the booth put a timely end to the conversation  ha my longlegged prince and stalwart hebrew cried the jovial chief in a loud voice i began to fear that you had got lostas folk seem prone to do in this regionor had forgotten all about us  come in and sit ye down  ho varlet set down the victuals  after all you are just in the nick of time  well beniah what think you of our search today  has it been close  is it likely that we have missed any of the caves or cliffs where robbers might be hiding  i think not  it seems to me that we have ransacked every hole and corner in which there is a chance that the lad could be found  the lad exclaimed gadarn  ii meanyour daughter returned the hebrew quickly  why dont you say what you mean then  one expects a man of your years to talk without confusionor is it that you are really more anxious about finding the boy than my girl  nay that be far from me answered the hebrew  to say truth i am to the full as anxious to find the one as the other for it matters not which you  matters not repeated gadarn fiercely  well of course i mean that my friendship for you and bladud makes me wish to see you each satisfied by finding both the boy and the girl  for my part said bladud quietly i sincerely hope that we may find them both for we are equally anxious to do so  equally exclaimed gadarn with a look of lofty surprise  dost mean to compare your regard for your young friend with a fathers love for his only child  the prince did not easily take offence but he could not refrain from a flush and a frown as he replied sharply  i make no useless comparisons chief  it is sufficient that we are both full of anxiety and are engaged in the same quest  ay the same questundoubtedly observed the hebrew in a grumbling abstracted manner  if it were possible returned gadarn sternly to give up the search for your boy and confine it entirely to my girl i would do so  but as they went astray about the same place we are compelled however little we like it to hunt together  not compelled chief cried bladud with a look and a flash in his blue eye which presaged a sudden rupture of friendly relations  we can each go our own way and hunt on our own account  scarcely replied the chief for if you found my daughter you would be bound in honour to deliver her up and if i found your boy i should feel myself bound to do the same  it matters not a straw which is found cried the hebrew exasperated at the prospect of a quarrel between the two at such an inopportune moment  surely as an old man i have the right to remonstrate with you for encouraging anything like disagreement when our success in finding the boyii mean the girldepends  a burst of laughter from the chief cut him short  you dont seem to be quite sure of what you mean he cried or to be able to say it  come come prince if the hebrew claims a right to remonstrate because he is twenty years or so older than i am surely i may claim the same right for i am full twenty years older than you  is it seemly to let your hot young blood boil over at every trifle  here let me replenish your platter for it is ill hunting after man woman or beast without a stomach full of victuals  there was no resisting the impulsive chief  both his guests cleared their brows and laughedthough there was still a touch of exasperation in the hebrews tone  while the search was being thus diligently though needlessly prosecuted in the neighbourhood of the hot swamp by gadarn who was dearly fond of a practical joke another chief who was in no joking humour paid a visit one evening to his mother  perhaps it is unnecessary to say that this chief was gunrig  from all that i see and hear mother he said walking up and down the room as was his habit with his hands behind him it is clear that if i do not go about it myself the king will let the matter drop for he is convinced that the girl has run off with some fellow and will easily make her way home  dont you think he may be right my son  no i dont my muchtoowise mother  i know the girl better than that  it is enough to look in her face to know that she could not run away with any fellow  hm remarked the woman significantly  what say you demanded the chief sharply  i scarcely know what to say  perhaps the best thing to do would be to take a band of our own men and go off in search of the girl yourself  thats just what ive made up my mind to do but i wanted to see if hudibras would get up a band to join mine for i dare not take many away from the town when that scoundrel addedomar is threatening to make a raid upon us  my son said the woman anxiously what threatened raid do you speak of  did you not hear  since the last time we gave that robber a drubbing at the hot swamp he has taken to the woods and gathered together a large band of rascals like himself  we would not have minded thatfor honest men are always numerous enough to keep villains in orderbut two chiefs who have long been anxious to take possession of the land round the swamp have agreed to join with him so that they form a formidable body of warriorstoo large to be treated with contempt  this is bad news gunrig  how does the king take it  in his usual way  he does not believe in danger or mischief till it has overtaken him and it is almost too late for action  there is one hope however that he will be induced to move in time  a young fellow has come from the far east who was a great friend of that longlegged fellow bladud and he is bent on finding out where his friend has gone of course the king is willing to let him have as many men as he wants though he sternly refuses to let bladud return home and i hope to induce this youthdromas they call himto join me so that we may search together for of course the search for the man may result in finding the girl  my only objection is that if we do find bladud i shall have to fight and kill himunless the leprosy has happily killed him already  so now i will away and see what can be done about this hunt  my object in coming was to get my men and to warn those left in charge of the town to keep a keen lookout for addedomar for he is a dangerous foe  farewell mother  the woman was not addicted to the melting mood  she merely nodded as her son went out  in pursuance of this plan a band of about two hundred warriors was raised armed and provisioned for a long journey  gunrig put himself at the head of a hundred and fifty of these and dromas being a skilled warrior was given command of the remaining fifty with captain arkal who begged to be allowed to go as his lieutenant and little maikar as one of his fighting men  the orders were that they should start off in the direction of the hot swamp searching the country as they went making diligent inquiries at the few villages they might pass and questioning all travellers whom they might chance to meet with by the way  if branwen should be found she was to be sent back escorted by a detachment of a hundred men  if the retreat of bladud should be discovered news of the fact was to be sent to the king and the prince was to be left there in peace with any of the men who might volunteer to live with him  but on no account were they or bladud to return to hudibras town as long as there was the least danger of infection  is he never to return asked the queen whimpering when she heard these orders given  no never answered the king in that awful tone which the poor queen knew too well meant something like a decree of fate  oh father remonstrated hafryddaand dromas loved her for the remonstrancenot even if he is cured  well of course if he is cured my child that alters the case  but how am i to know that he is curedwho is to judge  our court doctor knows as much about it as a sucking pigperhaps less  perhaps the hebrew knows suggested hafryddaand dromas loved her for the suggestion  ah to be sure  i forgot the hebrew  you may call at his hut in passing and take him with you if he has come home yet  hes an amiable old man and may consent to go  if notmake him  away and cease to worry me  thats the way to get rid of business my queen isnt it  certainlyit is one way answered the queen turning to the two commanders  go and my blessing go with you  success attend you murmured the princess glancing timidly at dromasand as dromas gazed upon her fair face and golden curls and modest mien he felt that he loved her for herself  success did not however attend them at first for on reaching the hebrews hut they found it empty and no amount of shouting availed to call beniah from the vasty deep of the chasm or the dark recesses of the secret chamber  pursuing their way therefore the small army was soon lost to view in the forest  chapter twenty seven  cross purposes and complications  we turn now to another scene in the wildwoods not far distant from the hot swamp  it is a thicklywooded hollow on the eastern slopes of the high ridge that bounds one side of the valley of the springs  sturdy oaks tall poplars lordly elms and beeches cast a deep shade over the spot which was rendered almost impenetrable by dense underwood  even in brightest sunshine light entered it with difficulty and in gloomy weather a sort of twilight constantly prevailed while at night the place became the very abode of thick darkness  in this retreat was assembled one gloomy afternoon a large body of armed men not connected with the searching parties which had been ransacking the region in the vain duplex search which we have tried to describe  it was a warparty under the command of addedomar the outlawif we may thus characterise a man in a land where there was little or no law of any kind save that of might  it was a strong band numbering nearly four hundred warriors all of whom were animated with the supposedtobe noble desire to commit theft on a very large scale  it is true they called it conquest which word in those days as in modern times even among civilised people meant killing many of the natives of a place and taking possession of their lands  thenas nowthis was sometimes styled right of conquest and many people thought then as some think even now that by putting this word right before conquest they made it all right and had somehow succeeded in abrogating the laws thou shalt not steal and do to others as thou wouldest have others do to thee laws which were written by god in the human understanding long before moses descended with the decalogue from sinai  however as we have said there was little or no law in the land of old albion at the time of which we write so that we can scarcely wonder at the aspirations of the band under addedomaraspirations which were to the full as strongperhaps even as nobleas those of alexander the great or the first napoleon  it had been ascertained by some stray hunter of addedomars party that considerable bands of men were ranging the valley of the springs and its neighbourhood in search of something or some one and that they went about usually in small detached parties  the stray hunter with an eye doubtless to his personal interest conveyed the news to the robber chief who having made secret and extensive preparations happened at the time to be on his way to raid the territories of king hudibras intending to take the town of gunrig as a piece of byplay in passing  here however was an opportunity of striking a splendid blow without travelling so far  by keeping his force united and sending a number of scouts in advance he could attack and overwhelm the scattered detachments in succession  he therefore in the meantime abandoned his original plan and turned aside to the neighbourhood of the hot swamp  there he remained in the sequestered hollow which has been described awaiting the return of his scouts  there was no difficulty in feeding an army in those days for the forests of albion abounded with game and the silent bow unlike the noisy firearm could be used effectively without betraying the presence of the hunter  the eyes of addedomar opened wider and wider as his scouts dropped in one by one and his heart beat high with glee and hope at the news they brought for it opened up a speedy conquest in detail of more foes than he had counted on meeting with and left the prospect of his afterwards carrying into execution his original plan  the first scout brought the intelligence that it was not the men of king hudibras who were in the neighbourhood but those of gadarn the great chief of the far north who had come there with an armed force in search of his daughtershe having gone lost stolen or strayed in the wilderness  is the band a large one demanded addedomar  it is but not so large as ours and it is weakened every day by being sent into the woods in different directions and in three detachments  excellent  ha we will join gadarn in this search not only for his daughter but for himself and we will double the number of his detachments when we meet them by slicing each man in two  a loud laugh greeted this pleasantry for robbers were easily tickled in those days  i also discovered continued the scout that there is search being made at the same time for some boy or lad who seems to have disappeared or run away or been caught by robbers  again there was a laugh at the idea that there were other robbers about besides themselves but the chief checked them  did you find out anything else about this lad he asked  only that he seemed from his dress to be a hunter  addedomar frowned and looked at the ground for some moments in meditation  im convinced he said at last that this lad is none other than the girl who escaped in the hunting dress of my young brother just the day before i returned to camp  mother was not as careful as she might have been at that time and lost me a pretty wife  good  things are turning out well today  we will rout gadarn find his daughter and this socalled lad and then i shall have two wives instead of one  the robber chief had just come to this satisfactory conclusion when another scout arrived  how now varlet  do you bring good news  that depends on what you consider good answered the scout panting i have just learned that a large body of king hudibras menabout two hundred i believeis on its way to the swamp to search for his son bladud  what the giant whom we have heard tell ofwho gave gunrig such a drubbing  the same  it seems that he has been smitten with leprosy has been banished from court and has taken up his abode somewhere near the swamp  but if he has been banished why do they send out to search for him i wonder said the robber chief  it is said returned the scout that a friend of bladud from the far east wants to find him  good  this is rare good luck  we too will search for bladud and slay him  it is not every day that a man has the chance to kill a giant with leprosy and a kings son into the bargain  i also learned continued the scout that some lady of the court has fled and the army is to search of her too  what more women  why it seems as if these woods here must be swarming with them  i should not wonder too if it was hudibras own daughter that has run away  not unlikely for the king is well known to be a tyrannical old fellow  hm we will search for her also  if we find them all i shall have more than enough of wivesthe kings daughter and gadarns daughter and this runawaylad whoever she may be  learned you anything more  nothing more except that gadarn intends to make an early start tomorrow morning  it is well  we also will make an earlyan even earlierstart tomorrow morning  to your food now my men and thento rest  while the robber chief was thus conversing with his scouts two men were advancing through the forest one of whom was destined to interfere with the plans which were so well conceived by addedomar  these were our friends arkal and maikar  filled with a sort of wild romance which neither the waves of the sea nor the dangers of the land could abate these two shipmates marched through the woods all unconscious of course of the important part they were destined to play in that era of the worlds history  the two sailors were alone having obtained leave to range right and left in advance of the column to which they were attached for the purpose of hunting  we are not much to boast of in the way of shooting remarked arkal but the troops dont know that and good luck may prevent them finding it out  just so returned maikar good luck may also bring us within arrowshot of a wolf  i have set my heart on taking home a wolfskin to that little woman with the black eyes that ive spoken to you about sometimes  quite right young man said the captain in an approving tone nothing pleases folk so much as to find that they have been remembered by you when far away  moreover i think you stand a good chance for i saw two wolves the other day when i was rambling about but they were out of range  chance or luckwhichever it wasdid not bring a wolf within range that day but it brought what was more important and dangerousnamely a large brown bear  the animal was seated under a willow tree with its head on one side as if in meditation when the men came upon it  an intervening cliff had prevented the bear from hearing the footsteps of the men and both parties being taken by surprise stared at each other for a moment in silence  no word was spoken but next instant the bear ran at them and stood up on its hind legs according to bearnature to attack  at the same moment both men discharged arrows at it with all their force  one arrow stuck in the animals throat the other in his chest  but bears are proverbially hard to kill and no vital part had been reached  dropping their bows the men turned and made for the nearest trees  they separated in doing so and the bear lost a moment or two in making up its mind which to follow  fortunately it decided in favour of maikar had it followed arkal it would have caught him for the captain not being as agile as might be wished missed his first spring up his tree and slid back to the bottom  maikar on the other hand went up like a squirrel  now the little seaman had been told that some kinds of bears can climb while others cannot  remembering the fact he glanced anxiously down as he went up to his horror he saw that this bear could climb and that his only chance would be to climb so high that the branches which would bear his weight would not support the bear  it was a forlorn hope but he resolved to try it  arkal in the meantime had recovered breath and selfpossession seeing the danger of his comrade he boldly dropped to the ground picked up his bow ran under the other tree and sent an arrow deep into the bears flank  with a savage growl the animal looked round saw the captain getting ready a second arrow and immediately began to descend this rather disconcerted arkal who discharged his arrow hastily and missed  dropping his bow a second time he ran for dear life to his own tree and scrambled up  but he need not have been in such haste for although some bears can ascend trees easily they are clumsy and slow in descending  consequently the captain was high up before his enemy began to climb  that was of little advantage however for in a few moments the bear would have been up with him had not maikar moved by the consideration no doubt that one good turn deserves another dropped quickly to the ground picked up his bow and repeated the captains operation with even more telling effect for his arrow made the bear so furious that he turned round to bite it  in doing so he lost his hold and fell to the ground with such a thud that he drove the arrow further into him and a vicious squeal out of him  at this point little maikar resolved to vary the plan of action  he stood his ground manfully and when the bear arose with a somewhat confused expression he planted another arrow up to the feathers in its chest  still the creature was unsubdued  it made a rush but the sailor sprang lightly behind a tree getting ready an arrow as he did so  when the animal rushed at him again it received the shaft deep in the left shoulder so that with blood pouring from its many wounds it stumbled and fell at its next rush  seeing how things were going you may be sure that arkal did not remain an idle spectator  he dropped again from the outer end of the bough he had reached and when the bear rose once more to its feet it found a foe on either side of it  dont shoot together panted maikar for all this violent action was beginning to tell on him  do you shoot first  this was said while the bear was in a state of indecision  the captain obeyed and put another arrow in its neck  the bear turned savagely on him thus exposing its side to maikar who took swift advantage of the chance and sending an arrow straight to its heart turned it over dead  it must be remarked here that all this shooting was done at such close range that although the two seamen were as we have said rather poor shots they had little difficulty in hitting so large an object  now then out with your knife and off with the claws for the little woman at home with the black eyes said arkal wiping the perspiration from his brow and be quick about it so as to have it done before the troops come up  the little man was not long in accomplishing the job and he had just put the claws in his pouch and was standing up to wipe his knife when the captain suddenly grasped his arm and drew him behind the trunk of a tree from which point of vantage he cautiously gazed with an anxious expression and a dark frown  chapter twenty eight  enemies friends scouts skirmishes and councils of war  arkals attention had been arrested by the figure of a man who suddenly appeared from behind a cliff not four hundred yards distant from the scene of their recent exploit  the stealthy manner in which the man moved among the bushes and the earnest gaze which he directed from time to time in one particular direction showed clearly that he was watching the movements of somethingit might be a deer or an enemy  evidently he has not seen us whispered maikar  clear enough that for he is not looking this way returned arkal he presents his back to us in a careless way which he would hardly do if he knew that two crack bowmen were a hundred yards astern of him  shall i shoot him whispered maikar preparing his weapons  he may be a friend returned the captain  but see yonder comes what interests him so much  look  he pointed to a distant ridge over the brow of which the head of gunrigs column of men was just appearing  he is a scout exclaimed maikar  ay and you may be sure that an enemy is not far off ahead of our columnunless perchance he may be the scout of some tribe friendly to the king  hold your hand maikar  you are ever too ready to fight listen now yonder is a convenient hollow where i may get into the thick wood unseen by this scout and run back to warn our friends ahead yonder is a narrow pass which leads no doubt into the next valley  run you as fast as your legs can wag get through that pass and see what you can see  in the nature of things the scout is almost sure to return through it if he intends to carry the news of our approach to his people who are probably there  you must hide and do the best you can to prevent him from doing thiseither by killing him or knocking him down  be off we have no time to lose  but how if he should be a friend asked maikar with a smile  how am i to find out  arkal paused and was perplexed  you must just exercise your wisdom he replied  if the fellow has an illlooking countenance kill him  if he looks a sensible sort of man stretch him out somehow  i would offer to go instead of you being more of a match for him but i could not match his legs or yours so it might well chance that he would reach the pass before me  pooh captain retorted maikar with a look of scorn  ye think too much of yourself and are unwarrantably puffed up about the advantage of size  without a replysave a grinarkal turned and jumping into the bushes was immediately out of sight  his comrade before starting off to carry out his part of the programme took a good look at the scout whom he was bound to circumvent  he was evidently a tall powerful man armed with a bow a short sword and a stout staff somewhat longer than himself  that he was also a brave and cool man seemed probable from the fact that instead of hurrying off hastily to warn his friends that troops were in sight he stood calmly leaning on his staff as if for the purpose of ascertaining the exact number of the strangers before reporting them  he was still engaged in this inspection when maikar started off and fled on the wings of hope and excitement toward the pass  arrived there his first glance revealed to him the troops of addedomar busy with their evening meal in the valley below  the question is are they friends or foes thought the little seaman hm its an awkward thing for a poor fellow not to be quite sure whether to prepare for calms or squalls  such a misfortune never could befall one at sea  well i must just take them to be foes till they prove themselves to be friends  and this scout what in the world am i to do about him  i have no heart to hide in the bushes and shoot him dead as he passes  the little man had probably forgotten his readiness to shoot the scout in the back only a few minutes beforebut is not mankind at large prone to inconsistency at times  i know what ill do he muttered pursuing his thoughts and nodding his head as he stepped aside into the shrubbery that clothed the slopes of the pass  cutting down a suitable branch from a tree he quickly stripped off the smaller branches and reduced it to a staff about six feet in length then hiding himself behind a part of the cliff which abutted close on the footpath that had been worn through the pass by men and wild animals he laid his bow and quiver at his feet and awaited the coming of the scout  he had not to wait long for that worthy having ascertained the size of the invading band came down the pass at a swinging trot  just as he passed the jutting rock his practised eye caught sight of maikar in time to avoid the blow of the pole or staff which was aimed at his head but not to escape the dig in the ribs with which the little man followed it up  instantly the scouts right hand flew to his quiver but before he could fix an arrow another blow from the staff broke the bow in his left hand  blazing with astonishment and wrath at such rough treatment from so small a man he stepped back drew his sword and glared at his opponent  maikar also stepped back a pace or two and held up his hand as if for a truce  i too have a sword he said pointing to the weapon and can use it but i have no desire to slay you till i know whether you are friend or foe  slay me thou insignificant rat cried the scout in savage fury even if we were friends i would have to pay thee for that dig in the ribs and the broken bow  but i scorn to take advantage of such a squirrel  have at thee with my staff  running at him as he spoke the scout delivered a blow that would have acted like the hammer of thor had it taken effect but the seaman deftly dipped his head and the blow fell on a neighbouring birch and a foot or so of the staff snapped off  what remained however was still a formidable weapon but before the scout could use it he received another dig in the ribs which called forth a yell of indignation rather than of pain  the appropriateness of the name squirrel now became apparent for maikar even excelled that agile creature in the rapidity with which he waltzed round the sturdy scout and delivered his stinging little blows  to do the scout justice he played his part like a brave and active warrior so that it seemed to rain blows and digs in all directions and once or twice as by a miracle maikar escaped what threatened to be little if at all short of extermination  as in running so in fighting it is the pace that kills  after five minutes or so both combatants were winded  they separated as if by mutual consent and leaning on their staves panted vehemently  then at it they went again  thou little scrap of a pigs snout come on shouted the scout in huge disdain  thou big skinful of pride look out cried maikar rendering the adoption of his own advice impossible by thrusting the butt of his staff against the scouts nose and thereby filling his eyes with water  at the next moment he rendered him still more helpless by bestowing a whack on his crown which laid him flat on the footpath  a cheer behind him at that moment caused the little man to look round when he found that the head of gunrigs column led by arkal had come up just in time to witness the final blow  they were still crowding round the fallen man and asking hurried questions about him when a voice from the heights above hailed them instantly a score or two of arrows were pointed in that direction  hold your hands men shouted gunrig  i know that voiceay and the face too  is it not the white beard of our friend the hebrew that i see  a few minutes more proved that he was right for the wellknown figure of beniah descended the sides of the pass  the news he brought proved to be both surprising and perplexing for up to that moment gunrig had been utterly ignorant of the recent arrival of gadarn from the far north in search of his lost daughter though of course he was well aware of the various unsuccessful efforts that had been made by king hudibras in that direction  moreover he chanced to be not on the best of terms with gadarn just at that time  then the fact that bladud had recovered his health and was actively engaged in the searchnot indeed so much for branwen as for a youth named cormacwas also surprising as well as disagreeable news to gunrig  and who is this cormac in whom the prince seems to be so interested he asked  here poor beniah held fast by his solemn promise was compelled to give an evasive answer  all that i can tell about him he replied is that he is a kind young fellow to whose attention and nursing the prince thinks himself indebted for his life  but had we not better question this young man he added turning to the scout  i have heard rumours about robbers lurking somewhere hereaboutshence my coming out alone to scout the country round little dreaming that i should find the men of king hudibras so near  if robbers are said to be hereabouts broke in maikar at this point i can tell you where to find them i think for i saw a band of men in the hollow just beyond this pass  say you so exclaimed gunrig fetch the prisoner here  the scout who had recovered his senses by that time was led forward but doggedly refused to give any information  kindle a fire men we will roast him alive and perhaps that will teach him to speak  it was by no means unusual for men in those days to use torture for the purpose of extracting information from obstinate prisoners  at first the man maintained his resolution but when he saw that his captors were in earnest and about to light the fire his courage failed him  he confessed that he was a scout and that addedomar was there with several other wellknown chiefs and a body of four hundred men  thereupon the man was bound and put in the safe keeping of several men whose lives were to be forfeited if he should escape  then gunrig dromas beniah arkal maikar and several other chief men retired under a tree to hold a council of war  their deliberations resulted in the following conclusions  first that the number of warriors at their disposal counting those of king hudibras and those under gadarn amounted to a sufficient force wherewith to meet the invaders in open fight second that a junction between their forces must be effected that night for according to usual custom in such circumstances the enemy would be pretty sure to attack before daybreak in the morning and third that what was to be done must be set about as soon as darkness favoured their operations  you can guide us in the dark i suppose said gunrig turning to beniah  ay as well almost as in the light replied the hebrew  let the men feed then and be ready for the signal to start said the chief to his officers and see that no louder noise be heard than the crunching of their jaws  the night was favourable to their enterprise  the moon was indeed risen but clouds entirely hid it yet allowed a soft light to pass through which rendered objects close at hand quite visible  before midnight they started on the march in profound silence and led by beniah made a wide detour which brought them to the encampment of gadarn  as may easily be understood that chief was well pleased at the turn events had taken for to say truth his little joke of trotting beniah about the land and keeping him in perplexity had begun to pall and he had for some days past been hunting about for a plausible excuse for abandoning the search and going to visit king hudibras  his difficulty in this matter was increased by his unwillingness to reveal the true state of matters to bladud yet he knew that unless he did so the prince would utterly refuse to abandon the search for cormac another thing that perplexed the chief greatly washow the hebrew knowing branwen as he did had failed to recognise her in the lad cormac for of course he knew nothing of the promise that held the hebrews lips tied his daughterwho was as fond of a joke as himself having taken care not to reveal all the complications that had arisen in regard to herself  the sudden appearance therefore of foes with whom he could fight proved to be a sort of fortunate safetyvalve and besides he had the comfort of thinking that he would fight in a good cause for the region of the hot swamp belonged to his friend hudibras and this robber addedomar was a notorious rascal who required extirpating while the chiefs who had joined him were little better  the council of war that was hastily called included bladud who was sent for being asleep in his own booth when the party arrived  the council chamber was under an old oak tree  when bladud came forward he was suddenly struck motionless and glared as if he had seen a ghost  for the first time in his life he felt an emotion of supernatural fearfor there in the flesh apparently stood his friend dromas  a smile from the latter reassured him  leaping forward he seized his friends hand but the impulsive greek was not to be put off thus  he threw an arm round the princes neck and kissed his cheek  dromas cried bladud can it be  am i dreaming  this is all very well interrupted the impatient gadarn and i have no doubt you are excellent friends though somewhat demonstrative but we are holding a council of warnot of affectionand as the enemy may be close at hand it behoves us to be smart  shake hands gunrig you and i must be friends when we fight on the same side  now let us to work who is to have the chief command  by universal desire the council appointed gadarn  well then said the commanderinchief this is my view addedomar will come expecting to find us all asleep  he will find us all very wide awake  there is a slope in front of this camp leading down to the swamp  at the bottom is a nice level piece of flat land bordering on the swamp that seems just made for a battlefield  we will drive him and his men down the slope on to that flat from which after giving them the toothache we will drive them into the swamp and as close up to the springhead as we can so that they may be half boiled alive if possible  those who escape the swamp will find men ambushed on the other side who will drive them into the river  those who escape the river may go home and take my blessing along with them  then do you intend to divide our troops into two bodies asked bladud  of course i do  we cant have an ambush without dividing can we  division means weakness observed gunrig  you were ever obstinate gunrig said gadarn sharply  division sometimes means strength said dromas in a conciliatory tone for he was anxious at least to prevent division in the council  as addedomar is ignorant of the strength of our force his being attacked unexpectedly and in the dark by two or three bands at once from different quarters will do much to demoralise his men and throw them into confusion  right my young friend rejoined gadarn though you do speak in the tones of one who has been born under other stars there is sense in your head  that is the very thing i mean to do  we will divide into four bands  i will keep the biggest at the camp to drive them down the slope and begin the fight  prince bladud will take one detachment round through the woods to the river and fall upon them from that side gunrig who i know loves the post of danger will go down between the two mounds and meet the enemy right in the teeth when they are being driven out upon the flat land and dromas as he seems to be a knowing man might take the ambush on the other side of the swamp  nay if i may choose i would rather fight under my friend bladud  be it so  settle that among yourselves  only i must have konar with me for he knows the swamp well and can roar splendidly  all the enemy below a certain point of courage will turn and split off when they hear his yell  im going to make him keep it for them as a little treat at the last  the hebrew will also keep by me  now marshal your men and take them off at once  we shant have to wait long for addedomar is an active villain  chapter twenty nine  the battle of the springs  gadarn was right  the robber chief was very early astir that morning and marched with his host so silently through the forest that the very birds on the boughs gave them as they passed underneath but a sleepy wink of one eye and thrust their beaks again under their wings  not knowing the country thoroughly however addedomar met some slight obstructions which necessitating occasional detours from the straight path delayed him a little so that it was very near dawn when he reached the neighbourhood of gadarns camp  hesitation in the circumstances he knew would be ruinous he therefore neglected the precaution of feeling his way by sending scouts in advance and made straight for the enemys camp  scouts previously sent out had ascertained its exact position so that he had no doubt of effecting a complete surprise  many noted battles have been fought and described in this world but few if any we should think will compare with the famous battle of the springs in the completeness of the victory  coming out upon the flat which gadarn had determined should be the battlefield and to the left of which the hot springs that caused the swamp were flowing addedomar marshalled his men for the final assault before reaching the flat they had passed almost within bowshot of the spot where gunrig and his men lay in ambush and that chief might easily have fallen upon and killed many of them had he not been restrained by the strict orders of gadarn to let them pass on to the camp unmolested it is true gunrig found it very hard to hold his hand but as gadarn had been constituted commanderinchief without a dissentient voice in virtue of his superior intelligence and indomitable resolution he felt bound to obey  bladud and his friend dromas with their contingent being at the lower end of the flat and far out of bowshot were not thus tempted to disobey orders  the ambuscade on the other side of the swamp had been put under the command of captain arkal with maikar for his lieutenant being entirely ignorant of what was going on the men of this contingent lay close abiding their time  inaction during the development of some critical manoeuvre while awaiting the signal to be up and doing is hard to bear  arkal and his men whiled away the time in whispered conversations which related more or less to the part they were expected to play  if any of the robbers reach this side of the swamp alive remarked arkal there will be no need to kill them  what then would you let them escape asked maikar in surprise  not on this side of the river returned the captain  but we might drive them into it and as it is in roaring flood just now most of them will probably be drowned  the few who escape will do us service by telling the tale of their defeat to their friends  he ceased to whisper for just then the dawning light showed them the dusky forms of the enemy stealing noiselessly but swiftly over the flat  at their head strode addedomar and a few of his stoutest men  reaching the slope that led to the camp the four hundred men rushed up still however in perfect silence expecting to take their victims by surprise  but before they gained the summit a body of men burst out from the woods on either side of the track and leaped upon them with a prolonged roar that must have been the rudimentary form of a british cheer  the effect on the robbers was tremendous  on beholding the huge forms of gadarn konar and beniah coming on in front they turned and fled like autumn leaves before a gale without waiting even to discharge a single arrow  the courageous addedomar was overwhelmed by the panic and carried away in the rush  gadarn supposing that the attack would have been made earlier and in the dark had left the bows of his force behind intending to depend entirely on swords and clubs  but he found that the robbers were swift of foot and that terror lent wings for they did not overtake them at once  down the slope went the robbers and down went the roaring northmen until both parties swept out upon the flat below  they did not scatter however  addedomars men had been trained to keep together even in flight and they now made for the gully between the mounds their chief intending to face about there and show fight on the slopes of the pass  but the flying host had barely entered it when they were assaulted and driven back by the forces under gunrig who went at them with a shout that told of previous severe restraint  the fugitives could not stand it  the arrows which even during flight were being got ready for gadarns host were suddenly discharged at the men in the gully but the aim was wild and the only shaft which took serious effect found its billet in the breast of gunrig himself  he plucked it savagely out and continued the charge at the head of his men  turning sharp to the left the robbers then made for the lower end of the flat still followed closely by gadarns band now swelled by that of gunrig  as had been anticipated they almost ran into the arms of bladuds contingent which met them with a yell of rage and the yell was answered by a shriek of terror  their retreat being thus cut off in nearly all directions the panicstricken crew doubled to the left again and sprang into the swamp closely followed by their everincreasing foes  at first and at some distance from the fountainhead the water felt warm and grateful to the lower limbs of the fugitives but as they plunged in deeper and nearer to the springs it became uncomfortably hot and they began to scatter all over the place in the hope of finding cool water  some who knew the locality were successful  others who did not know it rushed from hot to hotter while some who were blindly struggling toward the source of the evil at last began to yell with pain and no wonder for the temperature of the springs thenas it has been ever since and is at the present daywas 120 degrees of fahrenheita degree of heat in water which man is not fitted to bear with equanimity  now konar give them a tune from your pipe said gadarn whose eyes were blazing with excitement  the hunter of the swamp obeyed and it seemed as though a mammoth bull of bashan had been suddenly let loose on the fugitives  to add to the turmoil a large herd of bladuds pigs disturbed from their lair were driven into the hot water where they swam about in a frantic state filling the whole region with horrid yells which mingling with those of the human sufferers and the incessant barking of brownie rendered confusion worse confounded and caused the wild animals far and near to flee from the region as if it had become pandemonium  the pigs however unlike the men knew how to find the cooler parts of the swamp  perceiving his error when he stood kneedeep in the swamp gadarn now sought to rectify it by sending a detachment of swift runners back for his bows and arrows  but this manoeuvre took time and before it could be carried out the halfboiled host had gained the other side of the swamp and were massing themselves together preparatory to a retreat into the thick woods  now is our time said arkal rising up and drawing his sword  then with a nautical shout and almost in the words of a late warrior of note he cried up men and at them  and the men obeyed with such alacrity and such inconceivable violence that the stricken enemy did not await the onset  they incontinently sloped at an angle of fortyfive degrees with mother earth and scooted towards the river into which they all plunged without a moments consideration  arkal and his men paused on the brink to watch the result but the seaman was wrong about the probable fate of the vanquished for every man of the robber band could swim like an otter besides being in a fit condition to enjoy the cooler stream  they all reached the opposite bank in safety  scrambling out they took to the woods without once looking back and finally disappeared  during the remainder of that day gadarn could do little else than chuckle or laugh  bladuds comment was that it had been most successful  a bloodless victory remarked beniah  and didnt they yell said arkal  and splutter added maikar  and the pigs oh the pigs cried gadarn going off into another explosion which brought the tears to his eyes it would have been nothing without the pigs  the gentle reader must make allowance for the feelings of men fresh from the excitement of such a scene existing as they did in times so very remote  but after all when we take into consideration the circumstances the nature of the weapons used the cause of the war and the objects gained and compare it all with the circumstances weapons causes and objects of modern warfare we are constrained to admit that it was a most glorious victorythis battle of the springs  chapter thirty  small beginnings of future great things  there was one thing however which threw a cloud over the rejoicing with which the conquerors hailed this memorable victory  gunrigs wound turned out to be a very severe onemuch more so than had been at first supposedfor the arrow had penetrated one of his lungs and breaking off had left the head in it  as bladud was the only one of the host who possessed any knowledge of how to treat complicated wounds he was called in much against the wish of the wounded man but when the prince had seen and spoken to him in his peculiarly soft voice and with his gentle manner besides affording him considerable relief the chief became reconciled to his new doctor  i thought you a savage monster said the invalid on the occasion of the amateur doctors third visit but i find you to be almost as tender as a woman  yet your hand was heavy enough when it felled me at the games  let not your mind dwell on that gunrig and truth to tell if it had not been for that luckyor if you choose unluckyblow i might have found you more than my match  the chief held out his hand which the doctor grasped  i thought to kill you bladud but when i get well we shall be friends  poor gunrig however did not from that day show much evidence of getting well  his case was far beyond the skill of his amateur doctor it was therefore resolved a day or two later to send him home under an escort led by beniah  i will follow you ere long said gadarn as he grasped the hand of the invalid at parting for i have business at the court of king hudibras  gunrig raised himself in the litter in which he was borne by four men and looked the northern chief earnestly in the face  you have not yet found your daughter he asked  wellno  at least not exactly  not exactly repeated gunrig in surprise  no not exactly  thats all i can say at present  all ready in front there  move on  my greetings to the king and say i shall see him soon  what ho  konar come hither  know you where i can find prince bladud  in his booth replied the hunter  send him to me  i would have speech with him  when the prince entered the booth of the commanderinchief he found that worthy with his hands on his sides a tear or two in his eyes and very red in the face  he frowned suddenly however and became very grave on observing bladud  i sent for you he said to let you know my intended movements and to ask what you mean to do  tomorrow i shall start for your fathers town with all my men  what and leave your daughter undiscovered  ay  of what use is it to search any longer  there is not a hole or corner of the land that we have not ransacked  i am certain that she is not here wherever she may be so i must go and seek elsewhere  wilt go with me  that will not i returned bladud decisively  wherefore  the hebrew tells me you are cured and your father will be glad to have you back  it matters not  i leave not this region until i have made a more thorough search for and found the lad cormac or at least ascertained his fate  why so anxious about the boy is he of kin to you said gadarn in a tone that seemed to convey the slightest possible evidence of contempt  ay he is of kin returned bladud warmly for it seems to me sometimes that friendship is a closer tie than blood  at all events i owe my life to him  moreover if he has been captured by robbers i feel assured that he will escape before long and return to me  indeed  are you then so sure of his affection  has he ever dared to say that hehe is fond of you  truly he never has for we men of the southern parts of albion are not prone to speak of our feelings whatever you of the north may be  but surely you must know chief that the eyes the tones and the actions have a language of their own which one can well understand though the tongue be silent  besides i do not see it to be a very daring act for one man to tell another that he is fond of him  and you would not wonder at my regard if you only knew what a pureminded noble fellow this cormac isso thoughtful so selfsacrificing for you know it must have cost himit would cost any onea terrible effort of selfdenial to dwell in such a solitude as this for the sole purpose of nursing a stranger and that stranger a doomed leper as i thought at first though god has seen fit to restore me  nevertheless i counsel you to come with me prince for i have no intention of giving up the search for my child though i mean to carry it on in a more likely region and who knows but we may find cormac ha  here there was a peculiar catch in gadarns throat which he sought to conceal with a violent sneezeha find cormac in the same region  that is not likely  i see no reason why two people who were lost at different times and not as far as we know in exactly the same place should be foundhere the chief had another fit of sneezingbe found together  at any rate i remain here for a time at least  my old friend dromas will remain with me and some of my fathers men  as gadarn could not induce the prince to alter his decision and for reasons of his own did not choose to enlighten him they parted there the chief setting off with his troops in the direction of hudibras town and the prince returning to his booth accompanied by captain arkal little maikar the hunter of the hot swamp and about thirty of his fathers men who had elected to stay with him  as i am now cured good konar said bladud to the hunter while returning to the booth and as i have enough to do in searching for my lost friend i fear that i must end my service with you and make over the pigs to some other herd  as you please prince returned the eccentric hunter with the utmost coolness the pigs were well able to look after themselves before you came and doubtless they will be not less able after you go  bladud laughed and putting his hand kindly on the mans shoulder assured him that he would find for him a good successor to herd his pigs  he also asked him if he would agree to act as hunter to his party as he intended to remain in that region and build a small town beside the springs so that people afflicted with the disease from which he had suffered or any similar disease might come and be cured  konar agreed at once for a new light burst upon him and the idea of living to serve other people and not merely to feed himself seemed to put new life into him  do you really mean to build a town here asked dromas when he heard his friend giving orders to his men to erect a large booth to shelter them all for some time to come  indeed i do  so thankful am i dromas for this cure that i feel impelled to induce others to come and share the blessing  i only wish i could hope that you would stay in albion and aid me  but i suppose there is some fair one in hellas who might object to that  no fair one that i know of returned dromas with a laugh and as i have left neither kith nor kin at home there is nothing to prevent my taking the proposal into consideration  that is good news indeed  so then i will ask you to come along with me just now and mayhap you will make up your mind while we walk  i go to fix on a site for the new town and to set the men to work  that day the voices of toilers and the sound of hatchets and the crash of falling trees were heard in the neighbourhood of the hot swamp while the prince and his friend examined the localities around in the immediate vicinity of the fountainhead  on coming to the fountain itself the young men paused to look at it as it welled up from the earth  so hot was it that they could not endure to hold their hands in it and in such volumes did it rise that it overflowed its large natural basin continually and converted a large tract of ground into a morass while finding its way by many rills and channels into the adjacent river  what a singular work of nature remarked dromas  why not saya wonderful work of god replied the prince  come now my friend let us not begin again our old discussions  what was suitable for the groves of hellas is not appropriate to the swamps of albion  i agree not with that dromas  you were ever ready to disagree bladud  nay not exactly to disagree but to argue  however i will fall in with your humour just now and wait for what you may deem a more fitting time  but what think you can be the cause of this extraordinary hot spring  fire returned the greek promptly  truly that must be so returned the prince with a laugh  you are unusually sharp this morning my friend  but what originates the fire and where is it and why does it not set the whole world on fire seeing that it must needs be under the earth  it would be better to put such questions to the wise men of egypt next time you have the chance than to me returned dromas for i am not deep enough in philosophy to answer you  nevertheless it does not seem presumptuous to make a guess  that there is abundance of fire beneath the ground on which we tread is clear from the burning mountains which you and i have seen on our way from hellas  probably there are many such mountains elsewhere for if the fire did not find an escape in many places it would assuredly burst our world asunder  what set the inside of the world on fire at the beginning is of course a puzzle and why everything does not catch fire and blaze up is another puzzlefor it is plain that if you were to set fire to the inside of your booth the outside would be shrivelled up immediately  then continued dromas knitting his brows and warming with his subject there must be a big lake under the earth somewhere and quite close to the fire which sets it aboiling and makes it boil overthus  he pointed to the fountain as he spoke  there may be truth in what you say dromas  at all events your theory is plausible and this i know that ever since i came here there has not been the slightest diminution in the volume of hot water that has poured forth from which i would conclude that it has been flowing thus from the beginning of time and that it will go on flowing thus to the end  we know not whether the reader will be inclined to class bladud among the prophets but there are some prophets who have less claim to the title for it is a fact that in this year of grace 1892 the output of hot water from the same fountain in the town of bath is one million tons every year while the quantity and the temperature never vary in any appreciable degree summer or winter from year to year  having discussed the philosophical aspect of the fountain the two friends proceeded with the work then in hand  of course as they gazed around at the richly wooded hills and attractive eminences which were not only charming sites for the little town but also well suited for fortresses to resist invasions they were naturally tempted to sacrifice the useful to the safe and beautiful fortunately wisdom prevailed and it was that day decided that the site for swamptown should be on a slope that rose gently from the river bank passed close by the hot swamp and was finally lost in the lovely woodclad terraces beyond  we must of course confine the hot stream within banks train it to the river and drain the swamp observed bladud as he sat brooding over his plans that night at supper  ay and make a pond for sick folk to dip in said dromas  and another pond for the healthy folk suggested captain arkal we like to give ourselves a wash now and then and it would never do for the healthy to go spluttering about with the sickwould it  certainly not interposed little maikar but what about the women they would need a pond for themselves would they not  assuredly they would keep us all in hot water if they didnt have one  i see said bladud still in a meditative mood  there would have to be a succession of ponds alongside of the hot stream with leads to let the water in  and other leads to let the overflow out suggested the practical arkal  just so  and booths around the ponds for people to dry themselves and dress in  ha exclaimed the prince smiting his knee with his hand i see a great thing in thisa thing that will benefit mankind as long as disease shall afflict themas long as the hot waters flow  he looked round on his friends with an air of combined solemnity and triumph  the solemnity without the triumph marked the faces of his friends as they returned the look in profound silence for they all seemed to feel that the prince was in a state of exaltation and that something approaching to the nature of a prophecy had been uttered  for a few moments they continued to gaze at each otherthen there was a general sigh as if a matter of great importance had been finally settled and the silence was at last broken by little maikar solemnly demanding another rib of roastbeef  chapter thirty one  more plots and plans  having laid the foundations of the new town drawn out his plans and set his men to work bladud appointed captain arkal superintendent and set out on his quest after his lost friend cormac taking dromas and maikar along with him and four of the menone of them being konar the hunter brownie was also an important member of the party for his master hoped much from his power of scent  meanwhile cormacalias branwen alias the little old womanforsook the refuge of the hebrews house and in her antique capacity paid a visit one afternoon to the palace of hudibras  here comes that deaf old witch again said the domestic who had formerly threatened to set the dogs at her  yes remarked the old woman when she came up to the door and the old witch has got her hearing again my sweetfaced young mangot it back in a way too that if you only heard how would make your hair stand on end your eyes turn round and the very marrow in your spine shrivel up  go and tell the princess i want to see her  oh replied the domestic with a faint effort at a sneer for he was a bold man though slightly superstitious  oh echoed the old woman  yes and tell her that if she keeps me waiting ill bring the black cloud of the boongjeegop over the palace and that will bring you all to the condition of wishing that your grandmothers had never been born  young mango  this was too much for that domestic  the unheardof horrors of the boongjeegop coupled with the tremendous energy of the final go was more than he could stand  he wentmeekly  send her to me directly said hafrydda and the humiliated servitor obeyed  dearest branwen exclaimed the princess throwing back the old womans shawl straightening her up and hugging her when they were alone how long you have been coming  where have you been  why have you forsaken me  and i have such quantities of news to tell youbut what has become of your hair  i cut it short after i fell into the hands of robbers  robbers exclaimed the princess  yesi shall tell you all about my adventures presentlyand you have no idea what difficulty i had in cutting it for the knife was so blunt that i had to cut and pull at it a whole afternoon  but it had to be done for i meant to personate a boyhaving stolen a boys hunting dress for that purpose  wasnt it fun to rob the robbers  and then and theni found your brother  you found bladud  yes andandbut ill tell you all about that too presently  it is enough to say that he is alive and wellsickness almost if not quite gone  i was so sorry for him  dear branwen said the princess with an emphatic oral demonstration  hafrydda was so loving and tender and effusive and withal so very fair that her friend could not help gazing at her in admiration  no wonder i love him said branwen  why asked the princess much amused at the straightforward gravity with which this was said  because he is as like you as your own image in a brazen shieldonly far betterlooking  indeed your manners dont seem to have been improved by a life in the woods my branwen  perhaps not  i never heard of the woods being useful for that end ah if you had gone through all that i have sufferedthethebut what news have you got to tell me  well first of all replied the princess with that comfortable interested manner which some delightful people assume when about to make revelations sit down beside me and listenand dont open your eyes too wide at first else there will be no room for further expansion at last  hereupon the princess entered on a minute account of various doings at the court which however interesting they were to branwen are not worthy of being recorded here  among other things she told her of a rumour that was going about to the effect that an old witch had been seen occasionally in the neighbourhood of beniahs residence and that all the people in the town were more or less afraid of going near the place either by day or night on that account  of course the girls had a hearty laugh over this  did they say what the witch was like asked branwen  o yes  people have given various accounts of herone being that she is inhumanly ugly that fire comes out of her coalblack eyes and that she has a long tail  but now i come to my most interesting piece of newsthat will surprise you most i thinkyour father gadarn is here  branwen received this piece of news with such quiet indifference that her friend was not only disappointed but amazed  my dear she asked why do you not gasp my father and lift your eyebrows to the roots of your hair  because i know that he is here  know it  yesknow it  i have seen him as well as your brother and father knows that i am here  oh you deceiver  that accounts then for the mystery of his manner and the strange way he has got of going about chuckling when there is nothing funny being said or doneat least nothing that i can see  hes an old goose remarked her friend  branwen said the princess in a remonstrative tone is that the way to speak of your own father  hes a dear old goose then if that will please you betterthe very nicest old goose that i ever had to do with  did he mention bladud to you  yes he said he had seen him and been helped by him in a fight they seemed to have had at the hot swamp but we could not gather much from him as to the dear boys state of health or where he lived or what he meant to do  he told us however of a mysterious boy who had nursed him in sickness and who had somehow been lost or captured and that poor bladud was so fond of the boy that he had remained behind to search for him  i now know added the princess with a laugh who this dear boy is but i am greatly puzzled still about some of his doings and intentions  listen then hafrydda and i will tell you all  as we have already told the reader all we will not tell it over again but leap at once to that point where the princess asked at the close of the narrative what her friend intended to do  that said branwen with a perplexed look and a sigh is really more than i can tell you at present  you see there are some things that i am sure of and some things that i am not quite so sure of but that i must find out somehow  for instance i am quite sure that i love your brother more than any man in the world  i am also quite sure that he is the bravest handsomest strongest best and most unselfish man that ever livedmuch about the same as my father except that being younger he is handsomer though i have no doubt my father was as goodlooking as he when he was as young  then i am also quite sure that bladud is very fond of the boy cormac buti am not at all sure that he will love the girl branwen when he sees her  but i am sure of itquite sure said the princess demonstrating orally again  at this there was a slight sound near the door of the apartment in which this confidential talk was held which induced branwen to spring up and fling it wide open thus disclosing the lately humiliated servitor with the blush of guilt upon his brow  enter cried the princess in an imperious tone looking up at the man who was unusually tall and limp  the servitor obeyed  sit down said the princess with a view to get the tall mans head on a level with her blue indignant eyes  have you heard much  not much answered the man with intense humility  i heard only a very little at the end and that so imperfectly that i dont think i can remember iti really dont  now listen said the princess with a look that was intended to scorch  you know my father  indeed i dohave known him ever since i was a boy  well if you ever breathe a word of what you have seen or heard or what you think you have seen or heard today to any one i will set my father at you and that as you know will mean roasting alive over a slow fire at the very least  and said branwen advancing and shaking her forefinger within an inch of the mans nose i will set my father at you which will mean slow torture for hours  moreover i will set the boongjeegop on your track and that will meanno i wont say what  it is too horrible even to mention  nowgo said the princess pointing to the door  the servitor went with an air of profound abasement which changed into a look of complicated amusement when he got out of sight  he is quite safe said the princess not that i count much on his fear for he is as brave as a shewolf with whelps and fears nothing but i know he likes me  i think he likes me too said branwen thoughtfully  besides i feel sure that the boongjeegop has some influence over him  yes i think we are safe  well now she continued resuming the interrupted conversation it seems to me that the only course open to me is to appear to bladud as a girl some day and see if he recognises me  yet i dont quite like it for now that it is all past and he is well again i feel half ashamed of the part i have playedyet how could i help it when i saw the poor fellow going away to diealone  you could not help it dear and you should not wish it were otherwise now never mind what you feel about it but let us lay our heads together and consider what is to be done  you think i suppose that bladud may go on for a long time searching for this youth cormac  yes for a very long time and hell never find him replied branwen with a merry laugh  well then we must find some means of getting him home without letting him know why we want him continued the princess  just so but that wont be easy returned the other with a significant look for he is very fond of cormac and wont easily be made to give up looking for him  you conceited creature you are too sure of him  not at all  only as cormac  i wish i were sure of him as branwen  perchance he might like you best as the little old woman in grey  it may be so  i think he liked me even as a witch for he patted my shoulder once so kindly  ill tell you whatill go and consult father said the princess  no you shant my dear for he is not to know anything about it just yet  but i will go and consult my father  he will give me good advice i know  the result of branwens consultation with her father was that the hebrew was summoned to his presence  an explanation took place during which gadarn attempted to look grave and dignified as became a noted northern chief but frequently turned very red in the face and vented certain nasal sounds which betrayed internal commotion  you will therefore start for the hot swamp tomorrow beniah he finally remarked and let bladud know that the king desires his return to court immediately  i have been told by the king to send him this message  but keep your own counsel hebrew and be careful not to let the prince know what you know else it will go ill with you  tell him from myself that i have at last fallen on the tracks of the lad cormac and that we are almost sure to find him in this neighbourhood away and let not thy feet take root on the road  chapter thirty two  branwen visits gunrig  before going off on his mission the hebrew paid a visit to his own residence where he found branwen busy with culinary operations sitting down on a stool he looked at her with an expression of mingled amusement and perplexity  come hither my girl he said and sit beside me while i reveal the straits to which you have brought me  verily a short time ago i had deemed it impossible for any one to thrust me so near to the verge of falsehood as you have done  i beniah exclaimed the maiden with a look of surprise on her pretty face so ineffably innocent that it was obviously hypocriticalinsomuch that beniah laughed and branwen was constrained to join him  yesyou and your father together for the puzzling man has commissioned me to set out for the hot swamp to tell bladud that he is urgently wanted at home  and he would not even allow me to open my lips when i was about to broach the subject of your disguises although he almost certainly knows all about them  what my father knows interrupted branwen with raised eyebrows  yes and you know that he knows and he knows that i know and we all know that each other knows and why there should be any objection that every one should know is more than i can  never mind beniah interrupted the girl with the slightest possible smile  you are a dear good old creature and i know you wont betray me  remember your solemn promise  truly i shall not forget it soon replied the hebrew for the trouble it has cost me already to compose answers that should not be lies is beyond your lighthearted nature to understand  ah yes indeed rejoined branwen with a sigh of mock humility i was always very lighthearted by nature  the queen used frequently to tell me sothough she never said it was by nature and the king agreed with herthough by the way he used to laugh i dont think he thought lightheartedness to be very naughty  but come beniah i am longing to hear what my father commissioned you to say or do  well he was very particular in cautioning me not to tell what i know  ah that knowledge what a dreadful thing it is to have too much of it well what more  he told me what i have already told you and bid me add from himself that he has fallen on the tracks of the lad cormac and that he is sure to be found in this neighbourhood  that at least will be no lie suggested the maid  im not so sure of that for the lad cormac will never be found here or anywhere else having no existence at all  branwen laughed at this and expressed surprise  it seems to me she said that age or recent worries must have touched your brain beniah for if the lad cormac has no existence at all how is it possible that you could meet with him at the hot swamp and even make a solemn promise to him  beniah did not reply to this question but rose to make preparation for his journey  then as if suddenly recollecting something that had escaped him he returned to his seat  my child he said i have that to tell you which will make you sad unless i greatly misunderstand your nature  gunrig your enemy is dying  that the hebrew had not misunderstood branwens nature was evident from the genuine look of sorrow and sympathy which instantly overspread her countenance  call him not my enemy she exclaimed  an enemy cannot love  but tell me about him  i had heard the report that he was recovering  it was the report of a sanguine mother who will not believe that his end is so near but she is mistaken  i saw him two days ago  the arrowhead is still rankling in his chest and he knows himself to be dying  is he much changed in appearance asked branwen  indeed he is  his great strength is gone and he submits to be treated as a childyet he is by no means childish  the manliness of his strong nature is left but the boastfulness has departed and he looks death in the face like a true warrior though i cannot help thinking that if choice had been given him he would have preferred to fall by the sword of bladud or some doughty foe who could have given him a more summary dismissal from this earthly scene  beniah i will visit him said branwen suddenly brushing back her hair with both hands and looking earnestly into the hebrews face  that will be hard for you to do and still keep yourself concealed  nothing will be easier replied the girl with some impatience you forget the old womans dress  i will accompany you as far as his dwelling  it is only an easy days journey on foot from here  but my child i go on horseback and i am to be supplied with only one horse  well my father that is no difficulty for i will ride and you shall walk  you will bring the horse here instead of starting straight from the palace  then we will set off together and i will gallop on in advance  when you reach gunrigs house in the evening you will find the horse fed and rested and ready for you to go on  but how will you return child  by using my legs man  as an old witch i can travel anywhere at night in perfect safety  according to this arrangementto which the hebrew was fain to agree the pair started off a little after daybreak the following morning branwen galloped as she had said in advance leaving her protector to make his slower way through the forest  the sun was high when the domestics of gunrigs establishment were thrown into a state of great surprise and no little alarm at sight of a little old woman in grey bestriding a goodly horse and galloping towards the house  dashing into the courtyard at full speed and scattering the onlookers right and left she pulled up with some difficulty just in time to prevent the steed going through the parchment window of the kitchen  help me down she cried looking full in the face of a lumpish lad who stood gazing at her with open eyes and mouth  dont you see i am old and my joints are stiff  be quick  there was a commanding tone in her shrill voice that brooked no delay the lumpish lad shut his mouth reduced his eyes and going shyly forward held out his hand  the old woman seized it and almost before he had time to wink stood beside him  where is gunrigs room she demanded  all the observers pointed to a door at the end of a passage  take good care of my horse  rub him well down feed him  i shall know if you dont she cried as she entered the passage and knocked gently at the door  it was opened by gunrigs mother whose swollen eyes and subdued voice told their own tale  may i come in and see him mother said branwen in her own soft voice  you are a strange visitor said the poor woman in some surprise  do you want much to see him  he is but a poor sight now  yeso yesi want very much to see him  your voice is kindly old woman  you may come in  the sight that branwen saw on entering was indeed one fitted to arouse the most sorrowful emotions of the heart for there on a rude couch of branches lay the mere shadow of the once stalwart chief the great bones of his shoulders showing their form through the garments which he had declined to take off while his sunken cheeks large glittering eyes and labouring breath told all too plainly that disease had almost completed the ruin of the body and that death was standing by to liberate the soul  who comes to disturb me at such a time mother said the dying man with a distressed look  branwen did not give her time to answer but hurrying forward knelt beside the couch and whispered in his ear  as she did so there was a sudden rush of blood to the wan cheeks and something like a blaze of the wonted fire in the sunken eyes  mother he said with something of his old strength of voice leave us for a short while  this woman has somewhat to tell me  may i not stay to hear it my son  no  you shall hear all in a very short time  just nowleave us  now branwen said the chief taking her hand in his what blessed chance has sent you here  the poor girl did not speak for when she looked at the great thin transparent hand which held hers and thought of the day when it swayed the heavy sword so deftly she could not control herself and burst into tears  oh poor poor gunrig  im so sorry to see you like thisso very very sorry  she could say no more but covered her face with both hands and wept  nay take not your hand from me said the dying man again grasping the hand which she had withdrawn its soft grip sends a rush of joy to my sinking soul  say not that you are sinking gunrig returned the girl in pitying tones for it is in the power of the allseeing one to restore you to health if it be his will  if he is allseeing then there is no chance of his restoring me to health for he has seen that i have lived a wicked life  ah  branwen you do not know what i have been  if there is a place of rewards and punishment as some tell us there is assuredly my place will be that of punishment for my life has been one of wrongdoing  and there is something within me that i have felt before but never so strong as now which tells me that there is such a place and that i am condemned to it  but i have heard from the hebrewwho reads strange things marked on a roll of white cloththat the allseeing ones nature is love and that he has resolved himself to come and save men from wrongdoing  that would be good news indeed branwen if it were true  the hebrew says it is true  he says he believes it and the allseeing one is a redeemer who will save all men from wrongdoing  would that i could find him branwen for that is what i wish  i know not whether there shall be a hereafter or not but if there is i shall hope for deliverance from wrongdoing  a place of punishment i care not much about for i never shrank from pain or feared death  what i do fear is a hereafter in which i shall live over again the old bad life and i am glad it is drawing to a close with your sweet voice sounding in my ears  i believe it was that voice which first shot into my heart the desire to do right and the hatred of wrong  i am glad to hear that gunrig though it never entered into my head i confess to do you such a good turn  and surely it must have been the allseeing one who enabled me to influence you thus and who now recalls to my mind what the hebrew read to meone of those sayings of the good men of his nation which are marked in the white roll i spoke of  it is thisgod is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble  that is a good word if it be a true one returned the chief and i hope it is  now my end is not far off  i am so glad and thankful that you have forgiven me before the end  another thing that comforts me is that bladud and i have been reconciled  bladud exclaimed the girl  ay the prince with whom i fought at the games you remember  remember ay right well do i remember  it was a notable fight  it was returned the chief with a faint smile and from that day i hated him and resolved to kill him till i met him at the hot swamp where i got this fatal wound  he nursed me there and did his best to save my life but it was not to be  yet i think that his tenderness as well as your sweet voice had something to do with turning my angry spirit round  i would see my mother now  the world is darkening and the time is getting short  the deathly pallor of the mans cheeks bore witness to the truth of his words  yet he had strength to call his mother into the room  on entering and beholding a beautiful girl kneeling and in tears where she had left a feeble old woman she almost fell down with superstitious fear deeming that an angel had been sent to comfort her sonand so indeed one had been sent in a sense though not such an one as superstition suggested  a few minutes talk with gunrig however cleared up the mystery  but the unwonted excitement and exertion had caused the sands of life to run more rapidly than might otherwise have been the case  the chiefs voice became suddenly much more feeble and frequently he gasped for breath  mother he said branwen wants to get home without any one knowing that she has been here  you will send our stoutest man with her tonight to guard her through the woods as far as the hebrews cave let him not talk to her by the way and bid him do whatever she commands  yes my dear dear son what else can i do to comfort you  come and sit beside me mother and let me lay my head on your knee you were the first to comfort me in this life and i want you to be the last  speak with branwen mother after i am gone  she will comfort you as no one else can  give me your hand mother i would sleep now as in the days gone by  the bronzed warrior laid his shaggy head on the lap where he had been so often fondled when he was a little child and gently fell into that slumber from which he never more awoke  chapter thirty three  the hebrews mission  we turn now to beniah the hebrew  on arriving at the hot swamp he was amazed to find the change that had been made in the appearance of the locality in so short a time  united action you see said captain arkal who did the honours of the new settlement in the absence of bladud and his friends these being still absent on their vain search for the lad cormac united action perseveringly continued leads to amazing results  he repeated this to himself in a low tone as if he were rather proud of having hit on a neat way of expressing a great truth which he believed was an original discovery of his own  yes he continued i have got my men you see into splendid working order  they act from morning to night in concertone consequence of which is that all is harmony and there is but one man at the helm the consequence of which is that all is power  harmony and power  i have no faith beniah in a divided command  my men work together and feed together and play together and sleep together united in the one object of carrying out the grand designs of prince bladud while i as the superintendent of the work see to it that the work is properly done  nothing could be more simple or satisfactory  or more amazing added beniah as they walked by the margin of a hot rivulet  i could scarcely have known the swamp had i not recognised its beautiful surroundings  just so it is all as i have said the result of union which i hold to be the very foundation of human power for united action is strong said the captain with enthusiasm as he originated the idea which years afterwards became the familiar proverb union is strength  most true o mariner returned beniah your wisdom reminds me of one of our kings who wrote many of our wisest sayings  ah wise sayings have their value undoubtedly returned arkal but commend me to wise doings  look here now at the clever way in which bladud has utilised this bushcovered knoll  it is made to divide this rivulet in two so that one branch as you see fills this pond which is intended for the male population of the place while the other branch fills another pondnot in sight at presentintended for the women then you see that large pond away to the left a considerable distance from the fountainheadthat is supplied by a very small stream of the hot water so that it soon becomes quite cold and branch rivulets from the cold pond to the hot ponds cool them down till they are bearable it took six days to fill up the cold pond  we have not yet got the booths made for the women to dress in continued the captain for we have no women yet in our settlement but you see what convenient ones we have set up for the men  but surely said the hebrew looking round with interest you have far more hot water than you require  yes much more  what then do you do with the surplus  we just let it run into the swamp at present as it has always done but we are digging a big drain to carry it off into the river  then when the swamp is dry we will plant eatable things in it and perhaps set up more booths and huts and dig more baths  thus in course of timewho knowswe may have a big town here and king hudibras himself may condescend to lave his royal limbs in our waters  that may well be returned the hebrew thoughtfully  the hot spring is a good gift from the allseeing one and if it cures others as it has cured prince bladud i should not wonder to see the people of the whole land streaming to the place before long  but have you given up all thought of returning to your native land arkal  do you mean to settle here  nay verilythat be far from me  have i not a fair wife in hellas who is as the light of mine eyes and a little son who is as the plague of my life  no i shall return home once more to fetch my wife and child herethen i shall have done with salt water for ever and devote myself to hot water in time to come  a wise resolve no doubt said beniah and in keeping with all your other doings  see interrupted arkal there is the river and the womens bath and the big drain that i spoke of  he pointed to a wide ditch extending from the swamp towards the river it had been cut to within a few yards of the latter and all the men of the place were busily engaged with primitive picks spades and shovels in that harmonious unity of action of which the captain had expressed such a high opinion  a few more yards of cutting and the ditch or drain would be completed when the waters of the swamp would be turned into it  those waters had been banked up at the head of the drain and formed a lake of considerable size which when the neck of land separating it from the drain should be cut would rush down the artificial channel and disappear in the river  engineering in those days however had not been studiedat least in albionto the extent which now prevails in england  the neck of land was not equal to the pressure brought to bear on it and while the captain and his friend were looking at it there appeared symptoms which caused the former some anxiety  at that moment konar the hunter came up  although attached to the settlement as hunter he had agreed to take his turn with the diggers for the water accumulated in the lake so fast that the work had to be done rapidly and every available man at the place was pressed into the service  the overseer himself even lent a hand occasionally  i dont like the look of the lower part of that neck he remarked to the hunter  konar was a man of few words  by way of reply he laid aside his bow and descended the bank to examine the weak point  he was still engaged in the investigation and bending over a moist spot when the entire mass of earth gave way and the waters burst into the drain with a gush and a roar quite indescribable  konar was swept away instantly as if he had been a feather  arkal and beniah sprang down the bank to his assistance and were themselves nearly swept into the flood which had swallowed up the hunter but konar was not quite gone  another moment and his legs appeared above the flood then his head turned up and then the raging waters tossed him as if contemptuously on a projecting spit of bank where he lay half in and half out of the torrent  in a moment both arkal and the hebrew were at the spot seized the hunter by an arm the neck of his coat and the hair of his head and drew him out of danger but no sign of life did the poor man exhibit as he lay there on the grass  meanwhile the energetic labourers at the lower end of the drain heard the turmoil and stood motionless with surprise but were unable to see what caused it owing to a thick bush which intervened  another moment and they stood aghast for round the corner of the only bend in the drain there appeared a raging head of foam with mud grass sticks stones and rubbish on its crest bearing down on them like a racehorse  with a yell that was as fully united as their method of work the men scrambled out of the drain and rushed up the bank exhibiting a unity of purpose that must have gladdened the heart of captain arkal  and they were not a moment too soon for the last man was caught by the flood and would have been swept away but for the promptitude of his fellows  hm it has saved you some work lads observed the captain with a touch of grave irony as he pointed to the portion of the bank on which they had been engaged  he was right  the flood had not only overleaped this but had hollowed it out and swept it clean away into the river thus accomplishing effectively in ten minutes what would have probably required the labour of several hours  on carrying konar up to the village of the swampafterwards swamptown later aquae sulis ultimately bathwhich had already begun to grow on the nearest height they found that bladud and his party had just arrived from the last of the searching expeditions  what  beniah exclaimed the prince when the hebrew met him  you have soon returned to us  is all well at home  all is well  i am sent on a mission to you but that is not so urgent as the case of konar  as he spoke the young men laid the senseless form on the ground bladud at once dismissing all other subjects from his mind examined him carefully while brownie snuffed at him with sympathetic interest  he lives and no bones are broken said the prince looking up after a few minutes here some of you go fetch hot water and pour it on him then rub him dry cover him up and let him rest  he has only been stunned  and let us have something to eat arkal  we are ravenous as wolves having had scarce a bite since morning  you come in good time replied the captain  our evening meal is just ready  come along then let us to work  you will join us beniah and tell me the object of your mission while we eat  the men of old may not have been epicures but there can be no question that they were tremendous eaters  no doubt living as they did constantly in fresh air having no house drains or gas and being blessed with superabundant exercise their appetites were keen and their capacities great  for at least ten minutes after the evening meal began bladud arkal dromas little maikar and the hebrew were as dumb and as busy as brownie  they spake not a single wordexcept that once the prince took a turkey drumstick from between his teeth to look up and repeat all well at home you say  to which beniah checking the course of a great wooden spoon to his lips replied all well  there was roast venison at that feast and roast turkey and roast hare and plover and ducks of various kinds all roasted and nothing whatever boiled except some sorts of green vegetables the names of which have unfortunately not been handed down to us though we have the strongest ground for believing that they were boiled in earthenware potsfor in recent excavations in bath vessels of that description have been found among the traces of the most ancient civilisation  now said the prince wiping his mouth with a bunch of grass when he came to the first pause what may be the nature of your mission beniah  let me ask first replied the hebrew also wiping his mouth with a similar pocket handkerchief have you found the lad cormac yet  no answered the prince gloomily and with a slightly surprised look for the expression of beniahs countenance puzzled him  why do you ask  because that bears somewhat on my mission  i have to deliver a message from your father the king  he bids me say that you are to return home immediately  never cried bladud with that medopersic decision of tone and manner which implies highly probable and early surrender never until i find the boydead or alive  for continued the hebrew slowly he has important matters to consider with youmatters that will not brook delay  moreover gadarn bid me say that he has fallen on the tracks of the lad cormac and that we are almost sure to find him in the neighbourhood of your fathers town  what say you exclaimed bladud dropping his drumsticknot the same one but another which he had just begunrepeat that  beniah repeated it  arkal said the prince turning to the captain i will leave you in charge here and start off by the first light tomorrow morning  see that poor konar is well cared for  maikar you will accompany me and i suppose dromas that you also will go  of course said dromas with a meaning smileso full of meaning indeed as to be quite beyond interpretation  by the way continued bladudwho had resumed the drumstickhas that fellow gadarn found his daughter branwen  beniah choked on a bone or something at that moment and looking at the prince with the strangest expression of face and tears in his eyes explained that he had notat least not to his beniahs absolutely certain knowledge  that is to say he continued in some confusion ififhe has found herwhich seems to me highly probablethere must be somesome mystery about her forit is impossible that  here the hebrew choked again with some violence  have a care man cried the prince in some alarm  however hungry a man may be he should take time to swallow  you seem to be contradicting yourself but i dont wonder in the circumstances  verily i wonder at nothing in the circumstances for they are perplexingeven distressing returned the hebrew with a sigh as he wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his coat  better not speak with your mouth full then  ah poor gadarn said bladud in an obviously indifferent tone of voice  im sorry for him girls like his daughter who are selfwilled and given to running away are a heavy affliction to parents  and truly i ought to feel sympathy with him for although i am seeking for a youth of very different character we are both so far engaged in similar worksearch for the lost  and what of my father mother and sister  all hale and hearty replied beniah with a sigh of relief and all anxious for your return especially hafrydda  at this point dromas looked at the speaker with deepened interest  she is a good girl your sister continued beniah and greatly taken up just now with that old woman you met in my cave  hafrydda has strange fancies  she might have worse fancies than being taken up with poor old women returned the prince  im rather fond of them myself and was particularly attracted by the old woman referred to  she waswhat choking again beniah  come i think you have had enough for one meal and so have we all friends therefore we had better away to roost if we are to be up betimes in the morning  chapter thirty four  bladuds return and trials  we need scarcely say that there was joy at the court of king hudibras when bladud returned home cured of his terrible disease  the first person whom the prince hurried off to visit after seeing his father and embracing his mother and sister was the northern chief gadarn  that jovial character was enjoying a siesta after the midday meal at the time but willingly arose on the prince being announced  glad to see you gadarn said bladud entering the room that had been apportioned to the chief and sitting down on a bench for visitors which according to custom stood against the inner wall of the apartment  i hope your head is clear and your arm strong  both are as they should be answered gadarn returning the salutation  i thank you replied the prince my arm is indeed strong but my head is not quite as clear as it might be  love got anything to do with it asked gadarn with a knowing look  not the love of woman if that is what you mean  truly that is what i do meanthough of course i admit that ones horses and dogs have also a claim on our affections  what is it that troubles you my son  the affectionate conclusion of this reply and the chiefs manner drew the prince towards him so that he became confidential  the truth is gadarn that i am very anxious to know what news you have of cormacfor the fate of that poor boy hangs heavy on my mind indeed i should have refused to quit the swamp in spite of the kings commands and my mothers entreaties if you had not sent that message by the hebrew  ah bladud my young friend that is an undutiful speech for a son to make about his parents said the chief holding up a remonstrative forefinger  if that is the way you treat your natural parents how can i expect thatthati mean  here the chief was seized with a fit of sneezing so violent that it made the prince quite concerned about the safety of his nose  ha exclaimed gadarn as a final wind up to the last sneeze the air of that swamp seems to have been too strong for me  im growing old you see  wellwhat was i sayingnever mind  you were referring to that poor lad cormac  yes i have news of him  good news i hope said the prince anxiously  o yesvery good excellent  that is to sayrathersomewhat indefinite news forfor the person who saw him told mein fact it is difficult to explain because people are often untrustworthy and exaggerate reports so that it is not easy to make out what is true and what is false or whether both accounts may be true or the whole thing false altogether  you see bladud our poor brains continued the chief in an argumentative tone are sosoqueerly mixed up that one cannot telltellwhy there was once a fellow in my army whose manner of reporting any event no matter how simple was so incomprehensible that it was impossible totobut let me tell you an anecdote about him  his name was  forgive my interrupting you chief but i am so anxious to hear something about my lost friend that  ha  bladud i fear that you are a selfish man for you have not yet asked about my lost daughter  indeed i am not by any means indifferent about her butbut you know i have never seen her and to tell the plain truth my anxiety about the boy drove her out of my mind for the moment  have you found her  ay that i have as well and hearty as ever she was though somewhat more beautiful and a trifle more mischievous  but i will introduce her to you tomorrow  there is to be a grand feast is there not at the palace  yes something of the sort i believe in honour of my return answered the prince a good deal annoyed by the turn the conversation had taken  well then you shall see her then for she has only just arrived and is too tired to see any one continued gadarn with a suppressed yawn and youll be sure to fall in love with her but you had better not for her affections are already engaged  i give you fair warning so be on your guard  the prince laughed and assured his friend that there was no fear as he had seen thousands of fair girls both in east and west but his heart had never yet been touched by one of them  at this the chief laughed loudly and assured bladud that his case had now reached a critical stage for when young men made statements of that kind they were always on the point of being conquered  but leave me now bladud he continued with a yawn so vast that the regions around the uvula were clearly visible im frightfully sleepy and you know you have shortened my nap this afternoon  the prince rose at once  at all events he said i am to understand before i go that cormac has been seen  o yes  certainly no doubt about that  and is well  quite well  fain to be content with this in the meantime bladud hurried to the apartment of his sister  hafrydda he exclaimed has gadarn gone out of his mind  i believe not she replied sitting down beside her brother and taking his hand  why do you ask  because he talksi say it with all respectlike an idiot  hafrydda laughed and her brother thereupon gave her a full account of the recent interview  now my sister you were always straightforward and wise  give me a clear answer  has cormac been found  no he has not been found but  then interrupted bladud in a savage tone that was very foreign to his nature gadarn is a liar  oh brother say not so  how can i help it  he gave me to understand that cormac has been foundat least well no not exactly found but seen and heard of im no better than the rest of you continued bladud with a sarcastic laugh  it seems as if there were something in the air just now which prevents us all from expressing ourselves plainly  well then brother said hafrydda with a smile if he told you that cormac has been seen and heard of and is well surely that may relieve your mind till tomorrow when i know that some one who knows all about the boy is to be at our festival  we begin it with games as usual shall you be there  id rather not replied the prince almost testily but of course it would be ungracious not to appear  this however i do know that i shall take no part in the sports  as you please brother  we are only too glad to have you home again to care much about that  but now i have something of importance to tell you about myself  bladud was interested immediately and for the moment forgot his own troubles as he gazed inquiringly into the fair countenance of the princess  i am going to wed brother  indeed  you do not surprise me though you alarm mei know not why who is the mannot gunrig i hope  alas no  poor gunrig is dead  dead  ah poor man  i am glad we met at the swamp  bladud looked sad for a moment but did not seem unduly oppressed by the news  the man who has asked me to wed is your friend dromas  what exclaimed the prince in blazing surprise not unmingled with delight  the man has been here only a few hours  he must have been very prompt  it does not take many hours to ask a girl to wed and i like a prompt man returned the princess looking pensively at the floor  but tell me how came it all about  how did he manage it in so short a time  well brother dearbut youll never tell any one will you  nevernever  well you must know when we first met wewe  fell in love  poor helpless things  just so brother we fell somehow inwhatever it was and he told me with his eyesandandi told him with mine  then he went off to find you and came back having found youfor which i was very grateful then he went to father and asked leave to speak to me  then he went to mother  what they said i do not know but he came straight to me took my hand fixed his piercing black eyes on me and said hafrydda i love you  was that all asked bladud  yes that was all he said butbut that was not the end of the interview  it would probably have lasted till now if you had not interrupted us  im so very sorry sister but of course i did not know that  they were interrupted at that moment by the servitor to whom the reader has already been introduced  he entered with a brightly intelligent grin on his expressive face but on beholding bladud suddenly elongated his countenance into blank stupidity  the old woman waits outside princess  oh send her here at once  then when the servitor had left this is the person i mentioned who knows about cormac  another moment and the little old woman in the grey shawl was ushered in  she started visibly on beholding bladud  come in granny  i did not expect you till tomorrow  i thought i was to see you alone said the old woman testily in her hard metallic voice  that is true granny but i thought you might like to see my brother bladud who has just returned home safe and well  no i dont want to see your brother  what do i care for peoples brothers  i want to see yourself alone  let me congratulate you at all events interposed the prince kindly on your having recovered your hearing grannie  this is not the first time we have met hafrydda but i grieve to see that my old friends nerves are not so strong as they used to be  you tremble a good deal  yes i tremble more than i like returned the old woman peevishly and perhaps when you come to my age young man and have got the palsy youll tremble more than i do  nay be not angry with me  i meant not to hurt your feelings and since you wish to be alone with my sister i will leave you  when he was gone branwen threw back the grey shawl and stood up with flashing tearful eyes  was it kindwas it wise hafrydda to cause me to run so great a risk of being discovered  forgive me dear branwen i did not mean to do it but you arrived unexpectedly and i let you come in without thinking  besides i knew you could easily deceive him  nobody could guess it was younot even your own mother  there must be some truth in that returned the maiden quickly changing her mood and laughing for i deceived my own father yesterday  at the swamp he found me out at once as cormac for i had to speak in my natural voice and my full face was exposed but the grey shawl and the metallic voice were too much for him  dear good patient old man you have no notion what a fearful amount of abuse he took from me without losing temperand i gave him some awful homethrusts too  i felt almost tempted to kiss him and beg his pardon but now hafrydda i am beginning to be afraid of what all this deceiving and playing the doubleface will come to  and im ashamed of it tooi really am  what will bladud think of me when he finds out wont he despise and hate me  indeed he will not  i know his nature well returned the princess kissing and trying to reassure her friend whose timid look and tearful eyes seemed to indicate that all her selfconfidence and courage were vanishing  he loves you already and love is a preventive of hate as well as a sovereign remedy for it  ay he is fond of cormac i know but that is a very different thing from loving branwen  however tomorrow will tell  if he cares only for the boy and does not love the girl i shall return with my father to the far north and you will never see branwen more  chapter thirty five  the plot thickens  during the residence of gadarn at the court of king hudibras that wily northern chief had led the king to understand that one of his lieutenants had at last discovered his daughter branwen in the hands of a band of robbers from whom he had rescued her and that he expected her arrival daily  but what made the poor child run away asked the king at one of his interviews with his friend  we were all very fond of her and she of us i have good reason to believe  i have been told replied the chief that it was the fear of gunrig  gunrig  why the man was to wed my daughter  she had no need to fear him  that may be so but i knowthough it is not easy to remember how i came to know itthat gunrig had been insolent enough to make up to her after he was defeated by bladud and she was so afraid of him that she ran away and thus fell into the hands of robbers  while the chief was speaking hudibras clenched his hands and glared fiercely  dared he to think of another girl when he was engaged to my daughter he said between his teeth  it is well that gunrig is dead for assuredly i would have killed him  it is well indeed returned gadarn for if your killing had not been sufficient i would have made it more effectual  but he is out of the way now so we may dismiss him  trueand when may we expect branwen back again poor child asked the king  in a day or two at latest  from what was told me by the runner who was sent on in advance it is possible that she may be here tomorrow in time for the sports  the wily chief had settled it in his own mind that branwen should arrive exactly at the time when there was to be a presentation of chiefs which ceremony was to take place just before the commencement of the sports this arrangement he had come to in concert with a little old woman in a grey shawl who paid him a private visit daily  do you know gadarn who this youth cormac is whom bladud raves so much about  the northern chief was seized at that moment with one of those violent fits of sneezing to which of late he had become unpleasantly subject  oh yeyeyha yesexcuse me king but since i went to that hot swamp something seems to have gone wrong wiwiha my nose  something will go worse wrong with it chief if you go on like that i thought the last one must have split it  well what know you about cormac  that he appears to be a very good fellow  i can say nothing more about him than that except that your son seems to think he owes his life to his good nursing at a critical point in his illness  i know that well enough returned the king for bladud has impressed it on me at least a dozen times  he seems to be very grateful  indeed so am i and it would please me much if i had an opportunity of showing my gratitude to the lad  think you that there is any chance of finding out where he has disappeared to  not the least chance in the world  indeed exclaimed the king in surprise  that is strange for bladud who has just left me says that he has the best of reasons for believing that we shall have certain news of him tomorrow  but go gadarn and consult my doctor about this complaint of yours which interrupts conversation so awkwardly  we can resume our talk at some other time  gadarn obediently went holding his sides as if in agony and sneezing in a manner that caused the rooftree of the palace to vibrate  returning to his own room he found the little old woman in grey awaiting him  youve been laughing again father she said  i see by the purpleness of your face  youll burst yourself at last if you go on so  oh you little old hagoh  cormacoh  branwen i hope you wont be the death of me cried the chief flinging his huge limbs on a couch and giving way to unrestrained laughter till the tears ran down his cheeks  if they did not all look so grave when speaking about you it wouldnt be so hard to bear  its the gravity that kills me  but come branwen he added as he suddenly checked himself and took her hand what makes you look so anxious my child  because i feel frightened and ashamed and miserable she answered with no symptom of her sires hilarity  i doubt if i should have followed bladudbut if i had not he would have diedand i dont like to think of all the deceptions i have been practisingthough i couldnt very well help itcould i  then i fear that bladud will forget cormac when he learns to despise branwen  despise branwen shouted gadarn fiercely as his hand involuntarily grasped the hilt of his sword  if he did i would cleave him from his skull to his waist  quiet you my sweet father said branwen with a little smile you know that two can play at that game and that you have a skull and a waist as well as bladudthough your waist is a good deal thicker than his  im not so sure about the skull  i accept your reproof child for boastfulness is hateful in a warrior but get up my love  what would happen if some one came into the room and found a little old hag sitting on my knee with her arm around my neck  ah true father  i did not think of that  im rather given to not thinking of some things  perhaps that inquisitive servitor may beno hes not there this time said branwen reclosing the door and sitting down on a stool beside the chief  now come father and learn your lesson  gadarn folded his hands and looked at his child with an air of meek humility  well  well first of all you must tell the king tomorrow at the right time that i have just come back and am very tired and shall not appear till you take me to him while the other people are being presented  then you will lead me forward and announce me with a loud voice so that no one shall fail to hear that i am branwen your daughter you understand now mind you speak well out  i understandwith a shout something like my battlecry  not exactly so loud as that but so as bladud shall be sure to hear you and he will probably be near to his father at the time  just so  what next  oh thats all you will have to do  just retire among the other courtiers then and leave the rest to me  thats a very short lesson my little one would you not like to be introduced to bladud too  he does not know you you know  certainly not that would ruin allyou dear old goose  just do exactly what i tell you and you will be sure to go right  how like your dear mother you are my little one in your modest requirements  having finished the lesson the little old woman retired to a remote part of the palace which through hafryddas influence had been assigned to her and the great northern chief unbuckling his swordbelt called lustily for his midday meal  customs at that date you see were more freeandeasy than they are now and less ceremonious  the visitors at the palace of king hudibras were expected only to appear at the royal board at the evening meal after all the business or pleasure of each day was over  at all other times they were supposed to do as they pleased and shout for food as they happened to require it  it is perhaps unnecessary to comment on the exceeding convenience of this custom leaving as it did every one to follow the bent of inclination from earliest morn till dewy eve with the prospect of an enjoyable reunion after darkduring which of course the adventures of each were narrated exaggerated underrated or commented on as the case might be and the social enjoyments were enhanced by warlike and sentimental song as well as by more or lessusually more than less thrilling story  chapter thirty six  the denouement  it was a sunny frosty glorious forenoon when king hudibras awoke to the consciousness of the important day that was before him and the importunate vacuum that was within him  springing out of bed with a right royal disregard of appearances he summoned his servitorinwaiting and ordered breakfast  in the breakfastroom he met the queen hafrydda bladud and dromas the latter being now considered one of the familyand these five proceeded to discuss and arrange the proceedings of the day during the progress of the meal  you will join in the sports of course son dromas said the king and show us how the olympic victors carry themselves  ha  i should not wonder if a few of our lads will give you some trouble to beat them  you may be right father returned the young man modestly for one of your lads has already beaten me at most things  you mean bladud returned the king  dromas is only so far right interposed the prince  it is true that where mere brute force is required i usually have the advantage but where grace and speed come into play i am lost  of course dromas would not admit this and of course hafryddas fair cheeks were crimsoned when the youth accidentally looking up caught the princess accidentally gazing at him and still more of course the king who was sharp as a needle in such matters observed their confusion and went into a loud laugh which he declared was only the result of merry thoughts that were simmering in his brain  the reception was to be held in the large hall of the palace  no ladies were to be presented for it must be remembered that these were barbarous times and woman had not yet attained to her true position indeed there was to be no ceremony whateverno throne no crown no goldsticks in waiting or other sticks of any kind  it was to be a sort of freeandeasy conversazione in the presence of the royal family where just before the sports began any one who was moved by that ambition might hold personal intercourse with the king and converse with him either on the affairs of state or on private matters or subjects of a more light and social kindsuch as the weather  at the appointed hourwhich was indicated by that rough and ready but most natural of sundials the shadow of a tree falling on a certain spotthe royal family adjourned to the large hall and the unceremonious ceremony began  first of all on the doors being thrown open a crowd of noblesor warriorsentered and while one of them went to the king and began an earnest entreaty that war might be declared without delay against a certain chief who was particularly obnoxious to him another sauntered up to the princess and began a mild flirtation in the primitive manner which was characteristic of the sons of mars in that dayto the unutterable jealousy of dromas who instantly marked him down as a fit subject for overwhelming defeat at the approaching games  at the same time the family doctor paid his respects to the queen and began to entertain her with graphic accounts of recent casesfor doctors had no objection to talking shop in those days  we have said that no ladies were admitted to places of public importance such as grandstands or large halls but we have also pointed out that the ladies of the royal family and their female friends formed an exception to the rule  it was as it were the dawn of womens freedomthe insertion of the small end of that wedge which christianity and civilisation were destined to drive homesometimes too far home  gradually the hall began to fill and the hum of conversation became loud when there was a slight bustle at the door which caused a modification though not a cessation of the noise  it was caused by the entrance of gadarn leading branwen by the hand the girl was now dressed in the costume that befitted her age and sex and it is best described by the word simplicity  her rich auburn hair fell in short natural curls on her neckthe luxuriant volume of it having as the reader is aware been sacrificed some time before  she wore no ornament of any kind save on one side of her beautiful head a small bunch of wildflowers that had survived the frost  at the time of their entrance bladud was stooping to talk with hafrydda and did not observe them but when he heard gadarns sonorous voice he turned with interest to listen  king hudibras said the northern chief in a tone that produced instant silence i have found the lost onemy daughter branwen  as they moved through the crowd of tall warriors bladud could not at first catch sight of the girl  ha  hafrydda he said with a pleasant smile your young friend and companion found at last  i congratulate you  im so glad that  he stopped the colour fled from his cheeks his chest heaved  he almost gasped for breath  could he believe his eyes for there stood a girl with the features the hair the eyes of cormac but infinitely more beautiful  for some time the poor prince stood utterly bereft of speech fortunately no one observed him as all were too much taken up with what was going on  the king clasped the girls hands and kissed her on both cheeks  then the queen followed and asked her how she could have been so cruel as to remain so long away  and branwen said a few words in reply  it seemed as if an electric shock passed through bladud for the voice also was the voice of cormac  at this point the prince turned to look at his sister  she was gazing earnestly into his face  hafryddaisis that really branwen  yes brother that is branwen  i must go to her  as she spoke she started off at a run and threw her arms round her friends neck  i cannotcannot believe it is you she exclaimed aloudand then whispering in branwens ear oh you wicked creature to make such a hypocrite of me  but come she added aloud come to my room  i must have you all to myself alone  for one moment as they passed branwen raised her eyes and as they met those of the prince a deep blush overspread her face  another moment and the two friends had left the hall together  we need not weary the reader by describing the games and festivities that followed  such matters have probably been much the same in all important respects since the beginning of time  there was a vast amount of enthusiasm and willingness to be contented with little on the part of the people and an incredible desire to talk and delay matters and waste time on the part of judges umpires and starters but there was nothing particularly noteworthy except that bladud consented to run one race with his friend dromas and was signally beaten by him to the secret satisfaction of hafrydda and the open amusement of the king  but branwen did not appear at the games nor did she appear again during the remainder of that day and poor bladud was obliged to restrain his anxiety for he felt constrained to remain beside his father and somehow he failed in his various attempts to have a few words of conversation with his mother  at last like all sublunary things the games came to an end and the prince hastened to his sisters room  may i come in he asked knocking  yes brother  there was a peculiar tone in her voice and a curious expression in her eyes that the prince did not fail to note  hafrydda he exclaimed eagerly there is no cormac  true brother there is no cormacthere never was  branwen and cormac are one  and you knew itand she knew it all along  oh why did you agree to deceive me  nay brother i did not mean to deceive youat least not at first neither did branwen  i knew nothing about it till she came home after being with you at the swamp and told me that she was impelled by sheer pity to follow you intending to nurse you thinking at first that we had let you go to die alone  then she was caught in the woods by robbers and she only escaped from them by putting on a boys dress and running away  they gave chase however caught her up and had it not been for you would have recaptured her  the rest you know  but now brother i am jealous for my dear friend  she has expressed fear that in her great pity for you she may be thought to have acted an unwomanly part and that you will perhaps despise her  unwomanly despise exclaimed bladud in amazement  hafrydda do you regard me as a monster of ingratitude  nay brother that do i not  i think that you could never despise one who has felt such genuine pity for you as to risk and endure so much  hafrydda do you think there is no stronger feeling than pity for me in the heart of branwen asked bladud in a subdued earnest voice  that you must find out for yourself brother answered the princess yet after all if you are only fond of cormac what matters the feeling that may be in the heart of branwen  are you in love with her already bladud after so short an acquaintance  in love with her exclaimed the prince  there is no cormac  there is but one woman in the wide world now  that is not complimentary to your mother and myself i fear interrupted his sister  but continued the prince paying no regard to the interruption is there any chanceany hopeofofsomething stronger than pity being in her heart  i say again ask that of herself bladud but now i think of it added the princess leaping up in haste i am almost too late to keep an appointment with dromas  she went out hurriedly and the prince full of newborn hopes mingled with depressing anxieties went away into the neighbouring woods to meditatefor in the haste of her departure hafrydda had neglected to tell him where branwen was to be found and he shrank from mentioning her name to any one else  but accidentas we call itsometimes brings about what the most laboured design fails to accomplish  owing to a feeling of anxiety which she could not shake off branwen had gone out that evening to cool her fevered brow in the woods just a few minutes before the prince entered them  it was a strange coincidence but are not all coincidences strange  seating herself on a fallen tree she cast up her eyes towards the sky where a solitary star like a beacon of hope was beginning to twinkle she had not been there more than a few minutes when a rustle in the neighbouring thicket startled her  almost before she had time to look round the prince stood before her  she trembled for now she felt that the decisive hour had comewhether for good or evil  seating himself beside her the prince took one of her hands in his and looked steadily into her downcast face  cormbran he began and stopped  she looked up  branwen he said in a low calm voice will it pain you very much to know that i am gladinexpressibly gladthat there is no youth cormac in all the wide world  whether she was pained or not the girl did not say but there was a language in her eyes which induced bladud to slip his disengaged arm roundwell well there are some things more easily conceived than described  she seemed about to speak but bladud stopped her mouth how we need not tellnot rudely you may be suresuffice to say that when the moon arose an hour later and looked down into the forest that evening she saw the prince and branwen still seated hand in hand on the fallen tree gazing in rapt attention at the stars  chapter thirty seven  the last  when bladud walked out to the hebrews hut next day and informed him of what had taken place that longsuffering man heaved a deep sigh and expressed his intense relief that the whole affair was at last cleared up and had come to an end  i cannot view matters in the same light that you do beniah said the prince for in my opinion things have only now come to a satisfactory beginning  however i suppose that you are thinking of the strange perplexities in which you have been involved so long  i would not style them perplexities prince but intriguesobvious and unjustifiable intriguesin which innocent persons have been brought frequently to the verge of falsehoodif they have not indeed been forced to overstep the boundary  surely beniah circumstances against which none of us had power to contend had somewhat to do with it all as well as intrigue  i care not returned the hebrew whether it was the intrigues of your court or the circumstances of it which were the cause of all the mess in which i and others have been involved but i am aweary of it and have made up my mind to leave the place and retire to a remote part of the wilderness where i may find in solitude solace to my exhausted spirit and rest to my old bones  that will never do beniah said the prince laughing  you take too serious a view of the matter  there is no fear of any more intrigues or circumstances arising to perplex you for some time to come  besides i want your services very muchbut before broaching that point let me ask why you have invited me to come to see you here  hafrydda gave me your message  my message repeated the hebrew in surprise  yesto meet you here this forenoon on urgent business  if it is anything secret you have to tell me i hope you have not got your wonderful old witch in the back cave for she seems to have discovered as thorough a cure for deafness as i found for leprosy at the hot swamp  wonderful old witch repeated beniah with a dazed look and a tone of exasperation that the prince could not account for  do you then not know about that old woman  oh yes i know only too much about her replied bladud  she has been staying at the palace for some time as you know and rather a lively time the old hag has given us  she went in to see my mother one day and threw her into convulsions from which i think she has hardly recovered yet  then she went to my fathers roomthe chief gadarn and i were with him at the timeand almost before she had time to speak they went into fits of laughter at her till the tears ran down their cheeks  i must say it seemed to me unnecessarily rude and unkind for although the woman is a queer old thing and has little more of her face visible than her piercing black eyes i could see nothing to laugh at in her shrivelledup bent little body  besides this she has kept the domestics in a state of constant agitation for most of them seem to think her a limb of the evil spirit  but what makes you laugh so  oh  i see now returned the hebrew controlling himself by a strong effort  i understand now why the old woman wished to be present at our interview  come forth thou unconscionable hag added beniah in the voice of a stentor and do your worst  i am past emotion of any kind whatever now  as he spoke he gazed with the resigned air of a martyr at the inner end of his cavern  bladud also looked in that direction  a moment later and the little old woman with the grey shawl appeared thrust out the plank bridge crossed over and tottered towards them  dearie me  beniah theres no need to yell so loud  you know ive got back my hearing  what want ye with me  im sure i have no wish to pry into the secrets of this young man or yourself  what dye want  but beniah stood speechless a strange expression on his face his lips firmly compressed and his arms folded across his breast  have you become as dumb as i was deaf old man asked the woman petulantly  still the hebrew refused to speak  have patience with him old woman said bladud in a soothing tone he is sometimes taken with unaccountable fits  fits interrupted the old woman  i wish he had the fits that i have sometimes  perhaps they would cure him of his impudence  they would cure you too young man of your stupidity  stupidity echoed bladud much amused  i have been credited with pride and haste and many other faults in my day but never with stupidity  was it not stupid of you to go and ask that silly girl to wed youthat doublefaced thing that knows how to cheat and deceive and  come come old woman said the prince repressing with difficulty a burst of indignation  you allow your old tongue to wag too freely  i suppose he added turning to beniah that we can conclude our conversation outside  but the hebrew still remained immovable and sternly dumb  unable to understand this bladud turned again to the old woman but lo the old woman was gone and in her place stood branwen erect with the grey shawl thrown back and a halftimid smile on her face  to say that bladud was thunderstruck is not sufficient to indicate his condition  he stood as if rooted to the spot with his whole being concentrated in his wideopen blue eyes  is my presumption too great bladud asked the girl hesitatingly  i did but wish to assure you that i have no other deceptions to practise that i feari hopethat  the prince recovering himself sprang forward and once again stopped her mouthnot with his hand oh by no meanswhile beniah with that refinement of wisdom which is the prerogative of age stepped out to ascertain whether it happened to be rain or sunshine that ruled at the time  curiously enough he found that it was the latter  that evening the doctor of the royal household was summoned by an affrighted servitor to the apartment of gadarn who had been overheard choking  the alarmed man of medicine went at once and bursting into the room without knocking found the great northern chief sitting on the edge of his couch purple in the face and with tears in his eyes  the exasperated man leaped up intending to kick the doctor out but changing his mind he kicked the horrified servitor out instead and taking the doctor into his confidence related to him an anecdote which had just been told to him by bladud  it will be the death of the king said gadarn  you had better go to him  he may need your services  but the king was made of sterner stuff than his friend imagined  he put strong constraint upon himself and being not easily overcome by feelingor anything else under the sunhe lived to relate the same anecdote to his wife and daughter  the day following bladud resumed with the hebrew the conversation that had been interrupted by branwen  i was going to have said to you beniah that i want your services very much  you had said that much prince before brani mean corthat is the old womaninterrupted us  how can i serve you  by going back with me to the hot swamp and helping to carry out a grand scheme that i have in my brain  the hebrew shook his head  i love not your grand schemes he said somewhat sternly  the last grand scheme that your father had was one which if successfully carried out would have added a large portion of albion to his dominions and would have swept several tribes off the face of the earth  as it was the mere effort to carry it out cost the lives of many of the best young men on both sides and left hundreds of mothers wives sisters and children to mourn their irreparable losses and to wonder what all the fighting was about  indeed there are not a few greybearded men who share that wonder with the women and children and who cannot by any effort of their imagination see what advantage is gained by either party when the fight is over  these greybeards must be thickskulled then replied the prince with a smile for does not the victor retain the land which he has conquered  yea truly and he also retains the tombs of the goodly young men who have been slain and also the widows and sweethearts and the national loss resulting from the warfor all which the land gained is but a paltry return  moreover if the allseeing one cared only for the victors there might be some understanding of the matterthough at the cost of justicebut seeing that he cares for the vanquished quite as much as for the victorious the gain on one side is counterbalanced by the loss on the other side while the world at large is all the poorer first by the loss of much of its best blood second by the creation of a vast amount of unutterable sorrow and bitter hatred and third by a tremendous amount of misdirected energy  look for instance at the hot swamp  before the late war it was the abode of a happy and prosperous population  now it is a desolation hundreds of its youth are in premature graves and nothing whatever has been gained from it by your father that i can see  but surely men must defend themselves and their women and children against foes said bladud  verily i did not say they should not replied beniah  selfdefence is a duty aggressive war in most cases i do not say in all is a blunder or a sin  i think that my mind runs much on the same line with yours beniah as to these things but i am pretty sure that a good many years will pass over us before the warriors of the present day will see things in this light  one is apt to smile at bladuds prophetic observation when one reflects that about two thousand seven hundred years have elapsed since that day and warriors as well as many civilians have not managed to see it in this light yet  however continued the prince the scheme which runs in my head is not one of waraggressive or defensivebut one of peace for the betterment of all mankind  as you know i have begun to build a city at the hot swamp so that all who are sick may go to that beautiful country and find health as i did  and i want your help in this scheme  that is well prince but i see not how i can aid you  i am not an engineer who could carry out your devices nor an architect who could plan your dwellings  and i am too old for manual labourthough of course it is not for that you want me  you are right beniah  it is not for that  i have as many strong and willing hands to work as i require but i want wise heads full of years and experience which may aid me in council and guard me from the blunders of youth and inexperience  besides man was not it seems to me put into this world merely to enjoy himself  if he was then are the brutes his superiors for they have no cares no anxieties about food or raiment or housing and they enjoy themselves to the full as long as their little day lasts  there is surely some nobler end for man and as you have given much study to the works and ways and reputed words of the allseeing one i want you to aid me in helping men to look upwardto soar like the eagle above the things of earth as well as to consider the interests of others and so as far as may be unlearn selfishness  will you join me for this end  that will i with joy answered the hebrew with kindling eye but your ambition soars high prince  have you spoken to branwen on these subjects  of course i have and she like a true woman enters heartily into my plans  like myself she does not think that being wedded and happy is the great end of life but only the beginning of it  when the wedding is over our minds will then be set free to devote ourselves to the great work before us  and what duties in the work will fall to the lot of branwen asked beniah with an amused look  the duties of a wife of course returned the prince  she will lend a sympathetic ear to all plans and proposals her ingenious imagination will suggest ideas that might escape my grosser mind her brilliant fancy will produce combinations that my duller brain would never think of her hopeful spirit will encourage me to perseverance where accident or disaster has a tendency to demoralise and her loving spirit will comfort me should failure great or small be permitted to overtake me all this i admit sounds very selfish but you asked me what part branwen should play in regard to my schemes  if you had asked me what part i am to play in her life and work the picture might be inverted to some extentfor our lives will be mutualthough of course i can never be to her what she will be to me  with this exalted idea of the married state prince bladud looked forward to his wedding  whether dromas was imbued with similar ideas we cannot tell but of this we are sure that he was equally devoted to the princessas far as outward appearance wentand he entered with keenest zest and appreciation into the plans and aspirations of his friend with regard to the welfare of mankind in general and the men of albion in particular  not many days after that there was a double wedding at hudibras town which created a tremendous sensation throughout all the land  for although news travelled slowly in those days the fame of bladud and his wonderful cure and his great size and athletic powers coupled with his eastern learning and warlike attainments and peaceful proclivities not to mention the beauty and romantic adventures of his bride had made such an impression on what may be styled the whole nation that noted chiefs came from all parts far and near to his wedding bringing as many of their distinguished followers with them as they deemed necessary to safe travelling in an unsettled country  some even came from the great western island called erin and others from the remote isle of the north which lay beyond gadarns country and was at a later period named ultima thule  i wonder when theyre going to stop coming remarked gadarn to king hudibras as the selfinvited guests came pouring in  let them come replied the jovial king with the air of a man of unlimited means  the more the merrier  theres room for all and the forests are big  some of them i see rejoined gadarn are my mortal foes  we shall now have a chance of becoming mortal friends  it might be supposed that the assemblage of such a host from all points of the compass would as it is sometimes expressed eat king hudibras out of house and home but this was not so for it was the custom at that time for visitors at royal courts to hunt for their victualsto go in as it were for a grand picnic on a continuous basis so that the palace of our king instead of being depleted became surfeited with food  as his preserves were extensive and game of all kinds abundant the expense attendant on this kind of hospitality was nil  it would have been very much the reverse had it been necessary to supply drink but the art of producing liquids which fuddle stupefy and madden had not yet been learnt in this country  consequently there was no fighting or bloodshed at those jovial festivities though there was a certain amount of quarrellingas might be expected amongst independent men who held different opinions on many subjects although politics and theology had not yet been invented  great were the rejoicings when it was discovered by each band as it arrived that there was to be a double wedding that the princess hafrydda was to be one of the brides and that the fortunate man who had won her was a famous warrior of the mysterious east and one of the victors at the great games of that part of the world  how the ceremony of marriage was performed we have not after the most painstaking research been able to ascertain but that it was performed somehow and to the satisfaction of all concerned we are absolutely certain from the fact that bladud and branwen dromas and hafrydda lived happily together as man and wife for many years afterwards and brought up large families of stalwart sons and daughters to strengthen the power and increase the prestige of old albion  this however by the way  of course the chief amusement of the guests was games followed by songs and dancing in the evenings  and one of the favourite amusements at the games was scientific boxing for that was an entirely new art to the warriors alike of albion erin and ultima thule  it first burst upon their senses as a new and grand idea when bladud and dromas at the urgent request of their friends stepped into the arena and gave a specimen of the manner in which the art was practised in hellas  of course they did not use what we call knuckledusters nor did they even double their fists except when moving round each other and as gloves were unknown they struck out with the hands half open for they had no wish to bleed each others noses or black each others eyes for mere amusement  at the beginning it was thought that dromas was no match at all for the gigantic bladud but when the wonderful agility of the former was seen the ease with which he ducked and turned aside his head to evade blows and the lightning speed with which he countered giving a touch on the forehead or a dig in the ribs smiling all the time as if to say how dye like it mens minds changed with shouts of surprise and satisfaction  and they highly approved of the way in which the champions smilingly shook hands after the bout was overas they had done before it began  they did not however perceive the full value of the art until an ambitious young chief from ultima thulea man of immense size and rugged mould with red hairinsisted on dromas giving him a lesson  the man from hellas declined at first but the man from thule was urgent and there seemed to be a feeling among the warriors that the young hellene was afraid  it is so difficult he explained to hit lightly and swiftly that sometimes an unintentionally hard blow is given and men are apt to lose their tempers  this was received with a loud laugh by the thuler  what  i lose my temper on account of a friendly buffet  besides i shall take care not to hit hardyou need not fear  as you will returned dromas with a goodhumoured smile  the thuler stood up and allowed his instructor to put him in the correct attitude  then the latter faced him and said now guard yourself  next moment his left hand shot out and gently touched his opponents nose  the thuler received the touch with what he deemed an orthodox smile and tried to guard it after it had been delivered  then he struck out with his leftbeing an apt pupilbut dromas drew back and the blow did not reach him  then he struck out smartly with his right but the hellene put his head to one side and let it pass again he struck out rapidly one hand after the other without much care whether the blows were light or heavy  dromas evaded both without guarding and in reply gave the thuler a smartish touch on his unfortunate nose  this was received by the assemblage with a wild shout of surprise and delight and the thuler became grave collected himself as if for real business and suddenly let out a shower of blows which had they taken effect would soon have ended the match but his blows only fell on air for dromas evaded them with ease returning every now and then a tap on the old spot or a touch on the forehead  at last seeing that the man was losing temper he gave him a sharp dig in the wind which caused him to gasp and a sounding buffet on the cheek which caused him to howl with rage and feel for the hilt of his sword  that dangerous weapon however had been judiciously removed by his friends  he therefore rushed at his antagonist resolved to annihilate him but was received with two genuine blowsone in the wind the other on the forehead which stretched him on the sward  the thuler rose therefrom with a dazed look and accepted the hellenes friendly shake of the hand with an unmeaning smile  after the sports had continued for several days king hudibras proposed an excursiona sort of gigantic picnicto the hot swamp where bladud and his friend had made up their mind to spend their honeymoon  arrived there they found that immense progress had been made with the new cityinsomuch that dromas assured hafrydda that it brought to his mind some very ancient fables of great cities rising spontaneously from the ground to the sound of pipes played by the gods  the baths too were in such an advanced stage that they were able to fill them on the arrival of the host and allow the interested and impatient chiefs to bathe  dont let them go in till you give the signal that the baths are ready said gadarn to the king in that grave suppressed manner which indicated that the northern chief was inclined to mischief  why asked the king  because as i understand you love fair play and no favour  it would not be fair to let some begin before others  they might feel it you know and quarrel  very well so be it returned the king and gave orders that no one was to go near the baths until they were quite full when he would give the signal  the chiefs and warriors entering into the spirit of the thing took quite a boyish delight in stripping themselves and preparing for a rush  now are you ready said the king  ay all ready  away then  the warlike host rushed to the brink of the largest bath and plunged insome head others feet first  but they came out almost as fast as they went inyelling and splutteringfor the water was much too hot  ah  i see now growled the king turning to gadarnbut gadarn was gone  he found him a minute later behind a bush in fits  pacifying the warriors with some difficultyfor they were a hotheaded generationthe king being directed by bladud ordered the water from the cold lake to be turned on until the bath became bearable  then the warriors reentered it again more sedately  the warm water soon restored their equanimity and ere long the unusual sight was to be seen of bearded men and smooth chins rugged men and striplings rolling about like porpoises shouting laughing and indulging in horseplay like veritable boys  truly warmth has much to do with the felicity of mankind  towards afternoon the warriors were ordered to turn out and after the water had been allowed to run till it was clear king hudibras descended into it with much gravity and a good deal of what was in those ages considered to be ceremonial effect  this was done by way of taking formal possession of the hot springs  he was greatly cheered during the process by the admiring visitors as well as physically by the hot water and it is said that while his son bladud was dutifully rubbing him down in the neighbouring booth he remarked that it was the best bath he ever had in his life that he would visit the place periodically as long as he lived and that a palace must be built there for his accommodation  from that day the bath was named the kings bath and it is so named at the present day  soon after that the queen visited the swamp and with her ladies made use of the bath which had been specially prepared for women and this one went by the name of the queens bath thereafter  its site however is not now certainly known and it is not to be confounded with the queens bath of the present day which was named after queen anne  prince bladud lived to carry out most of his plans  he built a palace for his father in swamptown  he built a palace for himself and branwen with a wing to it for dromas and hafrydda and took up his permanent abode there when he afterwards became king  at the death of his father he added another wing for the queenmotherwith internal doors opening from each wing to the other in order that they might live so to speak as one family  this arrangement worked admirably until the families became large and the younger members obstreperous when the internal doors were occasionally even frequently shut  he also built a snug house for konar and made him huntergeneral to the royal household  it is said that owing to the genial influence of bladuds kind nature konar recovered his reason and forgetting the false fairone who had jilted him took to himself a helpmate who more than made up for her loss  captain arkal soon found that his passion for hot water cooled  as it did so his love for salt water revived  he returned to hellas and after paying his respects to his pretty greek wife and dandling the solid square bluff and resolute baby he reloaded his ship and returned to albion  thus he went and came for many years  little maikar however did not follow his example  true he accompanied his old captain on his first trip to hellas but that was for the purpose of getting possession of a darkeyed maiden who awaited him there with whom he returned to swamptown and in that lovely region spent the remainder of his life  even addedomar was weaned from outlawry to honesty by the irresistible solicitations of bladud and as in modern times many an incorrigible poacher makes a firstrate gamekeeper so the robberchief became an able headhuntsman under the huntergeneral  the irony of fate decreed however that the man who had once contemplated three wives was not to marry at all  he dwelt with his mother ortrud to the end of her days in a small house not far from the residence of konar  gunrigs mother also dwelt with themnot that she had any particular regard for them personally but in order that she might be near to the beautiful girl who had been beloved by her son  gadarn the great northern chief ever afterwards paid an annual visit to swamptown  while that visit lasted there was a general feeling in the palaceespecially among the young peoplethat a jovial hurricane was blowing  during the daytime the gale made itself felt in loud hilarious laughter song and story  at night it blew steadily through his nose  after his departure an unaccountable calm seemed to settle down upon the whole region  beniah performed with powerful effect the task allotted to him for both by precept and example he so set forth and obeyed the laws of god that the tone of society was imperceptibly elevated  men came to know and to act upon the knowledge that this world was not their rest that there is a better life beyond and in the contemplation of that life they somehow made this life more agreeable to themselves and to each other  time which never intermits the beating of his fateful wings flew by the centuries rolled on the roman invaders came the norsemen and saxons came the norman conquerors came and each left their mark deep and lasting on the people and on the landbut they could not check by one hairsbreadth the perennial flow of the springs in the hot swamp or obliterate the legend on which is founded this romance of old albion  the end
