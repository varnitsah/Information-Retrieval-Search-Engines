lights burned low of the great audience who had filled the place only halfanhour ago not one remained the echoes of their tumultuous cheering seemed still to linger amongst the rafters the dust which their feet had raised hung about in a little cloud but the long rows of benches were empty the sweepers moved ghostlike amongst the shadows and an old woman was throwing tealeaves here and there about the platform in the committeeroom behind a little group of men were busy with their leavetakings the candidate a tall somewhat burly man with hard shrewd face and loosely knit figure was shaking hands with every one his tone and manner savoured still of the rostrum  goodnight sir goodnight mr bullsom a most excellent introduction yours sir you made my task positively easy goodnight mr brooks a capital meeting and everything very well arranged personally i feel very much obliged to you sir if you carry everything through as smoothly as this affair tonight i can see that we shall lose nothing by poor morrisons breakdown goodnight gentlemen to all of you we will meet at the club at eleven oclock tomorrow morning eleven oclock precisely if you please  the candidate went out to his carriage and the others followed in twos and threes a young man pale with nervous mouth stronglymarked features and clear dark eyes looked up from a sheaf of letters which he was busy sorting  dont wait for me mr bullsom he said reynolds will let me out and i had better run through these letters before i leave  mr bullsom was emphatic to the verge of gruffness  youll do nothing of the sort he declared i tell you what it is brooks were not going to let you knock yourself up youre tackling this job in rare style i can tell you that henslow is delighted  im much obliged to you for saying so mr bullsom the young man answered of course the work is strange to me but it is very interesting and i dont mean to make a mess of it  there is only one chance of your doing that mr bullsom rejoined and that is if you overwork yourself you need a bit of looking after youve got a rare head on your shoulders and im proud to think that i was the one to bring your name before the committee but im jolly well certain of one thing youve done all the work a man ought to do in one day now listen to me heres my carriage waiting and youre going straight home with me to have a bite and a glass of wine we cant afford to lose our second agent and i can see whats the matter with you youre as pale as a ghost and no wonder youve been at it all day and never a break  the young man called brooks had not the energy to frame a refusal which he knew would be resented he took down his overcoat and stuffed the letters into his pocket  youre very good he said ill come up for an hour with pleasure  they passed out together into the street and mr bullsom opened the door of his carriage  in with you young man he exclaimed home george  kingston brooks leaned back amongst the cushions with a little sigh of relief  this is very restful he remarked we have certainly had a very busy day the inside of electioneering may be disenchanting but its jolly hard work  mr bullsom sat with clasped hands in front of him resting upon that slight protuberance which denoted the advent of a stomach he had thrown away the cigar which he had lit in the committeeroom mrs bullsom did not approve of smoking in the covered wagonette which she frequently honoured with her presence  theres nothing in the world worth having that hasnt to be worked for my boy he declared goodhumoredly  by other people brooks remarked smiling  thats as it may be mr bullsom admitted to my mind thats where the art of the thing comes in any fool can work but it takes a shrewd man to keep a lot of others working hard for him while he pockets the oof himself  i suppose the younger man remarked thoughtfully that you would consider mr henslow a shrewd man  shrewd oh henslows shrewd enough theres no question about that  and honest  mr bullsom hesitated he drew his hand down his stubbly grey beard  honest oh yes hes honest youve no fault to find with him eh  none whatever brooks hastened to say you see he continued more slowly i have never been really behind the scenes in this sort of thing before and henslow has such a very earnest manner in speaking he talked to the working men last night as though his one desire in life was to further the different radical schemes which we have on the programme why the tears were actually in his eyes when he spoke of the old age pension bill he told them over and over again that the passing of that bill was the one object of his political career then you know there was the luncheon todayand i fancied that he was a little flippant about the labour vote it was perhaps only his way of speaking  mr bullsom smiled and rubbed the carriage window with the cuff of his coat he was very hungry  oh well a politician has to trim a little you know he remarked votes he must have and henslow has a very good idea how to get them here we are thank goodness the carriage had turned up a short drive and deposited them before the door of a highly ornate villa mr bullsom led the way indoors and himself took charge of his guests coat and hat then he opened the door of the drawingroom  mrs bullsom and the girls he remarked urbanely will be delighted to see you come in    chapter ii  the bullsom family at home  there were fans upon the wall and much bricabrac of oriental shape but brummagem finish a complete suite of drawingroom furniture incandescent lights of fierce brilliancy and a pianola mrs peter bullsom stout and shiny in black silk and a chatelaine was dozing peacefully in a chair with the latest novel from the circulating library in her lap whilst her two daughters in evening blouses which were somehow suggestive of the odd elevenpence were engrossed in more serious occupation louise the elder whose budding resemblance to her mother was already a protection against the overamorous youths of the town was reading a political speech in the times selina who had sandy hair a slight figure and was considered by her family the essence of refinement was struggling with a volume of cowper who had been recommended to her by a librarian with a sense of humour as a poet unlikely to bring a blush into her virginal cheeks mr bullsom looked in upon his domestic circle with pardonable pride and with a little flourish introduced his guest  mrs bullsom he said this is my young friend kingston brooks my two daughters sir louise and selina the ladies were gracious but had the air of being taken by surprise which considering mr bullsoms parting words a few hours ago seemed strange  weve had a great meeting mr bullsom remarked sidling towards the hearthrug and with his thumbs already stealing towards the armholes of his waistcoat a great meeting my dears not that i am surprised oh no as i said to padgett when he insisted that i should take the chair padgett i said mark my words were going to surprise the town mr henslow may not be the most popular candidate weve ever had but hes on the right side and those who think radicalism has had its day in medchester will be amazed and so they have been ive dropped a few hints during my speeches at the ward meetings lately and mr brooks though hes new at the work did his best and i can tell you the result was a marvel the hall was packedsimply packed when i rose to speak there wasnt an empty place or chair to be seen  dear me mrs bullsom remarked affably supper is quite ready my love  mr bullsom abandoned his position precipitately and his face expressed his lively satisfaction  ah he exclaimed i was hoping that you would have a bite for me as i said to mr brooks when i asked him to drop in with me theres sure to be something to eat and i can tell you im about ready for it  brooks found an opportunity to speak almost for the first time he was standing between the two misses bullsom and already they had approved of him he was distinctly of a different class from the casual visitors whom their father was in the habit of introducing into the family circle  mr bullsom was kind enough to take pity on an unfortunate bachelor he said with a pleasant smile my landlady has few faults but an overlove of punctuality is one of them by this time she and her household are probably in bed our meeting lasted a long time  if you will touch the bell peter mrs bullsom remarked ann shall dish up the supper  the young ladies exchanged shocked glances dish up what an abominable phrase they looked covertly at their guest but his face was imperturbable  we think that we have been very considerate mr brooks selina remarked with an engaging smile we gave up our usual dinner this evening as papa had to leave so early  mr brooks smiled as he offered his arm to mrs bullsoma courtesy which much embarrassed her  i think he said that we shall be able to show you some practical appreciation of your thoughtfulness i know nothing so stimulating to the appetite as politics and today we have been so busy that i missed even my afternoon tea  im sure that we are quite repaid for giving up our dinner selina remarked with a backward glance at the young man oh here you are at last mary i didnt hear you come in  my niece miss scott mr bullsom announced now you know all the family  a plainlydressed girl with dark eyes and unusually pale cheeks returned his greeting quietly and followed them into the diningroom mrs bullsom spread herself over her seat with a little sigh of relief brooks gazed in silent wonder at the giltframed oleographs which hung thick upon the walls and mr bullsom stood up to carve a joint of beef  plain fare mr brooks for plain people he remarked gently elevating the sirloin on his fork and determining upon a point of attack we dont understand frills here but weve a welcome for our friends and a hearty one  if there is anything in the world better than roast beef brooks remarked unfolding his serviette i havent found it  theres one thing mr bullsom remarked pausing for a moment in his labours i can give you a good glass of wine ann i think that if you look in the righthand drawer of the sideboard you will find a bottle of champagne if not ill have to go down into the cellar  ann however produced itwhich considering that mr bullsom had carefully placed it there a few hours ago was not extraordinaryand brooks sipped the wine with inward tremors justified by the result  i suppose mr brooks selina remarked turning towards him in an engaging fashion that you are a great politician i see your name so much in the papers  brooks smiled  my political career he answered dates from yesterday morning i am taking mr morrisons place you know as agent for mr henslow i have never done anything of the sort before and i have scarcely any claims to be considered a politician at all  a very lucky change for us brooks mr bullsom declared with the burly familiarity which he considered justified by his position as chairman of the radical committee poor morrison was past the job it was partly through his muddling that we lost the seat at the last election id made up my mind to have a change this time and so i told em  brooks was tired of politics and he looked across the table this pale girl with the tired eyes and selfcontained manner interested him the difference too between her and the rest of the family was puzzling  i believe miss scott he said that i met you at the stuarts dance  i was there she admitted i dont think i danced with you but we had supper at the same table  i remember it perfectly he said wasnt it supposed to be a very good dance  she shrugged her shoulders  i believe so she answered there was the usual faulttoo many girls but it was very pretty to watch  you do not care for dancing yourself perhaps he hazarded  indeed i do she declared but i knew scarcely any one there i see a good deal of kate sometimes but the others i scarcely know at all  you were in the same position as i was then he answered smiling  oh youyou are different she remarked i mean that you are a man and at a dance that means everything that is why i rather dislike dances we are too dependent upon you if you would only let us dance alone  selina smiled in a superior manner she would have given a good deal to have been invited to the dance in question but that was a matter which she did not think it worth while to mention  my dear mary she said what an idea i am quite sure that when you go out with us you need never have any difficulty about partners  our programmes for the liberal club dance and the county cricket ball were full before we had been in the room five minutes louise interposed  mary smiled inwardly but said nothing and brooks was quite sure then that she was different he realized too that her teeth were perfect and her complexion notwithstanding its pallor was faultless she would have been strikingly goodlooking but for her mouth and thatwas it a discontented or a supercilious curl at any rate it disappeared when she smiled  may i ask whether you have been attending a political meeting this evening miss scott he asked you came in after us i think  she shook her head  no i have a class on wednesday evening  a class he repeated doubtfully  mr bullsom who thought he had been out of the conversation long enough interposed  mary calls herself a bit of a philanthropist you see mr brooks he explained goes down into medchester and teaches factory girls to play the piano on wednesday evenings much good may it do them  there was a curious gleam in the girls eyes for a moment which checked the words on brooks lips and led him to precipitately abandon the conversation but afterwards while selina was pedalling at the pianola and playing havoc with the expressionstops he crossed the room and stood for a moment by her chair  i should like you to tell me about your class he said i have several myselfof different sorts  she closed her magazine but left her finger in the place  oh mine is a very unambitious undertaking she said kate stuart and i started it for the girls in her fathers factory and we aim at nothing higher than an attempt to direct their taste in fiction they bring their free library lists to us and we mark them together then we all read one more serious book at the same timehistory or biographyand talk about it when we meet  it is an excellent idea he said earnestly by the bye something occurs to me you know or rather you dont know that i give free lectures on certain books or any simple literary subject on wednesday evenings at the secular hall when this electioneering isnt on couldnt you bring your girls one evening i would be guided in my choice of a subject by you  yes i should like that she answered and i think the girls would it is very good of you to suggest it  louise with a great book under her arm deposited her dumpy person in a seat by his side and looked up at him with a smile of engaging candour  mr brooks she said i am going to do a terrible thing i am going to show you some of my sketches and ask your opinion  brooks turned towards her without undue enthusiasm  it is very good of you miss bullsom he said doubtfully but i never drew a straight line in my life and i know nothing whatever about perspective my opinion would be worse than worthless  louise giggled artlessly and turned over the first few pages  you men all say that at first she declared and then you turn out such terrible critics i declare im afraid to show them to you after all  brooks scarcely showed that desire to overcome her new resolution which politeness demanded but selina came tripping across the room and took up her position on the other side of him  you must show them now youve brought them out louise she declared i am sure that mr brooks advice will be most valuable but mind if you dare to show mine ill tear them into pieces  i wasnt going to dear louise declared a little tartly shall i begin at the beginning mr brooks or  oh dont show those first few dear selina exclaimed you know theyre not nearly so good as some of the others that mill is all out of drawing  mary who had been elbowed into the background rose quietly and crossed to the other end of the room brooks followed her for a moment with regretful eyes her simple gown with the little piece of ribbon around her graceful neck seemed almost distinguished by comparison with the loudpatterned and dressier blouses of the two girls who had now hemmed him in for a moment he ignored the waiting pages  your cousin he remarked is quite unlike any of you has she been with you long  louise looked up a little tartly  oh about three years you are quite right when you say that she is unlike any of us it doesnt seem nice to complain about her exactly but she really is terribly trying isnt she selina  selina nodded and dropped her voice  she is getting worse she declared she is becoming a positive trouble to us  brooks endeavoured to look properly sympathetic and considered himself justified in pursuing the conversation indeed may i ask in what way  oh she has such oldfashioned ideas louise said confidentially ive quite lost patience with her and so has selina havent you dear she never goes to parties if she can help it she is positively rude to all our friends and the sarcastic things she says sometimes are most unpleasant you know papa is very very good to her  yes indeed selina interrupted you know mr brooks she has no father and mother and she was living quite alone in london when papa found her out and brought her hereand in the most abject poverty i believe he found her in a garret fancy that  and now louise continued he allows her for her clothes exactly the same as he does usand look at her would you believe it now she is like that nearly every evening although we have friends dropping in continually of course i dont believe in extravagance but if a girl has relations who are generous enough to give her the means i do think that for their sake she ought to dress properly i think that she owes it to them as well as to herself  and out of doors it is positively worse selina whispered impressively i declare she added with a simper that although nobody can say that i am proud there are times when i am positively ashamed to be seen out with her what she does with her money i cant imagine  brooks who was something of a critic in such matters and had recognized the art of her severely simple gown smiled to himself he was wise enough however not to commit himself  perhaps he suggested she thinks that absolute simplicity suits her best she has a nice figure  selina tossed her muchbeaded slipper impatiently  heaven only knows what mary does think she exclaimed impatiently  and heaven only knows what i am to say about these brooks groaned inwardly as the sketchbook fell open before him at last and its contents were revealed to his astonished eyes    chapter iii  kingston brooks has a visitor  kingston brooks was twentyfive years old strong nervous and with a strenuous desire to make his way so far as was humanly possible into the heart of life he was a young solicitor recently established in medchester without friends save those he was now making and absolutely without interest of any sort he had a small capital and already the beginnings of a practice he had some sort of a reputation as a speaker and was well spoken of by those who had entrusted business to him yet he was still fighting for a living when this piece of luck had befallen him mr bullsom had entrusted a small case to him and found him capable and cheap amongst that worthy gentlemans chief characteristics was a decided weakness for patronizing younger and less successful men and he went everywhere with kingston brooks name on his lips then came the election and the sudden illness of mr morrison who had always acted as agent for the radical candidates for the borough another agent had to be found several who would have been suitable were unavailable an urgent committee meeting was held and mr bullsom at once called attention to an excellent little speech of kingston brooks at a ward meeting on the previous night in an hour he was closeted with the young lawyer and the affair was settled brooks knew that henceforth the material side of his career would be comparatively easy sailing  he had accepted his good fortune with something of the same cheerful philosophy with which he had seen difficulty loom up in his path a few months ago but tonight on his way home from mr bullsoms suburban residence a different mood possessed him usually a selfcontained and somewhat gravely minded person tonight the blood went tingling through his veins with a new and unaccustomed warmth he carried himself blithely the cool night air was so grateful and sweet to him that he had no mind even to smoke there seemed to be no tangible reason for the change the political excitement which a few weeks ago he had begun to feel exhilarating had for him decreased now that his share in it lay behind the scenes and he found himself wholly occupied with the purely routine work of the election nor was there any sufficient explanation to be found in the entertainment which he had felt himself bound to accept at mr bullsoms hands of the wine which had been only tolerable he had drunk as was his custom sparingly and of mary scott who had certainly interested him in a manner which the rest of the family had not he had after all seen but very little he found himself thinking with fervor of the desirable things in life never had the various tasks which he had set himself seemed so easy an accomplishment his own powers more real and alive and beneath it all he was conscious of a vague sense of excitement a nervous dancing of the blood as though even now the time were at hand when he might find himself in touch with some of the greater forces of life all of which he intended some day to realize it was delightful after all to be young and strong to be stripped for the race in the morning of life when every indrawn breath seems sweet with the perfume of beautiful things and the heart is tuned to music  the fatigue of the day was wholly forgotten he was surprised indeed when he found himself in the little street where his rooms were a small brougham was standing at the corner the liveries and horse of which though quiet enough caused him a moments surprise as being superior to the ordinary equipages of the neighborhood he passed on to the soberfronted house where he lived and entering with his latchkey made his way to his study immediately he entered he was conscious of a man comfortably seated in his easychair and apparently engrossed in a magazine  he advanced towards him inquiringly and his visitor carefully setting down the magazine rose slowly to his feet the young mans surprise at finding his rooms occupied was increased by the appearance of his visitor he was apparently of more than middle age with deeplylined face tall and with an expression the coldness of which was only slightly mitigated by a sensitive mouth that seemed at once cynical and humorous he was of more than ordinary height and dressed in the plainest dinner garb of the day but his dinner jacket his black tie and the set of his shirt were revelations to brooks who dealt only with the medchester tradespeople he did not hold out his hand but he eyed brooks with a sort of critical survey which the latter found a little disconcerting  you wished to see me sir brooks asked my name is kingston brooks and these are my rooms  so i understood the newcomer replied imperturbably i called about an hour ago and took the liberty of awaiting your return  brooks sat down his visavis was calmly selecting a cigarette from a capacious case brooks found himself offering a light and accepting a cigarette himself the flavour of which he at once appreciated  can i offer you a whiskyandsoda he inquired  i thank you no was the quiet reply  there was a short pause  you wished to see me on some business connected with the election no doubt brooks suggested  his visitor shook his head slowly he knocked the ash from his cigarette and smiled whimsically  my dear fellow he said i havent the least idea why i came to see you this evening  brooks felt that he had a right to be puzzled and he looked it but his visitor was so evidently a gentleman and a person of account that the obvious rejoinder did not occur to him he merely waited with uplifted eyebrows  not the least idea his visitor repeated still smiling but at the same time i fancy that before i leave you i shall find myself explaining or endeavouring to explain not why i am here but why i have not visited you before what do you think of that  i find it brooks answered enigmatic but interesting  exactly well i hate talking so my explanation will not be a tedious one your name is kingston brooks  yes  your mothers name was dorothy kenneir she was before her marriage the matron of a home in the east end of london and a lady devoted to philanthropic work your father was a policecourt missionary  brooks was leaning a little forward in his chair these things were true enough who was his visitor  your father through overdevotion to the philanthropic works in which he was engaged lost his reason temporarily and on his partial recovery i understand that the doctors considered him still to be mentally in a very weak state they ordered him a sea voyage he left england on the corinthia fifteen years ago and i believe that you heard nothing more of him until you received the news of his deathprobably ten years back  yes ten years ago  your mother i think lived for only a few months after your father left england you found a guardian in mr ascough of lincolns inn fields there my knowledge of your history ceases  how do you know these things brooks asked  i was with your father when he died it was i who wrote to you and sent his effects to england  you were therein canada  yes i had a dwelling within a dozen miles of where your father had built his hut by the side of the great lake he was the only other englishman within a hundred miles so i was with him often  it is wonderfulafter all these years brooks exclaimed you were there for sport of course  for sport his visitor repeated in a colourless tone  but my fatherwhat led him there why did he cut himself off from every one send no word home creep away into that lone country to die by himself it is horrible to think of  your father was not a communicative man he spoke of his illness i always considered him as a person mentally shattered he spent his days alone looking out across the lake or wandering in the woods he had no companions of course but there were always animals around him he had the look of a man who had suffered  he was to have gone to australia brooks said it was from there that we expected news from him i cannot see what possible reason he had for changing his plans there was no mystery about his life in london it was one splendid record of selfdenial and devotion to what he thought his duty  from what he told me his visavis continued handing again his cigarettecase and looking steadily into the fire he seems to have left england with the secret determination never to return but why i do not know one thing is certain his mental state was not altogether healthy his desire for solitude was almost a passion towards the end however his mind was clear enough he told me about your mother and you and he handed me all the papers which i subsequently sent to london he spoke of no trouble and his transition was quite peaceful  it was a cruel ending brooks said quietly there were people in london whom he had befriended who would have worked their passage out and faced any hardships to be with him and my mother notwithstanding his desertion believed in him to the last  there was a moments intense silence this visitor who had come so strangely was to all appearance a man not easily to be moved yet brooks fancied that the long white fingers were trembling and that the strange quiet of his features was one of intense selfrepression his tone when he spoke again however was clear and almost indifferent  i feel he said that it would have been only decently courteous of me to have sought you out before although i have as you see nothing whatever to add to the communications i sent you but i have not been a very long time in england and i have a very evil habit of putting off things concerning which there is no urgency i called at ascoughs and learned that you were in practice in medchester i am now living for a short time not far from here and reading of the election i drove in tonight to attend one of the meetingsi scarcely cared which i heard your name saw you on the platform and called here hoping to find you  it was very kind brooks said  he felt curiously tonguetied this sudden upheaval of a past which he had never properly understood affected him strangely  i gathered from mr ascough that you were left sufficient means to pay for your education and also to start you in life his visitor continued yours is considered to be an overcrowded profession but i am glad to understand that you seem likely to make your way  brooks thanked him absently  from your position on the platform tonight i gather that you are a politician  scarcely that brooks answered i was fortunate enough to be appointed agent to mr henslow owing to the illness of another man it will help me in my profession  the visitor rose to his feet he stood with his hands behind him looking at the younger man and brooks suddenly remembered that he did not even know his name  you will forgive me he said also rising if i have seemed a little dazed i am very grateful to you for coming i have always wanted more than anything in the world to meet some one who saw my father after he left england there is so much which even now seems mysterious with regard to his disappearance from the world  i fear that you will never discover more than you have done from me was the quiet reply your father had been living for years in profound solitude when i found him frankly i considered from the first that his mind was unhinged therein i fancy lies the whole explanation of his silence and his voluntary disappearance i am assuming of course that there was nothing in england to make his absence desirable  there was nothing brooks declared with conviction that i can personally vouch for his life as a policecourt missionary was the life of a militant martyrs the life of a saint the urgent advice of his physicians alone led him to embark upon that voyage i see now that it was a mistake he left before he had sufficiently recovered to be safely trusted alone by the bye brooks continued after a moments hesitation you have not told me your name whom i have to thank for this kindness your letters from canada were not signed  there was a short silence from outside came the sound of the pawing of horses feet and the jingling of harness  i was a fellowtraveller in that great unpeopled world the visitor said and there was nothing but common humanity in anything i did i lived out there as philip ferringshaw here i have to add my title the marquis of arranmore i was a younger son in those days if there is anything which i have forgotten i am at enton for a month or so it is an easy walk from medchester if your clients can spare you for an afternoon goodnight mr brooks  he held out his hand he was sleepy apparently for his voice had become almost a drawl and he stifled a yawn as he passed along the little passage kingston brooks returned to his little room and threw himself back into his easychair truly this had been a wonderful day    chapter iv  a question for the country  for the first time in many years it seemed certain that the conservatives had lost their hold upon the country the times were ripe for a change of any sort an illconducted and ruinous war had drained the empire of its surplus wealth and every known industry was suffering from an almost paralyzing depressionmedchester perhaps as severely as any town in the united kingdom its staple manufactures were being imported from the states and elsewhere at prices which the local manufacturers declared to be ruinous many of the largest factories were standing idle a great majority of the remainder were being worked at half or threequarters time thoughtful men looking ten years ahead saw the cloud which even now was threatening enough grow blacker and blacker and shuddered at the thought of the tempest which before long must break over the land meanwhile the streets were filled with unemployed whose demeanour day by day grew less and less pacific people asked one another helplessly what was being done to avert the threatened crisis the manufacturers openly threatened by their discharged employees and cajoled by others higher in authority and by public opinion still pronounced themselves helpless to move without the aid of legislation for the first time for years protection was openly spoken of from a political platform  henslow a shrewd man and a politician of some years standing was one of the first to read the signs of the times and rightly to appreciate them he had just returned from a lengthened visit to the united states and what he had seen there he kept at first very much to himself but at a small committee meeting held when his election was still a matter of doubt he unbosomed himself at last to some effect  the vote we want he said is the vote of those people who are losing their bread and who see ruin and starvation coming in upon them i mean the middleclass manufacturers and the operatives who are dependent upon them i tell you where i think that as a nation we are going wrong we fixed once upon a great principle and we nailed it to our mastfor all time that is a mistake absolute free trade such as is at present our national policy was a magnificent principle in the days of cobdenbut the times have changed we must change with them that is where the typical englishman fails it is a matter of temperament he is too slow to adapt himself to changing circumstances  there was a moments silence these were ominous words every one felt that they were not lightly spoken henslow had more behind a prominent manufacturer harrison by name interposed from his place  you are aware mr henslow he said that many a man has lost an assured seat for a more guarded speech than that for generations even a whisper of the sort has been counted heresyespecially from our party  maybe henslow answered but i am reminded of this mr harrison the pioneers of every great social change have suffered throughout the whole of history but the man who has selected the proper moment and struck hard has never failed to win his reward now i am no novice in politics and i am going to make a prophecy years ago the two political parties were readjusted on the irish question every election which was fought was simply on these linesit was upon the principle of home rule for ireland and the severance of that country from the united kingdom or the maintenance of the union good now in more recent times the south african war and the realization of what our colonies could do for us has introduced a new factor those who have believed in a doctrine of expansion have called themselves imperialists and those who have favoured less widereaching ideals and perhaps more attention to home matters have been christened little englanders many elections have been fought out on these lines if not between two men absolutely at variance with one another on this question still on the matter of degree now i am going to prophesy i say that the next readjustment of parties and the time is not far ahead will be on the tariff question and i believe that the controversy on this matter when once the country has laid hold of it will be the greatest political event of this century listen gentlemen i do not speak without having given this question careful and anxious thought and i tell you that i can see it coming  the committee meeting broke up at a late hour in the afternoon amidst some excitement and mr bullsom walked back to his office with brooks a fine rain was falling and the two men were close together under one umbrella  what do you think of it brooks bullsom asked anxiously  to tell you the truth i scarcely know the younger answered ten years ago there could have been but one answertodaywell look there  the two men stood still for a moment they were in the centre of the town at a spot from which the main thoroughfares radiated into the suburbs and manufacturing centres everywhere the pavements and the open space where a memorial tower stood were crowded with loiterers men in long lines stood upon the kerbstones their hands in their pockets watching waitinggod knows for what there were all sorts of course the professional idlers and the drunkard were there but the othersthere was no lack of them there was no lack of men whitefaced dulleyed dejected some of them actually with the brand of starvation to be seen in their sunken cheeks and wasted limbs no wonder that the swingdoors of the publichouses where there was light and warmth inside opened and shut continually  look brooks repeated with a tremor in his tone there are thousands and thousands of themand all of them must have some sort of a home to go to fancy itones womankind perhaps childrenand nothing to take home to them its such an old story that it sounds hackneyed and commonplace but god knows theres no other tragedy on his earth like it  mr bullsom was uncomfortable  ive given a hundred pounds to the unemployed fund he said  its money well spent if it had been a thousand brooks answered some day they may learn their strength and they will not suffer then like brute animals in silence look here im going to speak to one of them  he touched a tall youth on the shoulder out of work my lad he asked the youth turned surlily round yes looks like it dont it  what are you brooks asked  clicker  why did you leave your last place  gaffer said hes no more orderscouldnt keep us on the shops shut up know of a job guvnor he asked with a momentary eagerness ive two characters in my pocketgood uns  youve tried to get a place elsewhere brooks asked  tried dye suppose im standing here for fun ive tramped the blessed town i went to thirty factories yesterday and forty today know of a job guvnor im not particular  i wish i did brooks answered simply heres halfacrown go to that coffeepalace over there and get a meal its all i can do for you  good for you guvnor was the prompt answer i can treat my brother on that here ned he caught hold of a younger boy by the shoulder hot coffee and eggs you sinner come on  the two scurried off together brooks and his companion passed on  it is just this brooks said in a low tone just the thought of these people makes me afraid positively afraid to argue with henslow you seehe may be right i tell you that in a healthilygoverned country there should be work for every man who is able and willing to work and in england there isnt free trade works out all right logically but its one thing to see it all on paper and its another to see thishere around usand medchester isnt the worst off by any means  bullsom was silent for several moments  i tell you what it is brooks he said ill send another hundred to the unemployed fund tonight  its generous of you mr bullsom the young lawyer answered youll never regret it but look here theres a greater responsibility even than feeding these poor fellows resting upon us today they dont want our charity theyve an equal right to live with us what they want and what they have a right to is just legislation thats where we come in politics isnt a huge joke or the vehicle for any one mans personal ambition we who interest ourselves however remotely in them impose upon ourselves a great obligation weve got to find the truth thats why i hesitate to say anything against henslows new departure were off the track now i want to hear all that henslow has to say we must not neglect a single chance whilst that terrible cry is ever in our ears  they parted at the tram terminus mr bullsom taking a car for his suburban paradise as usual he was the centre of a little group of acquaintances  and how goes the election bullsom some one asked him  mr bullsom was in no hurry to answer the question he glanced round the car collecting the attention of those who might be supposed interested  i will answer that question better he said after the mass meeting on saturday night i think that henslows success or failure will depend on that  got something up your sleeve eh his first questioner remarked  maybe mr bullsom answered maybe not but apart from the immediate matter of this election i can tell you one thing gentlemen which may interest you  he paused one thumb stole towards the armhole of his waistcoat he liked to see these nightly companions of his hang upon his words it was a proper and gratifying tribute to his success as a man of affairs  i have just left he said our future member  the significance of his speech was not immediately apparent  henslow oh yes committee meeting this afternoon wasnt it some one remarked  i do not mean henslow mr bullsom replied i mean kingston brooks  the desired sensation was apparent  why hes your new agent isnt he  young fellow who plays cricket rather well  great golfer they say  makes a good speech some one was saying  gives free lectures at the secular hall rather a smart young solicitor they say  mr bullsom looked around him  he is all these things and he does all these things he is one of these youngsters who has the knack of doing everything well mark my words all of you i gave him his first case of any importance and i got him this job as agent for henslow hes bound to rise hes ambitious and hes got the brains hell be mp for this borough before we know where we are  halfadozen men of more or less importance made a mental note to nod to kingston brooks next time they saw him and mr bullsom trudged up his avenue with fresh schemes maturing in his mind in the domestic circle he further unburdened himself  mrs bullsom he said i am thinking of giving a dinnerparty how many people do we know better than ourselves  mrs bullsom was aghast and the young ladies selina and louise who were in the room were indignant  really papa selina exclaimed what do you mean  what i say he answered gruffly were plain people your mother and i at any rate and when you come to reckon things up i suppose youll admit that were not much in the social way theres plenty of people living round us in a sight smaller houses who dont know us and wouldnt if they couldand im not so sure that its altogether the fault of your father and mother either selina he added breaking ruthlessly in upon a sottovoce remark of that young ladys  well i never selina exclaimed tossing her head  come come i dont want no sauce from you girls he added drifting towards the fireplace and adopting a more assured tone as he reached his favourite position ive reasons for wishing to have mr kingston brooks here and id like him to meet gentlefolk now theres the vicar and his wife do you suppose theyd come  well i should like to know why not mrs bullsom remarked laying down her knitting when its only three weeks ago you sent him ten guineas for the curates fund come indeed theyd better  then theres dr seventon mr bullsom continued and his wife better drop him a line and tell him to look in and see me at the office i can invent something the matter with me and id best drop him a hint they say mrs seventon is exclusive but ill just let him know shes got to come now who else girls  the huntingdons might comeif they knew that it was this sort of an affair selina remarked thoughtfully  and mr seaton louise added im sure hes most gentlemanly  i dont want gentlemanly people this time mr bullsom declared i want gentlepeople thats all there is about it i let you ask who you like to the house and give you what you want for subscriptions and clothes and suchlike youve had a free and now lets see something for it halfadozen couplesll be enough if you cant get more but i wont have the nortons or the marvises or any of that podgy set you understand that and first of all you selina had better write to mr brooks and ask him to dine with us in a friendly way one night the week after next when the election is over and done with  in a friendly way pa selina repeated doubtfully but we cant ask these other people whom we know so slightly like thatand besides mr brooks might not dress if we put it like that  a nice lot you know about gentlepeople and their ways mr bullsom remarked with scorn a young fellow like brooks would tog himself out for dinner all right even if we were alone as long as there were ladies there and as for the dinner you dont suppose im such a mug as to leave that to ann i shall go to the queens hotel and have em send a cook and waiters and run the whole show dont know that i shant send to london you get the people ill feed em  do as your father says selina mrs bullsom said mildly im sure hes very considerate  wheres mary mr bullsom inquired this is a bit in her line  selina tossed her head  im sure i dont know why you should say that papa she declared mary knows nothing about society and she has no friends who would be the least use to us  where is she anyway mr bullsom demanded no one knew as a matter of fact she was having tea with kingston brooks    chapter v  the marquis of arranmore  they had met almost on the steps of his office and only a few minutes after he had left mr bullsom brooks was attracted first by a certain sense of familiarity with the trim wellbalanced figure and immediately afterwards she raised her eyes to his in passing he wheeled sharply round and held out his hand  miss scott isnt it do you know i have just left your uncle  she smiled a little absently she looked tired and her boots and skirt were splashed as though with much walking  indeed i suppose you see a good deal of him just now while the election is on  i must make myself a perfect nuisance to him brooks admitted you see the work is all new to me and he has been through it many times before are you just going home  she nodded  i have been out since two oclock she said  and you are almost wet through and quite tired out he said look here come across to mellors and have some tea with me and i will put you in a car afterwards  she hesitatedand he led the way across the street giving her no opportunity to frame a refusal the little teaplace was warm and cosy he found a comfortable corner and took her wet umbrella and cape away  i believe he said sitting down opposite her that i have saved your life  then i am not sure she answered that i feel grateful to you i ought to have warned you that i am not in the least likely to be a cheerful companion i have had a most depressing afternoon  you have been to your tailors he suggested and your new gown is a failureor is it even worse than that  she laughed dubiously then the tea was brought and for a moment their conversation was interrupted he thought her very graceful as she bent forward and busied herself attending to his wants her affinity to selina and louise was undistinguishable it was true that she was pale but it was the pallor of refinement the students absence of colour rather than the pallor of illhealth  mr brooks she said presently you are busy with this election and you are brought constantly into touch with all classes of people can you tell me why it is that it is so hard just now for poor people to get work is it true what they tell me that many of the factories in medchester are closed and many of those that are open are only working half and threequarter time  i am afraid that it is quite true miss scott he answered as for the first part of your question it is very hard to answer there seem to be so many causes at work just now  but it is the work of the politician surely to analyze these causes  it should be he answered tell me what has brought this into your mind  some of the girls in our class she said are out of work and those who have anything to do seem to be working themselves almost to death to keep their parents or somebody dependent upon them two of them i am anxious about i have been trying to find them this afternoon i have heard things mr brooks which have made me ashamedsick at heartashamed to go home and think how we live while they die and these girlsthey have known so much misery i am afraid of what may happen to them  these girls are mostly boot and shoe machinists are they not  yes but even mr stuart says that he cannot find them work  it is only this afternoon that we have all been discussing this matter he said gravely it is serious enough god knows the manufacturer tells us that he is suffering from american competitionhere and in the colonies he tells us that the workpeople themselves are largely to blame that their trades unions restrict them to such an extent that he is hopelessly handicapped from the start but there are other causes there is a terrible wave of depression all through the country the working classes have no money to spend every industry is flagging and every industry seems threatened with competition from abroad do you understand the principles of free trade at all  not in the least i wish i did  some day we must have a talk about it henslow has made a very daring suggestion today he has given us all plenty to think about we are all agreed upon one thing the crisis is fast approaching and it must be faced these people have the right to live and they have the right to demand that legislation should interfere on their behalf  she sighed  it is a comfort to hear you talk like this she said to me it seems almost maddening to see so much suffering so many people suffering not only physically but being dragged down into a lower moral state by sheer force of circumstances and their surroundings and all the time we educated people go on our way and live our lives as though nothing were happeningas though we had no responsibility whatever for the holocaust of misery at our doors so few people stop to think they wont understand it is so easy to put things behind one  come he said cheerfully you and i at least are not amongst those and there is a certain duty which we owe to ourselves too as well as to othersto look upon the brighter side of things let us talk about something less depressing  you shall tell me she suggested who is going to win the election  henslow he answered promptly  owing i suppose  to his agent of course you may laugh miss scott but i can assure you that my duties are no sinecure i never knew what work was before  too much work she said is better than too little after all more people die of the latter than the former  nature meant me he said for a hazy man i have all the qualifications for a firstclass idler and circumstances and the misfortune of my opinions are going to keep me going at express speed all my life i can see it coming sometimes it makes me shudder  you are too young she remarked to shrink from work i have no sympathy to offer you  i begin to fear miss scott he said that you are not what is called sympathetic  she smiledand the smile broke into a laugh as though some transient idea rather than his words had pleased her  you should apply to my cousin selina for that she said every one calls her most delightfully sympathetic  sympathy he remarked is either a heavensent joyor a bore it depends upon the individual  that is either enigmatical or rude she answered but after all you dont know selina  why not he asked i have talked with her as long as with youand i feel that i know you quite well  i cant be responsible for your feelings she said a little brusquely but im quite sure that i dont know you well enough to be sitting here at tea with you even  i wont admit that he answered but it was very nice of you to come  the fact of it was she admitted my headache and appetite were stronger than my sense of the conventions now that the former are dissipated the latter are beginning to assert themselves and so  she began to draw on her gloves just then a carriage with postilions and ladies with luggage came clattering up the street she watched it with darkening face  that is the sort of man i detest she said motioning her head towards the window you know whose carriage it is dont you  he shook his head  no i did not know that any one round here drove with positions  it is the marquis of arranmore he has a place at enton i believe but he is only here for a few months in the year  brooks started and leaned eagerly forward  why do you hate him he asked what has he done  didnt you hear how he treated the mayor when he went out for a subscription to the unemployed fund  brooks shook his head  no i have heard nothing  poor old mr wensome went out all that way purposely to see him he was kept waiting an hour and then when he explained his errand the marquis laughed at him my dear fellow he said the poor people of medchester do not interest me in the least i do not go to the people who are better off than i am and ask them to help support me nor do i see the least reason why those who are worse off than i am should expect me to support them mr wensome tried to appeal to his humanity and the brute only continued to laugh in a cynical way he declared that poor people did not interest him his tenants he was prepared to look afteroutside his own property he didnt care a snap of the fingers whether people lived or died mr wensome said it was perfectly awful to hear him talk and he came away without a penny yet his property in this country alone is worth fifty thousand a year  it is very surprising brooks said thoughtfully the more surprising because i know of a kind action which he once did  sh theyre coming here she exclaimed that is the marquis  the omnibus had pulled up outside a tall footman threw open the door and held an umbrella over the two ladies who had descended the marquis and two other men followed they trooped into the little place bringing with them a strange flavour of another world the women wore wonderful furs and one who had ermine around her neck wore a great bunch of neapolitan violets whose perfume seemed to fill the room  this is a delightful idea the taller one said turning towards her host an eightmile drive before tea sounded appalling where shall we sit and may we have muffins  there is nothing about your youth lady sybil which i envy more than your digestion he answered motioning them towards a table to be able to eat muffins with plenty of butter would be unalloyed bliss nevertheless you shall have them no one has ever called me selfish let us have tea and toast and breadandbutter and cakes and a great many muffins please young lady he ordered and will you send out some tea to my servants please it will save them from trying to obtain drinks from the hotel next door and ensure us a safe drive home  and dont forget to send out for that pack of cards arranmore the elder lady said we are going to play bridge driving home with that wonderful little electric lamp of yours  i will not forget he promised we are to be partners you know  he was on the point of sitting down when he saw brooks at the next table he held out his hand  how do you do mr brooks he said i am glad to see that you are going to get your man in  thank you brooks answered rising and waiting for his companion who was buttoning her gloves i was afraid that your sympathies would be on the other side  dear me no the marquis answered my enemies would tell you that i have neither sympathy nor politics but i assure you that at heart i am a most devout radical i have a vote too and you may count upon me  i am very glad to hear it brooks answered shall i put you down on the list to be fetched  the marquis laughed  ill come without he declared i promise just remind me of the day  he glanced towards mary scott and for a moment seemed about to include her in some forthcoming remark but whatever it might have beenit was never made she kept her eyes averted and though her selfpossession was absolutely unruffled she hastened her departure i am not hurrying you mr brooks she asked not in the least he assured her  he raised his hat to the marquis and his party and the former nodded goodhumouredly there was silence until the two were in the street then one of the men who had been looking after them dropped his eyeglass  i tell you what he said to his visavis theres some chance for us in medchester after all i dont believe arranmore is popular amongst the ladies of his own neighbourhood  the marquis laughed softly  she has a nice face he remarked and i should imagine excellent perceptions curiously enough too she reminded me of some one who has every reason to hate me but to the best of my belief i never saw her before in my life lady caroom that weirdlooking object in front of you is a teapotand those are teacups may i suggest a use for them    chapter vi  the man who went to hell  the hon sydney chester molyneux stood with his cue in one hand and an open telegram in the other in the billiardroom at enton he was visibly annoyed  beastly hard luck he declared parliament is a shocking grind anyway it isnt that one ever does anything you know but one wastes such a lot of time when one might have been doing something worth while  do repeat that sydney lady caroom begged laying down her novel for a moment it really sounds as though it ought to mean something  i couldnt he admitted i wish to cultivate a reputation for originality and my first object is to forget everything i have said directly i have said it in case i should repeat myself  a short memory arranmore remarked is a politicians most valuable possession isnt it  no memory at all is better molyneux answered  and your telegram lady caroom asked  is from my indefatigable uncle molyneux groaned he insists upon it that i interest myself in the election here which means that i must go in tomorrow and call upon rochester  the younger girl looked up from her chair and laughed softly  you will have to speak for him she said how interesting we will all come in and hear you  molyneux missed an easy cannon and laid down his cue with an aggrieved air  it is all very well for you he remarked dismally but it is a horrible grind for me i have just succeeded in forgetting all that we did last session and our programme for next now ive got to wade through it all i wonder why on earth providence selected for me an uncle who thinks it worth while to be a cabinet minister  sybil caroom shrugged her shoulders  i wonder why on earth she remarked any constituency thinks it worth while to be represented by such a politician as you how did you get in sydney  dont know he answered i was on the right side and i talked the usual rot  for myself she said i like a politician who is in earnest they are more amusing and more impressive in every way who was the young man you spoke to in that little place where we had tea she asked her host  his name is kingston brooks arranmore answered he is the agent for henslow the radical candidate  well i liked him she said if i had a vote i would let him convert me to radicalism i am sure that he could do it  he shall tryif you like arranmore remarked  i am going to ask him to shoot one day  i am delighted to hear it the girl answered i think he would be a wholesome change you are all too flippant here  the door opened mr hennibul kc inserted his head and shoulders  i have been to look at arranmores golflinks he remarked they are quite decent will some one come and play a round  i will come sybil declared putting down her book  and i molyneux joined in hennibul can play our best ball  lady caroom and her host were left alone he came over to her side  what can i do to entertain your ladyship he asked lightly will you play billiards walk or drive there is an hour before lunch which must be charmed away  i am not energetic she declared i ought to walk for the sake of my figure im getting shockingly stout marie made me promise to walk a mile today but im feeling deliciously lazy  embonpoint is the fashion he remarked and you are inches short of even that yet come and sit in the study while i write some letters she held out her hands  pull me up then i am much too comfortable to move unaided  she sprang to her feet lightly enough and for a moment he kept her hands which rested willingly enough in his they looked at one another in silence then she laughed  my dear arranmore she protested i am not made up half carefully enough to stand such a critical survey by daylight your north windows are too terrible  not to you dear lady he answered smiling i was wondering whether it was possible that you could be fortyone  you brute she exclaimed with uplifted eyebrows how dare you forty if you likefor as long as you like forty is the fashionable age but one year over that is fatal dont you know that nowadays a woman goes straight from forty to sixty it is such a delicious long rest and besides it gives a woman an object in life which she has probably been groping about for all her days one is never bored after forty  and the object  to keep young of course theres scope for any amount of ingenuity since that dear man in paris has hit upon the real secret of enamelling we are thinking of extending the limit to sixtyfive lily cestigan is seventyone you know and she told me only last week that mat harloweyou know harlowe hes rather a nice boy in the guards had asked her to run away with him shes known him three months and hes seen her at least three times by daylight shes delighted about it  and is she going arranmore asked  well im not sure that shed care to risk that lady caroom answered thoughtfully she told him shed think about it and meanwhile hes just as devoted as ever  they crossed the great stone hall togetherthe hall which with its wonderful pillars and carved dome made enton the showhouse of the county arranmores study was a small octagonal room leading out from the library a fire of cedar logs was burning in an open grate and he wheeled up an easychair for her close to his writingtable  i wonder she remarked thoughtfully what you think of syd molyneux  is there anythingto be thought about him he answered lighting a cigarette  hes rather that way isnt he she assented i mean for sybil you know  i should let sybil decide he answered  she probably will lady caroom said still shes horribly bored at having to be dragged about to places you know and that sort of thing just because she isnt married and she likes syd all right hes no fool  i suppose not arranmore answered hes of a type you know which has sprung up during myabsence from civilization you want to grow up with it to appreciate it properly i dont think hes good enough for sybil  lady caroom sighed  sybils a dear girl she said although shes a terrible nuisance to me i shouldnt be at all surprised either if she developed views i wish you were a marrying man arranmore i used to think of you myself once but you would be too old for me now youre exactly the right age for sybil  arranmore smiled he had quite forgotten his letters lady caroom always amused him so well  she is very like what you were at her age he remarked what a pity it was that i was such a povertystricken beggar in those days i am sure that i should have married you  now i am beginning to like you she declared settling down more comfortably in her chair if you can keep up like that we shall be getting positively sentimental presently and if theres anything i adore in this worldespecially before luncheonit is sentiment do you remember we used to waltz together arranmore  you gave me a glove one night he said i have it still  and you pressed my handandit was in the setons conservatoryhow bold you were  and the next day he declared in an aggrieved tone i heard that you were engaged to caroom you treated me shamefully  these reminiscences she declared are really sweet but you are most ungrateful i was really almost too kind to you they were all fearfully anxious to get me married because dumesnil always used to say that my complexion would give out in a year or two and i wasted no end of time upon you who were perfectly hopeless as a husband after all though i believe it paid it used to annoy caroom so much and i believe he proposed to me long before he meant to so as to get rid of you  i arranmore remarked was the victim  she sat up with eyes suddenly bright  upon my word she declared i have an idea it is the most charming and flattering thing and it never occurred to me before after all it was not eccentricity which caused you to throw up your work at the barand disappear it was your hopeless devotion to me dont disappoint me now by denying it please dont it was the announcement of my engagement wasnt it  and it has taken you all these years to find it out  i was shockingly obtuse she murmured the thing came to me just now as a revelation poor dear man how you must have suffered this puts us on a different footing altogether doesnt it altogether he admitted  and she continued eyeing him now with a sudden nervousness emboldens me to ask you a question which i have been dying to ask you for the last few years i wonder whether you will answer it  i wonder he repeated  a change in him too was noticeable that wonderful impassivity of feature which never even in his lighter moments passed altogether away seemed to deepen every line in his hard clearcut face his mouth was close drawn his eyes were suddenly colder and expressionless there was about him at such times asthese an almost repellent hardness his emotions and the man himself seemed frozen lady caroom had seen him look like it once before and she sighed nevertheless she persevered  for nearly twenty years she said you disappeared you were reported at different times to be in every quarter of the earth from zambesia to pekin but no one knew and of course in a season or two you were forgotten i always wondered i am wondering now where were you what did you do with yourself  i went down into hell he answered cant you see the marks of it in my face for many years i lived in hellfor many years  you puzzle me she said in a low tone you had no taste for dissipation you look as though life had scorched you up at some time or other but how where you were found in canada i know when your brother died but you had only been there for a few years before then  ay before then  there was a short silence then arranmore who had been gazing steadily into the fire looked up she fancied that his eyes were softer  dear friend he said of those days i have nothing to telleven you but there are more awful things even than moral degeneration you do me justice when you impute that i never ate from the trough but what i did and where i lived i do not think that i shall ever willingly tell any one  a piece of burning wood fell upon the hearthstone he stooped and picked it up placed it carefully in its place and busied himself for a moment or two with the little brass poker then he straightened himself  catherine he said i think if i were you that i would not marry sybil to molyneux it struck me today that his eyeglasschain was of last years pattern and i am not sure that he is sound on the subject of collars you know how important these things are to a young man who has to make his own way in the world perhaps i am not sure but i think it is very likely i might be able to find a husband for her  you dear man lady caroom murmured i should rely upon your taste and judgment so thoroughly  there was a discreet knock at the door a servant entered with a card  arranmore took it up and retained it in his fingers  tell mr brooks he said that i will be with him in a moment if he has ridden over ask him to take some refreshment  you have a visitor lady caroom said rising if you will excuse me i will go and lie down until luncheontime and let my maid touch me up these sentimental conversations are so harrowing i feel a perfect wreck  she glided from the room graceful brisk and charming the most wonderful woman in england as the society papers were never tired of calling her arranmore glanced once more at the card between his fingers  mr kingston brooks  he stood for a few seconds motionless then he rang the bell  show mr brooks in here he directed    chapter vii  a thousand pounds  brooks had ridden a bicycle from medchester and his trousers and boots were splashed with mud his presence at enton was due to an impulse the inspiration of which he had already begun seriously to doubt arranmores kindly reception of him was more than ordinarily welcome  i am very glad to see you mr brooks he said holding out his hand how comes it that you are able to take even so short a holiday as this i pictured you surrounded by canvassers and billposters and journalists all clamouring for your ear  brooks laughed completely at his ease now thanks to the unspoken cordiality of the other man he took the easychair which the servant had noiselessly wheeled up to him  i am afraid that you exaggerate my importancelord arranmore he said i was very busy early this morning and i shall be again after four but i am allowed a little respite now and then  you spend it very sensibly out of doors arranmore remarked how did you get here  i cycled brooks answered it was very pleasant but muddy  what will you have lord arranmore asked some wine and biscuits or something of that sort  his hand was upon the bell but brooks stopped him  nothing at all thank you just now   luncheon will be served in halfanhour the marquis said you will prefer to wait until then  i am much obliged to you brooks answered but i must be getting back to medchester as soon as possible besides he added with a smile i am afraid when i have spoken of the object of my visit you may feel inclined to kick me out  i hope not arranmore replied lightly i was hoping that your visit had no object at all and that you had been good enough just to look me up  i should not have intruded without a purpose brooks said quietly but you will be almost justified in treating my visit as an impertinence when i have disclosed my errand lord arranmore i am the secretary for the fund which is being raised in medchester for the relief of the unemployed  arranmore nodded  oh yes he said i had a visit a few days ago from a worthy medchester gentleman connected with it  it is concerning that visit lord arranmore that i have come to see you brooks continued quietly i only heard of it yesterday afternoon but this morning it seems to me that every one whom i have met has alluded to it  the marquis was lounging against the broad mantelpiece some part of the cordiality of his manner had vanished  well  lord arranmore i wondered whether it was not possible that some mistake had been made brooks said i wondered whether mr wensome had altogether understood you properly  i did my best to be explicit the marquis murmured  or whether you had misunderstood him brooks continued doggedly this fund has become absolutely necessary unless we wish to see the people starve in the streets there are between six and seven thousand operatives and artisans in medchester today who are without work through no fault of their own it is our duty as citizens to do our best for them nearly every one in medchester has contributed according to their means you are a large propertyowner in the town cannot you consider this appeal as an unenforced rate it comes to that in the long run  the marquis shrugged his shoulders  i think he said that on the subject of charity englishmen generally wholly misapprehend the situation you say that between six and seven thousand men are out of work in medchester very well i affirm that there must be a cause for that if you are a philanthropist it is your duty to at once investigate the economic and political reasons for such a state of things and alter them by going about and collecting money for these people you commit what is little short of a crime you must know the demoralizing effect of charity no man who has ever received a dole is ever again an independent person besides that you are diverting the public mind from the real point of issue which is not that so many thousand people are hungry but that a flaw exists in the administration of the laws of the country so grave that a certain number of thousands of people who have a godsent right to productive labour havent got it do you follow me  perfectly brooks answered you did not talk like this to mr wensome  i admit it he was an ignorant man in whom i felt no interest whatever and i did not take the trouble besides i will frankly admit that i am in no sense of the word a sentimentalist the distresses of other people do not interest me particularly i have been poor myself and i never asked for nor was offered any sort of help consequently i feel very little responsibility concerning these unfortunate people whose cause you have espoused  may i revert to your first argument brooks said if you saw a man drowning then instead of trying to save him you would subscribe towards a fund to teach people to swim  that is ingenious lord arranmore replied smiling grimly but it doesnt interest me if i saw a man drowning i shouldnt think of interfering unless the loss of that man brought inconvenience or loss to myself if it did i should endeavour to save himnot unless as for the fund you speak of i should not think of subscribing to it it would not interest me to know that other people were provided with a safeguard against drowning i should probably spend the money in perfecting myself in the art of swimming dont you see that no man who has ever received help from another is exactly in the same position again as an individual he is a weaker creature that is where i disagree with nearly every existing form of charity they are wrong in principle they are a debauchment  your views lord arranmore brooks said are excellent for a model world for practical purposes i think they are a little pedantic you are quite right in your idea that charity is a great danger i can assure you that we are trying to realize that in medchester we ask for money and we dispense it unwillingly but as a necessary evil and we are trying to earnestly see where our social system is at fault and to readjust it but meanwhile men and women and children even are starving we must help them  that is where you are wholly wrong and where you retard all progress arranmore remarked cant you see that you are continually plugging up dangerous leaks with putty instead of lead you muffle the cry which but for you must ring through the land and make itself heard to every one let the people starve who are without means legislation would stir itself fast enough then it is the only way charity to individuals is poison to the multitude you create the criminal classes with your charities you blindfold statesmen and mislead political economists i tell you that the more you give away the more distress you create  brooks rose from his seat  charity is older than nations or history lord arranmore he said and i am foolish enough to think that the world is a better place for it your reasoning is very excellent but life has not yet become an exact science the weaknesses of men and women have to be considered you have probably never seen a starving person  lord arranmore laughed and brooks looked across the room at him in amazement the marquis was always pale but his pallor just then was as unnatural as the laugh itself  my dear young man he said if i could show you what i have seen your hair would turn grey and your wits go wandering do you think that i know nothing of life save its crust i tell you that i have been down in the depths aye singlehanded there in the devils own cauldron where creatures in the shape of men and women the very sight of whom would turn you sick with horror creep like spawn through life brainless and soulless foul things who would murder one another for the sake of a crust orbah what horrible memories  he broke off abruptly when he spoke again his tone was as usual  come he said i mustnt let you have this journey for nothing after all the only luxury in having principles is in the departing from them i will give you a cheque mr brooks only i beg you to think over what i have said abandon this doling principle as soon as it is possible give your serious attention to the social questions and imperfect laws which are at the back of all this distress  brooks felt as though he had been awakened from a nightmare he never forgot that single moment of revelation on the part of the man who sat now smiling and debonair before his writingtable  you are very kind indeed lord arranmore he said i can assure you that the money will be most carefully used and amongst my party at any rate we do really appreciate the necessity for going to the root of the matter  arranmores pen went scratching across the paper he tore out a cheque and placing it in an envelope handed it to brooks  i noticed he remarked thoughtfully that a good many people coming out of the factories hissed my carriage in medchester last time i was there i hope they will not consider my cheque as a sign of weakness but after all he added with a smile what does it matter let us go in to luncheon brooks  brooks glanced down at his mudsplashed clothes and boots  i must really ask you to excuse me he began but arranmore only rang the bell  my valet will smarten you up he said here fritz take mr brooks into my room and look after him will you i shall be in the hall when you come down  as he passed from the dressingroom a few minutes later brooks paused for a moment to look up at the wonderful ceiling above the hall below lord arranmore was idly knocking about the billiard balls and all around him was the murmur of pleasant conversation brooks drew the envelope from his pocket and glanced at the cheque he gave a little gasp of astonishment it was for a thousand pounds    chapter viii  kingston brooks makes inquiries  at luncheon brooks found himself between sybil caroom and mr hennibul she began to talk to him at once  i want to know all about your candidate mr brooks she declared you cant imagine how pleased i am to have you here i have had the feeling ever since i came of being shut up in a hostile camp i am a radical you know and these good people even my mother are rabid conservatives  brooks smiled as he unfolded his serviette  well henslow isnt exactly an ornamental candidate he said but he is particularly sound and a man with any amount of commonsense you should come and hear him speak  id love to she answered but no one would bring me from here they are all hopeless mr molyneux there is going to support mr rochester if i wasnt sure that hed do more harm than good i wouldnt let him go but i dont suppose theyll let you speak sydney she added they wont if theyve ever heard you  molyneux smiled an imperturbable smile  personally he said i should prefer to lend my moral support only but my fame as an orator is too well known there is not the least chance that they will let me off  sybil looked at brooks  did you ever hear such conceit she remarked in a pitying tone and i dont believe hes ever opened his mouth in the house except to shout hear hear besides hes as nervous as a kitten tell me are you going to return mr henslow  i think so brooks answered it is certain to be a very close contest but i believe we shall get a small majority the jingo element are our greatest trouble they are all the time trying to make people believe that conservatives have the monopoly of the imperial sentiment as a matter of fact i think that henslow is almost rabid on the war question  still your platformto use an americanism mr hennibul interposed must be founded upon domestic questions medchester is a manufacturing town and i am given to understand is suffering severely has your man any original views on the present depression in trade  brooks glanced towards the speaker with a smile  you have been reading the medchester post he remarked  the barrister nodded  yes it hinted at some rather surprising revelation  you must read henslows speech at the mass meeting tomorrow night brooks said at present i mustnt discuss these matters too much especially before a political opponent he remarked smiling at mr molyneux you might induce mr rochester to play our trump card  if your trump card is what i suspect it to be mr hennibul said i dont think you need fear that rochester would be ready enough to try it but some of his supporters wouldnt listen to it  the conversation drifted away from politics brooks found himself enjoying his luncheon amazingly sybil caroom devoted herself to him and he found himself somehow drawn with marvellous facility into the little circle of intimate friends afterwards they all strolled into the hall together for coffee and arranmore laid his hand upon his arm  i am sorry that you will not have time to look round the place he said you must come over again before long  you are very kind brooks said dropping his voice a little there are one or two more things which i should like to ask you about canada  i shall always be at your service lord arranmore answered  and i cannot go brooks continued without thanking you  we will take that for granted arranmore interrupted you know the spirit in which i gave it it is not i fear one of sympathy but it may at any rate save me from having my carriage windows broken one dark night by the bye i have ordered a brougham for you in halfanhour as you see it is raining your bicycle shall be sent in tomorrow  it is very kind of you indeed brooks declared  molyneux has to go in so you may just as well drive together arranmore remarked by the bye do you shoot  a little brooks admitted  you must have a day with us my head keeper is coming up this afternoon and i will try and arrange something the election is next week of course we must plan a day after then  i am afraid that my performance would scarcely be up to your standard brooks said although it is very kind of you to ask me i might come and look on  arranmore laughed  hennibul is all right he said but molyneux is a shocking duffer well give you an easy place we have some early callers i see  the butler was moving towards them followed by two men in huntingclothes  sir george marson and mr lacroix your lordship he announced  for a second arranmore stood motionless his eyes seemed to pass through the man in pink who was approaching with outstretched hand and to be fastened upon the face of his companion it chanced that brooks who had stepped a little on one side was watching his host and for the second time in one day he saw things which amazed him his expression seemed frozen on to his facesomething underneath seemed struggling for expression in a second it had all passed away brooks could almost have persuaded himself that it was fancy  come for something to eat arranmore sir george declared hungrily my second mans gone off with the sandwichcasehunting on his own i believe ill sack him tomorrow heres my friend lacroix who says you saved him from starvation once before out in the wilds somewhere awfully sorry to take you by storm like this but were twelve miles from home and its a godforsaken country for inns  luncheon for two at once groves lord arranmore answered delighted to meet you again mr lacroix last time we were both of us in very different trim  lady caroom came gliding up to them and shook hands with sir george  this sounds so interesting she murmured did you say that you met lord arranmore in his exploring days she asked turning to mr lacroix  i found lord arranmore in a log hut which he had built himself on the shores of lake ono lacroix said smiling and when i tell you that i had lost all my stores and that his was the only dwellingplace for fifty miles around you can imagine that his hospitality was more welcome to me then even than today  brooks who was standing near could not repress a start he fancied that lord arranmore glanced in his direction  lady caroom shuddered  the only dwellinghouse for fifty miles she repeated what hideous misanthropy  there was no doubt about it lacroix declared smiling my indian guide who knew every inch of the country told me so many times i can assure you that lord arranmore whom i am very pleased to meet again was a very different person in those days  the butler glided up from the background  luncheon is served in the small diningroom sir george he announced                                      molyneux and brooks drove in together to medchester and the former was disposedfor him to be talkative  queer thing about lacroix turning up he remarked i fancy our host looked a bit staggered  it was enough to surprise him brooks answered from lake ono to medchester is a long way  molyneux nodded  by jove it is he affirmed queer stick our host close as wax ive known him ever since he dropped in for the title and estates and ive never yet heard him open his mouth on the subject of his travels  was he away from england for very long brooks asked  no one knows where he was molyneux replied twenty years ago he was reading for the bar in london and he suddenly disappeared well i have never met a soul except lacroix today who has seen anything of him in the interval between his disappearance and his coming to claim the estates that means that for pretty well half a lifetime he passed completely out of the world poor beggar i fancy that he was hard up for one thing to brooks the subject was fascinating but he had an idea that it was scarcely the best of form to be discussing their late host with a man who was comparatively a stranger to him so he remained silent and molyneux with a yawn abandoned the subject  where does rochester hang out do you know he asked brooks i dont suppose for a moment i shall be able to find him  his headquarters are at the bell hotel brooks replied you will easily be able to come across him for he has a series of ward meetings tonight i am sorry that we are to be opponents  we shant quarrel about that molyneux answered here we are at medchester then better let him put you down and then he can go on with me youre coming out to shoot at enton arent you  lord arranmore was good enough to ask me brooks answered dubiously but i scarcely know whether i ought to accept i am such a wretched shot  molyneux laughed  well i couldnt hit a haystack he said so you neednt mind that besides arranmore isnt keen about his bag like some chaps are these your offices see you again then  brooks found a dozen matters waiting for his attention but before he settled down to work he wrote two letters one was to the man who was doing his work as secretary to the unemployed fund during the election and with a brief mention of a large subscription instructed him to open several relief stations which they had been obliged to chose a few days ago and the other letter was to victor lacroix whom he addressed at westbury park sir george marsons seat  dear sir  i should be exceedingly obliged if you would accord me a few minutes interview on a purely personal matter i will wait upon you anywhere according to your convenience  yours faithfully  kingston brooks    chapter ix  henslow speaks out  the bomb was thrown some ten thousand people crowded together in the marketplace at medchester under what seemed to be one huge canopy of dripping umbrellas heard for the first time for many years a bold and vigorous attack upon the principles which had come to be considered a part of the commercial ritual of the country henslow made the best of a great opportunity he spoke temperately but without hesitation and concluded with a biting and powerful onslaught upon that class of englishmen who wilfully closed their eyes to the prevailing industrial depression and endeavoured to lure themselves and others into a sense of false security as to the wellbeing of the country by means of illusive statistics in his appreciation of dramatic effect and the small means by which an audience can be touched henslow was a past master early in his speech he had waved aside the umbrella which a supporter was holding over him and regardless of the rain he stood out in the full glare of the reflected gaslight a ponderous powerful figure  no one can accuse me he cried of being a pessimist throughout my life i have striven personally and politically to look upon the brightest side of things but i count it a crime to shut ones eyes to the cloud in the sky even though it be no larger than a mans hand years ago that cloud was there for those who would to see today it looms over us a black and threatening peril and those who ostrichlike still hide their heads in the sand are the men upon whose consciences must rest in the future the responsibility for those evil things which are even now upon us theories are evil things but when theory and fact are at variance give me fact theoretically free trade shouldi admit itmake us the most prosperous nation in the world as a matter of fact never since this country commenced to make history has our commercial supremacy been in so rotten and insecure a position there isnt a flourishing industry in the country save those which provide the munitions of war and their prosperity is a spasmodic and i might almost add an undesirable thing now i am dealing with facts tonight not theories and i am going to quote certain unassailable truths and i am going to give you the immediate causes for them the furniture and joinery trade of england is bad there are thousands of good hands out of employment they are out of work because the manufacturer has few or no orders i want the immediate cause for that and i go to the manufacturer i ask him why he has no orders he tells me because every steamer from america is bringing huge consignments of readymade office and general furniture at such prices or such quality that the english shopkeepers prefer to stock them consequently trade is bad with him and he cannot find employment for his men i find here in medchester the boot and shoe trade in which you are concerned bad there are thousands of you who are willing to work who are out of employment i go to the manufacturer and i say to him why dont you find employment for your hands for two reasons he answers first because i have lost my colonial and some of my home trade through american competition and secondly because of the universally depressed condition of every kindred trade throughout the country which keeps people poor and prevents their having money to spend just now i am not considering the question of why the american can send salable boots and shoes into this country although the reasons are fairly obvious they have nothing to do with my point however we are dealing tonight with immediate causes  and now as to that depression throughout the country which keeps people poor as the boot manufacturer puts it and prevents their having money to spend i am going to take several trades one by one and ascertain the immediate cause of their depression  he had hold of his audience and he made good use of his advantage he quoted statistics showing the decrease of exports and relative increase of imports how could we hope to retain our accumulated wealth under such conditionsand finally he abandoned theorizing and argument and boldly declared his position  i will tell you he concluded what practical means i intend to bring to bear upon the situation i base my projected action upon this truism which is indeed the very kernel of my creed i say that every man willing and able to work should have work and i say that it is the duty of legislators to see that he has it today there are one hundred thousand men and women hanging about our streets deteriorating morally and physically through the impossibility of following their trade i say that it is time for legislators to inquire into the cause of this and to remedy it so i propose to move in the house of commons should your votes enable me to find myself there that a royal commission be immediately appointed to deal with this matter and i propose further to insist that this commission be composed of manufacturers and business men and that we dispense with all figureheads and i can promise you this that the first question which shall engage the attention of these men shall be an immediate revision of our tariffs we wont have men with theories which work out beautifully on paper and bring a great country into the throes of commercial ruin we wont have men who think that the laws their fathers made are good enough for them and that all change is dangerous because englishmen are sure to fight their way through in the long runa form of commercial jingoism to which i fear we are peculiarly prone we dont want scholars or statisticians we want a commission of plain business men and i promise you that if we get them there shall be presented to parliament before i meet you again practical measures which i honestly and firmly believe will start a wave of commercial prosperity throughout the country such as the oldest amongst you cannot remember we have the craftsmen the capital and the brainsall that we need is legislation adapted to the hour and not the last century and we can hold our own yet in the face of the world                                      afterwards at the political club and at the committeeroom there was much excited conversation concerning the effect of henslows bold declaration the general impression was this election was now assured a shouting multitude followed him to his hotel popular sentiment was touched and even those who had been facing the difficulty of life with a sort of dogged despair for years were raised into enthusiasm his words begat hope  in the committeeroom there was much excitement and a good deal of speculation every one realized that the full effect of this daring plunge could not be properly gauged until after it had stood the test of print but on the whole comment was strikingly optimistic brooks for some time was absent in the corridor he had come face to face with mary scott her eyes flashed with pleasure at the sight of him and she held out her hand frankly  you heard it all he asked eagerly  yesevery word tell me you understand these things so much better than i do is this an election dodge oris he in earnest was he speaking the truth  the honest truth i believe he answered leading her a little away from the crowd of people he is of course pressing this matter home for votes but he is very much in earnest himself about it  and you think that he is on the right track  i really believe so he answered in fact i am strongly in favour of making experiments in the direction he spoke of by the bye miss scott i have something to tell you you remember telling me about lord arranmore and his refusal to subscribe to the unemployed fund  yes  he has been approached againthe facts have been more fully made known to him and he has sent a cheque for one thousand pounds  she received the news with a coldness which he found surprising  i think i can guess she said quietly who the second applicant was  i went to see him myself he admitted  you must be very eloquent she remarked with a smile which he could not quite understand a thousand pounds is a great deal of money  it is nothing to lord arranmore he answered  less than nothing she admitted readily i would rather that he had stopped in the street and given halfacrown to a hungry child  stillit is a magnificent gift he declared we can open all our relief stations again i believe that you are a little prejudiced against lord arranmore  i she shrugged her shoulders how should i be i have never spoken a word to him in my life but i think that he has a hard cynical face and a hateful expression  brooks disagreed with her frankly  he seems to me he declared like a man who has had a pretty rough time and i believe he had in his younger days but i do not believe that he is really either hard or cynical he has some odd views as regards charity but upon my word they are logical enough  she smiled  well well not disagree about him she declared i wonder how long my uncle means to be  shall i find out he asked  would it be troubling you he is so excited that i dare say he has forgotten all about me  which was precisely what he had done brooks found him the centre of an animated little group with a freshlylit cigar in his mouth and every appearance of having settled down to spend the night he was almost annoyed when brooks reminded him of his niece  god bless my soul i forgot all about mary he exclaimed with vexation she must go and sit somewhere i shant be ready yet henslow wants us to go down to the bell and have a bit of supper  in that case brooks said you had better allow me to take miss scott home and i will come then to you  capital if you really dont mind mr bullsom declared put her in a cab dont let her be a bother to you  brooks found her reluctant to take him away but he pleaded a headache and assured her that his work for the night was over outside he led her away from the centre of the town to a quiet walk heading to the suburb where she lived here the streets seemed strangely silent and brooks walked hat in hand heedless of the rain which was still sprinkling oh this is good he murmured how one wearies of these crowds  all the same she answered smiling i think that your place just now is amongst them and i shall not let you take me further than the top of the hill  brooks looked down at her and laughed  what a very determined person you are he said i will take you to the top of the hilland then we will see    chapter x  a tempting offer  the small boy brought in the card and laid it on brooks desk with a flourish  hes outside sirin mr bartons room shall i show him in  brooks for a moment hesitated he glanced at a letter which lay open upon the desk before him and which he had read and reread many times the boy repeated his inquiry  yes of course he answered show him in at once  lord arranmore more than usually immaculate strolled in hat in hand and carefully selecting the most comfortable chair seated himself on the other side of the open table at which brooks was working  how are you brooks he inquired tersely busy of course an aftermath of work i suppose  a few months ago brooks answered i should have considered myself desperately busy but after last week anything ordinary in the shape of work seems restful  lord arranmore nodded  i must congratulate you i suppose he remarked you got your man in  we got him in all right brooks assented our majority was less than we had hoped for though  lord arranmore shrugged his shoulders  it was large enough he answered and after all it was a clear gain of a seat to your party wasnt it  it was a seat which we radicals had a right to brooks declared now that the storm of imperialism is quieting down and people are beginning to realize that matters nearer home need a little attention i cannot see how the manufacturing centres can do anything save return radicals we are the only party with a definite home policy  lord arranmore nodded  just so he remarked indifferently i neednt say that i didnt come here to talk politics there was a little matter of business which i wished to put before you  brooks looked up in some surprise  business he repeated a little vaguely  yes as you are aware mr morrison has had the control of the enton estates for many years he was a very estimable man and he performed his duties so far as i know quite satisfactorily now that he is dead however i intend to make a change the remaining partners in his firm are unknown to me and i at once gave them notice of my intention would you care to undertake the legal management of my estates in this part of the world  brooks felt the little colour he had leave his cheeks for a moment he was quite speechless  i scarcely know how to answer or to thank you lord arranmore he said at last this is such a surprising offer i scarcely see how you can be in earnest you know so little of me  lord arranmore shrugged his shoulders  really he said i dont see anything very surprising in it morrisons have a large practice and without the old man i scarcely see how they could continue to give my affairs the attention they require you on the other hand are only just starting and you would be able to watch over my interests more closely thenalthough i cannot pretend that i am much influenced by sentimental reasonsstill i knew your father and the strangeness of our few years of life as neighbours inclines me to be of service to you provided i myself am not the sufferer as to that i am prepared to take the risk you see mine is only the usual sort of generositythe sort which provides for an adequate quid pro quo of course if you think that the undertaking of my affairs would block you in other directions do not hesitate to say so this is a matter of business between us pure and simple  brooks had recovered himself the length of lord arranmores speech and his slow drawl had given him an opportunity to do so he glanced for a moment at the letter which lay upon his desk and hated it  in an ordinary way lord arranmore he answered there could be only one possible reply to such an offer as you have made mean immediate and prompt acceptance if i seem to hesitate it is because firsti must tell you something i must make somethingin the nature of a confession  lord arranmore raised his eyebrows but his face remained as the face of a sphinx he sat still and waited  on the occasion of my visit to you brooks continued you may remember the presence of a certain mr lacroix he is the author i believe of several books of travel in western canada and has the reputation of knowing that part of the country exceedingly well  brooks paused but his visitor helped him in no way his face wore still its passive expression of languid inquiry  he spoke of his visit to you brooks went on in canada and he twice reiterated the fact that there was no other dwelling within fifty miles of you he said this upon his own authority and upon the authority of his indian guide now it is only a few days ago since you spoke of my father as living for years within a few miles of you  lord arranmore nodded his head thoughtfully  ah and you found the two statements of course irreconcilable well go on  brooks found it difficult he was grasping a paperweight tightly in one hand and he felt the rising colour burn his cheeks  i wrote to mr lacroix he said  a perfectly natural thing to do lord arranmore remarked smoothly  and his answer is here  suppose you read it to me lord arranmore suggested  brooks took up the letter and read it  travellers club december 10  dear sir  replying to your recent letter i have not the slightest hesitation in reaffirming the statement to which you refer i am perfectly convinced that at the time of my visit to lord arranmore on the bank of lake quo there was no englishman or dwellingplace of any sort within a radius of fifty miles the information which you have received is palpably erroneous  why not refer to lord arranmore himself he would certainly confirm what i say and finally dispose of the matter  yours sincerely  victor lacroix  a very interesting letter lord arranmore remarked well  brooks crumpled the letter up and flung it into the wastepaper basket  lord arranmore he said i made this inquiry behind your back and in a sense i am ashamed of having done so yet i beg you to put yourself in my position you must admit that my fathers disappearance from the world was a little extraordinary he was a man whose life was more than exemplaryit was saintly for year after year he worked in the policecourts amongst the criminal classes his whole life was one long record of splendid devotion his health at last breaks down and he is sent by his friends for a voyage to australia he never returns years afterwards his papers and particulars of his death are sent home from one of the loneliest spots in the empire a few weeks ago you found me out and told me of his last days you see what i must believe that he wilfully deserted his wife and sonmyself that he went into lonely and inexplicable solitude for no apparent or possible reason that he misused the money subscribed by his friends in order that he might take this trip to australia was ever anything more irreconcilable  from your point of viewperhaps not lord arranmore answered you must enlarge it  will you tell me how brooks demanded  lord arranmore stifled a yawn he had the air of one wearied by a profitless discussion  well he said i might certainly suggest a few things who was your trustee or guardian or your fathers man of business  mr ascough of lincolns inn fields  exactly your father saw him of course prior to his departure from england  yes  well is it not a fact that instead of making a will your father made over by deed of gift the whole of his small income to your mother in trust for you  yes he did that brooks admitted  lord arranmore shrugged his shoulders  think that over he remarked doesnt that suggest his already halfformed intention never to return  it never struck me in that way brooks answered yet it is obvious lord arranmore said now i happen to know from your father himself that he never intended to go to australia and he never intended to return to england he sailed instead by an allan liner from liverpool to quebec under the name of francis he went straight to montreal and he stayed there until he had spent the greater part of his money then he drifted out west there is his history for you in a few words  a sudden light flashed in brooks eyes  he told you that he left england meaning never to return then you have the key to the whole thing why not that is what i want to know why not  i do not know lord arranmore answered coolly he never told me  brooks felt a sudden chill of disappointment lord arranmore rose slowly to his feet  mr brooks he said i have told you all that i know you have asked me a question which i have not been able to answer i can however give you some advice which i will guarantee to be excellentsome advice which you will do well to follow shall i go on  if you please  do not seek to unravel any further what may seem to you to be the mystery of your fathers disappearance from the world depend upon it his action was of his own free will and he had excellent reasons for it if he had wished you to know them he would have communicated with you remember i was with your father during his last daysand this is my advice to you  brooks pointed downward to the crumpled ball of paper  that letter he exclaimed  lord arranmore shrugged his shoulders  i scarcely see its significance he said it is not even my word against lacroix i sent you all your fathers papers i brought back photographs and keepsakes known to belong to him in what possible way could it benefit me to mislead you  the telephone on brooks table rang and for a moment or two he found himself with mechanical selfpossession attending to some unimportant question when he replaced the receiver lord arranmore had resumed his seat but was drawing on his gloves  come he said let us resume our business talk i have made you an offer what have you to say  brooks pointed to the wastepaper basket  i did a mean action he said i am ashamed of it do you mean that your offer remains open  certainly lord arranmore answered that little affair is not worth mentioning i should probably have done the same  well i am not altogether a madman brooks declared smiling so i will only say that i accept your offer gratefullyand i will do my very best to deserve your confidence  lord arranmore rose and stood with his hands behind him looking out of the window  very good he said i will send for ascough to come down from town and we must meet one day next week at morrisons office and go into matters thoroughly that reminds me busher my head bailiff will be in to see you this afternoon there are halfadozen leases to be seen to at once and everything had better come here until the arrangements are concluded  i shall be in all the afternoon brooks answered still a little dazed  and thursday lord arranmore concluded you dine and sleep at enton i hope we shall have a good days sport the carriage will fetch you at 630 goodmorning  lord arranmore walked out with a little nod but on the threshold he paused and looked back  by the bye brooks he said do you remember my meeting you in a little teashop almost the day after i first called upon you  quite well brooks answered  you had a young lady with you  yes i was with miss scott  lord arranmores hand fell from the handle his eyes seemed suddenly full of fierce questioning he moved a step forward into the room  miss scott who is she  brooks was hopelessly bewildered and showed it  she lives with her uncle in medchester he is a builder and timber merchant  lord arranmore was silent for a moment  her father then is dead he asked  he died abroad i think brooks answered but i really am not sure i know very little of any of them  lord arranmore turned away  she is the image of a man i once knew he remarked but after all the type is not an uncommon one you wont forget that busher will be in this afternoon he is a very intelligent fellow for his class and you may find it worth your while to ask him a few questions until thursday then  until thursday brooks repeated mechanically    chapter xi  who the devil is brooks  to be tired declared sydney molyneux sinking into a low couch to be downright dead dogtired is the most delightful thing in the world will some one give me some tea  brooks laughed softly from his place in front of the open fire a long day in the fresh north wind had driven the cobwebs from his brain and brought the burning colour to his cheeks his eyes were bright and his laughter was like music  and you he exclaimed are fresh from electioneering why fatigue like this is a luxury  molyneux lit a cigarette and looked longingly at the teatray set out in the middle of the hall  that is all very well he said but there is a wide difference between the two forms of exercise in electioneering one can use ones brain and my brain is never weary it is capable of the most stupendous exertions it is my legs that fail me sometimes here comes lady caroom at last why does she look as though she had seen a ghost  that great staircase at enton came right into the hall a few steps from the bottom lady caroom had halted and her appearance was certainly a little unusual every vestige of colour had left her cheeks her right hand was clutching the oak banisters her eyes were fixed upon brooks he was for a moment embarrassed but he stepped forward to meet her  how do you do lady caroom he said we are all in the shadows here and mr molyneux is crying out for his tea  she resumed her progress and greeted brooks graciously almost at the same moment a footman brought lamps and the tea was served lady caroom glanced again with a sort of curious nervousness at the young man who stood by her side  you are a little earlier than we expected she remarked seating herself before the teatray here comes sybil she is dying to congratulate you mr brooks is arranmore here  we left him in the gunroom molyneux answered he is coming directly  sybil caroom in a short skirt and a jaunty hat came towards brooks with outstretched hand  delightful she exclaimed i only wish that it had been nine thousand instead of nine hundred you deserved it  brooks laughed heartily  well we were satisfied to win the seat he declared  molyneux leaned forward teacup in hand  well you deserved it he remarked our old man opened his mouth a bit but yours knocked him silly upon my word i didnt think that any one man had cheek stupendous enough to humbug a constituency like henslow did it took my breath away to read his speeches  do you really mean that asked brooks  mean it of course i do what i cant understand is how people can swallow such stuff election after election doesnt every radical candidate get up and talk in the same maudlin wayhasnt he done so for the last fifty years and when he gets into parliament is there a more conservative person on the face of the earth than the radical member pledged to social reform its the same with your man henslow hell do nothing hell attempt nothing silly farce politics i think  lady caroom laughed softly  i have never heard you so eloquent in my life sydney she exclaimed do go on it is most entertaining when you have quite finished i can see that mr brooks is getting ready to pulverize you  brooks shook his head  lady sybil tells me that mr molyneux is not to be taken seriously he answered  molyneux brought up his cup for some more tea  dont you listen to lady sybil brooks he retorted she is annoyed with me because i have been spoken of as a future prime minister and she rather fancies her cousin for the post two knobs please and plenty of cream as a matter of fact i am in serious and downright earnest i say that henslow won his seat by kidding the working classes he promised them a sort of political arabian nights hell go up to westminster and im open to bet what you like that he makes not one serious practical effort to push forward one of the startling measures he talked about so glibly i will trouble you for the toast brooks thanks  he is always cynical like this sybil murmured when his party have lost a seat dont take any notice of him mr brooks i have great faith in mr henslow and i believe that he will do his best  molyneux smiled  henslow is a politician he remarked a professional politician what you radicals want is englishmen who are interested in politics henslow knows how to get votes hes got his seat and hell keep ittill the next election  brooks shook his head  henslow has rather a platform manner he said but he is sound enough i believe that we are on the eve of important changes in our social legislation and i believe that henslow will have much to say about them at any rate he is not a rank hypocrite we have shown him things in medchester which he can scarcely forget in a hurry he will go to westminster with the memory of these things before him with such a cry in his ears as no man can stifle he might forget if he wouldbut he never will we have shown him things which men may not forget  lord arranmore who had now joined the party leaned forward with his arm resting lightly upon lady carooms shoulder an uneasy light flashed in his eyes  there are men he said whom you can never reach genial men with a ready smile and a prompt chequebook whose selfishness is an armour more potent than the armour of my forefather there sir ronald kingston of arranmore and after all why not the thoroughly selfish man is the only person logically who has the slightest chance of happiness  it is true molyneux murmured delightfully true  lord arranmore is always either cynical or paradoxical sybil caroom declared he really says the most unpleasant things with the greatest appearance of truth of any man i know  this company lord arranmore remarked lightly is hostile to me let us go and play pool  lady caroom rose up promptly molyneux groaned audibly  you shall play me at billiards instead she declared i used to give you a good game once and i have played a great deal lately ring for annette will you sybil she has my cue  sybil caroom made room for brooks by her side  do sit down and tell me more about the election she said sydney is sure to go to sleep he always does after shooting  you shall ask me questions he suggested i scarcely know what part of it would interest you  they talked together lightly at first then more seriously from the other end of the hall came the occasional click of billiard balls lady caroom and her host were playing a leisurely game interspersed with conversation  who is this young mr brooks she asked pausing to chalk her cue  a solicitor from medchester he answered he was parliamentary agent for henslow and i am going to give him a management of my estates  he is quite a boy she remarked  twentysix or seven he answered how well you play those cannons  i ought to i had lessons for years is he a native of medchester  lord arranmore was blandly puzzled she finished her stroke and turned towards him  mr brooks you know we were talking of him  of course we were he answered i do not think so he is an orphan i met his father in canada  he reminds me of some one she remarked in a puzzled tone just now as i was coming downstairs it was almost startling he is a goodlooking boy  be careful not to foul he admonished her you should have the spiderrest  lady caroom made a delicate cannon from an awkward place and concluded her break in silence then she leaned with her back against the table chalking her cue her figure was still the figure of a girl she was a remarkably pretty woman she laid her slim white fingers upon his coatsleeve  i wonder she said softly whether you will ever tell me  if you look at me like that he answered smiling i shall tell youa great many things  her eyes fell it was too absurd at her age but her cheeks were burning  you dont improve a bit she declared you were always too apt with your tongue  i practiced in a good school he answered  dear me she sighed for elderly people what a lot of rubbish we talk  he shivered  what a hideous word he remarked you make me feel that my chest is padded and my hair dyed if to talk sense is a sign of youth let us do it  by all means when are you going to find me a husband for sybil  wellis there any hurry he asked  lots we are going to fernshire next week and the place is always full of young men if you have anything really good in your mind i dont want to miss it  he took up his cue and scored an excellent break she followed suit and he broke down at an easy cannon then he came over to her side  how do you like mr brooks he asked quietly  he seems a nice boy she answered lightly he remained silent suddenly she looked up into his face and clutched the sides of the table  youyou dont mean that she murmured suddenly pale to the lips  he led her to a chair the game was over  some day he whispered i will tell you the whole story                                      even to think of these things sybil said softly makes us feel very selfish  no one is ever hopelessly selfish who is conscious of it he answered smiling and after all it would not do for every one to be always brooding upon the darker side of life  in another minute molyneux exclaimed waking up with a start i should have been asleep whatever have you two been talking about it was the most soothing hum i ever heard in my life  mr brooks was telling me of some new phases of life she answered it is very interesting even if it is a little sad  molyneux eyed them both for a moment in thoughtful silence  hm he remarked dinner is the next phase of life which will interest me has the dressingbell gone yet  you gross person she exclaimed you ate so much tea you had to go to sleep  it was the exercise he insisted  you have been standing about all day i heard you ask for a place without any walking and where as few people as possible could see you miss your birds  your ears are a great deal too sharp he said it was the wind then  never mind what it was she answered laughing you can go to sleep again if you like  molyneux put up his eyeglass and looked from one to the other he saw that sybils interest in her companions conversation was not assumed and for the first time he appreciated brooks good looks he shook off his sleepiness at once and stood by sybils side  have you been trying to convert lady sybil he asked  it is unnecessary she answered quickly mr brooks and i are on the same side  he laughed softly and strolled away lord arranmore was standing thoughtfully before the markingboard he laid his hand upon his arm  i say arranmore he asked who the devil is brooks    chapter xii  mr bullsom gives a dinnerparty  god bless my soul mr bullsom exclaimed listen to this mrs bullsom in a resplendent new dress looking shinier and fatter than ever was prepared to listen to anything which might relieve the tension of the moment for it was the evening of the dinnerparty and within ten minutes of the appointed time mr bullsom stood under the incandescent light and read aloud the shootingparty at enton yesterday consisted of the marquis of arranmore the hon sydney molyneux mr hennibul kc and mr kingston brooks notwithstanding the high wind an excellent bag was obtained  what our mr kingston brooks selina exclaimed  its brooks right enough mr bullsom exclaimed i called at his office yesterday and they told me that he was out for the day well that licks me  mary who was reading a magazine in a secluded corner looked up  i saw mr brooks in the morning she remarked he told me that he was going to enton to dine and sleep  selina looked at her cousin sharply  you saw mr brooks she repeated where  i met him mary answered coolly he told me that lord arranmore had been very kind to him  why didnt you tell us louise asked  i really didnt think of it mary answered it didnt strike me as being anything extraordinary  not when hes coming here to dine tonight selina repeated and is a friend of papas why mary what nonsense  i really dont see anything to make a fuss about mary said going back to her magazine  mr bullsom drew himself up and laid down the paper with the paragraph uppermost  well it is most gratifying to think that i gave that young man his first start he remarked i believe too that he is not likely to forget it  the bell mrs bullsom exclaimed with a little gasp some one has come  well if they have theres nothing to be frightened about mr bullsom retorted aint we expecting them to come dont look so scared sarah take up a book or something why bless my soul youre all of a tremble  i cant help it peter mrs bullsom replied nervously i dont know these people scarcely a bit and im sure i shall do something foolish selina be sure you look at me when im to come away and  mr kingston brooks  brooks ushered in by a neighbouring greengrocer entered upon a scene of unexpected splendour selina and her sister were gorgeous in green and pink respectively mr bullsoms shirtfront was a thing to wonder at there was an air of repressed excitement about everybody except mary who welcomed him with a quiet smile  i am not much too early i hope brooks remarked  youre in the nick of time mr bullsom assured him  brooks endeavoured to secure a chair near mary which attempt selina adroitly foiled  weve been reading all about your grandeur mr brooks she exclaimed what a beautiful day you must have had at enton  brooks looked puzzled  it was very enjoyable he declared i wanted to see you miss scott he added turning to mary i think that we can arrange that date for the lecture now how would wednesday week do  admirably mary answered  do you know whom you take in mr brooks selina interrupted  brooks glanced at the card in his hand  mrs seventon he said yes thanks  selina looked up at him with an arch smile  mrs seventon is most dreadfully proper she said you will have to be on your best behaviour oh here comes some one what a bother  there was an influx of guests mrs bullsom reduced to a state of chaotic nervousness was pushed as far into the background as possible by her daughters and mr bullsom banished from the hearth where he felt surest of himself plunged into a conversation with mr seventon on the weather brooks leaned over towards mary  wednesday week at eight oclock then he said i want to have a chat with you about the subject  not now she interposed you know these people dont you and the huntingdons go and talk to them please  brooks laughed and went to the rescue he won mrs bullsoms eternal gratitude by diverting mrs seventons attention from her and thereby allowing her a moment or two to recover herself somehow or other a buzz of conversation was kept up until the solemn announcement of dinner and when she was finally seated in her place and saw a couple of nimble waiters with the greengrocer in the back looking cool and capable she felt that the worst was over  the solemn process of sampling doubtfullooking entries and eating saddle of mutton to the tune of a forced conversation was got through without disaster mrs bullsom felt her fat face break out into smiles mr bullsom though he would like to have seen everybody go twice for everything began to expand he had already recited the story of kingston brooks greatness to both of his immediate neighbours and in a casual way mentioned his early patronage of that remarkable young man and once meeting his eye he raised his glass  not quite up to the enton vintage brooks eh but all right i hope  brooks nodded back and resumed his conversation selina took the opportunity to mention casually to her neighbour mr huntingdon that mr brooks was a great friend of lord arranmores and louise on her side of the table took care also to disseminate the same information everybody was properly impressed mr bullsom decided to give a dinnerparty every month and to double the greengrocers tip and by the time selinas third stage whisper had reached her mother and the ladies finally departed he was in a state of geniality bordering upon beatitude there was a general move to his end of the table mr bullsom started the port and his shirtfront grew wider and wider he lit a cigar and his thumb found its way to the armhole of his waistcoat at that moment mr bullsom would not have changed places with any man on earth  what sort of a place is enton to stay at brooks eh he inquired in a friendly manner keeps it up very well dont he the present marquis  brooks sighed  i really dont know much about it he answered i was only there one night  good days sport  very good indeed brooks answered lord arranmore is a wonderful shot  a remarkable man in a great many ways lord arranmore dr seventon remarked he disappeared from london when he was an impecunious young barrister with apparently no earthly chance of succeeding to the arranmore estates and from that time till a few years ago when he was advertised for not a soul knew his whereabouts even now i am told that he keeps the story of all these years absolutely to himself no one knew where he was or how he supported himself  i can tell you where he was for some time at any rate brooks said he was in canada for he met my father there and was with him when he died  indeed dr seventon remarked then i should say that you are one of the only men in england to whom he has opened his lips on the subject do you know what he was doing there  fishing and shooting i think brooks answered it was near lake ono right out west and there would be nothing else to take one there  it was always supposed too that he had spent most of the time in a situation in new york mr huntingdon said  i know a man mr seaton put in who can swear that he met him as a sergeant in the first australian contingent of mounted infantry sent to the cape  there are no end of stories about him dr seventon remarked if i were the man i would put a stop to them by telling everybody exactly where i was during those twenty years or so it is a big slice of ones life to seal up  still there is not the slightest reason why he should take the whole world into his confidence is there brooks expostulated he is not a public man  a peer of england with a seat in the house of lords must always be a public man to some extent mr huntingdon remarked  i am not sure brooks remarked that the lives of all our hereditary legislators would bear the most searching inquiry  thats right brooks mr bullsom declared  stick up for your pals  brooks looked a little annoyed  the only claim i have upon lord arranmores acquaintance he remarked is his kindness to my father i hope dr seventon that you are going to press the matter of that fever hospital home i have a little information which i think you might make use of  brooks changed his place wineglass in hand and the conversation drifted away but he found the position of social star one which the bullsoms were determined to force upon him for they had no sooner entered the drawingroom than selina came rushing across the room to him and drew him confidentially on one side  mr brooks she said do go and talk to mrs huntingdon she is so anxious to hear about the lady caroom who is staying at enton  i know nothing about lady caroom brooks replied without any overplus of graciousness  selina looked at him in some dismay  but you met her at enton didnt you she asked  oh yes i met her there brooks answered impatiently but i certainly dont know enough of her to discuss her with mrs huntingdon i rather wanted to speak to your cousin  selinas thin little lips became compressed and for a moment she forgot to smile her cousin indeed mary who was sitting there in a plain black gown without a single ornament and not even a flower looking for all the world like the poor relation she was selina glanced downwards at the great bunch of roses and maidenhair fern in her bosom at the fancy and beaded trimming which ran like a nightmare all over her new gown and which she was absolutely certain had come from paris at the heavy gold bracelets which concealed some part of her thin arms she remembered suddenly the aigrette in her hair such a finish to her costume and her selfconfidence returned  oh dont bother about mary now mrs huntingdon is dying to have you talk to her please do and if you likei will give you one of my roses for your buttonhole  brooks stood the shock gallantly and bowed his thanks he had met mrs huntingdon before and they talked together for a quarter of an hour or so  i wish i knew why you were here was almost her first question isnt it all funny  mr bullsom has always been very decent to me he answered it is through him i was appointed agent to mr henslow  oh business i see she answered shrugging her shoulders same here im a doctors wife you know did you ever see such awful girls and who in the name of all thats marvellous can be their dressmaker  bullsom is a very good sort indeed brooks answered i have a great respect for him  she made a little face  whos the nicelooking girl in black with her hair parted in the middle she asked mr bullsoms niece she is quite charming and most intelligent  dear me mrs huntingdon remarked i had no idea she had anything to do with the family sort of a cinderella look about her now you mention it couldnt you get her to come over and talk to me im horribly afraid of mrs bullsom shell come out of that dress if she tries to talk and i know i shall laugh  im sure i can brooks answered rising with alacrity ill bring her over in a minute  mary had just finished arranging a cardtable when brooks drew her on one side  about that subject he began  we shall scarcely have time to talk about it now shall we she answered you will be wanted to play cards or something we shall be quite content to leave it to you  i should like to talk it over with you he said do tell me when i may see you  she sat down and he stood by her chair really i dont know she answered perhaps i shall be at home when you pay your duty call  come and have some tea at mellors with me tomorrow  she seemed not to hear him she had caught mrs seventons eye across the room and rose to her feet  you have left mrs seventon alone all the evening she said i must go and talk to her  he stood before hera little insistent  i shall expect you at halfpast four he said  she shook her head  oh no i have an engagement  the next day then  thank you i would rather you did not ask me i have a great deal to do just now i will bring the girls to the lecture  wednesday week he protested is a long way off  you can go over to enton she laughed and get some more cheques from your wonderful friend  i wonder he remarked why you dislike lord arranmore so much  instinct perhapsor caprice she answered lightly  the latter for choice he answered i dont think that he is a man to dislike instinctively he rather affected me the other way  she was suddenly graver  it is foolish of me she remarked you will think so too when i tell you that my only reason is because of a likeness  a likeness he repeated  she nodded  he is exactly like a man who was once a friend of my fathers and who did him a great deal of harm my father was much to blame i know but this man had a great influence over him and a most unfortunate one now dont you think im absurd  i think it is a little rough on lord arranmore he answered dont you  it would be if my likes or dislikes made the slightest difference to him she answered as it is i dont suppose it matters  was this in england he asked  she shook her head  no it was abroadin montreal i really must go to mrs seventon she looks terribly bored  brooks made no effort to detain her he was looking intently at a certain spot in the carpet the coincidenceit was nothing more of coursewas curious    chapter xiii  charity the crime  there followed a busy time for brooks the result of which was a very marked improvement in his prospects for the younger morrison and his partner loth to lose altogether the valuable enton connection offered brooks a partnership in their firm mr ascough who was lord arranmores london solicitor and had been brooks guardian after careful consideration advised his acceptance and there being nothing in the way the arrangements were pushed through almost at once mr ascough on the morning of his return to london took the opportunity warmly to congratulate brooks  lord arranmore has been marvellously kind to me brooks agreed to tell you the truth mr ascough i feel almost inclined to add incomprehensibly kind  the older man stroked his grey moustache thoughtfully  lord arranmore is eccentric he remarked has always been eccentric and will remain so i suppose to the end of the chapter you are the one who profits however and i am very glad of it  eccentricity brooks remarked is of course the only obvious explanation of his generosity so far as i am concerned but it has occurred to me mr ascough to wonder whether the friendship or connection between him and my father was in any way a less slight thing than i have been led to suppose  mr ascough shrugged his shoulders  lord arranmore he said has told you no doubt all that there is to be told  brooks sat at his desk frowning slightly and tapping the blottingpaper with a penholder  all that lord arranmore has told me he said is that my father occupied a cabin not far from his on the banks of lake ono that they saw little of each other and that he only found out his illness by accident that my father then disclosed his name gave him his papers and your address there was merely the casual intercourse between two englishmen coming together in a strange country  that is what i have always understood mr ascough agreed have you any reason to think otherwise  no definite reasonexcept lord arranmores unusual kindness to me brooks remarked lord arranmore is one of the most selfcentred men i ever knewand the least impulsive why therefore he should go out of his way to do me a kindness i cannot understand  if this is really an enigma to you mr ascough answered i cannot help you to solve it lord arranmore has been the reverse of communicative to me i am afraid you must fall back upon his lordships eccentricity  mr ascough rose but brooks detained him  you have plenty of time for your train he said will you forgive me if i go over a little old ground with youfor the last time  the lawyer resumed his seat  i am in no hurry he said if you think it worth while  my father came to you when he was living at stepneya stranger to you  a complete stranger mr ascough agreed i had never seen him before in my life i did a little trifling business for him in connection with his property  he told you nothing of his family or relatives  he told me that he had not a relation in the world  you knew him slightly then brooks continued all the time he was in london and when he left for that voyage he came to you  yes  he made over his small income then to my mother in trust for me did it strike you as strange that he should do this instead of making a will  not particularly mr ascough declared as you know it is not an unusual course  it did not suggest to you any determination on his part never to return to england  certainly not  he left england on friendly terms with my mother  certainly she and he were people for whom i and every one who knew anything of their lives had the highest esteem and admiration  you can imagine no reason then for my father leaving england for good  certainly not  you know of no reason why he should have abandoned his trip to australia and gone to canada  none  his doing so is as inexplicable to you as to me  entirely  you have never doubted lord arranmores story of his death  never why should i  one more question brooks said do you know that lately i have met a travellera man who visited lord arranmore in canada and who declared to his certain knowledge there was no other human dwellinghouse within fifty miles of lord arranmores cabin  he was obviously mistaken  you think so  it is certain  brooks hesitated  my question he said will have given you some idea of the uncertainty i have felt once or twice lately owing to the report of the traveller lacroix and lord arranmores unaccountable kindness to me you see he isnt an ordinary man he is not a philanthropist by any means nor in any way a person likely to do kindly actions from the love of them now do you know of any facts or can you suggest anything which might make the situation clearer to me  i cannot mr brooks the older man answered without hesitation if you take my advice you will not trouble yourself any more with fancies which seem to mepardon mequite chimerical accept lord arranmores kindness as the offshoot of some sentimental feeling which he might well have entertained towards a fellowcountryman by whose deathbed he had stood in that faraway lonely country you may even yourself be mistaken in lord arranmores character and you can remember too that after all what means so much to you costs him nothingis probably for his own advantage  brooks rose and took up his hat  i am very much obliged to you mr ascough he said yours after all is the commonsense view of the affair if you like i will walk up to the station i am going that way     so brooks convinced of their folly finally discarded certain uncomfortable thoughts which once or twice lately had troubled him he dined at enton that night and improved his acquaintance with lady caroom and her daughter who were still staying there although this was not a matter which he had mentioned to mr ascough there was something which he found more inexplicable even than lord arranmores transference of the care of his estates to him and that was the apparent encouragement which both he and lady caroom gave to the friendship between sybil and himself they had lunched with him twice in medchester and more often still the enton barouche had been kept waiting at his office whilst lady caroom and sybil descended upon him with invitations from lord arranmore after his talk with mr ascough he put the matter behind him but it remained at times an inexplicable puzzle  on the evening of this particular visit he found sybil alone in a recess of the drawingroom with a newspaper in her hand she greeted him with obvious pleasure  do come and tell me about things mr brooks she begged i have been reading the local paper is it true that there are actually people starving in medchester  there is a great deal of distress he admitted gravely i am afraid that it is true  she looked at him with wideopen eyes  but i dont understand she said i thought that there were societies who dealt with all that sort of thing and behind thethe workhouse  so there are lady sybil he answered but you must remember that societies are no use unless people will subscribe to them and that there are a great many people who would sooner starve than enter the workhouse  but surely she exclaimed there is no difficulty about getting moneyif people only understand  he watched her for a moment in silencesuddenly appreciating the refinement the costly elegance which seemed in itself to be a part of the girl and yet for which surely her toilette was in some way also responsible her white satin dress was cut and fashioned in a style which he was beginning to appreciate as evidence of skill and costliness a string of pearls around her throat gleamed softly in the firelight a chain of fine gold studded with opals and diamonds reached almost to her knees she wore few rings indeed but they were such rings as he had never seen before he had come as a guest to enton and there were thousands like her a momentary flash of thought carried him back to the days of the french revolution there was a print hanging in his room of a girl as fair and as proud as this one surrounded by a fierce rabble mad with hunger and the pentup rage of generations tearing the jewels from her fingers tearing even he thought the trimming from her gown  you do not answer me mr brooks she reminded him  he recovered himself with a start  i beg your pardon lady sybil your question set me thinking we have tried to make people understand and many have given most generously but for all that we cannot cope with such distress as there is today in medchester i am secretary for one of the distribution societies and i have seen things which are enough to sadden a man for life only during the last few days  you have seen peoplereally hungry she asked with something like timidity in her face  he laughed bitterly  that we see every moment of the time we spend down amongst them he answered i have seen worse things i have seen the sapping away of charactermen become thieves and women worseto escape from starvation that i think is the greatest tragedy of all it makes one shudder when one thinks that on the shoulders of many people some portion of the responsibility at any rate for these things must rest  her lips quivered she emptied the contents of a gold chain purse into her hands  it is we who are wicked mr brooks she said who spend no end of money and close our ears to all this do take this will you can it go to some of the women you know and the children there are only five or six pounds there but i shall talk to mamma we will send you a cheque  he took the money without hesitation  i am very glad he said earnestly that you have given me this that you have felt that you wanted to give it me i hope you wont think too badly of me for coming over here to help you spend a pleasant evening and talking at all of such miserable things  badly she repeated no i shall never be able to thank you enough for telling me what you have done it makes one feel almost wicked to be sitting here and wearing jewelry and feeling well off spending money on whatever you want and to think that there are people starving how they must hate us  it is the wonderful part of it he answered i do not believe that they do i suppose it is a sort of fatalismthe same sort of thing only much less ignoble as the indifference which keeps our rich people contented and deaf to this terribly human cry  you are young she said looking at him to be so much interested in such serious things  it is my blood i suppose he answered my father was a policecourt missionary and my mother the matron of a pauper hospital  they are both dead are they not she asked softly  many years ago he answered  lady caroom and lord arranmore came in together a certain unusual seriousness in sybils face was manifest  you two do not seem to have been amusing yourselves lady caroom remarked giving her hand to brooks  mr brooks has been answering some of my questions about the poor people sybil answered and it is not an amusing subject  lord arranmore laughed lightly and there was a touch of scorn in the slight curve of his fine lips and his raised eyebrows he stood away from the shaded lamplight before a great open fire of cedar logs and the red glow falling fitfully upon his face seemed to brooks watching him with more than usual closeness to give him something of a mephistopheles aspect his evening clothes hung with more than ordinary precision about his long slim body his black tie and black pearl stud supplied the touch of sombreness so aptly in keeping with the mirthless bitter smile which still parted his lips  you must not take mr brooks too seriously on the subject of the poor people he said the mockery of his smile well matched in his tone brooks is an enthusiastone i am afraid of those misguided people who have barred the way to progress for centuries if only they could be converted  lady caroom sighed  oh dear how enigmatic she exclaimed do be a little more explicit  dear lady he continued turning to her it is not worth while yet i sometimes wonder whether people realize how much harm this hysterical philanthropythis purely sentimental faddism does how it retards the natural advance of civilization throws dust in peoples eyes salves the easy conscience of the rich man who bargains for immortality with a few strokes of the pen and finds mischievous occupation for a good many weak minds and parasitical females believe me that all personal charity is a mistake it is a good deal worse than that it is a crime  sybil rose up and a little unusual flush had stained her cheeks  i still do not understand you in the least lord arranmore she said it seems to me that you are making paradoxical and ridiculous statements which only bewilder us why is charity a crime that is what i should like to hear you explain  lord arranmore bowed slightly  i had no idea he said leaning his elbow upon the mantelpiece that i was going to be inveigled into a controversy but my dear sybil i will do my best to explain to you what i mean especially as at your age you are not likely to discover the truth for yourself in the first place charity of any sort is the most insidious destroyer of moral character which the world has ever known the man who once accepts it even in extremes imbibes a poison from which his system can never be thoroughly cleansed you let him loose upon society and the evil which you have sown in him spreads he is like a man with an infectious disease he is a source of evil to the community you have relieved a physical want and you have destroyed a moral quality i do not need to point out to you that the balance is on the wrong side  sybil glanced across at brooks and he smiled back at her  lord arranmore has not finished yet he said let us hear the worst  their host smiled  after all he said why do i waste my breath from the teens to the thirties sentiment smiles it is only later on in life that reason has any show at all yet you should ask yourselves you eager selfdenying young people who go about with a healthy moral glow inside because you have fed the poor or given an hour or so of your time to the distribution of reckless charityyou should ask yourselves what is the actual good of ministering to the outward signs of an internal disease you are simply trying to renovate the outside when the inside is filthy dont you see my dear young people that to give a meal to one starving man may be to do him indeed good but it does nothing towards preventing another starving man from taking his place tomorrow you stimulate the disease you help it to spread dont you see where instead you should turnto the social laws the outcome of which is that starving man you let them remain unharmed untouched while you fall over one another in frantic efforts to brush away todays effect of an eternal cause let your starving man die let the bones break through his skin and carry him uphim and his wife and their children and their fellowsto your house of commons tell them that there are more tomorrow more the next day let the millions of the lower classes look this thing in the face i tell you that either by a revolution which no doubt some of us would find worse than inconvenient or by less drastic means the thing would right itself you who work to relieve the individual only postpone and delay the millennium people will keep their eyes closed as long as they can it is you who help them to do so  dinner is served my lord the butler announced  lord arranmore extended his arm to lady caroom  come he said let us all be charitable to one another for i too am starving    chapter xiv  an awkward question  you think they really liked it then  how could they help it it was such a delightful idea of yours and i am sure all that you said was so simple and yet suggestive goodnight mr brooks  they stood in the doorway of the secular hall where brooks had just delivered his lecture it seemed to him that her farewell was a little abrupt  i was going to ask he said whether i might not see you home  she hesitated  really she said i wish you would not trouble it is quite a long way and i have only to get into a car  the further the better he answered and besides if your uncle is at home i should like to come in and see him  she made no further objection yet brooks fancied that her acquiescence was to some extent involuntary he walked by her side in silence for a moment or two wondering whether there was indeed any way in which he could have offended her  i have not seen you he remarked since the evening of your dinnerparty  no  you were out when i called  i have so many things to dojust now we can get a car here  he looked at it  it is too full he said let us walk on for a little way i want to talk to you  the car was certainly full so after a moments hesitation she acquiesced   you will bring your girls again i hope he asked  they will come i have no doubt she answered so will i if i am in medchester  you are going away  i hope so she answered i am not quite sure  not for good possibly  wont you tell me about it he asked  welli dont know  she hesitated for a moment  i will tell you if you like she said doubtfully but i do not wish anything said about it at present as my arrangements are not complete  i will be most discreet he promised  i have been doing a little work for a womans magazine in london and they have half promised me a definite post on the staff i am to hear in a few days as to the conditions if they are satisfactorythat is to say if i can keep myself on what they offeri shall go and live in london  he was surprised and also in a sense disappointed it was astonishing to find how unpleasant the thought of her leaving medchester was to him  i had no idea of this he said thoughtfully i did not know that you went in for anything of the sort  my literary ambitions are slight enough she answered yet you can scarcely be surprised that i find the thought of a definite career and a certain amount of independence attractive  he stole a sidelong glance at her in her plainly made clothes and quiet hat she was scarcely perhaps a girl likely to attract attention yet he was conscious of certain personal qualities which he had realized and understood from the first she carried herself well she walked with the free graceful movements of a wellbred and healthy girl in her face was an air of quiet thought the selfpossession of the woman of culture and experience her claim to good looks was after all slight enough yet on studying her he came to the conclusion that she could if she chose appear to much greater advantage her hair soft and naturally wavy was brushed too resolutely back her smile which was always charming she suffered to appear only at the rarest intervals she suggested a life of repression and with his knowledge of the bullsom menage he was able to surmise some glimmering of the truth  you are right he declared i think that i can understand what your feeling must be i am sure i wish you luck  the touch of sympathy helped her to unbend she glanced towards him kindly  thank you she said of course there will be difficulties my uncle will not like it he is very goodnatured and very hospitable and i am afraid his limitations will not permit him to appreciate exactly how i feel about it and my aunt is of course merely his echo  he will not be unreasonable brooks said i am sure of that for a man who is naturally of an obstinate turn of mind i think your uncle is wonderful he makes great efforts to free himself from all prejudices  unfortunately she remarked he is very down on the independent woman he would make housekeepers and cooks of all of us  surely he protested with a quiet smile your cousins are more ambitious than that i am sure selina would never wear a cookingapron unless it had ribbon and frilly things all over it  she laughed  after all they have been kind to me she said my mother was the black sheep of the family and when she died mr bullsom paid my passage home and insisted upon my coming to live here as one of the family i should hate them to think that i am discontented only the things which satisfy them do not satisfy me so life sometimes becomes a little difficult  have you friends in london he asked  none i tried living there when i first came back for a few weeks but it was impossible  you will be very lonely surely london is the loneliest of all great cities  why should i not make friends  that is what i too asked myself years ago when i was articled there he answered yet it is not so easy as it sounds every one seems to have their own little circle and a solitary person remains so often just outside yet if you have friendsand tasteslondon is a paradise oh how fascinating i used to find it just at firstbefore the chill came you too will feel that you will be content at first to watch to listen to wonder every type of humanity passes before you like the jumbledup figures of a kaleidoscope you are content even to sit before a window in a back streetand listen what a sound that isthe roar of london the voices of the street the ceaseless hum the creaking of the great wheel of humanity as it goes round and round and then perhaps in a certain mood the undernote falls upon your ear the bitter longdrawnout cry of the hopeless and helpless when you have once heard it life is never the same again then if you do not find friends you will know what misery is  they were both silent for a few minutes a car passed them unnoticed then she looked at him curiously  for a lawyer she remarked you are a very imaginative person  he laughed  ah well i was talking just then of how i felt in those days i was a boy then you know i dare say i could go back now to my old rooms and live there without a thrill  she shook her head  what one has once felt she murmured comes back always  sometimes only the echo he answered and that is weariness  they walked for a little way in silence then she spoke to him in an altered tone  i have heard a good deal about you during the last few weeks she said you are very much to be congratulated they tell me i am sure i am very glad that you have been so fortunate  thank you he answered to tell you the truth it all seems very marvellous to me only a few months ago your uncle was almost my only client of importance  lord arranmore was your fathers friend though was he not  they came together abroad he answered and lord arranmore was with my father when he died in canada  she stopped short  where  in canada on the banks of lake ono if you know where that is he answered looking at her in surprise  she resumed her usual pace but he noticed that she was pale  so lord arranmore was in canada she said do you know how long ago  about ten years i suppose he answered how long before that i do not know  she was silent for several minutes and they found themselves in the drive leading to the bullsom villa brooks was curious  i wonder he asked whether you will tell me why you are interested in lord arranmoreand canada  i was born in montreal she answered and i once saw some one very much like lord arranmore there but i am convinced that it could only have been a resemblance  you mentioned it beforewhen we saw him in mellors he remarked  yes it struck me then she admitted but i am sure that lord arranmore could not have been the person whom i am thinking about it is ridiculous of me to attach so much importance to a mere likeness  they stood upon the doorstep but she checked him as he reached out for the bell  you have seen quite a good deal of him she said tell me what you think of lord arranmore his hand fell to his side he stood under the gasbracket and she could see his face distinctly there was a slight frown upon his forehead a look of trouble in his grey eyes  you could not have asked me a more difficult question he admitted lord arranmore has been very kind to me although my claim upon him has been of the slightest he is very clever almost fantastic in some of his notions he is very polished and his manners are delightful he would call himself i believe a philosopher and he is although it sounds brutal for me to say so very selfish and behind it all i havent the faintest idea what sort of a man he is sometimes he gives one the impression of a strong man wilfully disguising his real characteristics for hidden reasons at others he is like one of those brilliant frenchmen of the last century who toyed and juggled with words and phrases esteeming it a triumph to remain an unread letter even to their intimates so you see after all he wound up i cannot tell you what i think of lord arranmore  you can ring the bell she said you must come in for a few minutes  their entrance together seemed to cause the little family party a certain amount of disturbed surprise the girls greeted brooks with a great show of pleasure but they looked doubtfully at mary  did you meet at the front door selina asked i thought i heard voices brooks was a little surprised  your cousin brought her class of factory girls to my lecture tonight at the secular hall  selinas eyes narrowed a little and she was silent for a moment then she turned to her cousin  you might have told us mary she exclaimed reproachfully we should so much have liked to come shouldnt we louise  of course we should louise answered snappishly i cant think why mary should go off without saying a word  mary looked at them both and laughed well she said i have left the house at precisely the same time on wednesday evenings all through the winter and neither of you have said anything about coming with me  this is quite different selina answered cuttingly we should very much have enjoyed mr brooks lecture do tell us what it was about  dont you be bothered brooks mr bullsom exclaimed hospitably sit down and try one of these cigars weve had supper but if youd like anything  nothing to eat thanks brooks protested ill have a cigar if i may  and a whiskyandsoda then mr bullsom insisted say when  brooks turned to selina mary had left the room you were asking about the lecture he said really it was only a very unpretentious affair and to tell you the truth only intended for people whose opportunities for reading have not been great i am quite sure it would not have been worth your while to come down we just read a chapter or so from a tale of two cities and talked about it  we should have liked it very mulch selina declared do tell us when there is another one will you  with pleasure he answered i warn you though that you will be disappointed  we will risk that selina declared with a smile have you been to enton this week  i was there on sunday he answered  and is that beautiful girl lady sybil caroom still staying there  yes he answered is she very beautiful by the bye  well i thought men would think so selina said hastily i think that she is just a little loud dont you louise  louise admitted that the idea had occurred to her  and her hairisnt it badly dyed selina remarked such a pity its all in patches  i think girls ought not to make up in the street either louise remarked primly a little powder in the house is all very welllouise had a nose which gave her troublebut i really dont think it looks respectable in the street  i suppose selina remarked you men admire all that sort of thing dont you  i really hadnt noticed it with lady sybil brooks admitted  selina sighed  men are so blind she remarked you watch next time you are close to her mr brooks  i will he promised ill get her between me and a window in a strong north light  selina laughed  dont be too unkind she said thats the worst of you men when you do find anything out you are always so severe  after all though louise remarked with a sidelong glance it must be very very interesting to meet these sort of people even if one doesnt quite belong to their set i should think you must find every one else quite tame mr brooks  i can assure you i dont he answered coolly this evening has provided me with quite as pleasant society as ever i should wish for  selina beamed upon him  oh mr brooks you are terrible you do say such things she declared archly  louise laughed a little hardly  we mustnt take too much to ourselves dear she said remember that mr brooks walked all the way up from the secular hall with mary  mr bullsom threw down his paper with a little impatient exclamation  come come he said i want to have a few words with brooks myself if you girlsll give me a chance heard anything from henslow lately eh  brooks leaned forward  not a word he answered  mr bullsom grunted  hm hes taken his seat and thats all he does seem to have done to have heard his last speech here before polling time you would have imagined him with halfadozen questions down before now hes letting the estimates go by too there are halfadozen obstructors all faddists but henslow with a real case behind him is sitting tight pon my word im not sure that i like the fellow  i ventured to write to him the other evening brooks said and i have sent him all the statistics we promised he seems to have regarded my letter as an impertinence though for he has never answered it  you mark my words mr bullsom said doubling the paper up and bringing it down viciously upon his knee henslow will never sit again for medchester there was none too mulch push about him last session but he smoothed us all over somehow hell not do it again im losing faith in the man brooks  brooks was genuinely disturbed his own suspicions had been gathering strength during the last few weeks henslow had been pleasant enough but a little flippant after the election from london he had promised to write to mr bullsom as chairman of his election committee mapping out the course of action which in pursuance of his somewhat daring pledges he proposed to embark upon this was more than a month ago and there had come not a single word from him all that vague distrust which brooks had sometimes felt in the man was rekindled and increased and with it came a flood of bitter thoughts another opportunity then was to be lost for seven years longer these thousands of pallid heartweary men and women were to suffer with no one to champion their cause he saw again that sea of eager faces in the marketplace lit with a sudden gleam of hope as they listened to the bold words of the man who was promising them life and hope and better things surely if this was a betrayal it was an evil deed not passively to be borne  mr bullsom had refreshed himself with whiskyandwater and decided that pessimism was not a healthy state of mind  i tell you what it is brooks he said more cheerfully we mustnt be too previous in judging the fellow lets write him civilly and if nothing comes of it in a week or two we will run up to london you and me eh and just haul him over the coals  you are right mr bullsom brooks said there is nothing we can do for the present  please dont talk any more horrid politics selina begged we want mr brooks to give us a lesson at billiards do you mind  brooks rose at once  i shall be charmed he declared  mr bullsom rose also  pooh pooh he said brooks and i will have a hundred up and you can watch us thatll be lesson enough for you  selina made a little grimace but they all left the room together in the hall a housemaid was speaking at the telephone and a moment afterwards she laid the receiver down and came towards them  it is a message for mr brooks sir from the queens hotel lord arranmores compliments and the ladies from enton are at the theatre this evening and would be glad if mr brooks would join them at the queens hotel for supper at eleven oclock  brooks hesitated but mr bullsom spoke up at once  off you go brooks he said firmly dont you go refusing an invitation like that lord arranmore is a bit eccentric they say and he isnt the sort of man to like refusals youve just got time  they had the message two hours ago and have been trying everywhere to find mr brooks the housemaid added  selina helped him on with his coat  will you come another evening soon and play billiards with us she asked dropping her voice a little  with pleasure brooks answered do you mind saying goodbye to your cousin for me i am sorry not to see her again    chapter xv  a supperparty at the queens  brooks was shown into a private room at the queens hotel and he certainly had no cause to complain of the warmth of his welcome lady sybil in fact made room for him by her side and he fancied that there was a gleam of reproach in her eyes as she looked up at him  is medchester really so large a place that one can get lost in it she asked lord arranmore has been sending messengers in every direction ever since we decided upon our little excursion  i telephoned to your office sent a groom to your rooms and to the club and at last we had given you up lord arranmore remarked  and i sybil murmured was in a shocking bad temper  it is very good of you all brooks remarked cheerfully i left the office rather early and have been giving a sort of lecture tonight at the secular hall then i went up to have a game of billiards with mr bullsom your telephone message found me there you must remember that even if medchester is not a very large place i am a very unimportant person  dear me what modesty lady caroom remarked laughing to us however you happened to be very important i hate a party of three  brooks helped himself to a quail and remembered that he was hungry  this is very unusual dissipation isnt it he asked i never dreamed that you would be likely to come into our little theatre  it was sybils doings lady caroom answered she declared that she was dull and that she had never seen a message from mars i think that all that serious talk the other evening gave her the blues  i am always dull in the winter when there is no hunting sybil remarked this frost is abominable i have not forgotten our talk either i feel positively wicked every time i sip champagne  our young philanthropist will reassure you arranmore remarked drily  lady caroom sighed  i wonder how it is she murmured that ones conscience and ones digestion both grow weaker as one grows old you and i arranmore are content to accept the good things of the earth as they come to us  with me he answered it is the philosophy of approaching old age but you have no such excuse with you it must be sheer callousness you are in an evil way lady caroom do have another of these quails  you are very rude she answered and extremely unsympathetic but i will have another quail  i do not want to destroy your appetite mr brooks lady sybil said but this isif not a farewell feast something like it  he looked at her with sudden interest  you are going away he exclaimed  very soon she assented we were so comfortable at enton and the hunting has been so good that we cut out one of our visits mamma developed a convenient attack of influenza but the next one is very near now and our host is almost tired of us  lord arranmore was for a moment silent  you have made enton he said intolerable for a solitary man when you go i go  i wish you could say whither instead of when lady caroom answered how bored you would be at redcliffe it is really the most outlandish place we go to  why ever do we accept mamma sybil asked last year i nearly cried my eyes out i was so dull not a man fit to talk to or a horse fit to ride the girls bicycle and lord redcliffe breeds cattle and talks turnips  and they all drink port after dinner lady caroom moaned but we have to go dear we must live rent free somewhere during these months to get through the season  sybil looked at brooks with laughter in her eyes  arent we terrible people she whispered you are by way of being literary arent you you should write an article on the shifts of the aristocracy mamma and i could supply you with all the material the real trouble of course is that i dont marry  fancy glorying in your failure lady caroom said complacently three seasons arranmore have i had to drag that girl round ive washed my hands of her now she must look after herself a girl who refuses one of the richest young men in england because she didnt like his collars is incorrigible  it was not his collars mother sybil objected it was his neck he was always called the giraffe he had no head and all neckthe most fatuous person too i hate fools  that is where you lack education dear lady caroom answered a fool is the most useful personfor a husband  sybil glanced towards brooks with a little sigh and catching a glimpse of his expression burst out laughing  mother you must really not let your tongue run away with you mr brooks is believing every word you say you neednt she murmured in a discreet undertone mother and i chaff one another terribly but were really very nicelybehaved personsfor our station in life  lady caroom has such a delightfully easy way of romancing brooks said  sybil nodded  its quite true she answered she ought to write the prospectuses for gold mines and things  arranmore smiled across the table at brooks  this he said is what i have had to endure for the last six weeks do you wonder that i am getting balder or that i set all my people to work tonight to try and find some one to suffer with me  hell be so dull when weve gone lady caroom sighed  youve no idea how weve improved him sybil murmured he used to read owen meredith after dinner and go to sleep by the bye where are you going when we leave enton  lord arranmore hesitated  well i really am not sure he said you have alarmed me dont go  lady caroom laughed  my dear man she said we must i darent offend the redcliffes hes my trustee and hell never let me overdraw a penny unless im civil to him if i were you i should go to the riviera well lend you our cottage at lugiano it has been empty for a year  come and be hostess he said i promise you that i will not hesitate then  she shook her head towards sybil  how can i marry that down there she demanded no young men who are really respectable go abroad at this time of the year they are all hunting or shooting the riviera is thronged with roues and invalids and adventurers and we dont want any of them dear me what sacrifices a grownup daughter does entail this coming season shall be your last sybil i wont drag on round again im really getting ashamed of it  isnt she dreadful sybil murmured to brooks i hope you will come to enton before we leave  it is very kind of you lady sybil brooks said but you must remember that i am not like most of the men you meet i have to work hard especially just now  and if i were you i would be thankful for it she said warmly from our point of view at any rate there is nothing so becoming to a man as the fact that he is a worker sport is an excellent thing but i detest young men who do nothing else but shoot and hunt and loaf about it seems to me to destroy character where work creates it all the same i hope you will find an opportunity to come to enton and say goodbye to us  brooks was suddenly conscious that it would be no pleasant thing to say goodbye to lady sybil he had never known any one like her so perfectly frank and girlish and yet with character enough underneath in her rare moments of seriousness more than ever he was struck with the wonderful likeness between mother and daughter  i will come at any time i am asked he answered quietly but i am sorry that you are going  they had finished supper and had drawn their chairs around the fire arranmore was smoking a cigarette and brooks took one from his case the carriage was ordered in a quarter of an hour brooks found that he and sybil were a little apart from the others  do you know i am sorry too she declared of course it has been much quieter at enton than most of the houses we go to and we only came at first i think because many years ago my mother and lord arranmore were great friends and she fancied that he was shutting himself up too much but i have enjoyed it very much indeed  he looked at her curiously he was trying to appreciate what a life of refined pleasure which she must live would really be likehow satisfyingwhether its limitations ever asserted themselves sybil was a more than ordinarily pretty girl but her face was as smooth as a childs the joie de vivre seemed to be always in her eyes yet there were times as he knew when she was capable of seriousness  i am glad he said lord arranmore will miss you  she laughed at him her eyebrows raised a challenge in her bright eyes  may i add that i also shall he whispered  you may she answered in fact i expected it i am not sure that i did not ask for it and that reminds me i want you to do me a favour if you will  anything i can do for you he answered you know will give me pleasure  she laughed softly  it is wonderful how you have improved she murmured i want you to go and see lord arranmore as often as you can we are both very fond of him really mamma especially and you know that he has a very strange disposition i am convinced that solitude is the very worst thing for him i saw him once after he had been alone for a month or two and really you would not have known him he was as thin as a skeleton strange in his manner and he had that sort of red light in his eyes sometimes which always makes me think of mad people he ought not to be alone at all but the usual sort of society only bores him you will do what you can wont you  i promise you that most heartily brooks declared but you must remember lady sybil that after all it is entirely in his hands he has been most astonishingly kind to me considering that i have no manner of claim upon him he has made me feel at home at enton too and been most thoughtful in every way for after all you see i am only his man of business i have no friends much and those whom i have are medchester people you see i am scarcely in a position to offer him my society but all the same i will take every opportunity i can of going to enton if he remains there  she thanked him silently lady caroom was on her feet and sybil and she went out for their wraps lord arranmore lit a fresh cigarette and sent for his bill  by the bye brooks he remarked one doesnt hear much of your man henslow  mr bullsom and i were talking about it this evening brooks answered we are getting a little anxious  you have had seven years of him you ought to know what to expect  the war has blocked all legislation brooks said it has been the usual excuse henslow was bound to wait he would have done the particular measures which we are anxious about more harm than good if he had tried to force them upon the land but now it is different we are writing to him if nothing comes of it mr bullsom and i are going up to see him  arranmore smiled  you are young to politics brooks he remarked yet i should scarcely have thought that you would have been imposed upon by such a man as henslow he is an absolute fraud i heard him speak once and i read two of his speeches it was sufficient the man is not in earnest he has some reason i suppose for wishing to write mp after his name but i am perfectly certain that he has not the slightest idea of carrying out his pledges to you you will have to take up politics brooks  he laugheda little consciously  some day he said the opportunity may come i will confess that it is amongst my ambitions but i have many years work before me yet  lord arranmore paid the bill and they joined the women as brooks stood bareheaded upon the pavement arranmore turned towards him  we must have a farewell dinner he said how would tomorrow suit youor sunday  i should like to walk over on sunday if i might brooks answered promptly  we shall expect you to lunch goodnight  the carriage drove off brooks walked thoughtfully through the silent streets to his rooms    chapter xvi  uncle and niece  mr bullsom was an early riser and it chanced that as was frequently the case on the morning following brooks visit he and mary sat down to breakfast together but when after a cursory glance through his letters he unfolded the paper she stopped him  uncle she said i want to talk to you for a few minutes if i may  go ahead he answered no fear of our being interrupted i shall speak to those girls seriously about getting up now what is it  i want to earn my own living uncle she said quietly  he looked over his spectacles at her  eh  i want to earn my own living she repeated i have been looking about for a means of doing so and i think that i have succeeded  mr bullsom took off his spectacles and wiped them carefully  earn your own living eh he repeated well go on  mary leaned across the table towards him  dont think that i am not grateful for all you have done for me uncle she said i am indeed only i have felt lately that it was my duty to order my life a little differently i am young and strong and able to work there is no reason why i should be a burden upon any one  she found his quietness ominous but she did not flinch  i am not accomplished enough for a governess or goodtempered enough for a companion she continued but i believe i have found something which i can do i have written several short stories for a womans magazine and they have made me a sort of offer to do some regular work for them what they offer would just keep me i want to accept  where should you live he asked  in london  alone  there is a girls club in chelsea somewhere i should go there at first and then try and share rooms with another girl  how much a week will they give you  twentyeight shillings and i shall be allowed to contribute regularly to the magazine at the usual rates i ought to make at least forty shillings a week  mr bullsom sighed  is this owing to any disagreement between you and the girls he asked sharply  certainly not she answered  you aint unhappy here is there anything we could do i dont want to lose you  mary was touched she had expected ridicule or opposition this was more difficult  of course i am not unhappy she answered you and aunt have been both of you most generous and kind to me but i do feel that a busy lifeand im not a bit domestic you know would be good for me i believe uncle if you were in my place you would feel just like me if you were able to i expect youd want to earn your own living  you shall go he said decidedly ill help you all i can you shall have a bit down to buy furniture if you want it or an allowance till you feel your way but mary im downright sorry no im not blaming you youve a right to go ii dont believe id live here if i were you  you are very good uncle mary said gratefully and you must remember it isnt as though i were leaving you alone you have the girls  mr bullsom nodded  yes he said i have the girls look here mary he added suddenly looking her in the face i want to have a word with you im going to talk plainly be honest with me  of course she murmured  its about the girls its a hard thing to say but somehowim a bit disappointed with them  she looked at him in something like amazement  yes disappointed he continued thats the word im an uneducated man myselfany fool can see thatbut i did all i could to have them girls different theyve been to the best school in medchester and theyve been abroad theyve had masters in most everything and ive had em taught riding and driving and all that sort of thing properly then as they grew up i built this ouse and came up to live here amongst the people whom i reckoned my girlsd be sure to get to know and the whole things a damned failure mary thats the long and short of it  perhapsa little later on mary began hesitatingly  dont interrupt me he said brusquely this is the first honest talk ive ever had about it and its doing me good the girlsd like to put it down to your mother and me but i dont believe it im ashamed to say it but im afraid its the girls themselves theres something not right about them but im blessed if i know what it is their mother and i are a bit vulgar i know but ive done my best to copy those who know how to behaveand i believe wed get through for what we are anywhere without giving offence but my girls oughtnt to be vulgar its education as does away with that and ive filled em chockfull of education from the time they were babies its run out of them mary like the sands through an hourglass they can speak correctly and i dare say they know all the small society tricks but that isnt everything they dont know how to dress they can spend just as much as they like and then you can come into the room in a black gown as you made yourself and you look a lady and they dont thats the long and short of it the only decent people who come to this house are your friends and they come to see you theres young brooks now ive no son mary and im fond of young men i never knew one i liked as i like him my daughters are old enough to be married and id give fifty thousand pounds to have him for a soninlaw and of course he wont look at em he sees it hell talk to you he takes no more notice of them than is civil they fuss round him and all that but they might save themselves the pains its hard lines mary im making money as no one knows on i could live at enton and afford it but whats the good of it if people dont care to know us here they wont anywhere mary how was it education didnt work with them girls your mother was my own sister and she married a gentleman he was a blackguard but hang it mary if i were you id sooner be penniless and as you are than be my daughters with five thousand apiece  there was an embarrassed silence then mary faced the situation boldly  uncle she said you are asking my advice is that it  if theres any advice you can give for gods sake lets have it but i dont know as you can make black white  selina and louise are good girls enough she said but they are a little spoilt and they are a little limited in their ideas a town like this often has that effect take them abroad uncle for a year or better still if you can find the right person get a companion for thema ladyand let her live in the house  thats sound he answered ill do it  and about their clothes uncle take them up to london go to one of the best places and leave the people to make their things dont let them interfere down here theyve got to choose for themselves they wouldnt care about taking advice here but in london theyd probably be content to leave it take them up to town for a fortnight stay at one of the best hotels the berkeley or the carlton and let them see plenty of nice people and dont be discouraged uncle  where the devil did you get your commonsense from he inquired fiercely your mother hadnt got it and ill swear your father hadnt  she laughed heartily  above all be firm with them uncle she said put your foot down and stick to it theyll obey you  obey me good lord ill make em mr bullsom declared vigorously mary youre a brick i feel quite cheerful and remember this my girl i shall make you an allowance but thats nothing come to me when you want a bit extra and if ever the young man turns up then ive got a word or two to say mind i shall only be giving you your own my wills signed and sealed  she kissed him fondly  youre a good sort uncle she said and now will you tell me what you think of this letter  read it to me dear he said my eyes arent what they were  she obeyed him  41 bucklesbury london e c  dear madam  we have received a communication from our agents at montreal asking us to ascertain the whereabouts of miss mary scott daughter of richard scott at one time a resident in that city  we believe that you are the young lady in question and if you will do us the favour of calling at the above address we may be able to give you some information much to your advantage  we are dear madam  yours respectfully  jones and lloyd  mr bullsom stroked his chin thoughtfully  sounds all right he remarked of course youll go but i always understood that your fathers relations were as poor as church mice  poorer uncle his fathermy grandfather that iswas a clergyman with barely enough to live on and his uncle was a roman catholic priest both of them have been dead for years  and your fatherwell i know there was nothing there mr bullsom remarked thoughtfully  you cabled out the money to bring me home mary reminded him  well well mr bullsom declared you must go and see these chaps theres no harm in that at any rate we must all have that trip to london i expect brooks will be wanting to go and see henslow well have to give that chap what for i know  selina sailed into the room in a salmoncoloured wrapper which should long ago have been relegated to the bathroom she pecked her father on the cheek and nodded to mary  dont you see mr brooks dear her father remarked with a twinkle in his eye and something very much like a wink to mary  selina screamed and looked fearfully around the room  what do you mean papa she exclaimed there is no one here  serve you right if there had been mr bullsom declared gruffly a pretty state to come down in the morning at past nine oclock  selina tossed her head  i am going to dress directly after breakfast she remarked  then if youll allow me to say so her father declared before breakfast is the time to dress and not afterwards youre always the same selina underdressed when you think theres no one around to see you and overdressed when there is  selina poured herself out some coffee and yawned  la papa what do you know about it she exclaimed  what my eyes tell me mr bullsom declared sternly youve no allowance to keep to youve leave to spend what you want and youre never fit to be seen theres mary there taking thirty pounds a year from me and wont have a penny more though shes heartily welcome to it and she looks a lady at any moment of the day  selina drew herself up and her eyes narrowed a little  youre talking about what you dont understand pa she answered with dignity if you prefer marys style of dressshe glanced with silent disparagement at her cousins grey skirt and plain white blousewell its a matter of taste isnt it  taste mr bullsom replied contemptuously taste what sort of taste do you call that beastly rug on your shoulders eh or your hair rolled round and just a pin stuck through it looks as though it hadnt been brushed for a week faugh when your mother and i lived on two pounds a week she never insulted me by coming down to breakfast in such a thing  selina eyed her father in angry astonishment  thing indeed she repeated this wrapper cost me four guineas and came from paris that shows how much you know about it  from paris did it mr bullsom retorted fiercely then upstairs you go and take it off you girls have had your own way too much and im about tired of it  i shall change itafter breakfast selina said doubtfully  mr bullsom threw open the door  upstairs he repeated and throw it into the ragbag  selina hesitated then she rose and with scarlet cheeks and a poor show of dignity left the room mr bullsom drew himself up and beamed upon mary  ill showem a bit he declared with great goodhumour i may be an ignorant old man but im going to wake these girls up  mary struggled for a moment but her sense of humour triumphed she burst out laughing  oh uncle uncle she exclaimed youre a wonderful man  he beamed upon her  you come shopping with us in london he said well have some fun    chapter xvii  fifteen years in hell  really lady caroom exclaimed enton is the cosiest large house i was ever in do throw that bradshaw away arranmore the one oclock train will do quite nicely  lord arranmore obeyed her literally he jerked the volume lightly into a far corner of the room and came over to her side she was curled up in a huge easychair and her face caught by the glow of the dancing firelight almost startled him by its youth there was not a single sign of middle age in the smooth cheeks not a single grey hair no sign of weariness in the soft full eyes raised to his  she caught his glance and smiled  the firelight is so becoming she murmured  dont go he said  my dear arranmore the redcliffes would never forgive me and we must go some time  i dont see the necessity he answered slowly you like enton make it your home  she raised her eyebrows  how improper not necessarily he answered take me too  she sat up in her chair and regarded him steadily  am i to regard this she asked as an offer of marriage  well it sounds like it he admitted  dear me you might have given me a little more notice she said let me think for a moment please  perhaps their thoughts travelled back in the same direction he remembered his cousin and his playfellow the fairest and daintiest girl he had ever seen his best friend his constant companion he remembered the days when she had first become something more to him the miseries of that time his hopeless ineligibilitythe separation then the years of absence the terrible branding years of his life the horrible pit the time when night and day his only prayer had been the prayer for death the selfrepression of years seemed to grow weaker and weaker he held out his hands but she hesitated  dear she said you make me very happy it is wonderful to think this may come after all these years but there is something which i wish to say to you first  well  you are very very dear to me nowas you arebut you are not the man i loved years ago you are a very different person indeed sometimes i am almost afraid of you  you have no cause to be he said indeed you have no cause to be so far as you are concerned i have never changed i am the same man  she took one of his hands in hers  philip she said you must not think hardly of me you must not think of me as simply afflicted with the usual womans curiosity i am not curious at all i would rather not know but remember that for nearly twenty years you passed out of my life you have come back again wonderfully altered you do not wish to keep the story of those years for ever a sort of bluebeards chamber in our lives  not i he answered i would have you do as i have done rip them out page and chapter annihilate them utterly what have they to do with the life before us to you they would seem evil enough to me they are thronged with horrible memories with memories which could i take them with me would poison heaven itself so let us blot them out for ever come to me catherine and help me to forget  she looked at him with strained eyes  philip she said i must understand you i must understand what has made you the man you are  fifteen years in hell has done it he answered fiercely not even my memory shall ever take me back  if i marry you she said remember that i marry your past as well as your future and there are thingswhich need explanation  well  you have been married  she is dead  you have a son  he reeled as though he had been struck and the silence between them was as the silence of tragedy  you see she continued i am bound to ask you to lift the curtain a little fate or instinct or whatever you may like to call it has led me a little way i am not afraid to know i have seen too much of life to be a hard judge but you must hold out your hand and take me a little further  i cannot  she held him tightly her voice trembled a little dear you must i am not an exacting woman and i love you too well to be a hard judge of anything you might have to tell me ignorance is the only thing which i cannot bear remember how greatly you are changed you are almost a stranger to me in some of your moods i could not have you wandering off into worlds of which i knew nothing sit down by my side and talk to me i will ask no questions you shall tell me your own way and what you wish to leave outleave it out come is this so hard a task  he seemed frozen into inanition his face was like the cast of a dead mans his voice was cold and hopeless  the key he said is gone i shall never seek for it i shall never find it i have known what madness is and i am afraid shall we go into the hall i fancy that they are serving tea  she looked at him half terrified half amazed  you mean this as final she said deliberately you refuse to offer any explanation the explanation which common decency even would require of these things  i expected too much he answered i know it very well forgive me and let us forget  she rose to her feet  i do not know that you will ever regret this she said i pray that you may  to brooks she seemed the same charming woman as usual as he heard her light laugh come floating across the hall and bowed over her white fingers but sybil saw the overbright eyes and nervous mouth and had hard work to keep back the tears she piled the cushions about a dark corner of the divan and chattered away recklessly  this is a night of sorrows she exclaimed pouring out the tea mr brooks and i were in the midst of a most affecting leavetakingwhen the tea came why do these mundane things always break in upon the most sacred moments  life lady caroom said helping herself recklessly to muffin is such a wonderful mixture of the real and the fanciful the actual and the sentimental one is always treading on the heels of the other the little man who turns the handle must have lots of fun  if only he has a sense of humour brooks interposed after all though it is the grisly ugly things which float to the top one has to probe always for the beautiful and it requires our rarest and most difficult sense to apprehend the humorous  lord arranmore stirred his tea slowly his face was like the face of a carved image only brooks seemed still unconscious of the shadow which was stalking amongst them  we talk of life so glibly he said it is a pity that we cannot realize its simplest elements life is purely subjective nothing exists except in our point of view so we are continually making and marring our own lives and the lives of other people by a word an action a thought  dear me lady caroom murmured however shall i be able to play bridge after tea if you all try to addle my brain by paradoxes and subtle sayings beforehand what does arranmore mean  he put down his cup  do not dare to understand me he said it is the most sincere unkindness when one talks only to answer and as for bridgeremember that this is a night of mourning bridge is far too frivolous a pursuit  bridge a frivolous pursuit sybil exclaimed heavens what sacrilege what ought we to do lord arranmore  sit in sackcloth and ashes and hear brooks lecture on the poor he answered lightly brooks is a mixture of the sentimentalist and the hideous pessimist you know and it is the privilege of his years to be sometimes in earnest i know nothing more depressing than to listen to a man who is in earnest  you are getting positively lightheaded sybil laughed i can see no pleasure in life save that which comes from an earnest pursuit of things good or evil  my dear child lord arranmore answered when you are a little older you will know that to take life seriously is a sheer impossibility you may think that you are doing it but you are not  there must be exceptions sybil declared  there are none lord arranmore answered lightly outside the madhouse for the realization of life comes only hand in hand with insanity the people who have come nearest to it carry the mark with them all their life for the fever of knowledge will scorch even those who peer over the sides of the cauldron  lady caroom helped herself to some more tea  really arranmore she drawled for sheer and unadulterated pessimism you are unsurpassed you must be a very morbid person  he shrugged his shoulders  one is always called morbid he remarked who dares to look towards the truth  there are people lady caroom answered who look always towards the clouds even when the sun is shining  i am in the minority lord arranmore said smiling i feel myself becoming isolated let us abandon the subject  no let us convert you instead sybil declared we want to look at the sun and we want to take you with us you are really a very stupid person you know why do you want to stay all alone amongst the shadows arranmore smiled faintly  the sun shines he said only for those who have eyes to see it  blindness is not incurable she answered  save when the light in the eyes is dead he answered come shall we play a game at fourhanded billiards  it resolved itself into a match between lady caroom and lord arranmore who were both players far above the average sybil and brooks talked but for once her attention wandered she seemed listening to the click of the billiardballs and watching the man and the woman between whom all conversation seemed dead brooks noticed her absorption and abandoned his own attempts to interest her  your mother and lord arranmore he remarked are very old friends  they have known one another all their lives she murmured lord arranmore has changed a good deal though since his younger days  brooks made no reply the girl suddenly bent her head towards him  are you a judge of character she asked  he shook his head  scarcely i have not had enough experience it is a fascinating study  very now i want to ask you something what do you think of lord arranmore  her tone betokened unusual seriousness his light answer died away on his lips  it is very hard for me to answer that question he said lord arranmore has been most unnecessarily kind to me  his character  i do not pretend to be able to understand it i think that he is often wilfully misleading he does not wish to be understood he delights in paradoxy and moral gymnastics  he may blind your judgment how do you personally feel towards him  that he answered might be misleading he has shown me so much kindness yet i thinki am surethat i liked him from the first moment i saw him  she nodded  i like him too i cannot help it yet one can be with him can live in the same house for weeks even months and remain an utter stranger to him he has selfrepression which is marvellousnever at faultnever a joint loose one wonders so much what lies beyond one would like to know  is it wise he asked after all is it our concern  not ours but if you were a woman would you be content to take him on trust  it would depend upon my own feelings he answered hesitatingly  whether you cared for him  yes  she beat the floor with her foot  you are wrong she said i am sure that you are wrong to care for one is to wish ever to believe the best of them it is better to keep apart for ever than to run any risks supposing that unknown past was of evil and one discovered it to care for him would only make the suffering keener  it may be so he admitted may i ask you something  well  you speakof yourself  her eyes met his and he looked hastily downwards  absurd she murmured and inclined her head towards the billiardtable they have beenattached to one another always come over here to the window and i will tell you something  they walked towards the great circular window which overlooked the drive as they stood there together a fourwheeled cab drove slowly by and a girl leaned forward and looked at them brooks started as he recognized her  why that must be some one for me he exclaimed in a puzzled tone whatever can have happened to old bullsom  she looked at him politely bewildered  it is the niece of a man whom i know very well in medchester he exclaimed something must have happened to her uncle it is most extraordinary    chapter xviii  mary scott pays an unexpected call  brooks met the butler entering the room with a card upon his salver he stretched out his hand for it mechanically but the man only regarded him in mild surprise for his lordship sir excuse me  the man passed on brooks remained bewildered lord arranmore took the card from the tray and examined it leisurely  miss mary scott he repeated aloud are you sure that the young lady asked to see me  quite sure your lordship the servant answered  scott the name sounds familiar somehow lord arranmore said havent i heard you mention it brooks  miss scott is the niece of mr bullsom one of my best clients a large builder in medchester brooks answered why  he stopped suddenly short arranmore glanced towards him in polite unconcern  you saw her with me at mellons in medchester you asked me her name  lord arranmore bent the card in his forefinger and dropped his eyeglass  so that is the young lady he remarked i remember her distinctly but i do not understand what she can want within me is she by any chance brooks one of those young persons who go about with a collectingcardwho want money for missions and that sort of thing if so i am afraid she has wasted her cab fare  she is not in the least that sort of person brooks answered emphatically i have no idea what she wants to see you about but i am convinced that her visit has a legitimate object  lord arranmore stuck the card in his waistcoat pocket and shrugged his shoulders  you are my man of affairs brooks i commission you to see her find out her business if you can and dont let me be bothered unless it is necessary  brooks hesitated  i am not sure that i care to interferethat my presence might not be likely to cause her embarrassment he said i have seen her lately and she made no mention of this visit  lord arranmore glanced at him as though surprised i should like you to see her he said suavely it seems to me preferable to asking her to state her business to a servant if you have any objection to doing so she must be sent back  brooks turned unwillingly away as he had expected mary sprang to her feet upon his entrance into the room and the colour streamed into her cheeks  you here she exclaimed  he shook hands with her and tried to behave as though he thought her presence the most natural thing in the world yes you see i am lord arranmores man of affairs now and he keeps me pretty hard at work he seems to have a constitutional objection to doing anything for himself he has even sent me toto  i understand she interrupted to ascertain my business well i cant tell it even to you it is lord arranmore whom i want to see no one else will do  brooks leaned against the table and looked at her with a puzzled smile  you see its a little awkward isnt it he declared lord arranmore is very eccentric and especially so upon this point he will not see strangers write him a line or two and let me take it to him  she considered for a moment  very well give me a piece of paper and an envelope  she wrote a single line only brooks took it back into the great inner hall where lord arranmore had started another game of billiards with lady caroom  miss scott assured me that her business with you is private he announced she has written this note  lord arranmore laid his cue deliberately aside and broke the seal it was evident that the contents of the note consisted of a few words only yet after once perusing them he moved a little closer to the light and reread them slowly then with a little sigh he folded the note in the smallest possible compass and thrust it into his waistcoat pocket  your young friend my dear brooks he said taking up his cue does me the honour to mistake me for some one else will you inform her that i have no knowledge of the person to whom she alludes and suggestas delicately as you choosethat as she is mistaken an interview is unnecessary it is i believe my turn catherine you decline then to see her brooks said  lord arranmore turned upon him with a rare irritation  have i not made myself clear brooks he said if i were to keep open house to all the young women who choose to claim acquaintance with me i should scarcely have a moment to call my own or a house fit to ask my friends to visit be so good as to make my answer sufficiently explicit  it is unnecessary lord arranmore i have come to ask you for it yourself  they all turned round mary scott was coming slowly towards them across the thick rugs into which her feet sunk noiselessly her face was very pale and her large eyes were full of nervous apprehension but about her mouth were certain rigid lines which spoke of determination  sybil leaned forward from her chair and lady caroom watched her approach with lifted eyebrows and a stare of wellbred and languid insolence lord arranmore laid down his cue and rose at once to meet her  you are lord arranmore she said looking at him fixedly will you please answer the questionin my note  he bowed a little coldly but he made no remark as to her intrusion i have already he said given my answer to mr brooks the name which you mention is altogether unknown to me nor have i ever visited the place you speak of you have apparently been misled by a chance likeness  it is a very wonderful one she said slowly keeping her eyes fixed upon him  he shrugged his shoulders  i regret he said that you should have had your journey for nothing i can i presume be of no further use to you  i do not regret my journey here she answered i could not rest until i had seen you closely face to face and asked you that question you deny then that you were ever called philip ferringshaw  most assuredly he answered curtly  that is very strange she said  strange  yes it is very strange because i am perfectly certain that you were  he took up his cue and commenced chalking it in a leisurely manner  my dear young lady he said you are i understand a friend of mr brooks and are therefore entitled to some amount of consideration from me but i must respectfully remind you that your presence here is to put it mildly unsought and that i do not find it pleasant to be called a liar under my own roof and before my friends  pleasant she eyed him scornfully nor did my father find it pleasant to be ruined and murdered by you a debauched gambler a common swindler  lord arranmore unruffled permitted himself to smile  dear me he said this is getting positively melodramatic brooks for her own sake let me beg of you to induce the young woman to leave us in her calmer moments she will i am sure repent of these unwarranted statements to a perfect stranger  brooks was numbedfor the moment speechless sybil had risen to her feet as though with the intention of leaving the room but lord arranmore interposed if he were acting it was marvellously done  i beg he said that you will none of you desert me these accusations ofmiss scott i believe are unnerving a murderer a swindler and a rogue are hard names young lady may i ask if your string of invectives is exhausted or is there any further abuse which you feel inclined to heap upon me  the girl never flinched  i have called you nothing she said which you do not deserve do you still deny that you were in canadain montrealsixteen years ago  most assuredly i do deny it he answered  brooks started and turned suddenly towards lord arranmore as though doubtful whether he had heard rightly this was a year before his fathers death the girl was unmoved  i see that i should come here with proofs she exclaimed well they are easy enough to collect you shall have them but before i go lord arranmore let me ask you if you know who i am  i understand lord arranmore answered that you are the daughter or niece of a highly respectable tradesman in medchester who is a client of our young friend here mr brooks let me tell you young lady that but for that fact i should nottolerate your presence here  i am mr bullsoms niece the girl answered but i am the daughter of martin scott cartnell  it seemed to brooks that a smothered exclamation of some sort broke from lord arranmores tightly compressed lips but his face was so completely in the shadow that its expression was lost but he himself now revealed it for touching a knob in the wall a shower of electric lamps suddenly glowed around the room he leaned forward and looked intently into the face of the girl who had become his accuser she met his gaze coldly without flinching the pallor of her cheeks relieved by a single spot of burning colour her eyes bright with purpose  it is incredible he said softly but it is true you are the untidy little thing with a pigtail who used always to be playing games with the boys when you ought to have been at school come i am glad to see you why do you come to me like a cassandra of the family herald your father was my companion for a while but we were never intimate i certainly neither robbed nor murdered him  you did both she answered fiercely you were his evil genius from the first it was through you he took to drink through you he became a gambler you encouraged him to play for stakes larger than he could afford you won money from him which you knew was not his to lose he came to you for help you laughed at him that night he shot himself  it was lord arranmore remarked a very foolish thing to do  who or what you were before you came to montreal i do not know she continued but there you brought misery and ruin upon every one connected with you i was a child in those days but i remember how you were hated you broke the heart of durran lapage an honest man whom you called your friend and you left his wife to starve in a common lodging house there was never a man or woman who showed you kindness that did not live to regret it you may be the marquis of arranmore now but you have left a life behind the memory of which should be a constant torture to you  have you finished young lady he asked coldly  yes i have finished she answered i pray heaven that the next time we meet may be in the policecourt the police of montreal are still looking for philip ferringshaw and they will find in me a very ready witness  upon my word this is a most unpleasant young person lord arranmore said brooks do see her off the premises before she changes her mind and comes for me again you have i hope been entertained ladies he added turning to sybil and lady caroom  he eyed them carelessly enough to all appearance yet with an inward searchingness which seemed to find what it feared he turned to brooks but he and mary scott had left the room together  the girlwas terribly in earnest lady caroom said with averted eyes were you nota little cruel to her arranmore not that i believe these horrid things of course but she did she was honest  lord arranmore shrugged his shoulders he was looking out of the window out into the grey windy darkness listening to the raindrops splashing against the windowpane wondering how long brooks would be and if in his face too he should see the shadow and it seemed to him that brooks lingered a very long time  shall we finish our game of billiards catherine he asked turning towards her  welli think not she answered i am a little tired and it is almost time the dressing bell rang i think sybil and i will go upstairs  they passed awayhe made no effort to detain them he lit a cigarette and paced the room impatiently at last he rang the bell  where is mr brooks he asked  mr brooks has only just returned my lord the man answered he went some distance with the young lady he has gone direct to his room  lord arranmore nodded he threw himself into his easychair and his head sank upon his hand he looked steadfastly into the heart of the red coals    chapter xix  the marquis mephistopheles  i am so sorry she said softly our last evening is spoilt  he shook his head with an effort at gaiety  let us conspire he said you and i at least will make a struggle  i am afraid she said that it would be hopeless mother is an absolute wreck and i saw lord arranmore go into the library just now with that terrible white look under his eyes i saw it once before ugh  after all he said it only means that we shall be honest cheerfulness tonight could only be forced  she laughed softly into his eyes  how correct she murmured you are improving fast  he turned and looked at her slim and graceful in her white muslin gown her fair hair brushed back from her forehead with a slight wave but drooping low over her ears a delicate setting for her piquant face the dark brown eyes narrowing a little towards the lids met his with frank kindliness her mouth quivered a little as though with the desire to break away into a laugh the slight duskiness of her cheeksshe had lived for three years in italy and never worn a veilpleased him better than the insipidity of pink and white and the absence of jewelryshe wore neither bracelet nor rings gave her an added touch of distinction which restless youth finds something so much harder to wear than sedate middle age the admiration grew in his eyes she was charming  the lips broke away at last  after all she murmured i think that i shall enjoy myself this evening you are looking all sorts of nice things at me  my eyes he answered are more daring than my lips  and you call yourself a lawyer  is that a challenge well i was thinking that you looked charming  is that all i have a lookingglass you know  and i shall miss youvery much  she suddenly avoided his eyes but it was for a second only yet brooks was himself conscious of the significance of that second he set his teeth hard  the days here he said slowly have been very pleasant it has all beensuch a different life for me a few months ago i knew no one except a few of the medchester people and was working hard to make a modest living sometimes i feel here as though i were a modern aladdin there is a sense of unreality about lord arranmores extraordinary kindness to me tonight more than ever i cannot help feeling that it is something like a dream which may pass away at any moment  she looked at him thoughtfully  lord arranmore is not an impulsive person she said he must have had some reason for being so decent to you  yes as regards the management of his affairs perhaps brooks answered but why he should ask me here and treat me as though i were his social equal and all that sort of thingwell you know that is a puzzle isnt it  well i dont know she answered lord arranmore is not exactly the man to be a slave to or even to respect the conventional and your beingwhat you are naturally makes you a pleasant companion to himand his guests no i dont think that it is strange  you are very flattering he said smiling  not in the least she assured him nowadays birth seems to be rather a handicap than otherwise to the making of the right sort of people i am sure there are more impossibilities in the peerage than in the nouveaux riches i know heaps of people who because their names are in debrett seem to think that manners are unnecessary and that they have a sort of godsent title to gentility  brooks laughed  why he said you are more than half a radical  it is your influence she said demurely  it will soon pass away he sighed tomorrow you will be back again amongst your friends  she sighed  why do ones friends bore one so much more than other peoples she exclaimed  when one thinks of it he remarked you must have been very bored here why for the last fortnight there have been no other visitors in the house  there have been compensations she said  tell me about them he begged  she laughed up at him  if i were to say the occasional visits of mr kingston brooks would you be conceited  it would be like putting my vanity in a hothouse he answered but i would try and bear it  well i will say it then  he turned and looked at her with a sudden seriousness some consciousness of the change in his mood seemed to be at once communicated to her her eyes no longer met his she moved a little on one side and took up an ornament from an ormolu table  i wish that you meant it he murmured  i do she whispered almost under her breath  brooks suddenly forgot many things but nemesis intervened there was the sound of much rustling of silken skirts andlady carooms poodle followed by herself came round the angle of the drawingroom  my dear sybil she exclaimed do come and tie balfours ribbon for me marie has no idea of making a bow spread itself out and pink is so becoming to him thanks dear where is our host i thought that i was late  lord arranmore entered as she spoke his evening dress as usual was of the most severely simple type tonight its sombreness was impressive with such a background his pallor seemed almost waxenlike he offered his arm to lady caroom  i was not sure he said with a lightness which seemed natural enough whether tonight i might not have to dine alone whilst you poor people sat and played havoc with the shreds of my reputation groves the cabinet johannesburg and the 84 heidsieckthough i am afraid he added looking down at his companion that not all the wine in my cellar could make this feast of farewells a cheerful one  farewell celebrations of all sorts are such a mistake lady caroom murmured we have been so happy here too  you brought the happiness with you lord arranmore said and you take it away with you enton will be a very dull place when you are gone  your own stay here is nearly up is it not lady caroom asked very nearly i expect to go to paris next weekat latest the week after in time at any rate for bernhardts new play so i suppose we shall soon all be scattered over the face of the earth  except me brooks interposed ruefully i shall be the one who will do the vegetating  lady caroom laughed softly  foolish person you will be within two hours of london you none of you have the slightest idea as to the sort of place we are going to we are a days journey from anywhere the morning papers are twentyfour hours late the men drink port wine and the women sit round the fire in the drawingroom after dinner and waitand waitand wait oh that awful waiting i know it so well and it isnt much better when the men do come they play whist instead of bridge and a woman in the billiardroom is a lost soul our hostess always hides my cue directly i arrive and pretends that it has been lost by the bye what a dear little room this is arranmore we havent dined here before have we  lord arranmore shook his head he held up his wineglass thoughtfully as though criticizing the clearness of the amber fluid  no he said i ordered dinner to be served in here because over our dessert i propose to offer you a novel form of entertainment  how wonderful sybil said will it be very engrossing will it help us to forget  he looked at her with a smile  that depends he said how anxious you are to forget  she looked hastily away for a moment brooks met her eyes and his heart gave an unusual leap lady caroom watched them both thoughtfully and then turned to their host  you have excited our curiosity arranmore you surely dont propose to keep us on tenterhooks all through dinner  it will give a fillip to your appetite  my appetite needs no fillip it is disgraceful to try and make me eat more than i do already i am getting hideously stout i found my maid in tears tonight because i positively could not get into my most becoming bodice  if you possess a more becoming one than this lord arranmore said with a bow it is well for our peace of mind that you cannot wear it  that is a very pretty subterfuge but a subterfuge it remains lady caroom answered now be candid i love candour what are you going to do to amuse us  he shook his head  do not spoil my effect the slightest hint would make everything seem tame brooks i insist upon it that you try my johannesburg it was given to my grandfather by the grand duke of shleistein groves  brooks submitted willingly enough for the wine was wonderful sybil leaned over so that their heads almost touched  look at our host she whispered what does he remind you of  brooks glanced across the table brilliant with its burden of old silver of cutglass and hothouse flowers lord arranmores face notwithstanding his ready flow of conversation seemed unusually still and whitethe skin drawn across the bones even the lips pallid the sombreness of his costume the glitter in his eyes the icy coldness of his lack of coloring though time after time he set down his wineglass empty were curiously impressive brooks looked back into her face his eyes full of question  mephistopheles she whispered he is absolutely weird tonight if he sat and looked at me and we were alone i should shriek  lord arranmore lifted a glass of champagne to the level of his head and looked thoughtfully around the table  come he said a toastto ourselves singly collectively lady caroom i drink to the delightful memories with which you have peopled enton sybil may you charm society as your mother has done brooks your very good health may your entertainment this evening be a welcome one  we will drink to all those things lady caroom declared with enthusiasm but i am afraid your good wishes for sybil are beyond any hope of realization she is far too honest to flourish in society she will probably marry a bishop or a cabinet minister and become engrossed in theology or politics you know how limiting that sort of thing is i am in deadly fear that she may become humdrum a woman who really studies or knows anything about anything can never be a really brilliant woman  you  oh i pass for being intelligent because i parade my ignorance so just as sophie mills is considered a paragon of morality because she is always talking about running off with one of the boys in her husbands regiment it is a gigantic bluff you know but it comes off most bluffs do come off if one is only daring enough  you must tell them that up at redcliffe lord arranmore remarked  sybil laughed heartily  redcliffe is the one place where mother is dumb she declared up there they look upon her as a stupid but wellmeaning person she is absolutely afraid to open her mouth  they are so absurdly literal lady caroom sighed helping herself to an infinitesimal portion of a wonderful savoury dont talk about the place i know i shall have an attack of nerves there  mother always gets nerves if she maynt talk sybil murmured  youre an undutiful daughter lady caroom declared if i do talk i never say anything so nobody need listen unless they like about this entertainment arranmore are you going to make the wineglass disappear and the apples fly about the room a la maskelyne and cook i hope our share in it consists in sitting down  arranmore turned to the butler behind his chair  have coffee and liqueur served here groves and bring some cigarettes then you can send the servants away and leave us alone  the man bowed  very good your lordship  lord arranmore looked around at his guests  the entertainment he said will incur no greater hardship upon you than a little patience i am going to tell you a story    chapter xx  the confidence of lord arranmore  the servants had left the room and the doors were fast closed lord arranmore sat a little forward in his highbacked chair one hand grasping the arm the other stretched flat upon the table before him by his side neglected was a cedarwood box of his favourite cigarettes  i am going he said thoughtfully to tell you a story of whom the hero ismyself a poor sort of entertainment perhaps but then there is a little tragedy and a little comedy in what i have to tell and you three are the three people in the world to whom certain things were better told  they bent forward fascinated by the cold directness of his speech by the suggestion of strange things to come the mask of their late gaiety had fallen away lady caroom grave and sadeyed was listening with an anxiety wholly unconcealed under the shaded lamplight their faces dominated by that cold masterly figure at the head of the table were almost rembrandtesque  you have heard a string of incoherent but sufficiently damaging accusations made against me today by a young lady whose very existence i may say was a surprise to me it suited me then to deny them nevertheless they were in the main true  the announcement was no shock every one of the three curiously enough had believed the girl  i must go a little further back than the time of which she spoke at twentysix years old i was an idle young man of good family but scant expectations supposed to be studying at the bar but in reality idling my time about town in those days lady caroom you had some knowledge of me  up to the time of your disappearanceyes i remember arranmore she continued her manner losing for a moment some of its restraint and her eyes and tone suddenly softening dancing with you that evening we arranged to meet at ranelagh the next day and when the next day came you had vanished gone as completely as though the earth had swallowed you up for weeks every one was asking what has become of him and theni suppose you were forgotten  this lord arranmore continued is the hardest part of my narrative the hardest because the most difficult to make you understand you will forgive my offering you the bare facts only i will remind you that i was young impressionable and had views so to continue  the manner of his speech was in its way chillingly impressive he was still sitting in exactly the same position one hand upon the arm of his highbacked chair the other upon the table before him he made use of no gestures his face remained as white and emotionless as a carved image his tone though clear and low was absolutely monotonous but there was about him a subtle sense of repression apparent to all of them  on my way home that night my hansom knocked down an old man he was not seriously hurt and i drove him home on the way he stared at me curiously every now and then he laughedunpleasantly  i have never seen any one out of your world before he said i dare say you have never spoken to any one out of mine except to toss us alms come and see where i live  he insisted and i went i found myself in a lodginghouse now pulled down and replaced by one of lord rowtons tenement houses i saw a hundred human beings more or less huddled together promiscuously and the face of every one of them was like the face of a rat the old man dragged me from room to room laughing all the time he showed me children herded together without distinction of sex or clothing here and there he pointed to a face where some apprehension of the light was fighting a losing battle with the ghouls of disease of vice of foul air of filth i was faint and giddy when we had looked over that one house but the old man was not satisfied he dragged me on to the roof and pointed eastwards there as far as the eyes could reach was a blackened wilderness of smokebegrimed dwellings he looked at me and grinned i can see him now he had only one tooth a blackened yellow stump and every time he opened his mouth to laugh he was nearly choked with coughing he leaned out over the palisading and reached with both his arms eastward there he cried frantically you have seen one there are thousands and tens of thousands of houses like this a million crawling vermin who were born into the world in your likeness as you were born my fine gentleman day by day they wake in their holes fill their lungs with foul air their stomachs with rotten food break their backs and their hearts over some hideous task every day they drop a little lower down drink alone keeps them alive stirs their blood now and then so that they can feel their pulses beat brings them a blessed stupor and see over there the sun gods sun rises every morning over them and you young man you see those flaming spots of light they are ginpalaces you may thank your god for them for they alone keep this horde of rotten humanity from sweeping westwards breaking up your fine houses emptying your wine into the street tearing the silk and laces from your beautiful softlimbed women bah but you have read it would be the french revolution over again oh but you are wise you in the west your statesmen and your philanthropists that you build these ginpalaces and smile and rub your hands and build more and spend the money gaily you build the one dam which can keep back your retribution you keep them stupefied you cheapen the vile liquor and hold it to their noses so they drink and you live but a day of light may come  lord arranmore ceased speaking stretched out his hand and helped himself to wine with unfaltering fingers  i have tried he continued to repeat the exact words which the old man used to me and i do not find it so difficult as you might imagine because at that time they made a great impression upon me but i cannot of course hope to reproduce to you his terrible earnestness the burning passion with which every word seemed to spring from his lips their effect upon me at that time you will be able to judge when i tell you thisthat i never returned to my rooms that for ten years i never set foot west of temple bar i first joined a small society in whitechapel then i worked for myself and finally i became a policecourt missionary at southwark policecourt the history of those years is the history of a slowlygrowing madness i commenced by trying to improve whole districtsi ended with the individual  brooks wineglass fell with a little crash upon the tablecloth the wine a long silky stream flowed away from him unstaunched unregarded his eyes were fixed upon lord arranmore he leaned forward  a policecourt missionary he cried hoarsely  lord arranmore regarded him for a moment in silence  yes as you doubtless surmise i am your father afterwards you may ask me questions  brooks sat as one stupefied and then a sudden warm touch upon his hand sent the blood coursing once more through his veins sybils fingers lay for a moment upon his she smiled kindly at him lord arranmores voice once more broke the short silence  the individual was my greatest disappointment he continued young and old all were the same i took them to live with me i sent them abroad i found them situations in this country i talked with them read with them showed them the simplest means within their reach by means of which they might take into their lives a certain measure of beautiful things failure would only make me more dogged more eager i would spend months sometimes with one man or boy and at last i would assure myself of success i would find them a situation see them perhaps once a week then less often and the end was always the same they fell back i had put the poison to sleep but it was always there it was their everlasting heritage a gift from father to son bred in the bone a part of their blood  in those days i married a lady devoted to charitable works our purpose was to work together but we found it impracticable there was i fear little sympathy between us the only bond was our workand that was soon to be broken for there came a time after ten breathless years when i paused to consider  he raised his glass to his lips and drained it the wine was powerful but it brought no tinge of colour to his cheeks nor any lustre to his eyes he continued in the same firm expressionless tone  there came a night when i found myself thinking and i knew then that a new terror was stealing into my life i made my way up to the roof of the house where that old man had first taken me and i leaned once more over the palisading and looked eastwards i fancied that i could still hear the echoes of his frenzied words and for the first time i heard the note of mockery ringing clearly through them there they stretchedthe same blackened wilderness of roofs sheltering the same horde of drinking filthy cursing parasitical creatures there flared the ginpalaces more of them more brilliantly lit more gorgeously decorated ten years of my life and what had i done what could any one do the truth seemed suddenly written across the sky in letters of fire i a poor human creature had been fighting with a few other fanatics against the inviolable the unconquerable laws of nature the hideous mistake of all individual effort was suddenly revealed to me we were like a handful of children striving to dam a mighty torrent with a few handfuls of clay better a thousand times that these people rottedand died in their holes that disease should stalk through their streets and all the evil passions born of their misery and filth should be allowed to blaze forth that the whole world might see so the laws of the world might intervene the great natural laws by which alone these things could be changed i looked down at myself then wasted to the bone a stranger to the taste of wine or tobacco to all the joys of life a miserable heartbroken wretch and i cursed that old man and the thought of him till my lips were dry and my throat ached i walked back to my miserable dwelling with a red fire before my eyes muttering cursing that power which stood behind the universe and which we call god that there should be vomited forth into the world day by day hour by hour this black stream of human wretchedness an everlasting mockery to those who would seek for the joy of life  they took me to the hospital and they called my illness brainfever but long before they thought me convalescent i was conscious lying awake and plotting my escape with cunning i managed it of my wife and child i never once thought every trace of human affection seemed withered up in my heart i took the money subscribed for me with a hypocrites smile and i slunk away from england i went to montreal in canada and i deliberately entered upon a life of low pleasures pardon me  he bent forward and with a steady hand readjusted the shade of a lamp which was in danger of burning lady caroom leaned back in her chair with an indrawn sobbing breath the action at such a moment seemed grotesque his own coolness whilst with steady fingers he probed away amongst the wounded places of his life was in itself gruesome  my money he continued was no large sum but i eked it out with gambling the luck was always on my side its quite true that i ruined the father of the young lady who paid me a visit today after a somewhat chequered career he was settling down in a merchants office in montreal when i met him his luck at cards was as bad as mine was good i won all he had and more i believe that he committed suicide a man there was kind to me asked me to his housei persuaded his wife to run away with me these are amongst the slightest of my delinquencies i steeped myself in sin i revelled in it i seemed to myself in some way to be showing my defiance for the hidden powers of life which i had cursed i played a match with evil by day and by night until i was glutted and then i stole away from the city leaving behind a hideous reputation and not a single friend then a new mood came to me i wanted to get to a place where i should see no human beings at all and escape in that way from the memories which were still like a clot upon my brain so i set my face westwards i travelled till at last civilization lay behind still i pushed onward i had stores in plenty an indian servant who chanced to be faithful and whom i saw but twice a day at last i reached lake ono here between us we built a hut i sent my indian away then and when he fawned at my feet to stay i kicked him this was my third phase of living and it was true that some measure of sanity came back to me oh the blessed relief of seeing the face of neither man nor woman it was the unpeopled world of natureuncorrupted fresh magnificent alive by day and by night with everlasting music of nature the solitudes of those great forests were like a wonderful balm so the fevers were purged out of me and i became once more an ordinary human being i was content i think to die there for i had plenty to eat and drink and the animals and birds who came to me morning and evening kept me from even the thought of loneliness the rest is obvious i lost two cousins in south africa an uncle in the huntingfield a man in montreal had recognized me i was discovered but before i returned i killed brooks the policecourt missionary this girl has forced me to bring him to life again  it was a strange silence which followed brooks sat back in his chair pale bewildered striving to focus this story properly to attain a proper comprehension of these new strange things and behind all there smouldered the slow burning anger of the child who has looked into the face of a deserted mother lady caroom was white to the lips and in her eyes the horror of that story so pitilessly told seemed still to linger  lord arranmore spoke again still he sat back in his highbacked chair and still he spoke in measured monotonous tones but this time if only their ears had been quick enough to notice it there lay behind an emotion held in check indeed but every now and then quivering for expression he had turned to lady caroom  chance he said has brought together here at the moment when the telling of these things has become a necessity the two people who have in a sense some right to hear them for from each i have much to ask sybil is your daughter and from her there need be no secrets so catherine i ask you again now that you know everything are you brave enough to be my wife  she raised her eyes and he saw the horror there but he made no sign she rose and held out her hand for sybil  arranmore she said i am afraid  he looked down upon his plate  so let it be then he said it would need a brave woman indeed to join her lot with mine after the things which i have told you at heart catherine i am almost a dead man believe me you are wise  he rose and the two women passed from the room then he resumed his former seat and attitude and brooks though he tried to speak felt his tongue cleave to the roof of his mouth a dry and nerveless thing  for in these doings there was tragedy  there remains to me you philip kingston my son lord arranmore said in the same measured tone you also have before you the story of my life you are able from it to form some sort of idea as to what my future is likely to be i do not wish to deceive you my early enthusiasms are extinct i look upon the ten or twenty years or so which may be left to me of life as merely a space of time to be filled with as many amusements and new sensations as may be procurable without undue effort i have no wish to convert or perhaps pervert you to my way of thinking you live still in utopia and to me utopia does not exist so make your choice deliberately do you care to come to me  then brooks found words of a sort  lord arranmore he said forgive me if what i must say sounds undutiful i know that you have suffered i can realize something of what you have been through but your desertion of my mother and me was a brutality what you call your creed of life sounds to me hideous you and i are far apart and so far as i am concerned god grant that we may remain so  for the first time lord arranmore smiled he poured out with steady hand yet another glass of wine and he nodded towards the door  i am obliged to you he said for your candour i have met with enough hypocrisy in life to be able to appreciate it be so good as to humour my whimand to leave me alone  brooks rose from his seat hesitated for a single moment and left the room lord arranmore leaned back in his highbacked chair and looked round at the empty places the cigarette burned out between his fingers his wine remained untasted the evenings entertainment was over     part ii  chapter i  lord arranmores amusements  the domestic virtues lord arranmore said softly to himself being denied to me the question remains how to pass ones time  he rose wearily from his seat and walking to the window looked out upon st jamess square a soft rain hung about the lampposts the pavements were thick with umbrellas he returned to his chair with a shrug of the shoulders  the only elucidation from outside seems to be a change of climate he mused i should prefer to think of something more original in the meantime i will write to that misguided young man in medchester  he drew paper and pen towards him and began to write even his handwriting seemed a part of the mancold shapely and deliberate  my dear brooks  i have been made acquainted through mr ascough with your desire to leave the new firm of morrison and brooks and while i congratulate you very much upon the fact itself i regret equally the course of reasoning which i presume led to your decision you will probably have heard from mr ascough by this time on a matter of business you are by birth lord kingston of ross and the possessor of the kingston income which amounts to a little over two thousand a year please remember that this comes to you not through any grace or favour of mine but by your own unalienable right as the eldest son of the marquis of arranmore i cannot give it to you i cannot withhold it from you if you refuse to take it the amount must accumulate for your heirs or in due time find its way to the crown leave the tithe alone by all means if you like but do not carry quixotism to the borders of insanity by declining to spend your own money and thereby cramp your life  i trust to hear from mr ascough of your more reasonable frame of mind and while personally i agree with you that we are better apart you can always rely upon me if i can be of any service to you  yours sincerely  arranmore  he read the letter through thoughtfully and folded it up  i really dont see what the young fool can kick about in that he said throwing it into the basket well hennibul how are you  mr hennibul duly ushered in by a sedate butler pronounced himself both in words and appearance fit and well he took a chair and a cigarette and looked about him approvingly  nice house yours arranmore nice oldfashioned situation too why dont you entertain  no friends no inclination no womankind  mr hennibul smiled incredulously  your card plate is chockfull he said and there are a dozen women in town at least of your connections whod do the polite things by you as to inclinationwell one must do something  thats about the most sensible thing you have said hennibul arranmore remarked ive just evoked the same fact out of my own consciousness one must do something its tiresome but its quite true politics  hate em not worth while anyway  travel  done all i want for a bit but i keep that in reserve  hunt  bad leg but i do a bit at it  society  sooner go on the county council  city  too much money already  write a book no one would read it  start a magazine  too hard work  mr hennibul sighed  youre rather a difficult case he admitted youd better come round to the club and play bridge  i never played whistand im badtempered  bit of everything then  lord arranmore smiled  thats what itll end in i suppose  pleasant times we had down at enton mr hennibul remarked hows the nice young lawyerbrooks his name was i think  all right i believe  and the ladies  i believe that they are quite well they were in scotland last time i heard of them  mr hennibul found conversation difficult  i saw that you were in paris the other week he remarked  i went over to see bernhardts new play arranmore continued  good  it disappointed me very likely though the fault was with myself  mr hennibul looked across at his host shrewdly  what did you see me for he asked suddenly youre bored to death trying to keep up a conversation  lord arranmore laughed  upon my word i dont know hennibul he answered for the same old reason i suppose one must see some one do something i thought that you might amuse me  and ive failed hennibul declared smiling come to supper at the savoy tonight the two new american girls from the lyric and st john lyttleton are to be there moderately respectable i believe but a bit noisy perhaps  arranmore shook his head  youre a good fellow hennibul he said but im too old for that sort of thing  hennibul rose to his feet  well he said ive kept the best piece of advice till last because i want you to think of it marry  lord arranmore did not smile he did not immediately reply  you are a bachelor he remarked  i am a man of a different disposition hennibul answered i find pleasure in everythingeverything amuses me my work is fascinating my playtime is never big enough i really dont know where a wife would come in however if ever i did get a bit hipped find myself in your position for instance i can promise you that id take my own medicine ive thought of it more than once lately  perhaps by that time lord arranmore said the woman whom you wanted to marry wouldnt have you  hennibul looked serious for a moment a new idea had occurred to him  one must take ones chances he said  you are a philosopher arranmore declared will you have some teaor a whiskyandsoda  neither thanks in an abortive attempt to preserve my youth i neither take tea nor drinks between meals i will have one of your excellent cigarettes and get round to the club why this is enton over again for here comes molyneux  the hon sydney molyneux shook hands with both of them in somewhat dreary fashion and embarked upon a few disjointed remarks hennibul took his leave and arranmore yawned openly  what is the matter with you sydney he asked you are duller than ever i am positively not going to sit here and mumble about the weather how are the carooms have you heard from them lately  they are up in yorkshire molyneux announced staying with the prycepowells i believe theyre all right im beastly fit myself but i had a bit of a facer last week ieri wanted to ask you a question  well  about that fellow brooks i met at your place down at enton lawyer at medchester isnt he i thought that he and sybil seemed a bit thick somehow dont suppose there could have been anything in it eh hes no one in particular i suppose lady caroom wouldnt be likely to listen to anything between sybil and him  arranmore raised his eyebrows  brooks is a very intelligent young man he said and some girls are attracted by brains you know i dont know anything about his relations with sybil caroom but he has ample private means and i believe that he is wellborn  fellows a gentleman of course molyneux declared but lady caroom is a little ambitious isnt she i always seemed to be in the running all right lately i spent last sunday with them at chelsom castle awful long way to go but im fond of sybil i thought she was a bit cool to me but like a fool i blundered on and in the endi got a facer  very sorry for you arranmore yawned  what made me think about brooks was that she was awfully decent to me before enton molyneux continued i dont mind telling you that im hard hit i want to know who brooks is if hes only a country lawyer hes got no earthly chance with lady caroom and sybild never go against her mother theyre too great pals for that never saw them so thick  was lady caroomquite well arranmore asked irrelevantly  well now you mention it molyneux said i dont think she was quite in her usual form she was much quieter and it struck me that she was aging a bit wonderful woman though she and sybil were quite inseparable at chelsommore like sisters than anything pon my word  lord arranmore looked into the fire and was silent for several minutes  so far as regards brooks he said i do not think that he would be an acceptable soninlaw to lady caroom but i am not in the least sure he is by no means an insignificant person if he were really anxious to marry sybil caroom he would be a rival worth consideration i cannot tell you anything more  much obliged to you im sure i shall try again when they come to town of course  arranmore rose up  i am going down to christies to see some old french manuscripts he said is that on your way  molyneux shook his head  going down to the house thanks he answered ill look you up again some time if i may  they walked out into the street together arranmore stepped into his brougham and was driven off at the top of st jamess street he pulled the checkstring and jumped out he had caught a glimpse of a girls face looking into a shop window he hastily crossed the pavement and accosted her hat in hand  miss scott will you permit me the opportunity of saying a few words to you  mary turned round speechless for more than a minute or two  i will not detain you for more than a minute or two i hope that you will not refuse me  i will listen to anything you have to say lord arranmore she said but let me tell you that i have been to see mr ascough he told me that he had your permission to explain to me fully the reasons of your coming to montreal and the story of your life before  well  she hesitated he stood before her palpably anxiously waiting for her decision  i was perhaps wrong to judge so hastily lord arranmore she said and i am inclined to regret my visit to enton if you care to know it i do not harbour any animosity towards you but i cannot possibly accept this sum of money i told mr ascough so finally  it is only justice miss scott he said in a low tone i won the money from your father fairly in one sense but unfairly in another for i was a good player and he was a very poor one you will do me a great an immeasurable kindness if you will allow me to make this restitution  she shook her head  if my forgiveness is of any value to you lord arranmore she said you may have it but i cannot accept the money  you have consulted no one  no one  you have a guardian or friends  i have been living with my uncle mr bullsom he has been very kind to me and i have  mary  they both turned round selina and mr bullsom had issued from the shop before which they stood both were looking at lord arranmore with curiosity in selinas case mixed with suspicion  is this your uncle he asked will you introduce me  mary bit her lip  uncle this is lord arranmore she said mr bullsom my cousin miss bullsom  mr bullsom retained presence of mind enough to remove a new and very shiny silk hat and to extend a yellow dogskinned gloved hand  very proud to meet your lordship he declared ii wasnt aware  lord arranmore extricated his hand from a somewhat close grasp and bowed to selina  we are neighbours you know mr bullsom he said at medchester i met your niece there and recognized her at once though she was a little slip of a girl when i knew her last her father and i were in montreal together  god bless my soul mr bullsom exclaimed in much excitement its your lawyers then who have been advertising for mary  lord arranmore bowed  that is so he admitted i am sorry to say that i cannot induce your niece to look upon a certain transaction between her father and myself from a businesslike point of view i think that you and i mr bullsom might come to a better understanding will you give me an appointment i should like to discuss the matter with you  with the utmost pleasure my lord mr bullsom declared heartily cant expect these young ladies to see through a business matter eh i will come to your lordships house whenever you like  it would be quite useless uncle mary interposed firmly lord arranmore has already my final answer  mr bullsom was a little excited  tut tut child he exclaimed dont talk nonsense i should be proud to talk this matter over with lord arranmore we are staying at the metropole and if your lordship would call there tomorrow and take a bit of lunch eh about one oclockif it isnt too great a liberty  selina had never loved her father more sincerely lord arranmore smiled faintly but goodhumoredly  you are exceedingly kind he said for our business talk perhaps it would be better if you would come to st jamess house at say 1030 if that is convenient i will send a carriage  ill be ready prompt mr bullsom declared now girls we will say goodafternoon to his lordship and get a fourwheeler  selina raised her eyes and dropped them again in the most approved fashion mr bullsom shook hands as though it were a sacrament mary who was annoyed did not smile at all  this is all quite unnecessary lord arranmore she said while her uncle was signalling for a cab i shall not change my mind and i am sorry that you spoke to uncle about it at all  it is a serious matter to me miss scott lord arranmore said gravely and there is still another point of view from which i might urge it  it is wasted time she declared firmly  selina detached herself from her father and stood by lord arranmores side  i suppose you are often in london lord arranmore she asked shyly  a great deal too often he answered  we read about your beautiful parties at enton she said with a sigh it is such a lovely place  i am glad you like it he answered absently i see your uncle cannot find a fourwheeler you must take my carriage i am only going a few steps  marys eager protest was drowned in selinas shrill torrent of thanks lord arranmore beckoned to his coachman and the brougham with its pair of strong horses drew up against the pavement the footman threw open the door selina entered in a fever for fear a cab which her father was signalling should after all respond to his summons mr bullsom found his breath taken away  we couldnt possibly take your lordships carriage he protested  i have only a few steps to go mr bullsom and it would be a kindness for my horses are never more than half exercised at 1030 tomorrow then  he stood bareheaded upon the pavement for a moment and selinas eyes and smile had never worked harder mary leaned back too angry to speak selina and mr bullsom sat well forward and pulled both windows down    chapter ii  the heckling of henslow  the long and short of it is then mr henslow that you decline to fulfil your pledges given at the last election brooks asked coldly  nothing of the sort mr henslow declared testily you have no right to suggest anything of the sort  no right  certainly not you are my agent and you ought to work with me instead  i have already told you brooks interrupted that i am nothing of the sort i should not dream of acting for you again and if you think a formal resignation necessary i will post you one tomorrow i am one of your constituents nothing more or less but as i am in some measure responsible for your presence here i consider myself within my rights in asking you these questions  im not going to be hectored mr henslow declared  nobody wants to hector you you gave certain pledges to us and you have not fulfilled one of them  they wont let me im not here as an independent member im here as a liberal and sir henry himself struck out my proposed question and motion i must go with the party  you know quite well brooks said that you are within your rights in keeping the pledges you made to the mass meeting at medchester  henslow shook his head  it would be no good he declared ive sounded lots of men about it i myself have not changed i believe in some measure of protection i am a firm believer in it but the house wouldnt listen to me the times are not ripe for anything of the sort yet  how do you know until you try brooks protested your promise was to bring the question before parliament in connection with the vast and increasing number of unemployed you are within your rights in doing so and to speak frankly we insist upon it or we ask for your resignation  are you speaking with authority young man mr henslow asked  of course i am i am the representative of the liberal parliamentary committee and i am empowered to say these things to you and more  well ill do the best i can to get a date mr henslow said grumblingly but you fellows are always in such a hurry and you dont understand that it dont go up here we have to wait our time month after month sometimes  i dont see any motion down in your name at all yet brooks remarked  i told you that sir henry struck it through  then i shall call upon him and point out that he is throwing away a liberal seat at the next election brooks replied he isnt the sort of man to encourage a member to break his election pledges  youll make a mess of the whole thing if you do anything of the sort henslow declared look here come and have a bit of dinner with me and talk things over a bit more pleasantly eh theres no use in getting our rags out  please excuse me brooks said i have arranged to dine elsewhere i do not wish to seem dictatorial or unreasonable but i have just come from medchester where the distress is if anything worse than ever it makes ones heart sick to walk the streets and when i look into the peoples faces i seem to always hear that great shout of hope and enthusiasm which your speech in the marketplace evoked you see there is only one real hope for these people and that is legislation and you are the man directly responsible to them for that  ill tell you what ill do mr henslow said in a burst of generosity ill send another ten guineas to the unemployed fund  take my advice and dont brooks answered dryly they might be reminded of the people who clamoured for bread and were offered a stone do your duty here keep your pledges speak in the house with the same passion and the same eloquence as when you sowed hope in the heart of those suffering thousands some one must break away from this musty routine of party politics the people will be heard mr henslow their voice has dominated the fate of every nation in time and it will be so with ours  mr henslow was silent for a few minutes this young man who would not drink champagne or be hailfellowwellmet and who was in such deadly earnest was a nuisance  i tell you what ill do he said at last ill have a few words with sir henry and see you tomorrow at what time you like  certainly brooks answered rising if you will allow me to make a suggestion mr henslow i would ask you to run through in your memory all your speeches and go through your pledges one by one let sir henry understand that your constituents will not be trifled with for it is not a question of another candidate it is a question of another party you have set the ball rolling and i can assure you that the next member whom medchester sends here whether it be you or any one else will come fully pledged to a certain measure of protection  mr henslow nodded  very well he said gloomily where are you staying  at the metropole mr bullsom is there also  i will call mr henslow promised at three oclock if that is convenient  brooks passed out across the great courtyard and through the gates he had gone to his interview with henslow in a somewhat depressed state of mind and its result had not been enlivening were all politics like this was the greatest of causes the cause of the people to be tossed about from one to the other a joke with some a juggling ball with others never to be dealt with firmly and wisely by the brains and generosity of the empire he looked back at the houses of parliament with their myriad lights their dark impressive outline and for a moment the depression passed away he thought of the freedom which had been won within those walls of the gigantic struggles the endless restless journeying onward towards the truths the great truths of the world all politicians were not as this man henslow there were others more strenuous more singlehearted he himselfand his heart beat at the thoughtwhy should he not take his place there the thought fascinated himevery word of lord arranmores letter which he had recently received seemed to stand out before him his feet fell more blithely upon the pavement he carried himself with a different air here were ample means to fill his lifemeans by which he could crush out that sweet but unhappy tangle of memories which somehow or other had stolen the flavour out of life for the last few weeks  at the hotel he glanced at the clock it was just eight and he was to accompany the bullsoms to the theatre he met them in the hall and selina looked with reproach at his morning clothes she was wearing a new swansdown theatre cloak with a collar which she had turned up round her face like a frame she was convinced that she had never looked so well in her life  mr brooks how naughty of you she exclaimed shaking her head in mock reproach why the play begins at 815 and it is eight oclock already have you had dinner  oh i can manage with something in my room while i change he answered cheerily im going to take you all out to supper after the theatre you know dont wait for meill come on his majestys isnt it  ill keep your seat selina promised him lowering her voice that is if you are very good and come before it is half over do you know that we met a friend of yours and he lent us his carriage and i think hes charming  brooks looked surprised he glanced at mary and saw a look in her face which came as a revelation to him  you dont mean  lord arranmore selina declared triumphantly he was so nice he wouldnt let us come home in a cab he positively made us take his own carriage  mr bullsom came hurrying up  cab waiting he announced come on girls  see you later then brooks  brooks changed his clothes leisurely and went into the smokingroom for some sandwiches and a glass of wine a small boy shouting his number attracted his attention he called him and was handed a card  lord arranmore  you can show the gentleman here brooks directed  arranmore came in and nodded a little wearily to brooks whom he had not seen since the latter had left enton  i wont keep you he remarked i just wanted a word with you about that obstinate young person misserscott  brooks wheeled an easychair towards him  i am in no great hurry he remarked  arranmore glanced at the clock  more am i he said but i find i am dining with the prime minister at nine oclock it occurs to me that you may have some influence with her  we are on fairly friendly terms brooks admitted  just so well she may have told you that my solicitors approached her as the daughter of martin scott with the offer of a certain sum of money which is only a fair and reasonable item which i won from her father at a time when we were not playing on equal terms it was through that she found me out  yes i knew as much as that  so i imagined but the hotheaded young woman has up to now steadily refused to accept anything whatever from me quite ridiculous of her theres no doubt that i broke up the happy home and all that sort of thing and i really cant see why she shouldnt permit me the opportunity of making some restitution  you want her to afford you the luxury of salving your conscience brooks remarked dryly  lord arranmore laughed hardly  conscience he repeated you ought to know me better brooks than to suppose me possessed of such a thing no i have a sense of justice that is alla sort of weakness for seeing the scales held fairly now dont you think it is reasonable that she should accept this money from me  it depends entirely upon how she feels brooks answered you have no right to press it upon her if she has scruples nor have you any right to try and enlist her family on your side as you seem to be doing  will you discuss it with her  i should not attempt to influence her brooks answered  be reasonable brooks the money can make no earthly difference to me and it secures for her independence the obligation if only a moral one is real enough there is no question of charity use your influence with her  brooks shook his head  i have great confidence in miss scotts own judgment he said i prefer not to interfere  arranmore sat quite still for a moment then he rose slowly to his feet  i am sorry to have troubled you he said the world seems to have grown more quixotic since i knew it better i am almost afraid to ask you whether my last letter has yet received the favour of your consideration  brooks flushed a little at the biting sarcasm in arranmores tone but he restrained himself  i have consideredthe matter fully he said and i have talked it over with mr ascough there seems to be no reason why i should refuse the income to which i seem to be entitled  lord arranmore nodded and lit a cigarette  i am thankful he said dryly for so much commonsense mr ascough will put you in possession of a banking account at any moment should you consider itwellintrusive on my part if i were to inquire as to your plans  brooks hesitated  they are as yet not wholly formed he said but i am thinking of studying social politics for some time here in london with the intention of entering public life  a very laudable ambition lord arranmore answered if i can be of any assistance to you i trust that you will not fail to let me know  i thank you brooks answered i shall not require any assistance from you  lord arranmore winced perceptibly brooks who would not have believed him capable of such a thing for a moment doubted his eyes  i am much obliged for your candour lord arranmore said coldly and with complete selfrecovery dont trouble to come to the door goodevening  brooks was alone he sat down in one of the big easychairs and for a moment forgot that empty stall next to selina he had seen the first sign of weakness in a man whom he had judged to be wholly and entirely heartless    chapter iii  mary scotts two visitors  i am sure he said that selina would consider this most improper  you are quite right mary assured him laughing it was one of the first things she mentioned when i told her that i should ask any one to tea i liked she was positively indignant  it is hard to believe that you are cousins he remarked  we were brought up very differently  he looked around him he was in a tiny sittingroom of a tiny flat high up in a great building out of the window he seemed to look down upon the ferris wheel inside everything was cramped but cosy mary scott sat behind the teatray and laughed at his expression  i will read your thoughts she exclaimed you are wondering how you will get out of this room without knocking anything over  on the contrary he answered i was wondering how i ever got in  you were really very clever now do have some more tea and tell me all the news  i will have the tea if you please he answered and you shall have the news such as it is  first of all then she said i hear that you are leaving medchester giving up your business and coming to live in london and that you have had some money left you do you know that all this sounds very mysterious  i admit it he answered slowly stirring his tea yet in the mainit is true  how nice to hear all about it she sighed contentedly you know i have scarcely had a word with you while my uncle and cousins were up selina monopolized you most disgracefully  he looked at her with twinkling eyes  selina was very amusing he said  you seemed to find her so she answered but selina isnt here now and you have to entertain me you are really going to live in london  he nodded  i have taken rooms  delightful whereabouts in jermyn street  and are you going to practise  he shook his head  no i shall have enough to live on i am going to study social subjects and politics generally  you are going into parliament she exclaimed breathlessly  some day perhaps he answered hesitatingly if i can find a constituency  she was silent for a moment  do you know i think i rather dislike you she said i envy you most hideously  he laughed  what an evil nature  well ive never denied it im dreadfully envious of people who have the chance of doing things whose limitations are not chalked out on the blackboard before them  oh well you yourself are not at medchester now he reminded her you have kicked your own limitation away literature is as wide a field as politics  that is true enough she answered i must not grumble after medchester this is elysium but literature is a big name to give my little efforts im just a helper on a ladys threepenny paper and between you and me i dont believe they think much of my work yet  he laughed  surely they havent been discouraging you  no they have been very kind but they keep on assuring me that i am bound to improve and the way they use the blue pencil however its only the journalists part they go for the little stories are all right still  i should think so he declared warmly i think they are charming  how nice you are she sighed no wonder selina didnt like going home  he looked at her in amused wonder  do you know he said you are getting positively frivolous i dont recognize you i never saw such a change  she leaned back in her chair laughing heartily her eyes bright her beautiful white teeth in delightful evidence  oh i suppose its the sense of freedom she exclaimed its delightful isnt it medchester had got on my nerves i hated it one saw nothing but the ugly side of life day after day it was hideously depressing here one can breathe theres room for every one  the change agrees with you  why not i feel years younger think how much there is to do and see even for a pauper like myselfpicture galleries the shops the people the theatres  he looked at her thoughtfully  dont think me a prig will you he said but i want to understand you in medchester you used to work for the peopleit was the greater part of your life you are not giving that up altogether are you  she laughed him to scorn  am i such a butterfly no i hope to get some serious work to do and i am looking forward to it i have a letter of introduction to a mrs capenhurst whom i am going to see on sunday i expect to learn a lot from her i was very very sorry to leave my own girls it was the only regret i had in leaving medchester by the bye what is this about mr henslow  we are thinking of asking him to resign brooks answered he has been a terrible disappointment to us  she nodded  i am sorry from his speeches he seemed such an excellent candidate  he was a magnificent candidate brooks said ruefully but a shocking member i am afraid what i heard in the city the other day must have some truth in it they say that he only wanted to be able to write mp after his name for this last session to get on the board of two new companies he will never sit for medchester again  he was at the hotel the other day wasnt he mary asked with you and uncle what has he to say for himself  well he shelters himself behind the old fudge about duty to his party brooks answered you see the liberals only just scraped in last election because of the war scandals and their majority is too small for them to care about any of the rank and file introducing any disputative measures still that scarcely affects the question he won his seat on certain definite pledges and if he persists in his present attitude we shall ask him at once to resign  you still keep up your interest in medchester then  why yes he answered between ourselves if i could choose i would rather when the time comes stand for medchester than anywhere  i am glad i should like to see you member for medchester do you know even now although i am so happy i cannot think about the last few months there without a shudder it seemed to me that things were getting worse and worse the peoples faces haunt me sometimes  he looked up at her sympathetically  if you have once lived with them he said once really understood you never can forget you can travel or amuse yourself in any way but their faces are always coming before you their voices seem always in your ears it is the one eternal sadness of life and the strangest part of it is that just as you who have once really understood can never forget so it is the most difficult thing in the world to make those people understand who have not themselves lived and toiled amongst them it is a cry which you cannot translate but if once you have heard it it will follow you from the earth to the stars  you too then she said have some of the old aim at heart you are not going to immerse yourself wholly in politics  my studies he said will be in life it is not from books that i hope to gain experience i want to get a little nearer to the heart of the thing you and i may easily come across one another even in this great city  you she said are going to watch to observe to trace the external only that you may understand the internal but i am going to work on my hands and knees  and you think that i am going to play the dilettante  not altogether but you will want to pass from one scheme to another to see the inner workings of all i shall be content to find occupation in any one  i shall be coming to you he said for information and help  i doubt it she answered cheerfully never mind it is pleasant to build castles and we may yet find ourselves working side by side  he suddenly looked at her  i have answered all your questions he said there is something about you which i should like to know  i am sure you shall  lord arranmore came to me when i was staying at the metropole with your uncle and cousin he wished me to use my influence with you to induce you to accept a certain sum of money which it seemed that you had already declined  well  of course i refused in the first place as i told him i was not aware that i possessed any influence over you and in the second i had every confidence in your own judgment  she was suddenly very thoughtful  my own judgment she repeated i am afraid that i have lost a good deal of faith in that lately  why  i have learned to repent of that impulsive visit of mine to enton  again why  i was mad with rage against lord arranmore i think that i was wrong it was many years ago and he has repented  brooks smiled faintly the idea of lord arranmore repenting of anything appealed in some measure to his sense of humour  then i am afraid that i did him some great harm in accusing him like thatopenly he has seemed to me since like an altered man tell me those others who were therethey believed me  yes  it did him harmwith the lady the handsome woman who was playing billiards with him  yes  was he engaged to her  no he proposed to her afterwards and she refused him  her eyes were suddenly dim  i am sorry she said  i think he said quietly that you need not be you probably saved her a good deal of unhappiness  she looked at him curiously  why are you so bitter against lord arranmore she asked  i he laughed i am not bitter against him only i believe him to be a man without heart or conscience or principles  that is your opinionreally  really decidedly  then i dont agree with you she answered  why not  simply that i dont  excellent but you have reasons as well as convictions  perhaps why for instance is he so anxious for me to have this money that must be a matter of conscience  not necessarily an accident might bring his montreal career to light his behaviour towards you would be an excellent defence  she shook her head  he isnt mean enough to think so far ahead for his own advantage villain or paragon he is on a large scale your lord arranmore  he has had the good fortune brooks said with a note of satire in his tone to attract your sympathies  why not i struck hard enough at him and he has borne me no illwill he even made friends with selina and my uncle to induce me to accept his well conscience money  i need not ask you what the result was brooks said you declined it of course  she looked at him thoughtfully  i refused it at first as you know she said since then well i have wavered  he looked at her blankly  you meanthat you have contemplatedaccepting it  why not there is reason in it i do not say that i have accepted it but at any rate i see nothing which should make you look upon my possible acceptance as a heinous thing  he was silent for a moment  may i ask you then what the position is  i will tell you lord arranmore is coming to me perhaps this afternoon for my answer i asked him for a few days to think it over  and your decisionis it ready  no i dont think it is she admitted to tell you the truth i shall not decide until he is actually hereuntil i have heard just how he speaks of it  he got up and stood for a moment looking out of the window then he turned suddenly towards her with outstretched hand  i am goingmiss scott goodafternoon she rose and held out her hand  arent youa little abrupt she asked  perhaps i am i think that it is better that i should go away now there are reasons why i do not want to talk about lord arranmore or discuss this matter with you and if i stayed i might do both will you dine with me somewhere on friday night i will come and fetch you  of course i will do be careful how you walk about 730  i will be here by then he answered  on the last flight of stone steps he came face to face with lord arranmore who nodded and pointed upwards with his walkingstick  how much of this sort of thing he asked dryly  ten storeys brooks answered and passed out into the street  lord arranmore looked after himwatched him until he was out of sight then he stood irresolute for several moments tapping his boots  damned young fool he muttered at last and began the ascent    chapter iv  a marquis on matrimony  my dear miss scott lord arranmore said settling himself in the most comfortable of her fragile easychairs and declining tea i cannot fail to perceive that my cause is hopeless the united efforts of myself and your worthy relatives appear to be powerless to unearth a single grain of commonsense in yourerpardon mesingularly obstinate disposition  a subdued smile played at the corners of her mouth  i am delighted that you are convinced lord arranmore she said it will save us both a good deal of time and breath  wellas to that i am not so sure he answered deliberately you forget that there is still an important matter to be decided  she looked at him questioningly  the disposal of the money of course he said  the disposal of it but that has nothing to do with me she declared i refuse to touch itto have anything to do with it  he shook his head  you see he explained i have placed it or rather my solicitors have in trust actually you may decline as you are doing to have anything to do with itlegally you cannot avoid your responsibilities that money cannot be touched without your signature  she laughed a little indignantly   then you had better withdraw it from trust or whatever you call it at once if it was there until i was eighty i should never touch it  i understand that perfectly lord arranmore said you have refused it very well what are we going to do with it  put it back where it came from of course she answered  well he said by signing several papers that might be managed in that case i should distribute it amongst the various publichouses in the east end to provide drinks for the thirstiest of their customers  if you think that she said scornfully a reputable use to make of your money  he held out his hand  my dear miss scott our money  the money she exclaimed i repeat the money well there is nothing more to be said about it  will you sign the papers which authorize me to distribute the money in this way  she thought for a moment  no i will not  exactly you would be very foolish and very untrue to your principles if you did so you see this sum is not to be foisted altogether upon me for there is no doubt that i should misuse it now i believe that if you were to give the matter a little consideration you could hit upon a more reasonable manner of laying out this sum dont interrupt me please my own views as to charity you know you however look at the matter from an altogether different point of view let us leave it where it is for the moment something may occur to you within the next few months dont let it be a hospital if you can help itsomething altogether original would be best set your brain to work i shall be at your service at any moment  he rose to his feet and began slowly to collect his belongings then their eyes met and she burst out laughinghe too smiled  you are very ingenious lord arranmore she said  it is my conscience he assured her it is out of gear to the tune of three thousand  i dont believe in the conscience she answered this is sheer obstinacy you have made up your mind that i should be interested in that money somehow and you cant bear to suffer defeat  i am an old man he said and you are a young woman let us leave it where it is for a while i have an idea of the sort of life which you are planning for yourself believe me that before you have lived here for many months you will be willing to give years of your life years of your labour and your youth to throw yourself into a struggle which without money is hopeless remember that there was a time when i too was young i too saw these things as you and brooks see them today i do not wish to preach pessimism to you i fought and was worsted so will you be the whole thing is a vast chimera a jest of the god you have made for yourself but as long as the world lasts the young will have to buy knowledgeas i have bought it dont go into the fray emptyhandedit will only prolong the suffering  you speak she protested gently as though it were impossible to do good  it is absolutely and entirely impossible to do good by any means which you and brooks and the whole army of your fellowphilanthropists have yet evoked he answered with a sudden fierce note in his tone dont think that i speak to you as a cynic one who loiters on the edge of the cauldron and peers in to gratify cravings for sensation i have been there down in the thick of it there where the mud is as black as hellbottomless as eternity i was youngas youmad with enthusiasm i had faith strength belief i meant to cleanse the world i worked till the skin hung on my bones i gave all that i hadyouthgiftsmoney and do you know what i was doing i was swimming against the tide of natural law stronger than all mankind unconquerable eternal there wasnt the smallest corner of the world the better for my broken life there wasnt a child a man or a woman content to grasp my hand and climb out there were plenty who mocked me but they fell back again they fell back always  oh but you cant tell that she cried you cant be sure  you can be as sure of it as of life itself he answered come take my advice i know i can save you a broken youtha broken heart keep away from there  he pointed out of the window eastwards  you can be charitable like the others subscribe to societies visit the sick read the bible play at it as long as you likebut keep away from the real thing if you feel the fever in your veinsfly go abroad study art literature musicanything only dont listen to that cry it will draw you against your will even but not you nor the whole world of women or the world full of gold will ever stop it it is the everlasting legacy to the world of outraged nature  he went swiftly and silently leaving her motionless she saw him far down on the pavement below step into his brougham pausing for a moment to light a cigarette and halfanhour later he walked with elastic tread into mr ascoughs office  mr ascough greeted him with an inquiring smile lord arranmore nodded and sat down  you were quite right he announced the tongues of men or of angels wouldnt move her never mind shes going to use the money for charity  well thats something at any rate mr ascough remarked  the eloquence lord arranmore said lazily which i have wasted upon that young woman would entrance the house of lords by the bye ascough i am going to take my seat next week  i am delighted to hear it your lordship  yes its good news for the country isnt it lord arranmore remarked i have not quite decided what my particular line shall be but i have no doubt but that the papers will all be calling me a welcome addition to that august assembly before long i believe thats whats the matter with me i want to make a speech do you remember me at the bar ascough couldnt keep me down could they  mr ascough smiled  you were rather fond of being on your feet he admitted  lord arranmore sighed regretfully  and to think that i might have been lord high chancellor by now he remarked goodbye ascough                                      later at the reception of a cabinet minister lord arranmore came across hennibul talking with halfadozen other men he detached himself at once  this is odd he remarked with a whimsical smile what the dickens are you doing in this respectable household arranmore you look like a lost sheep  lord arranmore shrugged his shoulders  ive decided to go in for something he said politics or society or something of that sort what do you recommend  supper mr hennibul answered promptly  come on then lord arranmore assented one of those little tables in the far room eh  the pate here is delicious mr hennibul said but for heavens sake leave the champagne alone theres some decent hock youll excuse my pointing out these little things to you but of course you dont know the runs yet ill give you a safe tip while im about it the opposition food is beastly but the wine is all rightpommery and heidsieck most of it and the right years the government food now is good but the wine especially the champagne is positively unholy  one should eat then with the government and drink with the opposition lord arranmore remarked  or better still mr hennibul said do both with the speaker by the bye did you know that they are going to make me a judge  i heard that your friends wanted to get rid of you arranmore answered  to make yourself obnoxiousthoroughly obnoxious mr hennibul murmured is the sure road to advancement  thats right give me a few tips lord arranmore begged sipping his wine  my dear fellow i dont know what youre going in for yet  neither do i what about the stage i used to be rather good at private theatricals elderly wyndhamy parts you know  mr hennibul shook his head  twenty years too late he declared even the suburbs turn up their noses at a lord now  i must do something arranmore declared meditatively  dont see the necessity hennibul remarked  lord arranmore lifted his glass and looked thoughtfully at the wine for a moment  ah well he said you were born lazy and i was born restless that is the reason you have done something and i havent  if you want my advicemy serious advice the k c said quietly you will make yourself a nuisance to that right woman whoever she is until she marries youif only to get rid of you  all sorts of things in the way lord arranmore declared you see i was married abroad  mr hennibul looked up quickly  nonsense  quite true i assure you  is she alive  nobut her son is  great heavens why hes lord kingston  of course he is  how old is he  twentyeightor somewhere thereabouts  what is he doing where is he why dont we know him  he doesnt approve of me lord arranmore said fact really we are scarcely on speaking terms  why not  says i deserted his mother so i did played the blackguard altogether left em both to starve or next door to it  mr hennibul fetched out his handkerchief and dabbed his forehead  you are serious arranmore  rather you wouldnt expect me to be frivolous on this hock  that young man must be talked to mr hennibul declared he ought to be filling his proper place in the world its no use carrying on a grudge against his own father let me have a try at him  no lord arranmore said quietly i am obliged to you hennibul but the matter is one which does not admit of outside interference however kindly besides the boy is right i wilfully deserted both him and his mother and she died during my absence my life whilst away from them was the sort one forgetsor tries toand he knows about it further when i returned to england i was two years before i took the trouble to go and see him i merely alluded to these domestic matters that you might not wholly misjudge the situation  mr hennibul went on with his supper in silence lord arranmore whose appetite had soon failed him leaned back in his chair and watched the people in the further room  this rather puts me off politics he remarked after a while i dont like the look of the people  oh youll get in for the select crushers mr hennibul said this is a rank and file affair you mustnt judge by appearances but why must you specialize take my advice dont go in specially for politics or society or sport mix them all up be cosmopolitan and commonplace  upon my word hennibul you are a genius arranmore declared and yonder goes my good fairy  he sprang up and disappeared into the further room  lady caroom he exclaimed bending over her shoulder i never suspected it of you  she started slightlyshe was silent perhaps for the fraction of a second then she looked up with a bright smile meeting him on his own ground  but of you she cried it is incredible come at once and explain    chapter v  brooks enlists a recruit  brooks had found a small restaurant in the heart of fashionable london where the appointments and decorations were french and the waiters were not disposed to patronize of the cooking neither he nor mary scott in those days was a critic nevertheless she protested against the length of the dinner which he ordered  i want an excuse he declared laying down the carte for a good long chat we shall be too late for the theatre so we may as well resign ourselves to an hour or so of one anothers society  she shook her head  a very apt excuse for unwarrantable greediness she declared surely we can talk without eating  he shook his head  you do not smoke and you do not drink liqueurs he remarked now i have noticed that it is simply impossible for one to sit before an empty table after dinner and not feel that one ought to go let the waiter take your cape you will find the room warm  do you remember she asked him the first night we dined together  he looked at her with twinkling eyes  rather it was my introduction to your uncles household selina sat on my left and louise on my right you sat opposite tired and disagreeable  i was tiredand i am always disagreeable  i have noticed it he agreed equably i hope you like oysters  if selina were to see us now she remarked with a sudden humorous smile how shocked she would be  what a little faraway world it seems down there he said thoughtfully after all i am glad that i have not to live in medchester all my life  you have been there this afternoon havent you  yes henslow is giving us a lot of trouble i am afraid we shall lose the seat next election  do you mind  not much i am no party politician i want to see medchester represented by a man who will go there with a sense of political proportion and i dont care whether he calls himself liberal or radical or conservative or unionist  please explain what you mean by that she begged  why yes i mean a man who will understand how enormously more important is the welfare of our own people the people of whom we are making slaves than this feverish imperialism and war cant mind i think our patriotism should be a thing wholly understood it neednt be talked about it makes showy fireworks for the platform but its all unnecessary and to my mind very undignified if only people would take that for granted and go on to something worth while  are things any better in medchester just now she asked  on the surface yes but on the surface only more factories are running halftime but after all what does that mean its slow starvation a man cant live and keep a family on fifteen shillings a week even if his wife earns a little he cant do it in a dignified manner and with cleanliness and health that is what he has a right to that is what the next generation will demand he should have room to expand cleanliness air fresh food every man and woman who is born into the world has a godgiven right to these and there are millions in medchester manchester and all the great cities who are denied all three  so all henslows great schemes his royal commissions his protection duties his great housing bill have come to nothing then she remarked  to less than nothing he answered gloomily the man was a fraud he is not worth attempting to bully he is a puppet politician of a type that ought to have been dead and buried generations ago enoch stone is our only hope in the house now he is a strong man and he has hold of the truth  have they decided upon henslows successor she asked  not yet he answered  she looked up at him  i heard from uncle this morning she said smiling meaningly  he shook his head  well it was mentioned he said but i would not hear of it i am altogether too young and inexperienced i want to live with the people for a year or two first that is why i am glad to get to london  with the people she asked in jermyn street  he laughed goodhumouredly  i have also lodgings in the bethnal green road he said i took possession of them last week  anywhere near merrys corner she asked  what do you know about merrys corner he exclaimed with uplifted eyebrows yes my rooms are nearly opposite at the corner of the next street  ive been down there once or twice lately she said theres a missionhall just there and a girl named kate stuart gave me a letter to go three times a week  he nodded  i know the place weeknight services and hymnsinging and preaching a cold desolate affair altogether im thankful i went in there though for its given me an idea  yes  im going to start a mission myself  go on  on a new principle the first thing will be that there will be no religious services whatever i wont have a clergyman connected with it it will be intended solely for the benefit of the people from a temporal point of view  you are going a long way she said what about sundays  there will be a very short service for the mission helpers only no one will be asked from outside at all if they come it will be as a favour directly it is over the usual weekday procedure will go on  and what is that to be  brooks smiled a little doubtfully  well he said ive got the main idea in my head but all the details want thinking out i want the place to be a sort of help bureau to give the people living in a certain street or couple of streets somewhere to go for advice and help in cases of emergency there will be no money given away under any considerationonly food clothing and if they are asked for books i shall have halfadozen bathrooms and the people who come regularly for advice and help will have to use them and to keep their houses clean there will be no distinction as to character we shall help the drunkards and the very worst of them just the same as the others if they apply if we get enough helpers there will be plenty of branches we can open i should like to have a childrens branch for instanceone or two women will take the children of the neighbourhood in hand and bathe them every day as we get to know the people better and appreciate their special needs other things will suggest themselves but i want them to feel that they have some place to fail back upon we shall be frightfully humbugged robbed cheated and deceivedat first i fancy that after a time that will wear itself out  it is a fascinating idea she said thoughtfully but to carry it out in any way thoroughly you want a great many helpers and a great deal of money  i have enough to start it he said and when it is really going and improving itself i shall go out and ask for subscriptionsbig ones you know from the right sort of people you can always get money if you can show that it is to be well spent  and what about the helpers  well i know of a few he said who i think would come in and there is one to whom i would have to pay a small salary  i could come in the afternoons she said  capital but are you sure he said after a moments hesitation that it is quite fair to yourself  oh i can manage with my mornings salary she answered laughing i shant starve besides i can always burn a little midnight oil  a waiter stood at their table for a moment deftly carving some new dish and brooks leaning back in his chair glanced critically at his companion in his judgment she represented something in womankind essentially of the durable type he appreciated her good looks the air with which she wore her simple clothes her large full eyes her wide gentlyhumorous mouth and the hair parted in the middle and rippling away towards her ears a frank companionable woman whose eyes had never failed to look into his in whom he had never at any time seen a single shadow of embarrassment it occurred to him just at that moment that never since he had known her had he seen her interested to the slightest degree in any man he looked back at her thoughtfully she was young goodlooking too catholic in her views of life and its possibilities to refuse in any way to recognize its inevitable tendencies yet he told himself complacently as he sipped his wine and watched her gazing with amused interest at the little groups of people about the place that there must be in her composition a lack of sentiment never for a second in their intercourse had she varied from her usual goodnatured cheerfulness if there had been a shadow she had brushed it away ruthlessly even on that terrible afternoon at enton she had sat in the cab white and silentshe had appealed to him in no way for sympathy  the waiter retreated with a bow she shot a swift glance across at him  i object to being scrutinized she declared is it the plainness of my hat or the depth of my wrinkles to which you object  object he repeated  yes you were looking for something which you did not find you were distinctly disappointed dont deny it it isnt worth while  i wont plead guilty to the disappointment he answered but ill tell you the truth i was thinking what a delightfully companionable girl you were and yet how different from any other girl i have ever met in my life  that sounds hackneyedthe latter part of it she remarked but in my case i see that it is not intended to be a compliment what do i lack that other girls have  you are putting me in a tight corner he declared it isnt that you lack anything but nearly all the girls one meets some time or other seem to expect from one nice little speeches or compliments just a little sentiment now and then now you seem so entirely superior to that sort of thing altogether it is a ridiculously lame explanation the things in my head all right but i cant get it out i can only express it when i say that you are the only girl i have ever known or known of in my life with whom sex would never interfere with companionship  she stirred her coffee absently at first he thought that she might be offended for she did not look up for several moments  im afraid i failed altogether to make you understand what i meant he said humbly it is the result of an attempt at too great candour  then she looked up and smiled at him graciously enough though it seemed to him that she was a little pale  i am sure you were delightfully lucid she said i quite understood and on the whole i think i agree with you i dont think that the sentimental side of me has been properly developed by the bye you were going to tell me about that pretty girl i saw at entonlady carooms daughter wasnt she  his face lit upshe saw his thoughts go flitting away and the corner of his lips curl in a retrospective smile of pleasure  sybil caroom he said softly she is a very charming girl you would like her i am sure of course shes been brought up in rather a frivolous world but shes quite unspoilt very sympathetic and very intelligent isnt that a good character  very she answered with a suspicion of dryness in her tone is this paragon engaged to be married yet  he looked at her keenly surprised by the infusion of something foreign in her tone  ii think not he answered i should like you to meet her very much she will be coming to london soon and i know that she will be interested in our new scheme if it comes to anything we will take her down and give her a few practical lessons in philanthropy  will she be interested mary asked  immensely he answered with confidence lady caroom is an awfully good sort too  mary remembered the wellbred insolence of lady carooms stare the contemplative incredulity which found militant expression in her beautiful eyes and shapely curving lips and for a moment half closed her eyes  ah well she said that afternoon was rather a terrible one to me let us talk of something else  he was profuse at once in apologies for his own thoughtlessness but she checked him almost at the outset  it is i who am to blame for an unusual weakness she said let us both forget it and dont you find this place hot let us get outside and walk  they found a soft misty rain falling the commissionaire called a hansom she moved her skirts to make room for him  i am going down to stepney to see a man who i think will be interested in my scheme he said when may i come down again and have tea with you  any afternoon if you will drop me a line the night before she said but i am not very likely to be out in any case thank you so much for my dinner my aunt seemed to think that i was coming to london to starve i think i feel fairly safe this evening at any rate  the cab drove off skirting the gailylit crescent of regent street the smile almost at once died away from her lips she leaned forward and looked at herself in one of the oblong mirrors her face was almost colourless the skin seemed drawn closely round her eyes giving her almost a strained look for the rest her hair smoothly brushed away from her face was in perfect order her prim little hat was at exactly the right angle her little white tie alone relieved the sombreness of her black jacket she sighed and suddenly felt a moistening of her hot eyes she leaned far back into the corner of the cab    chapter vi  kingston brooks philanthropist  it is my deliberate intention lord arranmore said leaning over towards her from his low chair to make myself a nuisance to you lady caroom smiled at him thoughtfully  thank you for the warning she said but i can take care of myself i do not feel even obliged to deny myself the pleasure of your society  no you wont do that he remarked you see so many people bore you and i dont  it is true she admitted you pay me nothing but unspoken compliments and you devote a considerable amount of ingenuity to conceal the real meaning of everything you say now some people might not like that i adore it  catherine will you marry me  certainly not im much too busy looking after sybil and in any case youve had your answer my friend  you will marry me he said deliberately in less than two yearsperhaps in less than one why cant you make your mind up to it  you know why arranmore she said quietly if you were the man i remember many years ago the man i have wasted many hours of my life thinking about i would not hesitate for a moment i loved that man and i have always loved him but arranmore i cannot recognize him in you if these terrible things which you have suffered these follies which you have committed have withered you up so that there remains no trace of the man i once cared for do you blame me for refusing you i will not marry a stranger arranmore and i not only dont know you but i am a little afraid of you  he sighed  perhaps you are right he said softly i believe that the only thing i have carried with me from the beginning and shall have with me to the end is my love for you nothing else has survived  her eyes filled with tears she leaned over to him  dear friend she said listen at least i will promise you this if ever i should see the least little impulse or action which seems to me to come from the philip i once knew and not lord arranmore anything which will convince me that some part however slight of the old has survived i will come to you  he sighed  you alone he said might work such a miracle  then come and see me often she said with a brilliant smile and i will try  he moved his chair a little nearer to her  you encourage me to hope he said i remember that one night in the conservatory i was presumptuous enoughto take your hand history repeats itself you see and i claim the prize for i have fulfilled the condition  she drew her hand away firmly but without undue haste  if you are going to be frivolous she said i will have all the callers shown in you know very well that that is not what i mean there must be some unpremeditated action some impulse which comes from your own heart frankly arranmore there are times now when i am afraid of you you seem to have no heartto be absolutely devoid of feeling to be cold and calculating even in your slightest actions there now i have told you just what i feel sometimes and it doesnt sound nice does it  it sounds very true he said wearily will you tell me where i can buy a new heart and a fresh set of impulses even a disposition perhaps id be a customer im willing enough  never mind that she said softly after all i have a certain amount of faith a miracle may happen at any moment  sybil came in dressed in a fascinating short skirt and a toque her maid on the threshold was carrying a small green baize box  i am going to princes mother just for an hour with mrs huntingdon how do you do lord arranmore youll keep mother from being dull wont you  it is your mother he said who is making me dull  poor old mummy sybil declared cheerfully  never mind her barks a good deal worse than her bite goodbye both of you  lord arranmore rose and closed the door after her  sybil is a remarkably handsome young woman he said any signs of her getting married yet  lady caroom shook her head  no arranmore that reminds me what has become ofmr brooks lord arranmore smiled a little bitterly he is in london  i have never seen him you must remember since that evening is he stillunforgiving  yes he refuses to be acknowledged he is taking the bare income which is his by lawit comes from a settlement to the eldest sonand he is studying practical philanthropy in the slums  i am sorry she said i like him and he would be a companion for you  hes not to be blamed lord arranmore said from his point of view i have been the most scandalous parent upon this earth lady caroom sighed  do you know she said that he and sybil were very friendly  i noticed it he answered  she has asked about him once or twice since we got back to town and when she reads about the starting of this new work of his at stepney she will certainly write to him  you mean  i mean that she has sent sydney to the rightabout this time in earnest she is a queer girl reticent in a way although she seems such a chatterbox and i am sure she thinks about him  lord arranmore laughed a little hardly  well he said i am the last person to be consulted about anything of this sort if he keeps up his present attitude and declines to receive anything from me his income until my death will be only two or three thousand a year he might marry on that down in stepney but not in this part of the world  sybil has nine hundred a year lady caroom said but it would not be a matter of money at all i should not allow sybil to marry any one concerning whose position in the world there was the least mystery she might marry lord kingston of ross but never mr kingston brooks  hasmr brooks given any special signs of devotion lord arranmore asked  not since they were at enton i dare say he has never even thought of her since still it was a contingency which occurred to me  he is a young man of excellent principles lord arranmore said dryly taking life as seriously as you please and i should imagine is too well balanced to make anything but a very safe husband if he comes to me if he will accept it without coming to me even he can have another ten thousand a year and enton  you are generous she murmured  generous my houses and my money are a weariness to me i cannot live in the former and i cannot spend the latter i am a man really of simple tastes besides there is no glory now in spending money one can so easily be outdone by ones grocer or one of those marvellous americans  yet i thought i read of you last week as giving nine hundred pounds for some unknown tapestry at christies  but that is not extravagance he protested that is not even spending money it is exchanging one investment for another the purple colouring of that tapestry is marvellous the next generation will esteem it priceless  you must go she asked for he had risen  i have stayed long enough he answered in another five minutes you will yawn and mine would have been a wasted visit i should like to time my visits always so that the five minutes which i might have stayed seem to you the most desirable five minutes of the whole time  you are an epicurean and a schemer she declared i am afraid of you                                      he bought an evening paper on his way to st jamess square and leaning back in his brougham glanced it carelessly through just as he was throwing it aside a small paragraph at the bottom of the page caught his attention  a novel philanthropic departure  the first bureau opened today  interview with mr kingston brooks  he folded the paper out and read through every line carefully a few minutes after his arrival home he reissued from the house in a bowler hat and a long loose overcoat he took the metropolitan and an omnibus to stepney and read the paragraph through again soon he found himself opposite the address given  he recognized it with a little start it had once been a mission hall then a furniture shop and later on had been empty for years it was brilliantly lit up and he pressed forward and peered through the window inside the place was packed brooks and a dozen or so others were sitting on a sort of slightlyraised platform at the end of the room with a desk in front of each of them lord arranmore pulled his hat over his eyes and forced his way just inside almost as he entered brooks rose to his feet  look here he said you all come up asking the same question and wasting my time answering you all severally you want to know what this place means well if youll stay just where you are for a minute ill tell you all together and save time  hear hear guvnor said a bibulous old costermonger encouragingly lets hear all about it  so you shall brooks said now listen i dare say there are a good many of you who go up in the west end sometimes and see those big houses and the way people spend their money there who come back to your own houses here and think that things arent exactly dealt out square isnt that so  there was a hearty and unanimous assent  well brooks continued it may surprise you to hear that a few of us who have a little money up there have come to the same conclusion wed like to do our little bit towards squaring things up  it may not be much but lots more may come of it  a modified but a fairly cordial assent  we havent money to give awaynot much of it at any rate brooks continued  more bloomin tracks the costermonger interrupted and spat upon the floor fair sickens me it does  as for tracts brooks continued calmly i dont think ive ever read one in my life and i dont want to we havent such a thing in the place and i shouldnt know where to go for them and though that gentleman down there with a herring sticking out of his pocket seems to have done himself pretty well already id rather stand him a glass of beer than offer him such a thing  a roar of laughter during which a wag in the crowd quietly picked the costermongers pocket of the fish with a deftness born of much practice and sent it flying over the room it was promptly returned and found a devious way back to its owner in a somewhat dusty and mauled condition  there is just one thing we have to ask for and insist upon brooks continued when you come to us for help tell us the truth if youve been drunk all the week and havent earned any money well we may help you out with a sunday dinner if youve been in prison and wont mind owning up to it we shant send you away for that reason we want your women to come and bring us your children that we can have a look at them tell us how much you all make a week between you and what you need most to make you a bit more comfortable and we want your husbands to come and tell us where they work and what rent they pay and if they havent any work and cant get it well see what we can do i tell you i dont care to start with whether youre sober and industrious or idle or drunkards well give any one a legup if we can i dont say we shall keep that up always because of course we shant but well give any one a fair chance now do you want to ask any questions  a pallid but truculentlooking young man pushed himself to the front  ere guvnor he said supposing yer was to stand me a coati aint ad one for two monthsshould i ave to come ere on a sunday and sing bloomin hymns  if you did brooks answered him youd do it by yourself and youd stand a fair chance of being run out theres going to be no preaching or hymnsinging here those sorts of things are very well in their way but theyve nothing to do with this show im not sure whether we shall open on sundays or not if we do it will be only for the ordinary business now lets get to work  sounds a bit of orl right and no mistake the young man remarked turning round to the crowd im going to stop and ave a go for that coat  a young man in a bright scarlet jersey pushed himself to the front followed by a little volley of chaff more or less goodnatured  theres salvation joe wants a new trombone  christian salls blown a hole in the old one eh joe  breathless he reached brooks side the sweat stood out in beads upon his forehead he seemed not to hear a word that was said amongst the crowd brooks smiled at him goodhumouredly well sir he said what can i do for you  i happened in sir out of curiosity the young man said in a strange nasal twang the heritage of years of outdoor preaching i hoped to hear of one more good work begun in this den of iniquity and to clasp hands with another brother in god  glad to see you brooks said youll remember were busy  the message of god the young man answered must be spoken at all times  oh chuck im out cried the disgusted costermonger spitting upon the floor that sort o stuff fair sickens me  the young man continued as though he had not heard  such charity as you are offering he cried is corruption you are going to dispense things for their carnal welfare and you do nothing for their immortal souls you will not let them even shout their thanks to god you will fill their stomachs and leave their souls hungry  the costermonger waved a wonderful red handkerchief and spat once more on the floor brooks laid his hand upon the young mans shoulder  look here my young friend he said youre talking rot men and women who live down here in wretchedness and who are fighting every moment of their time to hang on to life dont want to be talked to about their souls they need a legup in the world and weve come to try and give it to them were here as friends not preachers well leave you to look after their souls you people whove tried to make your religion the pill to go with your charity have done more harm in the world than you know of  the young man was on fire to speak but he had no chance they hustled him out goodnaturedly except that the costermonger running him down the room took his cap from his head and sent it spinning across the road lord arranmore left the hall at the same time and turned homewards walking like a man in a dream    chapter vii  brooks and his missions  now then please brooks said dipping his pen in the ink  a lady of ample proportions who had been standing since the commencement of the proceedings with her hand tightly grasping the leg of brooks table gave a final shove of discomfiture to a meekfaced girl whom she had suspected of an attempt to supersede her and presented herself before the desk  im first she declared firmly been ere for four mortal hours  what is your name please brooks asked  mrs robert jones no 4 st marys court down fennell streetleastways you go that way from ere im a widow woman with four children and lost me husband on the railway what i wants is a suit of clothes for my tommy hes fiveandarf and stout for his years and a pair of boots for selina ann and im not a saying she continued blandly as me having waited ere so long and this being a sort of opening ceremony as a pound of tea for myself wouldnt be a welcome and reasonable gift and if the suit she concluded breathlessly has doubleseated breeches so much the better  brooks maintained the most perfect composure although conscious of a suppressed titter from behind he commenced to write rapidly in his book and mrs jones drawing her shawl about her looked around complacently suddenly she caught the ripple of mirth which some of brooks helpers were powerless to control her face darkened  which is little enough to ask for she declared truculently considering as its four mortal hours since i first laid hold of the leg of that table and neither bite nor sup have i had since it not being my habit she continued slowly and staring intently at the hang of her neighbours skirt to carry bottles in my pocket  brooks looked up  thank you mrs jones he said i have entered your name and address and i hope we shall see you again soon this young lady he indicated mary will take you over to our clothes department and if we havent anything to fit tommy you must come again on wednesday when we shall have a larger supply  ill take the nearest youve got today she decided promptly wot about the tea  we shall be glad to ask you to accept a small packet brooks answered by the bye have you a pension from the railway company  not a penny sir she declared and a burning shame it is  we must see into it brooks said you see that gentleman behind me  him with the squint she asked doubtfully  brooks bent over his book  mr fellows his name is he said he is one of our helpers here and he is a lawyer you can tell him all about it and if we think you have a claim we will try and see what we can do for you now if you please we must get on come in any time mrs jones and talk to us some one is always here what is your name please  amy hardinge  there was a howl of derision from the rear the girl pallid with large dark eyes a somewhat tawdry hat and torn skirt turned angrily around  who yer shouting at eh there aint so many of yer as knows yer own names i dir say and ardinges as good as any other leave a body be wont yer  she turned round to brooks and disclosed a most alarming rent in her gown  look ere guvnor she said thats my name and i as a back room behind old connels fishshop next door but one to ere if yer want to give away things to them as wants em wot price a new skirt ere eh  a woman from the rear leaned over to brooks  the ussy she said dont you take no notice of er sir we all knows erand precious little good there is ter know  miss hardinge was not unreasonably annoyed she turned round with flashing eyes and belligerent attitude  who the ell asked you anything she exclaimed cant yer keep your bloomin mouths closed  a palefaced little man pushed his way through the throng he was dressed in a semiclerical garb and he tapped brooks on the shoulder  can you favour me with one moments private conversation sir he said my name is john deeling and i am a minister of the gospel the mission house in fennell street is my special charge  glad to know you mr deeling brooks answered but i cant spare any time for private conversation now cant you speak to me here  mr deeling looked doubtfully at the girl who stood still before the desk silent but breathing hard a sullen shade had fallen upon her face she looked like a creature at bay  it is concerningthis unfortunate young person  i can assure you brooks said dipping his pen in the ink that no recommendation is necessary i shall do what i can for her  you misapprehend me sir mr deeling said with some solemnity i regret to say that no recommendation is possible that young person is outside the pale of all christian help i regret to speak so plainly before ladies sir but she is a notorious character a hardened and incurable prostitute  brooks looked at him for a moment fixedly  did i understand you to say sir that you were a minister of the gospel he asked  certainly i am well known in the neighbourhood  then if you take my advice brooks said sternly you will take off those garments and break stones upon the street it is to help such unfortunate and cruelly illused young women as this that i and my friends have come here be off sir miss hardinge this young lady will take you to our clothes store in the inner room there i hope you will permit us to be of some further use to you later on  the girl half dazed passed away mr deeling his face red with anger turned towards the door  you may call it a christian deed sir he exclaimed angrily to encourage vice of the worst description we shall see what the bishop what the press have to say about it  i dont care a snap of the fingers what you or the bishop or time press have to say brooks rejoined equably but lest there should be those here who agree with your point of view let them hear this from me at once to prevent misunderstanding we are here to help to the best of our ability all who need help whatsoever their characters they are equally welcome to what we have to offer whether they be thieves or prostitutes or drunkards or respectable men and women but if i were asked what really brought me here for what class of people in the world my sympathy and the sympathies of my friends have been most warmly kindled i should say for such as that young woman who has just presented herself here if she asks for them she will have from us food and clothes and the use of our baths and readingrooms whenever she chooses and i will guarantee that not one of my women friends here who come in contact with her will ask a single question as to her mode of life until she invites their confidence if you think that she is responsible for her present state you and i differif you think that one shadow of blame rests upon her we differ again and if there are any more like her in the room let them come out and they shall have all that they ask for that it is within our power to give  hear hear guvnor  thats ginger for im  out of this old white choker theres beans for you  they let him pass through on the threshold he turned and faced brooks again  at least he said i can promise you this gods blessing will never be upon your work i doubt whether you will be allowed to continue it in this christian country  brooks rose to his feet  mr deeling he said you and your mission system of work amongst the poor have been fighting a losing battle in this country for fifty years and more a christian country you call it go outside in the streets look north and south east and west look at the people look at their children look at their homes is there one shadow of improvement in this labyrinth of horrors year by year decade by decade you know in your heart that there is none therefore if new means be chosen do not condemn them too rashly your mission houses many of them have been nothing but breedingplaces for hypocrisy it is time the old order was changed now sir you are next what can we do for you  a wearylooking man with hollow eyes and nervouslytwitching fingers found himself pushed before the desk he seemed at first embarrassed and half dazed brooks waited without any sign of impatience when at last he spoke it was without the slightest trace of any cockney accent  ii beg your pardon sir i ought not perhaps to intrude here but i dont know who needs help more than i do  hes orl right sir sung out the costermonger he is a bit queer in the ead but hes a scholar and fair on his uppers speak up joe  you see my friends are willing to give me a character sir the man remarked with a ghost of a smile my name is edward owston i was clerk at a large drapery firm messrs appleby sons and dawson in st pauls churchyard for fourteen years i have a verified character from them they were obliged to cult down their staff owing to foreign competition andi have never succeededin obtaining another situation there is nothing against me sir i would have worked for fifteen shillings a week i walked the streets till my boots were worn through and my clothes hung around me like rags it was bad luck at firstafterwards it was my clothes i have been selling matches for a month it has brought me in two shillings a week  how old are you brooks asked thirtyfour sir brooks nearly dropped his pen  what he exclaimed  thirtyfour sir it is four years since i lost my situation  the mans hair was grey a little stubbly grey beard was jutting out from his chin his eyes were almost lost in deep hollows brooks felt a lump in his throat and for a moment pretended to be writing busily then he looked up  we shall give you a fresh start in life edward owston he said follow this gentleman at my left he will find you clothes and food tomorrow you will go to a cottage which belongs to us at hastings for one month afterwards if your story is true we shall find you a suitable situationif it is partially true we shall still find you something to do if it is altogether false we cannot help you for absolute truth in answering our questions is the only condition we impose the man never uttered a word he went out leaning upon the arm of one of brooks assistants another who was a doctor after a glance into the mans face followed them when he returned after about twenty minutes absence he leaned forward and whispered in brooks ear youll never have to find a situation for that poor fellow a months about all hes good for brooks looked round shocked what is itdrink he asked the doctor shook his head  not a trace of it starvation and exhaustion if i hadnt been with him just now hed have been dead before this he fainted away  brooks half closed his eyes  it is horrible he murmured  the costermonger was next brooks looked around the room and at the clock  look here he said if i sit here till tomorrow i cant possibly attend to all of you i tell you what ill do if you others will give place to those whose cases are really urgent ill be here at seven tomorrow morning till seven at night and the next day too if necessary its no good deputing any one else to tell me because however many branches we openand i hope we shall open a great manyi mean to manage this one myself and i must know you all personally now are you all agreeable  i am for one declared the costermonger moving away from before the desk i aint in no urry ive ad a bit o bad luck wi my barrer all owing to a plaguing drunken old omnibusdriver and horl i want is a bit o help towards the security josh auk wants it before hell let me out a new one tomorrows horl right for me  well i expect well manage that brooks remarked now where are the urgent cases  one by one they were elbowed forward brooks pen flew across the paper it was midnight even then before they had finished brooks and mary scott left together they were both too exhausted for words  as they crossed the street mary suddenly touched his arm  look she whispered  a girl was leaning up against the wall her face buried in her hands sobbing bitterly they both watched her for a moment it was amy hardinge  i will go and speak to her mary whispered  brooks drew her away  not one word even of advice he said let us keep to our principles the end will be surer  they turned the corner of the street above the shouting of an angry woman and the crazy song of a drunken man the girls sobs still lingered in their ears    chapter viii  mr bullsom is staggered  mr bullsom looked up from his letters with an air of satisfaction  company to dinner mrs bullsom he declared some more of your silly old directors i suppose said selina discontentedly what a nuisance they are  mr bullsom frowned  my silly old directors as you call em he answered may not be exactly up to your idea of refinement but i wouldnt call em names if i were you theyve made me one of the richest men in medchester  a lot we get out of it louise grunted discontentedly  you get as much as you deserve mr bullsom retorted besides youre so plaguing impatient you dont hear your mother talk like that  selina whispered something under her breath which mr bullsom if he heard chose to ignore  ive explained to you all before he continued that up to the end of last year weve been holding the entire propertyover a million pounds worth between five of us our times come now now look hereill listen to what youve got to sayall of you supposing ive made up my mind to launch out how do you want to do it you first mother  mrs bullsom looked worried  my dear peter she said i think were very comfortable as we are a larger household means more care and a manservant about the place is a thing i could never abide if you felt like taking sittings at mr thompsons as well as our own chapel so that we could go there when we felt we needed a change i think i should like it sometimes but it seems a waste of good money with sundays only coming once in seven days  mr bullsom shook with goodhumoured laughter  mother mother he said we shall never smarten you up shall we girls now what do you say selina  i should like a country house quite ten on fifteen miles away from here lots of horses and carriages and a house in town for the season selina declared boldly  and you louise  i should like what selina has said  mr bullsom looked a little grave  the house in london he said you shall have whether i buy it or only hire it for a few months at a time if we havent friends up there there are always the theatres and musichalls and lots going on but a country house is a bit different i thought of building a place up at nicholsons corner where the trains stop the land belongs to me and theres room for the biggest house in medchester  selina tossed her head  of course she said if we have to spend all our lives in this hateful suburb it doesnt much matter whether you stay here on build another house no one will come to see us we shall never get to know anybody  and supposing you go out into the country mr bullsom argued how do you know that you will make friends there  people must call selina answered if you subscribe to the hounds and you must get made a magistrate  we have lived here for a good many years mr bullsom said and there are very superior people living almost at our doors whom even you girls dont know to bow to  selina tossed her head  superior you call them do you a silly stuckup lot i think they form themselves into little sets and if you dont belong they treat you as though you had smallpox  the men are all pleasant enough mr bullsom remarked i meet them in the trains and in business and theyre always glad enough to pass the time o day  oh the men are all right selina answered its easy enough to know them mr wensome trod on my dress the other day and apologized as though hed torn it off my back and the next day he gave me his seat in the car i always acknowledge him and hes glad enough to come and talk but if his wifes with him she looks straight ahead as though every one else in the car were mummies  mr bullsom cut the end of a cigar thoughtfully and motioned louise to get him a light  you see your mother and i are getting on in life he said and its a great thing to ask us to settle down in a place where theres no slipping off down to the club in the evening and no chance of a friend dropping in for a chat weve got to an age when we need some one to talk to i aint going to say that a big house in the country isnt a nice thing to have and the gardens and that would be firstclass but its a big move and it aint to be decided about all in a hurry  why father theres the shooting selina exclaimed youre fond of that and men will go anywhere for really good shooting and make their wives go too if you could get a place with plenty of it and a foxcovert or two on the estate im perfectly certain we should be all right  mr bullsom looked still a little doubtful  thats all very well he said but i dont want to bribe people into my house with shooting and good cooking and nursing their blooming foxes that aint my idea of making friends  its only breaking the icejust at first selina argued afterwards im sure youd find them friendly enough   i tell you what i shall do mr bullsom said deliberately i shall consult the friend ive got coming to dinner tonight  selina smiled contemptuously  pshaw she exclaimed what do any of them know about such things  you dont know who it is mr bullsom replied mysteriously  the girls turned towards him almost simultaneously  is it mr brooks  mr bullsom nodded selina flushed with pleasure and tried to look unconscious  only the day before yesterday mr bullsom said as chairman of the committee i had the pleasure of forwarding to brooks a formal invitation to become the parliamentary candidate for the borough he writes to me by return to say that he will be here this afternoon as he wishes to see me personally  i must say he hasnt lost much time louise remarked smiling across at selina  mr bullsom grunted  i dont see how he could do much less he said after all though every one admits that hes a clever young chap and uncommonly conscientious hes not well known generally and he hasnt the position in the town or anywhere which people generally look for in a parliamentary candidate i may tell you girls and you mother that he was selected solely on my unqualified support and my casting vote  i hope mrs bullsom said that he will be properly grateful  im sure its very good of you pa selina declared affably she liked the idea of brooks owing so much to her father  theres no young man mr bullsom said whom i like so much or think so much of as mr brooks if id a son like that id be a proud man and as were here all alone just the family as it were ill go on to say this mr bullsom continued his right thumb finding its way to the armhole of his waistcoat im going to drop a hint at the first opportunity i get quite casually that whichever of you girls gets married first gets a cheque from me for one hundred thousand pounds  even selina was staggered mrs bullsom was positively frightened  mr bullsom she said peter you aint got as much as that dont tell me  i am worth today mr bullsom said solemnly at least five hundred thousand pounds  peter mrs bullsom gasped has it been come by honest  mr bullsom smiled in a superior way  i made it he answered by locking up forty thousand more than half of what i was worth for five years but i knew what i was about and so did the others mason made nearly as much as i did  selina looked at her father with a new respect he rose and brushed the ashes of his cigar from his waistcoat  now im off he declared brooks and i will be back about seven and i shall try and get him to sleep here fix yourselves up quiet and ladylike you girls goodbye mother                                      we have about an hour before dinner mr bullsom remarked sinking into his most comfortable chair and lighting a cigar just time for a comfortable chat youll smoke brooks wont you  brooks excused himself and remained standing upon the hearthrug his elbow upon the mantelpiece he hated this explanation he had to make however it was no good in beating about the bush  i am going to surprise you very much mr bullsom he began  mr bullsom took the cigar from his mouth and looked up with wideopen eyes he had been preparing graciously to wave away a torrent of thanks  i am going to surprise you very much brooks repeated i cannot accept this magnificent offer of yours i cannot express my gratitude sufficiently to you or to the committee nothing would have made me happier than to have been able to accept it but i am absolutely powerless  you dont funk it mr bullsom asked  not i the fact is there are circumstances connected with myself which make it inadvisable for me to seek any public position at present  mr bullsoms first sensations of astonishment were augmented into stupefaction he was scarcely capable of speech he found himself wondering idly how heinous a crime a man must commit to be branded ineligible  to explain this to you brooks continued i am bound to tell you something which is only known to two people in the country the marquis of arranmore is my father  mr bullsom dropped his cigar from between his fingers and it lay for a moment smouldering upon the carpet his face was a picture of blank and hopeless astonishment  god bless my soul he exclaimed faintly you mean that youyou kingston brooks the lawyer are lord arranmores son  brooks nodded  yes its not a pleasant story my father deserted my mother when i was a child and she died in his absence a few months ago lord arranmore in a leisurely sort of way thought well to find me out and after treating me as an acquaintance for some timea sort of probationary period i supposehe told me the truth that is the reason of my resigning from the firm of morrison and brooks almost as soon as the partnership deed was signed i went to see mr ascough and told him about your offer and he of course explained the position to me  butmr bullsom paused as though striving to straighten out the matter in his own mind but if you are lord arranmores son there is no secret about it is there why do you still call yourself mr brooks  mr bullsom whose powers of observation were not remarkably acute looking steadily into his visitors face saw there some signs of a certain change which others had noticed and commented upon during the last few monthsa hardening of expression and a slight contraction of the mouth for brooks had spent many sleepless nights pondering upon this new problem which had come into his life  i do not feel inclined he said quietly for many reasons to accept the olivebranch which it has pleased my father to hold out to me after all these years i have still some faint recollections of the close of my mothers lifehastened i am sure by anxiety and sorrow on his account i remember my own bringing up the loneliness of it i remember many things which lord arranmore would like me now to forget then too my father and i are as far apart as the poles he has not the least sympathy with my pursuits or the things which i find worth doing in life there are other reasons which i need not trouble you with it is sufficient that for the present i prefer to remain mr brooks and to lead my own life  butyou wont be offended but i want to understand the thing seems such a muddle to me youve given up your practicehow do you mean to live  there is an income which comes to me from the manor of kingston brooks answered settled on the eldest sons of the arranmore peerage with which my father has nothing to do this alone is comparative wealth and there are accumulations also  it dont seem natural mr bullsom said if youll excuse my saying so it dont sound like commonsense you can live on what terms you please with your father but you ought to let people know who you are great scott he added with a little chuckle what will julia and the girls say  you will understand mr bullsom brooks said hastily that i trust you to preserve my confidence in this matter i have told you because i wanted you to understand why i could not accept this invitation to contest the borough also because you were one of my best friends when i was here but you are the only person to whom i have told my secret  mr bullsom sighed it would have been such a delightful disclosure  as you wish of course he said but my it dont seem possible lord arranmores sonthe marquis of arranmore gee whiz  some day of course brooks said it must come out but i dont want it to be yet awhile if that clock is right hadnt i better be going upstairs  mr bullsom nodded  if youll come with me he said ill show you your room    chapter ix  ghosts  brooks relieved that his explanation with mr bullsom was over was sufficiently entertaining at dinnertime he sat between selina and louise and made himself agreeable to both mr bullsom for half the time was curiously abstracted and for the remainder almost boisterous every now and then he found himself staring at brooks as though at some natural curiosity his behaviour was so singular that selina commented upon it  one would think papa that you and mr brooks had been quarrelling she remarked tartly you seem quite odd tonight  mr bullsom raised his glass he had lately improved his cellar  drink your health brooks he said looking towards him we had an interesting chat but we didnt get quarrelling did we  nor are we ever likely to brooks answered smiling you know miss bullsom your father was my first client of any importance and i shant forget how glad i was to get his cheque  im very pleased that he was useful to you selina answered impressively will you tell me something that we want to know very much  certainly  are you really not coming back to medchester to live  brooks shook his head  no i am settling down in london i have found some work there i like  then are you the mr brooks who has started what the daily courier calls a whitebys charity scheme in the east end  quite true miss bullsom and your cousin is helping me  selina raised her eyebrows  dear me she said i had no idea that many had time to spare for that sort of thing had you father  many can look after herself and uncommonly well too mr bullsom answered  she comes mostly in the evening brooks explained but she is one of my most useful helpers  it must be so interesting to do good louise said artlessly after dinner mr brooks will you tell us all about it  it seems so odd that you should care so much for that sort of thing selina remarked as a rule it is the frumpy and uninteresting people who go in for visiting the poor and doing good isnt it you seem so young and sooh i dont think id better go on  please do brooks begged  well you wont think i was trying to flatter will you but i was going to say and too clever for that sort of thing  brooks smiled  perhaps he said the reason that social reform is so urgently needed in so many ways is for that very reason miss bullsomthat the wrong sort of person has been going in for it looking after the poor has meant for most people handing out bits of charity on the toastingfork of religion and that sort of thing doesnt tend to bridge over the gulf does it  toastingfork selina giggled how funny you are mr brooks  am i he answered goodhumouredly now let me hear what you have been doing since i saw you in town  selina was immediately gravenot to say scornful  doing what do you suppose there is to do here she exclaimed reproachfully weve been sitting still waiting for something to happen buthave you said anything to mr brooks yet papa  mr bullsom shook his head  havent had time he answered brooks had so much to say to me you knew all about our land company brooks of course you did a bit of conveyancing for us  of course i did brooks answered and i told you from the first that you were going to make a lot of money by it  mr bullsom glanced around the room the two maidservants were at the sideboard  guess how much  brooks shook his head  i never knew your exact share he said  its half a million mr bullsom said pulling down his waistcoat and squaring himself to the table not bad eh for a country spec  its wonderful brooks admitted i congratulate you heartily  thanks mr bullsom answered  we want papa to buy a house in the country and go to town for the season selina said so long as we can afford it i am dying to get out of medchester it is absolutely the most commercial town i have ever been in  your father should stand for parliament himself brooks suggested  it is really possible that mr bullsom being a man governed entirely by one idea at a time had never seriously contemplated the possibility of himself stepping outside the small arena of local politics it is certain at any rate that brooks words came to him as an inspiration he stared for a moment into his glassthen at brooks finally he banged the table with the flat of his hand  its an idea he exclaimed why not  why not indeed brooks answered youd be a popular candidate for the borough  im chairman of the committee mr bullsom declared ill propose myself ive taken the chair at political dinners and meetings for the last twenty years i know the runs and the people of medchester know me why not indeed mr brooks sir youre a genius  you ave given him something to think about mrs bullsom murmured amiably id be willing enough but for the late hours they never did agree with peterdid they hes always been such a one for his rest  mr bullsoms thumbs made their accustomed pilgrimage  in the service of ones country he said one should be prepared to make sacrifices the champagne amy besides one can always sleep in the morning  selina and louise exchanged glances and selina as the elder gave the project her languid approval  it would be nice for us in a way she remarked of course you would have a house in london then papa and being an mp you would get cards for us to a lot of at homes and things only i wish you were a conservative  a liberal is much more fashionable than he was brooks assured her cheerfully  fashionable i know the son of a marquis a lord himself whos a liberal and a good one mr bullsom remarked with a wink to brooks  well my dears mrs bullsom said making an effort to rise and failing at the first attempt shall we leave the gentlemen to talk about it over their wine  oh you sit down again mother selina directed  that sort of things quite oldfashioned isnt it mr brooks were going to stay with you you can smoke ann bring the cigars  mrs bullsom who was looking forward to a nap in a quiet corner of the drawingroom obeyed with resignation written large on her goodnatured somewhat flushed face but mr bullsom who wanted to revert to the subject which still fascinated him grunted  hang these new ideas he said its you theyre after mr brooks as a rule theyre off before i can get near my cigarbox  selina affected a little consciousness which she felt became her  such foolishness papa you dont believe it do you mr brooks  am i not to then he asked looking down upon her with a smile whereupon selinas consciousness became confusion  how stupid you are she murmured you can believe just what you like what are you looking at over in the corner of the room  ghosts he answered  yet very much as those images flitted at that moment through his brain so events were really shaping themselves in that bare cleanswept room into which his eyes had for a moment strayed away mary scott was there her long apron damp with soapsuds and her cheeks red with exertion for she had just come from bathing twelve youngsters who not being used to the ordeal had given trouble there were other of his helpers too a dozen of them up to their eyes in work and a long string of applicants patiently waiting their turn the right sort toothe sort from underneathpalefaced holloweyed weary yet for a moment stirred from their lethargy of suffering at the prospect of some passing relief there was a young woman hollowcheeked thin herself as a lath eager for work or chance of work for her husbandthat morning out of hospital still too delicate to face the night air and the hot room he knew shorthand could keep books typewrite a little slip about his character but that was all over and done with a bank clerk with l90 a year obliged to wear a silk hat who marries a penniless girl on his summer holiday they must live both of them and the gold passed through his fingers day by day an endless shower the magistrates had declined to sentence him but the shameand he was never strong brooks saw the card made out for that little cottage at hastings and enclosed with the railway ticket owston was picking up fast thereand smiled faintly he saw the girl on her breathless way home with the good news saw her wet face heaven turned for the first time for many a month there were men and women in the world with hearts then they were not all puppets of wood and stone even as those bank directors then too she would believe again that there might be a god  ghosts they were plentiful enough there was the skindresserhis fingers still yellow with the dye of the pith things were bad in bermondsey the master had gone bankrupt the american had filched away his trade no one could find him work he was sober enough except at holiday time and an odd saturdaya good currierthere might be a chance for him in the country but how was he to get there and in any case now how could he his wife had broken down lay at home with no disease that a hospital would take her in for sinking for want of good food worn out with hard work toiling early and late to get food for the children until her man should get a job there was the workhouse but it meant separation perhaps for ever and they were man and wife as much needed the one by the other perhaps more as their prototype in the world of plenty again brooks smiled he must have seen flitch a capital chap flitch making up that parcel in the grocery department and making an appointment for three days time and menton too the young doctor as keen on the work as brooks himself but paid for his evenings under protest overhears the addresswhy it was only a yard or two he would run back with the man and have a look at his wife he had some physiche felt sure it was just what she wanted so out into the street together and no wonder the yellowstained fingers that grasped the string of the parcel shook and the man felt an odd lump in his throat and a wave of thankfulness as he passed a flaring publichouse when halfanhour ago he had almost plunged madly in to find pluck for the riverdevils pluck the woman nothing the matter with her but what rest and good food would cure another case for that little cottage lucky there were others being made ready  what sort of ghosts mr brooks selina asked a little more sharply  he started and withdrew his eyes at last  ah miss bullsom he answered just the ghosts we all carry with us you know the ghosts of our thoughts living and dead good and evil  how funny you are mr brooks she exclaimed    chapter x  a new don quixote  brooks reached london the next evening to find himself famous the evening papers one of which he had purchased en route were one and all discussing his new charitable schemes he found himself held up at once to ridicule and contemptpraised and blamed almost in the same breath the daily gazette in an article entitled the new utopia dubbed him the don quixote of philanthropy the st jamess made other remarks scarcely so flattering he drove at once to stepney and found his headquarters besieged by a crowd which his little staff of helpers was wholly unable to cope with and halfadozen reporters waiting to snatch a word with him mary watched his entrance with a little sigh of relief  im so glad you have come she exclaimed it is hard to send these people away but do you know they have come from all parts of london neither mr flitch nor i can make them understand that we can only deal with cases in the immediate neighbourhood you must try  brooks stood up at once  i am very sorry he said if there has been any misunderstanding but i want you all to remember this it is impossible for us to deal with any cases tonight unless you are residents of the immediate neighbourhood the list of streets is on the front door please do not present yourselves before any of the desks unless you lodge or live in one of them  there was a murmur of disappointment and in the background a few growls  i hope before very long brooks continued that we shall have a great many more branches open and be able to offer help to all of you but at present we cannot make any exceptions will every one except our neighbours please help us by leaving the room  for the most part he was obeyed and then one of the reporters touched him on the shoulder  goodevening mr brooks i am representing the evening courier we should be glad to know what your ideas are as to the future of this new departure of yours and any other information you might cane to give us there are some others here i see on the same errand any exclusive information you cared to place at my disposal would be much valued and we should take especial pains to put your case fairly before the public  brooks smiled  really he said it seems as though i were on my defence  the reporter took out his pencil  well you know he said some of the established charitable institutions are rather conservative and they look upon you as an interloper and your methods as a little too broad  well brooks said if it is to be war between us and the other charitable institutions you name i am ready for it but i cannot talk to you now as you see i have an evenings work before me  when can you spare me halfanhour sir  at midnightmy rooms in jermyn street  the reporter closed his book  i dont wish to waste your time sir he answered if you are not going to say anything to the others before then i will go away  brooks nodded the reporters whispered together  may we stay and watch for a few minutes one of them asked  brooks agreed and went on with his work once more the human flotsam and jetsam worthy and unworthy laid bare the sore places in their lives sometimes with the smooth tongue of deceit sometimes with the unconscious eloquence of suffering long pent up one by one they found their way into brooks ledgers as cases to be reckoned out and solved and meanwhile nearly all of them found some immediate relief passing out into the night with footsteps a little less shuffling and hearts a little lighter the nights work was a long one it was eleven oclock before brooks left his seat with a little gesture of relief and lit a cigarette  i must go and get something to eat he said will you come miss scott  she shook her head  i have to make out a list of things we want for my department she said last night they were nearly all women here dont bother about me mr flitch will put me in an omnibus at london bridge you must see those reporters youve read the evening papers havent you  brooks nodded  yes i knew we should have opposition this isnt even the beginning of it it wont hurt us  nevertheless brooks was anxious to be properly understood and he talked for a long time with the reporter whom he found awaiting him in jermyn streeta pleasant young fellow just back from the war with the easy manner and rattling conversation of his order  you ought to call in and have a chat with the chief mr brooks he said hed be delighted to hear your views personally im sure and i believe youd convert him hes a bit oldfashioned you know that is for a subbelieves in the orthodox societies and makes a great point of not encouraging idleness  id be glad to some time brooks answered but i can tell you this if we can get the money and i havent asked for a penny yet nothing in the shape of popular opinion is going to stop us idleness and drunkenness deceit and filthymindedness and all those vices which i admit are like a pestilence amongst these people are sins which we are responsible for not them and of course we must suffer to some extent from them but weve got to grapple with them we shall be taken advantage of and grossly deceived continually i know of one or two cases already we expect itcount upon it but in the end we shall come out on the top if we are consistent the thing will right itself  you are a young man to be so interested in philanthropic work mr brooks every one seems to consider philanthropy the pursuit of the old brooks answered i dont know why i am sure  and may i ask if that is a sample of your daily correspondence he asked pointing to the table  brooks looked at the enormous pile of letters and shook his head  i have never had more than twenty letters at a time in my life he answered there seems to be almost as many thousands there it is i suppose a result of the press booming our modest little show i can scarcely feel as grateful as i should like to have another pipe will youor a cigar i think unless theres anything else youd like to ask id better begin on these  nothing more thanks the pressman answered but if i might id like to stay while you open a few there might be something interesting if youll forgive my remarking it there seem to be a good many registered letters i understood that you had not appealed to the public for subscriptions  neither have i brooks answered stretching out his hand if there is money in these it is entirely unsolicited  he plunged into a correspondence as various as it was voluminous there were letters of abuse of sympathy of friendship of remonstrance of reproof there were offers of help money advice suggestions and advertisements there were small sums of money and a few larger ones he was amused to find that a great many people addressed him as an infidelthe little mission preacher had certainly been busy and everywhere it seemed to be understood that his enterprise was an antichristian one and finally there was a long packet marked as having been delivered by hand and insidewithout a word of any sort on a single clue as to its sendera banknote for one thousand pounds  brooks passed it over to his companion who saw the amount with a little start  a thousand poundsnot even registeredin a plain envelope and you have no idea from whom it came  none whatever brooks answered  the pressman folded it up silently and passed it back he looked at the huge pile of correspondence and at brookshis dark thoughtful face suddenly lit up with a rare gleam of excitement in his own mind he was making a thumbnail sketch of these things there was material for one of those broad suggestive articles which his editor loved he wished brooks goodnight  im much obliged for all youve told me he said if you dont mind id like to drop in now and again down at stepney i believe that this is going to be rather a big thing for you  brooks smiled  so do i he answered come whenever you like  brooks sank into an easychair conscious at last of a more than ordinary exhaustion he looked at the pile of newspapers at his feet the sea of correspondence on the tablehis thoughts travelled back to the bare dusty room in stepney with its patient whitefaced crowd of men and women and children perhaps after all then he had found his lifes work here if so he need surely regret no longer his lost political opportunities yet in his heart he knew that it had been from the house of commons he had meant to force home his schemes to work outside had always seemed to him to be labouring under a disadvantage to be missing the true and best opportunity of impressing upon the lawmakers of the country their true responsibilities but of that there was no longer any hope of the house of lords he thought only with a cold shiver no political life was denied to him he must do his best for the furtherance of his work outside  he fell asleep to awake in the cold grey of the morning stiff and cramped and cold to the bone stamping up and down the room in a vigorous attempt to restore his lost circulation he noticed as he passed the corner of the table a still unopened letter addressed to him in a familiar handwriting he took it over to the window and glancing at the faintlysketched coronet on time back turned it over and broke the seal  st jamess house london  thursday  my dear brooks  i have read with an amusement which i am sure you will not fail to share the shower of condemnation approval and remonstrance which by your doings in stepney you appear to have brought down upon your head the religious element especially you seem to have set by the ears i sat within hearing of our premier bishop last night at dinner and his speculations with regard to you and your ultimate aims were so amusing that i passed without noticing it my favourite entree  you will have observed that it is your anonymity which is the weapon of which your antagonists make most use why not dissipate it and confound them a mr brooks of unknown antecedents might well be supposed capable of starting a philanthropic work for his own good the same suspicion could never fall on lord kingston ross a future marquis you will notice that i make no appeal to you from any personal motive i should suggest that we preserve our present relations without alteration but if you care to accept my suggestion i would propose that you nominate me trustee of your society and i will give as a contribution to its funds the sum of five thousand pounds  brooks looked down the long street quiet and strangely unfamiliar in the dawning light and for a moment he hesitated the letter he held in his hand crushed up into a shapeless ball it would make things very easy and thena rush of memories he swung round and sat down at his desk drawing paper and ink towards him  dear lord arranmore he wrote i am much obliged to you for the suggestion contained in your letter but i regret that its acceptance would involve the carrying out on my part of certain obligations which i am not at present prepared to undertake we will therefore if you please allow matters to remain on this footing  yours sincerely  kingston brooks  bareheaded he stole out into the street and breathed freely only when he heard it drop into the pillarbox for only he himself knew what other things went with the rejection of that offer  he crept upstairs to lie down for a while and on the way he laughed softly to himself  what a fool she would think me he muttered what a fool i am     part iii  chapter i  an aristocratic recruit  an early spring came with a rush of warm west wind sunshine and the perfume of blossoming flowers the chestnuts where out at the park fully a week before their time and already through the great waxy buds the colour of the coming rhododendrons was to be seen in sheltered corners of the park london put out its window boxes and remembered that it had after all for two short months a place amongst the beautiful cities of the world bus conductors begun to whistle and hansom cab drivers to wear a bunch of primroses in their coats kingston brooks who had just left his doctor turned into the park and mingled idly with the throng of people  for the first time for many months he suffered his thoughts to travel over a wider range than usual the doctors words had been sharp and to the point he must have instant changechange if not of scene at least of occupation scarcely to be wondered at brooks thought to himself with a faint smile when he thought of the last twelve months full to the brim of strenuous labour of ceaseless striving within a herculean task well he was in smoother waters now he might withdraw his hand for a while if necessary he had gone his way and held his own so far against all manner of onslaught just then he heard himself called by name and looking up found himself face to face with sybil caroom  mr brooks is it really you then at last  he set his teeth hard but he could not keep the unusual colour from his cheeks  it is really i lady sybil how do you do  sybil was charming in a lilaccoloured dress and hat as fresh and dainty as her own complexion she looked straight into his eyes and told him that he ought to be ashamed of himself  oh its not the least use your looking as though you were going to edge away every moment she declared laughing i am going to keep you for quite a long time and make you tell me about everything  in which case lady sybil her escort remarked goodhumouredly you will perhaps find a better use for me at some future time  how sweet of you she answered blandly do you know mr brooks mr kingston brooks lord bertram mr brooks is a very old friend and i have so many questions i want to ask him  lord bertram a slim aristocratic young man raised his hat and glanced with some interest at the other man  the mr kingston brooks of the east end lavvys friend he asked politely  brooks smiled  i am afraid he said that i am the person who is being exposedisnt that the word i warn you lady sybil that i am a questionable character  i will take the risk she answered gaily  i think you may safely do so lord bertram answered raising his hat goodmorning lady sybilmorning mr brooks  she led him towards the chairs  i am going to take the risk of your being in an extravagant frame of mind she said and make you pay for two chainsup here on the back now now first of all do you know that you look shockingly ill  i have just come fromn my doctor brooks answered he agrees with you  i am glad that you have had the sense to go to him she said tell me are you just run down on is there anything more serious the matter  nothing serious at all he answered i have had a great deal to do and no holiday during the past year so i suppose i am a little tired  you look like a ghost she said you have been overworking yourself ridiculously now will you be so good as to tell me why you have never been to see us  i have been nowhere he answered my work has claimed my undivided attention  nonsense she answered you have been living for a year within a shilling cab ride of us and you have not once even called i really wonder that i am sitting here with you as though prepared to forgive you do you know that i have written you three times asking you to come to tea  he turned a very white face upon her  wont you understand he said that i have been engrossed in a work which would admit of no distractions  you could find time to go down to medchester and make speeches for your friend mr bullsom she answered  that was different i was deeply indebted to mr bullsom and anxious to see him returned that too was work it is only pleasures which i have denied myself  that she remarked is the nicestin fact the only nice thing you have said you have changed since enton  i have been through a good deal he said wearily  she shuddered a little  dont look like that she exclaimed forgive me but you made me thinkdo you remember that night at enton when lord arranmore spoke of his work amongst the poor how the hopelessness of it began to haunt him and weigh upon him till he reached the verge of madness you had something of that look just now  he smiled faintly  believe me it was fancy he answered earnestly remember i am a little out of sorts today i am not discouraged i have no cause to be discouraged a good many of the outside public misunderstand my work and mr lavilette thinks i make money out of it then of course all the organized charities are against me but in spite of all i am able to go on and increase day by day  it is wonderful she declared i read everything in the papers about youand i get the monthly reports for of course i am a subscriberso is mother butthat brings your shameful neglect of us back into my mind i wrote to you begging to be allowed to inspect one of your branches and all i got back was a polite reply from your secretary to the effect that the general publiceven subscriberswere never allowed in any of the branches as sightseers and that all i could see was the stores and general arrangements for which he enclosed a viewcard  well brooks said you dont think that poor people who come to you for help should be exposed to the casual inspection of visitors who want to see how it is done do you i have always been very particular about that we should not allow the prince of wales in the room whilst we were dealing with applicants  well you might have written yourself or come and seen us sybil declared a little irrelevantly why couldnt i be an occasional helper  there is not the slightest reason why you should not he answered we have seventeen hundred on the books but we could always do with more especially now we are opening so many more branches but you know we should expect you to come sometimes and how would lady caroom like that she laughed  you know how much mother and i interfere with one another she answered besides i have several friends who are on your list and who are sent for now and thenedie gresham and mary forbrooke it is rough work he said but of course if you like my secretary shall put your name down and you will get a card then telling you what week to come it will be every afternoon for a week you know then you are qualified and we might send for you at any time if we were short  i should come she said  a coach passed by with its brilliant load of women in bright gowns and picture hats and two or three immaculate men they both looked up and followed it with their eyes  lord arranmore sybil exclaimed and that is the duchess of eversleigh with him on the box it doesnt seemthe same man does it  brooks smiled a little bitterly  the same man he repeated no  they were silent for a few moments then sybil turned towards him with a little impetuous movement  come she said let us talk about yourself now what are you going to do  to do he repeated vaguely why  about your health of course you admitted a few minutes ago that you had been to see your doctor  whyi suppose i must ease up a little  of course you must when will you come and dine quietly with us in berkeley square and go to the theatre  he shook his head  it is kind of you he said but  when will you come and have tea with me then  he set his teeth he had done his best  whenever you choose to ask me he answered with a sort of dogged resignation  she looked at him half curiously half tenderly  you are so much changed she murmured since those days at enton you were a boy then although you were a thoughtful onenow you are a man and when you speak like that an old man come i want the other mr brooks  he sat quite still perhaps at that moment of detachment he realized more keenly than ever the withering nature of this battle through which he had passed indeed he felt older those days at enton lay very far back yet the girl by his side made him feel as though they had been but yesterday he glanced at her covertly gracious fresh and as beautiful as the spring itself what demon of mischief had possessed her that she should with all her army of admirers her gay life her host of pleasures still single him out in this way and bring back to his memory days which he had told himself he had wholly forgotten she was not of the world of his adoption she belonged to the things which he had forsworn  the other mr brooks he murmured is dead he has been burned in the furnace of this last wonderful year that is why i thinki fear it is no use your looking for himand you would not wish to have a stranger to tea with you  that she said is ingenious but not convincing so you will please come tomorrow at four oclock i shall stay in for you  at four oclock he repeated helplessly  lady caroom waved to them from the path  sybil come here at once she exclaimed and bring mr brooks with you dear me what troublesome people you have been to find i am very glad indeed to see you again  she looked brooks in the face as she held his hand and with a little start he realized that she knew  you most quixotic of young men she exclaimed come home with us at once and explain how you dared to avoid us all this time what a ghost you look i hope it is your conscience dont pretend you cant sit with your back to the horse but get in there sir andjames the little seatand make yourself as comfortable as you can home james upon my word mr brooks you look like one of those poor people whom you have been working for in the slums if starvation was catching i should think that you had caught it you must try my muffins  sybil caught his eye and laughed  mother hasnt altered much has she she asked    chapter ii  mr lavilette interferes  what is this kingston brooks affair that lavilette has hold of now yawned a man over his evening papers that fellow will get into trouble if he doesnt mind  some new sort of charity down in the east end one of the little group of club members replied fellow has a lot of branches and tries to make em a sort of family affair he gets a pile of subscriptions and declines to publish a balancesheet lavilette seems to think theres something wrong somewhere  lavilettes such a suspicious beggar another man remarked the thing seems all right i know people who are interested in it who say its the most comprehensive and commonsense charity scheme of the day  why doesnt he pitch into lavilette then lavilettes awfully insulting brooks the other day inserted an acknowledgment in the papers of the receipt of one thousand pounds anonymous you saw what lavilette said about it  no what  oh he had a little sarcastic paragraphdeclined to believe that brooks had ever received a thousand pounds anonymouslychallenged him to give the number of the note and said plainly that he considered it a fraud theres been no reply from brooks  how do you know  this weeks verity here it is  we have received no reply from mr kingston brooks up to going to press with respect to our remark concerning the thousand pounds alleged to have been received by him from an anonymous giver we may add that we scarcely expected it yet there is another long list of acknowledgments of sums received by mr brooks this morning we are either the most credulous nation in the world or there are a good many people who dont know what to do with their money we should like to direct their attention to halfadozen excellent and most deserving charities which we can personally recommend and whose accounts will always stand the most vigorous examination  hm thats pretty strong the first speaker remarked i should think that that ought to stay the flow of subscriptions  lord arranmore who was standing on the hearthrug smoking a cigarette joined languidly in the conversation  you think that brooks ought to take some notice of lavilettes impudence then  well im afraid his not doing so looks rather fishy the first speaker remarked that thousand pounds note must have been a sort of a myth   i think not lord arranmore remarked quietly i ought to know for i sent it myself  every man straightened himself in his easychair there was a little thrill of interest  youre joking arranmore  not i ive sent him three amountsanonymously  well id no idea that sort of thing was in your line one of the men exclaimed  more it is arranmore answered personally i dont believe in charityin any modern application of it at any rate but this man brooks is a decent sort  you know who brooks is then  certainly he was my agent for a short time in medchester  mr hennibul who was one of the men sitting round doubled his copy of verity up and beat the air with it  i knew id heard the name he exclaimed why ive met him down at enton nicelooking young fellow  arranmore nodded  yes that was brooks  mr hennibuls face beamed  great scott what a haul he exclaimed why youve got old lavilette on toastyouve got him for suing damages too if this is why brooks has been hanging backjust to let him go far enoughby jove hes a smart chap  i dont fancy brooks has any idea of the sort lord arranmore answered all the same i think that lavilette must be stopped and made to climb down  curiously enough he met brooks the same afternoon in lady carooms drawingroom  this is fortunate he remarked i wished for a few minutes conversation with you  i am at your service brooks answered quietly  the room was fairly full so they moved a little on one side lord arranmore for a moment or two studied his sons face in silence  you show signs of the struggle he remarked  i have been overworked brooks answered a week or twos holiday is all i requireand that i am having as for the rest he answered looking lord arranmore in the face i am not discouraged i am not even depressed  i congratulate youupon your zeal  you are very good  i was going to speak to you lord arranmore continued concerning the paragraph in this weeks verity and these other attacks which you seem to have provoked  brooks smiled  you too he exclaimed  i also lord arranmore admitted coolly you scarcely see how it concerns me of course but in a remote sense it does  i am afraid that i am a little dense brooks remarked  i will not embarrass you with any explanation lord arranmore remarked but all the same i am going to surprise you do you know that i am very much interested in your experiment  brooks raised his eyebrows  indeed  yes i am very much interested lord arranmore repeated i should like you to understand that my views as to charity and charitable matters remain absolutely unaltered but at the same time i am anxious that you should test your schemes properly and unhampered by any pressure from outside you are all the sooner likely to grow out of conceit with them therefore let me offer you a word of advice publish your accounts and sue lavvy for a thousand pounds  brooks was silent for a moment  my own idea he said slowly was to take no notice of these attacks the offices where the financial part of our concern is managed are open to our subscribers at any time and the books are there for their inspection it is only at the branches where we do not admit visitors  you must remember lord arranmore said that these attacks have been growing steadily during the last few months it is of course no concern of mine but if they are left unanswered surely your funds must suffer  there have been no signs of it up to the present brooks answered we have large sums of money come in every day  this worst attack lord arranmore remarked only appeared in this weeks verity it is bound to have some effect  brooks shrugged his shoulders  i do not fear it he answered calmly as a matter of fact however i am going to form a council to take the management of the financial organization it is getting too large a thing for me with all my other work is there anything else you wished to say to me  the eyes of the two men met for a moment both unflinchingly perhaps they were each searching for something they could not find  there is nothing else dont let me detain you  brooks who was the leaving guest stepped quietly away and lord arranmore calmly outstayed all the other callers  your manners lady caroom told him as the last of her guests departed are simply hoydenish who told you that you might sit out all my visitors in this barefaced way  you dear lady or rather your manner he answered imperturbably it seemed to me that you were saying all the time do not desert me do not desert me and so i sat tight  an imagination like yours she declared is positively unhealthy arranmore what an idiot you are  well  oh you know all about itand one hears are you tired of your life  very very tired of it he answered isnt everybody  of course not neither are you really it is only a mood some day you will succeed in what you seem trying so hard to do and then you will be sorryand perhaps some others  if one could believe that he murmured  two months ago she continued every one was saying that you had made up your mind to end your days in the huntingfield all melton was talking about your reckless riding and your hairbreadth escapes  both shockingly exaggerated he said under his breath  perhaps but apart from the papers i have seen people who were out and who have told me that you rode with absolute recklessness simply and purely for a fall and that you deserved to break your neck a dozen times over then there was your week in paris with prince comfrere and now your supperparties are the talk of london  they are justly famed he answered gravely for you know i brought home the chef from voillards i am sorry that i cannot ask you to one  dont be ridiculous arranmore why do you do these things does it amuse you give you any satisfaction  upon my word i dont know he answered  then why do you do it  because he said slowly there is a shadow which dogs me i am always trying to escapeand it is always hard on my heels you are a woman catherine and you dont know the suffering of the most intolerable form of ennuiloneliness  and do you she asked looking at him with softening eyes  always it rode with me in the turnkey frilland sometimes perhaps it lifted my spurswhy not and at these suppers you speak of well they are all very gayit is i only who have bidden them who reap no profit for whosoever may sit there the chair at my side is always empty  you speak sadly she said and yet  yet what  to hear you talk arranmore with any real feeling about anything is always a relief she said sometimes you speak and act as though every emotion which had ever filled your life were dead as though you were indeed but the shadow of your former self even to know that you feel pain is better than to believe you void of any feeling whatever  then you may rest content he told her quietly for i can assure you that pain and i are old friends and close companions  you have so much too which should make you happywhich should keep you employed and amused she said softly  employed and amused his eyes flashed upon her with a gleam of something very much like anger it pleases you to mock me  indeed no she protested you must not say such things to me  then remember he said bitterly that sympathy from you comes always very near to mockery it is you and you alone who can unlock the door for me you show me the keybut you will not use it  a belated caller straggled in and arranmore took his leave lady caroom for the rest of the afternoon was a little absent she gave her visitors cold tea and seriously imperiled her reputation as a charming and sympathetic hostess    chapter iii  the singular behaviour of mary scott  the lookingglass was perhaps a little merciless in that clear north light but marys sigh as she looked away from it was certainly unwarranted for as a matter of fact she had improved wonderfully since her coming to london a certain angularity of figure had vanishedthe fashionable clothes which mr bullsom had insisted upon ordering for her did ample justice to her graceful curves and lithe buoyant figure the pallor of her cheeks too which she had eyed just now with so much dissatisfaction was far removed from the pallor of illhealth her mouth which had lost its discontented droop was full of pleasant suggestions of humour she was distinctly a very charming and attractive young womanand yet she turned away with a sigh she was twentyseven years old and she had been unconsciously comparing herself with a girl of eighteen  she drew down one of the blinds and set the teatray where she could sit in the shadow she was conscious of having dressed with unusual careshe had pinned a great bunch of fragrant violets in her bosom she acknowledged to herself frankly that she was anxious to appear at her best for there had come to her in the midst of her busy lifea life of strenuous endeavour mingled with many small selfdenialsa certain sense of lonelinessof insufficiencya new thing to her and hard to cope with in this great city where friends were few and last night whilst she had been thinking of it came this note from brooks asking if he might come to tea she had been ashamed of herself ever since it was maddening that she should sit waiting for his coming like a blushing schoolgirlthe colour ready enough to stream into her face at the sound of his footstep  he came at lasta surprise in more ways than one for he had abandoned the blue serge and low hat of his daily life and was attired in frock coat and silk hathis tie and collar of a new fashion even his bearing alteredat least so it seemed to her jealous observation he was certainly looking better there was colour in his pale cheeks and his eyes were bright once more with the joy of life her dark eyes took merciless note of these things and then found seeing at all a little difficult  my dear mary he exclaimed cheerfullyhe had fallen into the way of calling her mary lately this is delightful of you to be in do you know that i am really holidaymaking  well she answered smiling i imagined that you were not on your way eastwards  where can i sit may i move these he swept aside a little pile of newspapers and books and took possession of the seat which she had purposely appropriated the other chairs are so far off and you seem to have chosen a dark corner eastwards no i have been at the office all the morning and we have bought the property in poplar grove and the house in bermondsey now i have finished for the day doctors orders  if any one has earned a holiday she said quietly you have there is some cake on the table there  thanks well it was hard work at first how we stuck at it down at stepney didnt we six in the morning till twelve at night and then how we rushed ahead it seems to me that we have been doing nothing but open branches lately  i wonder she said that you have stood it so well why dont you go away altogether for a time you have such splendid helpers now  oh im enjoying myself he answered lightly and i dont care to be out of touch with it all  you enjoy contrasts she remarked i saw your name in the paper this morning as one of lady carooms guests last night  he nodded  yes lady caroom has been awfully good to me and i seem to have got to know a lot of pleasant people in an incredulously short time  you are a curious mixture she said looking at him thoughtfully  of what he asked passing his cup for some more tea  of wonderful selfdevotion she answered and a genuine and natural love of enjoyment after all you are only a boy  i fancy he remarked smiling that my years exceed yours  as a matter of fact they dont she answered but i was not thinking of years i was thinking of disposition you have set going the greatest charitable scheme of the generation and yet you are so young so very young  he laughed a little uneasily in some vague way he felt that he had displeased her  i never pretended he said that i did not enjoy life that i was not fond of its pleasures it was only while my work was insecure that i made a recluse of myself you too he said it is time that you slackened a little come take an evening off and we will dine somewhere and go to the theatre how delightful it sounded she felt a warm rush of pleasure at the thought they would want her badly at stepney but this evening she asked  yes no hang it it cant be this evening im dining with the caroomsnor tomorrow evening say thursday evening will you  something seemed suddenly to chill her momentary gush of happiness  well she said i think not just yet we have several fresh girls you knowit is a bad time to be away perhaps you will ask me later on  he laughed softly  what a funny girl you are mary youd really rather stew in that hot room i believe than go anywhere to enjoy yourself such women as you ought to be canonized you are saints even in this life what can be done for you in the next  mary bit her lip hard and she bent low over the teacups in another moment she felt that her selfcontrol must go fortunately he drifted away from the subject  very soon he said we must all have a serious talk about the future the management is getting too big for me i think there should be a council electedsomething of the sort must be done and soon  that she remarked is what mr lavilette says isnt it  he looked at her with twinkling eyes  oh you neednt think im being scared into it he answered all the same lavvys right enough no one man has the right to accept large subscriptions and not let the public into his confidence  lavilette doesnt believe in our anonymous subscriptions does he she asked  no hes rather impudent about that isnt he i suppose i ought really to set him right i should have done so before but he went about it in such an offensive manner well to go on with what i was saying you will come on the council mary  i oh surely not  you will and what is more i am going to split all the branches up into divisions and appoint superintendents and manageresses at a reasonable salary and you he concluded are going to be one of the latter  she shook her head firmly  no i must remain my own mistress  why not i want to allot to you the work where you can do most good you know more about it than any one there is no one half so suitable i want you to throw up your other work come into this altogether be my right hand and let me feel that i have one person on the council whom i can rely upon  she was silent for a moment she leaned back in her chair but even in the semiobscurity the extreme pallor of her face troubled him  you must remember too he said that the work will not be so hard as now lately you have given us too much of your time indeed i am not sure that it is not you who need a holiday more than i  she raised her eyes  this iswhat you came to say to me  yes i was anxious to get your promise  there was another short silence then she spoke in dull even tones  i must think it over you want my whole time and you want to pay me for it  yes it is only reasonable and we can afford it i should draw a salary myself if i had not a little of my own  she raised her eyes once more to his mercilessly and drew a quick little breath yes it was there written in his facethe blank utter indifference of goodfellowship it was all that he had come to ask her it was all that he would ever ask her suddenly she felt her heart throbbing in quick short beatsher cheeks burned they were aloneeven her little maid had gone out why was he so miserably indifferent she stumbled to her feet and suddenly stooping down laid her burning cheeks against his  kingston she said you are so crueland i am so lonely cant you see that i am miserable kiss me  brooks sat petrified utterly amazed at this selfyielding on the part of the last woman in this world whom he would ever have thought capable of anything of the sort  kiss meat once  he touched her lips timorously then she sprang away from him her cheeks aflame her eyes on fire her hair strangely ruffled she pointed to the door  please goquickly  he picked up his hat  but mary i  please  she stamped her foot  but  i will write you shall hear from me tomorrow but if you have any pity for me at all you will go nowthis moment  he rose and went she heard him turn the handle of the door heard his footsteps upon the stone stairs outside  she counted them idly one two three four now he was on the next landing she heard them again less distinctly always less distinctly then silence she ran to the window there he was upon the pavement now he was crossing the road on his way to the underground station she tore at her handkerchief waved it wildly for a momentand then stopped he was goneand she the hot colour came rushing painfully into her cheeks she threw herself face downwards upon the sofa    chapter iv  lord arranmore in a new role  the epochmaking nights of ones life mr hennibul remarked are few let us sit down and consider what has happened  a seat lady caroom sighed what luxury but where  my knowledge of the geography of this house mr hennibul answered has more than once been of the utmost service to me but i have never appreciated it more than at this moment accept my arm lady caroom  they made a slow circuit of the room passed through an antechamber and came out in a sort of wintergarden looking over the park lady caroom exclaimed with delight  you dear man she exclaimed of course i knew of this placeisnt it charmingbut i had no idea that we could reach it from the receptionrooms let us move our chairs over there we can sit and watch the hansoms turn into piccadilly  it shall be as you say he answered i wonder if all london is as excited tonight as the crowd we have just left  to me she murmured london seems always imperturbable stonily indifferent to good or evil i believe that on the eve of a revolution we should dine and go to the theatre choose our houses at which to spend the evening and avoid sweet champagne with the same care you and i may know that tonight england has thrown overboard a national policy yet i doubt whether either of us will sleep the less soundly  not only that he said but the government have today shown themselves possessed of a penetration and appreciation of mind for which i for one scarcely gave them credit they have made me a peer  she looked at him with an amused smile  they make judges and peers for two reasons she remarked  that lady caroom is unkind he said i can assure you that throughout my career i have never made a nuisance of myself to any one in the house i have been a model member and i have always obeyed my whip in fear and trembling at the bar i have been mildness itself the st jamess gazette speaks of my urbanity and the courtesy with which i have always conducted the most arduous crossexamination you should read the st jamess gazette lady caroom i do not know the biographical editor but it is easy to predict a future for him he has commonsense and insight the paragraph about myself touched me i have cut it out and i mean to keep it always with me  the press she said have all those things cut and dried no doubt if you made friends with that young man he would let you read your obituary notice i have a friend who has corrected the proofs of his already  hennibul smiled  my cousin avenal the police magistrate he said actually read his in the times he was bathing at jersey and was carried away by currents and picked up by a sark fishingsmack they took him to sark and he was so charmed with his surroundings and the hospitality of the people that he quite forgot to let anybody know where he was when he read his obituary notice he almost decided to remain dead he declared that it was quite impossible to live up to it  our charity nowadays she remarked always begins with the dead  let me try and awaken yours towards the living he said  she laughed  are you smitten with the brooks fever she asked  mine is a fever he answered but it has nothing to do with brooks i would try to awaken your charity on behalf of a perfectly worthy object myselfvide the st jamess gazette  and what do you need from me more than you have she asked havent you the sole possession of my society the right to bore me or make me happy perhaps presently the right to feed me  for a few minutes he answered  dont be so sure it may be an hour  i want it he said for longer  something in his tone suddenly broke through the easy lightness of their conversation she stole a swift sideglance at him and understood  come she said you and i are setting every one here a bad example this is not an occasion for teteatetes we should be doing our duty and talking a little to every one let us go back and make up for lost time  she rose to her feet but found him standing in the way for once the long humorous mouth was set fast his eyes were no longer full of the shadow of laughter his tone had a new note in it the note which a woman never fails to understand  dear lady caroom he said i was not altogether jesting  she looked him in the eyes  dear friend she answered i know that you were not and so i think that we had better go back  he detained her very gently  it is the dearest hope i have in life he said softly do not let me run the risk of being misunderstood will you be my wife  she shook her head there were tears in her eyes but her gesture was significant enough  it is impossible she said i have loved another man all my life  he offered her his arm at once  then i believe he said in a low tone in the old sayingthat a glimpse of paradise is sufficient to blind the strongest man  they passed into the receptionroom and came face to face with brooks she held out her hand  come you have no right here she declared you are not even a member of parliament he laughed  what about you  oh i am an inspiration  i dont believe he said that you realize in the least what is going to happen  i do she answered i am going to make you relieve lord hennibul and take me to have an ice  they moved off together hennibul stood looking after them for a moment then he sighed and turned slowly away  if its arranmore he said to himself why on earth doesnt he marry her  lady caroom was more silent than usual she complained of a headache and brooks persuaded her to take champagne instead of the ice  what is the matter with you tonight she asked looking at him thoughtfully you look like a boywith a dash of the bridegroom  he laughed joyously  you should read the evening papersyou would understand a little the practical effect of our new tariff bill mills in yorkshire and lancashire are being opened that have been shut down for years in medchester northampton and the bootcentres the unemployed are being swept into the factories manufacturers who have been struggling to keep their places open at all are planning extensions already the wages bill throughout the country will be the largest next week that has been paid for years travellers are off to the colonies with cases of samplesevery manufacturing centre is suddenly alive once more the terrible struggle for existence is lightened next week brooks continued with an almost boyish twinkle in his eyes i shall go down to medchester and walk through the streets where it used to make our hearts ache to see the unemployed waiting about like dumb suffering cattle it will be a holidaya glorious holiday  and yet behind it all she remarked watching him closely there is something on your mind what is it  he looked at her quickly  what an observation  wont you tell me  he shook his head  it is only one of the smallest cupboards he said the ghost will very soon be stifled  she sighed  did you see lord arranmore this evening  yes he was talking to the duke just now what of him  i have been watching him did you ever see a man look so ill  he is bored brooks answered coldly this sort of thing does not amuse him  she shook her head  he is always the same he has always that weary look he is living with absolute recklessness it cannot possibly last long  he knows the price brooks answered he lives as he chooses  i wonder she murmured sometimes i wonder whether we do not misjudge himyou and i kingston for you know we have been his judges you must not shake your head it is true you have judged him to be unworthy of a son and ii have judged him to be unworthy of a wife you dont thinkthat we could possibly have made a mistakethat underneath there is a little heart lefteaten up with pride and loneliness  i have never seen brooks answered the slightest trace of it  nor i she answered yet i knew him when he was young he was so different and annihilation is very hard isnt it supposing he were to die and we were to find out afterwards  you he said slowly must be the judge of your own actions for my part i see in him only the man who abandoned my mother who spent the money of other people in dissipation and worse than dissipation who came to england and accepted my existence after a leisurely interval as a matter of course i have never seen in any one of his actions or heard in his tone one single indication of anything save selfishness so incarnate as to have become the only moving impulse of his life if ever i could believe that he cared for me would find in me anything save a convenience i would try to forget the past if he would even express his sorrow for it show himself capable of any emotion whatsoever in connection with anything or any person save himself i would be only too thankful to escape from my ridiculous position  then they were silent for a moment each occupied with their own thoughts and lord arranmore pale and spare taller than most men there notwithstanding a recentlyacquired stoop came wearily over to them  dear me he remarked what gloomy facesand i expected to see brooks at least radiant am i intruding  dont be absurd arranmore she said kindly why dont you bring up that chair and sit down you look tired  he laugheda little hardly  i have been tired so long he said that it has become a habit brooks will you think me guilty of an impertinence i wonder i have intruded upon your concerns  brooks looked up with his eyes full of questioning that fellow lavilette arranmore continued seemed worried about your anonymous subscription i was in an evil temper yesterday afternoon and verity amused me so i wrote and confounded the fellow by explaining that it was i who sent the moneythe thousand pounds you had  you lady caroom exclaimed breathlessly  you sent me that thousand pounds brooks cried  they exchanged rapid glances a spot of colour burned in lady carooms cheeks she felt her heart quicken an unspoken prayer upon her lips  brooks too was agitated  upon my word lord arranmore remarked coldly i really dont know why my whim should so much astound you i took care to explain that i sent it without the slightest sympathy in the causemerely out of compliment to an acquaintance it was just a whim nothing more i can assure you i think that i won it at sandown or something  it was not because you were interested in this work then lady caroom asked fearfully  not in the slightest he answered that is to say sympathetically interested i am curious i will admit that no more  the colour faded from lady carooms cheeks she shivered a little and rose to her feet brooks face had hardened  we are very much obliged to you for the money he said as for lavilette i had not thought it worth while to reply to him  lord arranmore shrugged his shoulders  nor should i in your place he answered my position is a little different of course i am positively looking forward to my next weeks verity you are leaving now i see goodnight  i have kept mr brooks away from his friends she said looking at him will you see me to my carriage  he offered her his arm with courtly grace they passed down the crowded staircase together  you are looking ill philip she said softly you are not taking care of yourself  care of myself he laughed why for whom life is not exactly a playground is it  you are not making the best of it  the best do you want to mock me  it is you she whispered who stand before a lookingglass and mock yourself philip be a man your life is one long repression break through just once wont you  he sighed would you have me a hypocrite catherine  she shook her head suddenly she looked up at him  philip will you promise me this if ever your impulse should comeif you should feel the desire to speak to act once more as a man from your heartyou will not stifle it promise me that he looked at her with a faint tired smile yes i promise he answered    chapter v  lady sybil lends a hand  brooks glanced at the card which was brought in to him at first carelessly enough afterwards with mingled surprise and pleasure  here is some one he said to mary scott whom i should like you to meet show the young lady in he directed  some instinct seemed to tell her the truth  who is it she asked quickly i am very busy this morning  it is lady sybil caroom he answered please dont go i should like you to meet her  mary looked longingly at the door of communication which led into the further suite of offices but it was too late to think of escape sybil had already entered bringing into the room a delicious odor of violets herself almost bewilderingly beautiful she was dressed with extreme simplicity but with a delicate fastidiousness which mary at any rate was quick to appreciate her lips were slightly parted in a natural and perfectly dazzling smile she came across to brooks with outstretched hand and laughter in her eyes  confess that you are horrified she exclaimed i dont care a bit ive waited for you to take me quite long enough if you wont come now i shall go by myself  go where he exclaimed  why to one of the branchesi dont care which i can help for the rest of the day he laughed  well let me introduce you to miss scott he said turning round mary this is lady sybil caroom miss scott he continued turning to the younger girl has been my right hand since we first started if ever you do stand behind our counter it will have to be under her auspices  sybil turned courteously but with some indifference towards the girl who was standing by brooks chair in her plain black dress and white linen collar mary perhaps looked more than her years especially by the side of sybil as the eyes of the two met sybil saw that she was regarded with more than ordinary attention she saw too that mary was neither so plain nor so insignificant as she had at first imagined  i am sure you are very much to be congratulated miss scott she said mr brooks scheme is a splendid success isnt it you must be proud of your share in it  my share mary said in quiet even tones has been very small indeed mr brooks is alone responsible for it the idea was his and the organization was his we others have been no more than machines  very useful machines mary brooks said with a kind glance towards her come we mustnt any of us belittle our share in the work  mary took up some papers from the desk  i think she said that if you have no more messages for mr flitch i had better start we are very busy in stepney just now  please dont hurry brooks said we must try and manage something for lady sybil  mary looked up doubtfully  unless you ask lady sybil to look on she said i dont quite see how it is possible for her to come  lady sybil knows the conditions brooks answered she wants to have a try as a helper  mary raised her eyebrows slightly  the chief work in the morning is washing children she remarked they come to us in a perfectly filthy condition and we wash about twenty each altogether  sybil laughed  well im not at all afraid of that she declared i could do my share i rather like kiddies  the other departments mary went on all need some instruction would you think it worth while for one day if so i should be pleased to do what i can for you  sybil hesitated she glanced towards brooks  i dont want to give a lot of unnecessary trouble of course she said especially if you are busy but it might be for more than one day you have a staff of supernumerary helpers havent you whom you send for when you are busy i thought that i might be one of those  in that case mary answered i shall be very glad of course to put you in the way of it i am going to my own branch this morning at stepney will you come with me  if you are sure i shant be a nuisance sybil answered gratefully goodbye mr brooks im awfully obliged to you and will talk it all over at the henages tonight  the two girls drove off in sybils brougham mary in her quiet little hat and plain jacket seemed to her companion notwithstanding her air of refinement to be a denizen of some other world and between the two there was from the first a certain amount of restraint  do you give up your whole time to this sort of work sybil asked presently  i do now mary answered i had other employment in the morning but i gave that up last week i am a salaried official of the society from last monday  sybil stole a swift sideglance at her  do you know i think that it must be a very satisfactory sort of life she said  marys lips flickered into the faintest of smiles really  oh i mean it sybil continued of course i like going about and enjoying myself but it is hideously tiring and then after a year or two of it you begin to realize a sort of sameness things lose their flavour then you have odd times of serious thought and you know that you have just been going round and round in a circle that you have done nothing at all except made some show at enjoying yourself now that isnt very satisfactory is it  no mary answered i dont suppose it is  now you sybil continued you may be dull sometimes but i dont suppose you are and whenever you leave off and thinkwell you must always feel that your time instead of having been wasted has been well and wholesomely spent i wish i could have that feeling sometimes  despite herself mary felt that she would have to like this girl she was so pretty so natural and so deeply in earnest  there is no reason why you shouldnt is there she said more kindly than she had as yet spoken i can assure you that i very often have the blues and i dont consider mine by any means the happiest sort of life but of course one feels differently a little if one has tried to do somethingand you can if you like you know  sybils face was perfectly brilliant with smiles  you think that i can she exclaimed how nice of you i dont mind how hard it is at first i may be a little awkward but i dont think im stupid  you think this sort of work is the sort you would like best  why yes it seems so practical you know sybil declared you must be doing good even if some of the people dont deserve it i dont know about the washing but i dont mind it a bit do you think it will be a busy morning  i am sure it will mary answered a number of the people are getting to work again now since the tariff revision bill passed and they keep coming to us for clothes and boots and things i shall give you the skirts and blouses to look after as soon as the washing is over  delightful sybil exclaimed i am sure i can manage that  and on no account must you give any money to any one mary said that is most important  i will remember sybil promised  two hours later she broke in upon her mother and halfadozen callers her hat obviously put on without a lookingglass her face flushed and her hair disordered and smelling strongly of disinfectant  some tea mother please she exclaimed nodding to her visitors i have had one bun for luncheon and i am starving can you imagine what i have been doing  no one could every one tried  skating  pingpong  getting theatretickets at the theatre she waved them aside with scorn  i have washed fourteen children she declared impressively fitted at least a dozen women with blouses and skirts and three with boots besides a lot of odd things  lord arranmore set down his cup with a little shrug of the shoulders  you have joined brooks society he remarked  yes i have been down at the stepney branch all the morning and do you know were disinfected before we leave  a most necessary precaution i should think lady caroom exclaimed reaching for her vinaigrette but do go and change your things as quickly as you can  i must eat mother or starve sybil declared i have never been so hungry  a somewhat ponderous lady who was the wife of a bishop felt bound to express her disapprobation  do you really think dear she said that you are wise in encouraging a charity which is not in any way under the control of the church  oh isnt it sybil remarked im sure i didnt know but then the church hasnt anything quite like this has it mr brooks is so clever and original in all his ideas  the disapprobation of the bishops wife became even more marked  the very fact she said that the church has not thought it wise to institute a charitable scheme upon suchersweeping lines is a proof to my mind that the whole thing is a mistake as a matter of fact i happen to know that the bishop strongly disapproves of mr brooks methods  thats rather a pity isnt it sybil asked sweetly the society has done so much good and in so short a time every one admits that  i think that the opinion is very far from universal the elder lady remarked firmly there appears to be no discrimination shown whatever in the distribution of relief the deserving and the undeserving are all classed together i could not possibly approve of any charity conducted upon such lines nor i think could any good churchwoman  mr brooks thinks sybil remarked with her mouth full of cake that it is the undeserving who are in the greatest need of help  one could believe anything the bishops wife said stiffly of a man who adopted such principles as that and although i do not as a rule approve of mr lavilette or his paper i am seriously inclined to agree with him in some of his strictures upon mr brooks  sybil laughed softly  i hadnt read them she remarked mother doesnt allow the mans paper in the house do you really mean that you have it at the palace mrs endicott  the bishops wife stiffened  mr lavilette has at times done great service to the community by his exposure of frauds of all sorts especially charitable frauds she said it is possible that he may shortly add to the number  lord arranmore shook his head slowly  mr lavilette he said has also had to pay damages in one or two rather expensive libel cases and between you and me mrs endicott if our young friend brooks chose to move in the matter i am afraid mr lavilette might have to sign the largest cheque he has ever signed in his life for law costs  the bishops wife rose with an icy smile  i seem to have found my way into mr brooks headquarters she remarked lady caroom i shall hope to see you at the palace shortly  poor me sybil exclaimed as their visitor departed she only asked you mummy so as to exclude me and poor mr brooks i wish hed been here what fun we should have had  oh these etrusians lord arranmore murmured i thought that a bishop was very near heaven indeed all sanctity and charity and that a bishops wife was the concentrated essence of these thingsplus the wings  sybil laughed softly  sanctity and charity she repeated and mrs endicott oh    chapter vi  the reservation of mary scott  the two girls were travelling westwards on the outside of an omnibus in itself to sybil a most fascinating mode of progression and talking a good deal spasmodically  its really too bad of you miss scott sybil declared now today if you will come luncheon shall be served in my own room we shall be quite cosy and quiet and i promise you that you shall not see a soul except my motherwhom i want you to know  mary shook her head  dont think me unkind she said i really must not begin visiting i have only just time for a hurried lunch and then i must look in at the office and get down to bermondsey  you might just as well have that hurried lunch with me sybil declared ill send you anywhere you like afterwards in the carriage  it is very kind of you mary answered but my visiting days are over i am not a social person at all you know my role is usefulness and nothing else  you are too young to talk like that sybil said i am ten years older than you are mary reminded her you are twentyeight sybil answered i think it is beautiful of you to be so devoted to this work but i am quite sure a little change now and then is wholesome  in another ten years i may think of it mary said just now i have so much upon my hands that i dare not risk even the slightest distraction  in another ten years sybil said you will find it more difficult to enlarge your life than now i cant believe that absorption in any one thing is natural at your age  mary looked steadfastly down at the horses  we must all decide what is best for ourselves she said i have not your disposition remember  nothing in the world sybil said would convince me that it is well for any girl of your age to crowd everything out of her life except work however fine and useful the work may be now you have admitted that except for mr brooks and the people you have met in connection with his work you have no friends in london i want you to count me a friend miss scott you have been very kind to me and made everything delightfully easy why cant you let me try and repay it a little  i have only done my duty mary answered quietly i am supposed to show new helpers what to do and you have picked it up very quickly and as for the restdont think me unkind but i have no room for friendships in my life just now  i am sorry sybil answered softly for though marys tone had been cold enough she had nevertheless for a single moment lifted the curtain and sybil understood in some vague manner that there were things behind into which she had no right to inquire  the two girls parted at trafalgar square and sybil still in love with the fresh air turned blithely westward on foot in the haymarket she came face to face with brooks  he greeted her with a delightful smile  you alone and walking he exclaimed what fortune may i come  of course she answered you know where i have come from i suppose  he glanced at her plain clothes and realized that the odour of disinfectants was stronger even than the perfume of the handful of violets which she had just bought from a woman in the street  stepney he exclaimed  quite right i had a card last evening and was there at nine oclock this morning i suppose i look a perfect wreck i was dancing at hamilton house at three oclock  he looked towards her marvelling her cheeks were prettily flushed and she walked with the delightful springiness of perfect health  i have never seen you look better he answered  and you she remarked glancing in amusement at his blue serge clothes which to tell the truth badly needed brushing what are you doing in the west end at this time in the morning  i have been to drury lane he answered with some surveyors from the county council there is a whole court there i mean to get condemned then i looked in at our new place there but there was such a howling lot of children that i was glad to get away how they hate being washed  dont they she exclaimed laughing i had the dearest naughtiest little girl this morning and do you know when i got her clean her own brothers and sisters didnt know her again im so glad ive seen you mr brooks i want to ask you something well  about miss scott shes been so good to me and i like her awfully weve just come up on the omnibus together  she has been my right hand from the very first brooks said slowly i really dont see how i could have done without her she is such a capital organizer too  i know all that sybil declared shes wonderful i dont want of course to be inquisitive she went on after a moments hesitation but she interests me so much and it was only this morning that i felt that i understood her a little bit  brooks nodded  she is a very reserved young woman he said  yes but isnt there some reason for it sybil continued eagerly i have asked her lots of times to come and see me she admits that she has no friends in london and i wanted to have her come very much you see i thought she would be sure to like mother and if she doesnt care for society we might go to the theatre or the opera a it would be a little change for her wouldnt it  i think it is very kind of you indeed brooks said  well she has always refused but i have been very persistent i just thought that she was perhaps a little shy or found it difficult to break through her retirementpeople get like that you know when they live alone so this morning i really went for her and i happened to be looking and i saw something in her face which puzzled me it stopped my asking her any more there is something underneath her quiet manner and selfdevotion she has had trouble of some sort  how do you know he asked  a girl can always tell sybil answered her selfcontrol is wonderful but she just let it slipfor a moment she has some trouble i am sure i thought perhaps you might know isnt there anything we could do i am so sorry for her  brooks was very grave and his face was curiously pale  are you quite sure he asked  certain  they walked on in silence for a few moments  you have asked me a very difficult question he said at last she has had a very unhappy sort of life her father and mother died in canadaher father shot himself and her mother died of the shock she went to live with an uncle at medchester who was good to her but his household could scarcely have been very congenial i met her thereshe was interested in charitable works then and she came to london to try and attain some sort of independence at first she had a position on a ladys magazine which took up her mornings but we have just induced her to accept a small salary and give us all her time that seems like a comprehensive sketch of her life sybil remarked thoughtfully but are you surethat you have not missed anything out  so far as i know he answered gravely there is nothing new to tell  they walked the rest of the way to berkeley square in absolute silence  you will come in to lunch she said  he looked down at his clothes  i think not he answered  we are almost certain to be alone she said you havent seen mother for a long time  he suffered himself to be persuaded and almost immediately regretted it for there were a dozen people or more round the luncheontable and he caught a glimpse of more than one frock coat further from the dead silence which followed their entrance it seemed more than probable that he himself had formed the subject of conversation  lady caroom greeted him as kindly as ever and found a place for him by her side brooks whose selfpossession seldom failed him smiled to himself as he recognized the bishop who was his visavis hennibul however from a little lower down nodded to him pleasantly and lord arranmore spoke a few words of dry greeting  your friend bullsom he remarked has soon distinguished himself he made quite a decent speech the other night on the tariff bill  he has commonsense and assurance brooks answered he ought to be a very useful man  lord hennibul leaned forward and addressed arranmore with blank surprise on his face  you dont mean to say that you read the debates in the house of commons arranmore he exclaimed  lord arranmore shrugged his shoulders  since the degeneration of english humour he remarked one must go somewhere for ones humour  i should try the house of lords then a smart young undersecretary remarked under his breath with a glance at the bishop there is more hidden humour in the unshaken gravity of the episcopal bench than in both houses of parliament put together  they take themselves so seriously sybil murmured  to our friend there the younger man continued the whole worlds a congregationand by jove here comes the text  for the bishop had deliberately cleared his throat and leaning forward addressed brooks across the table  i believe he said that i have the pleasure of speaking to mr brooksmr kingston brooks  that is my name brooks answered civilly wondering what avalanche was to be hurled upon him  would you consider a question almost a personal question from a stranger an impertinencewhen the stranger is twice your age the bishop asked  by no means brooks answered on the contrary i should be delighted to answer it if i can  these aspersions which mrerlavilette has been making so freely in his paper against your new departurei mean against the financial management of itdo you propose to answer them  well brooks said i have not altogether made up my mind perhaps your lordship would permit mesince you have mentioned the matterto ask for your advice  the bishop inclined his head this was by no means the truculent sort of young man he had expected  you are very welcome to it mr brooks he answered i should advise you most earnestly to at once justify yourselfnot to mr lavilette but to the readers of his paper whom he may have influenced by his statements one charitable institution however different its foundation or its method of working or its ultimate aims leans largely upon another mr lavilettes attack if unanswered may affect the public mind with regard to many other organizations which are grievously in need of support  if that is your opinion brooks said after a moments hesitation i will take the steps you suggest and set myself right at once  if you can do that thoroughly and clearly the bishop said you will render a service to the whole community  there should not be much difficulty brooks remarked helping himself to omelette i never appealed for subscriptions but directly they began to come in i engaged a clerk and a wellknown firm of auditors through whose bankingaccount all the money has passed they have been only too anxious to take the matter up  i am more than pleased at your decision mr brooks the bishop said genially i rejoice at it you will pardon my remarking that you seem very young to have inaugurated and to carry the whole responsibility of a work of such magnitude  the work brooks answered has largely grown of itself but i have an excellent staff of helpers  the sole responsibility though rests with you  i am arranging to evade it brooks answered i am going to adopt commercial methods and inaugurate a board of directors  the bishop hesitated  again mr brooks he said i must address a suggestion to you which might seem to require an apology you have adopted methods and expressed views with regard to your scheme which are in themselves scarcely reconcilable with the point of view with which we churchmen are bound to regard the same question but if you thought it worth while before finally arranging your board to discuss the whole subject with me it would give me the greatest pleasure to have you visit me at the palace at any time convenient to yourself  i shall consider it a great privilege brooks answered promptly and i shall not hesitate to avail myself of it  the little party broke up soon afterwards but lady caroom touched brooks upon his shoulder  come into my room for a few minutes she said i want to talk with you    chapter vii  father and son  do you know lady caroom said motioning brooks to a seat by her side that i feel very middleclass and elderly and interfering for i am going to talk to you about sybil  brooks was a little paler than usual this was one of those rare occasions when he found his emotions very hard to subdue and it had come so suddenly  after we left enton lady caroom said thoughtfully i noticed a distinct change in her the first evidences of it were in her treatment of sydney molyneux i am quite sure that she purposely precipitated matters and when he proposed refused him definitely  i do not think brooks found voice to say that she would ever have married sydney molyneux  perhaps not lady caroom admitted but at any rate before our visit to enton she was quite content to have him aroundshe was by no means eager to make up her mind definitely after we left she seemed to deliberately plan to dispose of him finally since theni am talking in confidence kingstonshe has refused t e duke of atherstone  brooks was silent his selfcontrol was being severely tested his heart was beating like a sledgehammerhe was very anxious to avoid lady carooms eyes  atherstone she said slowly is quite the most eligible bachelor in england and he is as you know a very nice unaffected boy there is only one possible inference for me as sybils mother to draw and that is that she cares or is beginning to think that she cares for some one else  some one else do you know whom brooks asked  if you do not know lady caroom answered i do not  brooks threw aside all attempt at disguise he looked across at lady caroom and his eyes were very bright  i have never believed he said that sybil would be likely to care for me i can scarcely believe it now  lady caroom hesitated  in any case she said could you ask her to marry you you must see that as things are it would be impossible  impossible he muttered impossible  of course she answered briskly you must be a man of the world enough to know that you could not ask a girl in sybils position to share a borrowed name nor would the other conditions permit of your marrying her that is why i want to talk to you  well  is there any immediate chance of your reconciliation with the marquis of arranmore  none brooks answered  well then lady caroom said there is no immediate chance of your being in a position to marry sybil dont look at me as though i were saying unkind things i am not i am only talking commonsense what is your income  about two thousand pounds but some of that half perhaps moregoes to the society  exactly it would be impossible for you to marry sybil on the whole of it or twice the whole of it  you want me then brooks said to be reconciled to my father yet youyou yourself will not trust him  i have not expressed any wish of the sort lady caroom said kindly i only wished to point out that as things are you were not in a position to ask sybil to marry you and therefore i want you to keep away from her i mean this kindly for both of you of course if sybil is absolutely in earnest if the matter has gone too far we must talk it all over again and see what is to be done but i want you to give her a chance keep away for a time your father may live for twentyfive years if your relations with him all that time continue as they are now marriage with a girl brought up like sybil would be an impossibility  brooks was silent for several moments then he looked up suddenly  has lady sybil said anything to youwhich led you to speak to me  lady caroom shook her head  no she is very young you know frankly i do not believe that she knows her own mind you have not spoken to her of course no  and you will not  i suppose brooks said that i must not think of it  you must give up thinking about her of course lady caroom said until until what  until you can ask herif ever you do ask herto marry you in your proper name  brooks set his teeth and walked up and down the little room  that he said may be never  exactly lady caroom agreed that is why i am suggesting that you do not see her so often  he stopped opposite her  does hedoes lord arranmore know anything of this  she shook her head  not from me he may have heard whispers to tell you the truth i myself have been asked questions during the last few days you have been seen about a good deal with sybil and you are rather a mystery to people that is why i felt compelled to speak he nodded i see  you must not blame me she went on softly you know kingston that i like you that i would give you sybil willingly under ordinary circumstances i dont want to speak to her if i can help it and kingston there is one thing more i must say to you it is on my mind it keeps me awake at night i think that it will make an old woman of me very soon ifif we should be wrong  there is no possibility of that he answered sadly lord arranmore is candour itself even in his selfishness  his face haunts me she murmured there is something so terribly impersonal so terribly sad about it he looks on at everything he joins in nothing they say that he gambles but he never knows whether he is winning or losing he gives entertainments that are historical and remains as cold as ice to guests whom a prince would be glad to welcome his horse won that great race the other day and he gave up his place on the stand just before the start to a little girl and never even troubled to watch the race though his winnings were enormous he bought the frivolity theatre produced this new farce and has never been seen inside the place what does it mean kingston there must be suffering behind all thisterrible suffering  it is a law of retribution brooks said coldly he has made other people suffer all his life now perhaps his turn has come he spends fortunes trying to amuse himself and cannot are we to pity him for that  i have heard of people she said looking at him intently who are too proud to show the better part of themselves who rather than court pity or even sympathy will wear a mask always will hide the good that is in them and parade the bad  you love him still he said wonderingly  kingston i do if i were a brave woman i would risk everything sometimes when i see him like a banquo at a feast with his eyes full of weariness and the mummys smile upon his lips i feel that i can keep away no longer kingston let us go to him you and i let us see if we cant tear off the mask  he shook his head  he would laugh at us  will you try  he hesitated  no but lady caroom you have no such debt of bitterness against him as i have i cannot advise youi would not dare but if there is a spark of soul left in the man such love as yours must fan it into warmth if you have the couragerisk it  brooks left without seeing sybil again and turned northward in pall mall he heard his name called from the steps of one of the great clubs he looked up and found lord arranmore leisurely descending  a word with you brooks he said coolly on a matter of business will you step inside  brooks hesitated it was beginning to rain and neither of them had umbrellas  as you will he answered i have an appointment in halfanhour  i shall not detain you ten minutes lord arranmore answered there is a comfortable strangers room here where we can chat will you have anything  nothing to drink thanks brooks answered a cigarette if you are going to smoke  lord arranmore pushed his cigarettecase across the small round table which stood between their easychairs the room was empty  you will find these tolerable i promised to be brief did i not i wished to speak for a moment upon a subject which it seems to me might require a readjustment of our financial relations  brooks looked up puzzled but made no remark  i refer to the possibility of your desiring to marry be so good as not to interrupt me i have seen you once or twice with sybil caroom and there has been a whisperbut after all that is of no consequence the name of the young lady would be no concern of mine but in case you should be contemplating anything of the sort i thought it as well that you should know what the usual family arrangements are  i am sorry brooks said but i really dont understand what you mean by family arrangements  no lord arranmore remarked softly perhaps if you would allow me to explainit is your own time which is limited you know the eldest son of our family comes in as you have been told on his twentyfirst birthday to two thousand pounds a year which income you are now in possession of on his marriage that is increased to ten thousand a year with the possession of either enton or mangohfred in the present case you could take your choice as i am perfectly indifferent which i retain that is all i wished to say i thought it best for you to understand the situation mr ascough will at any time put it into legal shape for you  you speak of thisarrangement brooks said slowly as though it were a corroboration of the settlement upon the eldest son this scarcely seems possible there can be no such provision legally  i scarcely see lord arranmore said wearily what that has to do with it the ten thousand pounds a year is of course not a legal charge upon the estates but from time immemorial it has been the amount which has been the admitted portion of the eldest son upon marriage it is no gift from me it is the income due to lord kingston of ross if you wish for any future explanation i must really refer you to mr ascough the discussion of business details is by no means a favourite occupation of mine  brooks rose to his feet his eyes were fixed steadily almost longingly upon lord arranmores his manner was not wholly free from nervousness  i am very much obliged to you lord arranmore he said i quite understand that you are making me the offer of a princely settlement out of the arranmore estates to which i have no manner of claim it is not possible for me to accept it  there was a moments silence a great clock in the corner ticked noisily a faint unusual colour stole into lord arranmores cheeks  accept it i accord you no favour i offer you no gift the allowance is i repeat one which every lord kingston has drawn upon his marriage perhaps i have spoken before it was necessary you may have had no thoughts of anything of the sort  brooks did not answer  i have noticed lord arranmore continued in measured tones an intimacy between you and lady sybil caroom which suggested the idea to me i look upon lady sybil as one of the most charming young gentlewomen of our time and admirably suited in all respects to the position of the future marchioness of arranmore i presume that as head of the family i am within my rights in so far expressing my opinion  marriage brooks said huskily is not possible for me at present  why not  i cannot accept this money from you the terms on which we are do not allow of it  there was an ominous glitter in lord arranmores eyes he too rose to his feet and remained facing brooks his hand upon the back of his chair  are you serious do you mean that  i do brooks answered lord arranmore pointed to the door  then be off he said a note of passion at last quivering in his tone leave this room at once and let me see as little of you in the future as possible if sybil cares for you god help her you are a damned obstinate young prig sir be off  brooks walked out of the club and into the street his ears tingling and his cheeks aflame the world seemed topsyturvy it was long indeed before he forgot those words which seemed to come to him winged with a wonderful and curious force    chapter viii  the advice of mr bullsom  at no time in his life was brooks conscious of so profound a feeling of dissatisfaction with regard to himself his work and his judgment as during the next few weeks his friendship with mary scott which had been a more pleasant thing than he had ever realized seemed to him to be practically at an end he had received a stinging rebuke from the one man in the world whose right to administer it he would have vigorously denied and he was forced to admit to himself that his last few weeks had been spent in a fools paradise into which he ought never to have ventured he had the feeling of having been pulled up sharply in the midst of a very delightful interludeand the whole thing seemed to him to come as a warning against any deviation whatsoever from the life which he had marked out for himself so after a day of indecision and nerveless hesitation he turned back once more to his work here at any rate he could find absorption  he formed his boardwithout figureheads wholly of workers there was scarcely a name which any one had ever heard of before he had his interview with the bishop who was shocked at his views and publicly pronounced his enterprise harmful and pauperizing and verity with the names of the board as a new weapon came for him more vehemently than ever brooks at last goaded into action sent the paper to his solicitors and went down to medchester to attend a dinner given to mr bullsom  it was at medchester that he recovered his spirits he knew the place so well that it was easy for him to gauge and appreciate the altered state of affairs there the centre of the town was swept clean at last of those throngs of wearyfaced men and youths looking for a job the factories were running full timethere seemed to his fancy to be even an added briskness in the faces and the footsteps of the hurrying crowds of people later on at the public dinner which he had come down to attend he was amply assured as to the sudden wave of prosperity which was passing over the whole country mr bullsom with an immense expanse of white shirt a white waistcoat and a scarlet camellia in his buttonhole beamed and oozed amiability upon every one brooks he grasped by both hands with a full return to his old cordiality indulgence in which he had rather avoided since he had been aware of the social gulf between them  brooks he said i owe this to you it was your suggestion and i dont think its turned out so badly eh what do you think  i think that you have found your proper sphere brooks answered smiling i cant think why you ever needed me to suggest it to you  my boy i cant either mr bullsom declared this is one of the proudest nights of my life do you know what weve done up there at westminster eh weve given this old country a new lease of life how they were all laughing at us up their sleeve eh germans and frenchmen and yankees its a horse of another colour now john bull has found out how to protect himself and brooks my boy its been mentioned tonight and im a proud man when i think of it there were others who did the showy part of the work of course the speechmaking and the billframing and all that but i was the first man to set the protection snowball rolling it wasnt much i had to say but i said it a glass of wine with you sir henry with pleasure sir  i wonder how long it will last brooks neighbour remarked cynically the manufacturers are like a lot of children with a new toy what about the colonies what are they going to say about it  we have no colonies brooks answered smiling you are only half an imperialist dont you know that they have been incorporated in the british empire  hope theyll like it his neighbour remarked sardonically plenty of glory and a good price to pay for it what licks me is that every one seems to imagine that this tariff bill is going to give the workingclasses a legup to my mind its the capitalist whos going to score by it  the capitalist manufacturer brooks answered but after all you cant under our present conditions dissociate capital and labour the benefit of one will be the benefit of the other no food stuffs are taxed you know  his neighbour grunted  pity cobdens ghost cant come and listen to the rot those fellows are talking he remarked we shall see in a dozen years how the thing works  the dinner ended with a firework of speeches and an ovation to their popular townsman and member which left mr bullsom very red in the face and a little watery about the eyes brooks and he drove off together afterwards and mr bullsom occupied the first five minutes or so of the journey with a vigorous mopping of his cheeks and forehead  a great night brooks he exclaimed faintly a night to remember dont mind admitting that im more than a bit exhausted though phew  brooks laughed and leaning forward looked out of the windows of the carriage  are we going in the right direction he asked this isnt the way to homelands  mr bullsom smiled  little surprise for you brooks he remarked we found the sort of place the girls were hankering after to let furnished and weve took it for a year we moved in a fortnight ago  do i know the house brooks asked its woton hall mr bullsom remarked impressively nice old place dare say you remember it  remember it of course i do brooks answered how do the young ladies like it  mr bullsom laid hold of the strap of the carriage the road was rough the horses were fresh and mr bullsoms head had felt steadier  well mr bullsom said youd think to hear em wed stepped straight into heaven were close to the barracks you know and im blest if half the officers havent called already they drop in to luncheon or dinner or whatevers going on in the most friendly way just as they used to you know when sir henry lived there him as took wine with me you remember lord you should hear selina on the military cant say i take to em much myself ill bet therell be one or two of them hanging about the place tonight phew  mr bullsom mopped his forehead again the carriage had turned in at the drive and he glanced towards brooks a little uneasily  do i lookas though id been going it a bit he asked since selinas got these bandbox young men hanging around shes so mighty particular  brooks leaned forward and rescued mr bullsoms tie from underneath his ear  youre all right he said reassuringly you mustnt let the girls bully you you know  mr bullsom sat bolt upright  you are quite right brooks he declared i will not but we took on the servants here as well and theyre a bit strange to me after all though im the boss ill let em know it too  a footman threw open the door and took brooks dressingcase a butler hurrying up from the background ushered them into the drawingroom mr bullsom pulled down his waistcoat and marched in whistling softly a popular tune selina and louise in elaborate evening gowns were playing bridge with two young men  selina rose and held out her hand to brooks a little languidly  so glad to see you mr brooks she declared let me introduce mr suppeton captain meyton  the two young men were good enough to acknowledge the introduction and brooks shook hands with louise selina was surveying her father with uplifted eyebrows  why father where on earth have you been she exclaimed i never saw anybody such a sight your shirt is like a rag and your collar too  never you mind me selina mr bullsom answered firmly as to where ive been you know quite well political dinners may be bad for your linen and there may be more healths drunk than is altogether wise but a member of parliament has to take things as he finds em dont let us interrupt your game brooks and i are going to have a game at billiards  one of the young men laid down his cards  cant we join you he suggested we might have a game of pool if it isnt too late  you are soon tired of bridge selina remarked reproachfully very well we will all go into the billiardroom  the men played a fourhanded game between the shots selina talked to brooks  were you surprised she asked had you heard  not a word i was astonished he answered  you hadnt seen it in the papers either most of them mentioned itin the county notes  i so seldom read the newspapers he said you like it of course  selina was bereft of words  how we ever existed in that hateful suburb she whispered under her breath and the people round here too are so sociable papa being a member makes a difference of course then the barracksisnt it delightful having them so close there is always something going on a cricket match tomorrow i believe louise and i are going to play mrs maleveyshes the colonels wife you know persuaded us into it  and your mother brooks asked a minute or two later  selina tossed her head  mother is so foolish she declared she misses the sound of the trains and she actually calls the place dead alive because she cant sit at the windows and see the tradesmens carts and her neighbours go by isnt it ridiculous  brooks hesitated  i suppose so he answered your mother can have her friends out here though it really is only a short drive to medchester  she wont have them oftener than i can help selina declared doggedly old mrs mason called the other day when captain meyton and mrs malevey were here it was most awkward but i dont know why i tell you all these things she declared abruptly somehow i always feel that you are quite an old friend  selinas languishing glance was intercepted by one of her admirers from the barracks as she had intended it to be brooks went off to play his shot and returned smiling  i am only too happy that you should feel so he declared your father was very kind to me  isnt it almost a pity that you didnt stay in medchester mr brooks selina remarked with a faint note of patronage in her tone papa is so much more influential now you know and he was always so fond of you  it is rather a pity brooks remarked with twinkling eyes one cant foresee these things you know  selina felt it time to bestow her attention elsewhere and the game soon came to an end the girls glanced at the clock and reluctantly withdrew  remember miss bullsom that we are relying upon you tomorrow the younger of the two officers remarked as he opened the door two oclock sharpbut you lunch with mrs malevey first dont you  we shant forget selina assured him graciously goodnight  the two young men left soon afterwards mr bullsom mixed himself a whiskyandsoda and stood for a few minutes on the hearthrug before retiring  youre not up to the mark brooks my boy he said kindly  brooks shrugged his shoulders i am about as usual he answered  mr bullsom set down his glass  look here brooks he said youve given me many a useful piece of advice even when you used to charge me six and eightpence for it im going to turn the tables one doesnt need to look at you twice to see that things arent going altogether as they should do with you see here are you sure that youre not cutting off your nose to spite your face eh  perhaps i am brooks answered but it is too late to draw back now  it is never too late mr bullsom declared vigorously ive no fancy for weathercocks but i havent a haporth of respect for a man who aint smart enough to own up when hes made a mistake and who isnt willing to start again on a fresh page you take my advice brooks be reconciled with your father and let em all know who you are ive seen a bit of lord arranmore and ill stake my last shilling that hes not a bad un at heart you make it up with him brooks come thats a straight tip and its a good one  brooks threw away his cigarette and held out his hand  it is very good advice mr bullsom he said under any ordinary circumstances i wish i could take it goodnight  mr bullsom grasped his hand  youre not offended my boy he asked anxiously  not i brooks answered heartily im not such an idiot  i dont want to take any liberties bullsom said and im afraid i forget sometimes who you are but thats your fault seeing that you will call yourself only mr kingston brooks when youre by rights a lord but if you were the prince of wales id still say that my advice was good forgive your father anything youve got against him and start afresh  well ill think about it brooks promised    chapter ix  a question and an answer  brooks returned to london to find the annual exodus already commenced lady caroom and sybil had left for homburg lord arranmore was yachting in the channel brooks settled down to work and found it a little wearisome  he saw nothing of mary scott whose duties now brought her seldom to the head office he began to think that she was avoiding him and there came upon him about this time a sense of loneliness to which he was sometimes subject he fought it with hard workearly and late till the colour left his cheeks and black lines bordered his eyes they pressed him to take a holiday but he steadily declined mr bullsom wrote begging him to spend a weekend at least at woton hall he refused this and all other invitations  one day he took up a newspaper which was chiefly concerned with the doings of fashionable people and lady carooms name at once caught his eye he read that her beautiful daughter lady sybil was quite the belle of homburg that the duke of atherstone was in constant attendance that an interesting announcement might at any moment be made he threw aside the paper and looked thoughtfully out into the stuffy little street where even at night the air seemed stifling and unwholesome after all was he making the best of his life he had started a great work hundreds and thousands of his fellow creatures would be the better for it so far all was well enough but personallywas this entire selfabnegation necessarywas he fulfilling his duty to himself was he not rather sacrificing his future to a prejudicean idea in any case he knew that it was too late to retract he had renounced his proper position in life it was too late for him now to claim it and there had gone with itsybil after all why should he arrogate to himself judgment the sins of his father were not his concern it was chiefly he who suffered by his present attitude yet he had chosen it deliberately he could not draw back he had cut himself off from her worldhe saw now the folly of his ever for a moment having been drawn into it it must be a chapter closed  the weeks passed on and his loneliness grew one day the opening of still another branch brought him for a moment into contact with mary scott she too was looking pale but her manner was bright even animated she seemed to feel none of the dejection which had stolen away from him the whole flavour of life her light easy laugh and cheerful conversation were like a tonic to him he remembered those days at medchester after all she was the first woman whom he had ever looked upon as a comrade whom he had ever taken out of her sex and considered singly  she spoke of his illlooks kindly and with some apprehension  i am all right he assured her but a little dull take pity on me and come out to dinner one night this week  they dined in the annex of a fashionable restaurant practically out of doorsa cool green lawn for a carpet and a fountain playing close at hand mary wore a white dinnergown gossamerlike and airy her rich brown hair was tastefully arranged her voice had never seemed to him so soft and pleasant all around was the hum of cheerful conversation a little world of people seemed to be there whose philosophy of life after all was surely the only true one where hearts were light with the joy of the moment the dinner was carefully served the wine which in his solitude he had neglected stole through his veins with a pleasant warmth brooks felt his nerves relax the light came back to his eyes and the colour to his cheeks their conversation grew brighteralmost gay they both carefully avoided all mention of their workit was a holiday the burden of his too carefully thought out life seemed to pass away brooks felt that his youth was coming to him a little late but with delicious freshness  he smoked a cigarette and sipped his coffee glancing every now and then at his companion with approving eyes for mary whose dress was so seldom a matter of moment to her chanced to look her best that night the delicate pallor of her cheeks under the rich tone of her hair seemed quite apart from any suggestion of illhealth her eyes were wonderfully full and soft a quaint pearl ornament hung by a little gold chain from her slender graceful neck a sort of dreamy content came over brooks after all why should he throw himself in despair against the gates of that other world outside which he himself had elected to dwell it was only madness for him to think of sybil while lord arranmore lived he must remain kingston brooksand for kingston brooks it seemed that even friendship with her was forbidden he could live down those memories they were far better crushed he thought of that moment in marys sittingroom that one moment of her selfbetrayal and his heart beat with an unaccustomed force why not rob her of the bitterness of that memory he looked at the white hand resting for a moment on the table so close to his and a sudden impulse came over him to snatch it up to feel his loneliness fade away for ever before the new light in her face  let us go and sit on the other side of the lawn he said leaning over towards her we can hear the music better  they found a quiet seat where the music from the main restaurant reached them curiously mingled with the jingling of cab bells from piccadilly brooks leaned over and took her hand mary he said will you marry me  she looked at him as though expecting to find in his face some vague sign of madness some clue to words which seemed to her wholly incomprehensible but he had all the appearance of being in earnest his eyes were serious his fingers had tightened over hers she drew a little away and every vestige of colour had vanished from her cheeks  marry you she exclaimed  he bent over her and he laughed softly in the darkness a mad impulse was upon him to kiss her but he resisted it  why not does it sound so dreadful  she drew her fingers away slowly but with determination  i had hoped she said that you would have spared me this  spared you he repeated i do not understand spared you  she looked at him with flashing eyes  oh i suppose i ought to thank you she said bitterly only i do not i cannot you were kinder when you joined with me and helped me to ignorethat hateful moment that was much kinder  upon my honour mary brooks declared earnestly i do not understand you i have not the least idea what you mean  she looked at him incredulously  you have asked me to marry you she said why  because i care for you  care for me does that mean that youlove me  yes  she noted very well that moments hesitation  that is not true she declared oh i know you ask me out of pitybecause you cannot forget i suppose you think it kindness i dont it is hateful  a light broke in upon him he tried once more to take her hand but she withheld it  i only half understand you mary he said earnestly but i can assure you that you are mistaken as to asking you out of pitythat is ridiculous i want you to be my wife we care for the same thingswe can help one anotherand i seem to have been very lonely lately  and you think mary said with a curious sideglance at him that i should cure your loneliness thank you i am very happy as i am please forget everything you have said and let us go  brooks was a little bewilderedand manlike a little more in earnest  for some reason or other he said you seem disinclined to take me seriously i cannot understand you mary at any rate you must answer me differently i want you to be my wife i am fond of youyou know thatand i will do my best to make you happy  thank you mary said hardly i am sorry but i must decline your offerabsolutely now let us go shall we  she would have risen but he laid his hand firmly upon her shoulder  not till i have some sort of explanation he said is it that you do not care for me mary  she turned round upon him with colour enough in her cheeks and a strange angry light burning in her eyes  you might have spared me that also she exclaimed you are determined to humiliate me to make me remember that hateful afternoon in my roomsoh i can say it if i likewhen i kissed you i knew then that sooner or later you would make up your mind that it was your duty to ask me to marry you only you might have done it by letter it would have been kinder never mind you have purged your conscience and you have got your answer now let us go  brooks looked at her for a moment amazed beside himself with wonder and selfreproach  mary he said quietly i give you my word that nothing which i have said this evening has the least connection with that afternoon i give you my word that not for a moment have i thought of it in connection with what i have said to you tonight  she looked at him steadfastly and her eyes were full of things which he could not understand  when did you make up your mindto ask me this  he pointed to the little table where they had been sitting  only a few minutes ago i confess it was an impulse i think that i realized as we sat there how dear you had grown to me maryhow dull life was without you  you say these things to me she exclaimed when all the time you love another woman  he started a little she smiled bitterly as she saw the shadow on his face  what do you mean  i mean she said deliberately that you love sybil caroom is it not true  his head drooped a little he had never asked himself even so much as this he was face to face now with all the concentrated emotions which lately had so much disturbed his life the problem which he had so sedulously avoided was forced upon him ruthlessly with almost barbaric simplicity  i do not know he answered vaguely i have never asked myself i do not wish to ask myself why do you speak of her she is not of our world the world to which i want to belong i want to forget her  you are a little mad tonight my friend mary said tomorrow you will feel differently if sybil caroom cares for you what does it matter which world she belongs to she is not the sort of girl to be bound by oldfashioned prejudices but i do not understand you at all tonight you are not yourself i think that you area little cruel cruel he repeated  her face darkened  oh it is only natural she said with a note of suppressed passion in her how tone it is just the accursed egotism of your sex what right have you to make us suffer soto ask me to marry youand sit by my side and wonder whether you care for another woman cant you see how humiliating it all is it is an insult to ask a woman to marry you to cure your loneliness to make you a home to settle your indecision it is an insult to ask a woman to marry you for any reason except that you care for her more than any other woman in the world and can tell her so trustfully eagerly please to put me in a cab at once and never speak of these things again  she was halfway across the lawn before he could stop her her head thrown back carrying herself proudly and well moving as it seemed to him with a sort of effortless dignity wholly in keeping with the vigour of her words he obeyed her literally there was nothing else for him to do his slight effort to join her in the cab she firmly repulsed holding out her hand and speaking a few cheerful words of thanks for her evenings entertainment and when the cab rolled away brooks felt lonelier than ever    chapter x  lady sybil says yes  the carriage plunged into the shadow of the pinewoods and commenced the long uphill ascent to saalburg lady caroom put down her parasol and turned towards sybil whose eyes were steadfastly fixed upon the narrow white belt of road ahead  now sybil she said for our talk  your talk sybil corrected her with a smile  im to be listener  oh it may not be so onesided after all lady caroom declared and we had better make haste or that impetuous young man of yours will come pounding after us on his motor before we know where we are what are you going to do about him sybil  i dont know  well youll have to make up your mind hes getting on my nerves you must decide one way or another  sybil sighed  hes quite the nicest young man i knowof his class she remarked  exactly lady caroom assented and though i think you will admit that i am one of the least conventional of mothers i must really say i dont think that it is exactly a comfortable thing to do to marry a man who is altogether outside ones own circle  mr brooks sybil said is quite as well bred as atherstone  he is his equal in breeding and in birth lady caroom declared you know all about him i admit she continued that it sounds like a page out of a novel but it isnt the only pity isfrom one point of viewthat it makes so little difference  you think sybil asked that he will really keep his wordthat he will not be reconciled with lord arranmore  i am sure of it my dear lady caroom answered unless a miracle happens he will continue to be mr kingston brooks for the next ten or fifteen years for lord arranmores lifetime and you know that they are a longlived race so you see the situation remains practically unaltered by what i have told you mr kingston brooks is a great favourite of mine i am very fond of him indeed but i very much doubteven if he should ask youwhether you would find your position as his wife particularly comfortable you and i sybil have no secrets from one another i wish you would tell me exactly how you feel about him  sybil smileda little ruefully  if i knewexactly she answered i should know exactly what to do but i dont you know how uninteresting our set of young men are as a rule well directly i met mr brooks at enton i felt that he was different he interested me very much then i have always wanted to do something useful to get something different into my life and he found me exactly the sort of work i wanted but he has never talked to me as though he cared particularly though i think that he does a little  it is easy to see lady caroom remarked that you are not head over ears in love  mother sybil answered do you believe that girls often do fall head over ears in love if mr brooks and i met continually and if he and his father were reconciled well i think it would be quite easy for me very soon to care for him a great deal if even now he had followed me here was with us often and showed that he was really very fond of me i think that i should soon be inclined to return itperhaps eveni dont knowto risk marrying him and giving up our ordinary life but as it is i like to think of him i should like him to be here but i am not as you say head over ears in love with him  and now about atherstone lady caroom said  well atherstone has improved a great deal sybil answered thoughtfully there are a great many things about him which i like very much he is always well dressed and fresh and nice he enjoys himself without being dissipated and he is perfectly natural he is rather boyish perhaps but then he is young he is not afraid to laugh and i like the way he enters into everything and i think i like his persistence  as his wife lady caroom said you would have immense opportunities for doing good he has a great deal of property in london besides three huge estates in somerset  that is a great consideration sybil said earnestly i shall always be thankful that i met mr brooks he made me think in a practical way about things which have always troubled me a little i should hate to seem thoughtless or ungrateful to him will you tell me something mother of course  do you think that he caresat all  i think he doesa little  enough to be reconciled with his father for my sake  no not enough for that lady caroom answered  sybil drew a little breath  i think she said that that decides me  the long ascent was over at last they pulled up before the inn in front of which the proprietor was already executing a series of low bows before they could descend there was a familiar sound from behind and a young man in a grey flannel suit and panama hat jumped from his motor and came to the carriage door  dont be awfully cross he exclaimed laughing you know you half promised to come with me this afternoon so i couldnt help having a spin out to see whether i could catch you up wont you allow me lady caroom the step is a little high  it isnt any use being cross with you sybil remarked it never seems to make any impression  i am terribly thickskimmed he answered when i dont want to understand will you ladies have some tea or come and see how the restoration is getting on  we were proposing to go and see what the german emperors idea of a roman camp was sybil answered  oh you cant shake me off now can you lady caroom he declared appealing to her well consider it an accident that you found me here if you like but it is in reality a great piece of good fortune for you  and why may i ask sybil inquired with uplifted eyebrows  oh im an authority on this placecome here nearly every day to give the director as he calls himself some hints come along lady caroom ill show you the baths and the old part of the outer wall  lady caroom very soon had enough of it she sat down upon a tree and brought out her sketchbook  give me a quarter of an hour please she begged not longer i want to be home for tea  they strolled off atherstone turning a little nervously to sybil  i say weve seen the best part of the ruins he remarked the renovations hideous lets go in the woodand ill show you a squirrels nest  sybil hesitated her thoughts for a moment were in confusion then she sighed once and turned towards the wood  i have never seen a squirrels nest she said is it far  lady caroom put her sketch away as she heard their approaching footsteps and looked up atherstones happiness was too ridiculously apparent he came straight over to her  youll give her to me wont you he exclaimed pon my word she shall be the happiest woman in england if i can make her so im perfectly certain im the happiest man  lady caroom pressed her daughters hand and they all turned to descend the hill  of course im charmed lady caroom said sybil makes me feel so elderly but i dont know what i shall do for a chaperon now  atherstone laughed  im your soninlaw he said i can take you out  sybil shook her head  no you wont she declared the only woman i have ever been really jealous of is mother she has a way of absorbing all the attention from every one when she is around im not going to have her begin with you  i feel atherstone said like the man who married a twinsaid he never tried to tell the difference you know when a pal asked him how he picked out his own wife  if you think sybil said severely that you have made any arrangements of that sort i take it all back you are going to marry me if you behave yourself  he sighed  three months is a beastly long time he said  lady caroom drove back alone the motor whizzed by her halfway down the hillsybil holding her hat with both hands her hair blowing about and her cheeks pink with pleasure she waved her hand gaily as she went by and then clutched her hat again lady caroom watched them till they were out of sight then she found herself looking steadfastly across the valley to the dark belt of pineclad hills beyond she could see nothing very clearly and there was a little choking in her throat they were both there father and son once she fancied that at last he was holding out his arms towards hershe sat up in the carriage with a little cry which was half a sob when she drove through the hotel gates it was he who stood upon the steps to welcome her    chapter xi  brooks hears the news  unchanged her first eager glance into his face told her that waxen white his lips smiled their courteous greeting upon her his tone was measured and cold as ever she set her teeth as she rose from her seat and gathered her skirts in her hand  you too a pilgrim she exclaimed i thought you preferred salt water  we had a pleasant fortnights yachting he answered then i went with hennibul to wiesbaden and i came on here to see you  have you met sybil and atherstone she asked him  yes he answered gravely  come into my room she said and i will give you some tea these young people are sure to have it on the terrace i will join you when i have got rid of some of this dust  he was alone for ten minutes at the end of that time she came out through the foldingdoors with the old smile upon her lips and the old lithesomeness in her movements he rose and watched her until she had settled down in her low chair  so sybil is going to marry atherstone  yes he really deserves it doesnt he he is a very nice boy  arranmore shrugged his shoulders  what an everlasting fool brooks is he said in a low tone  he keeps his word she answered it is a family trait with you arranmore you are all stubborn all selfwilled selfcentred selfish  thank you  you cant deny it  i wont try i suppose it is true besides i want to keep you in a good humour  do tell me why  if sybil is going to be married you cant live alone  i wont admit that but what about it do you know of a nice respectable companion  myself  she shook her head  you may be nice she answered but you certainly arent respectable  i am what you make me he answered in a low tone catherine a moment ago you accused me of stubbornness what about yourself  i  yes you you have been the one woman of my life you are free you know that there is no other man who could make you happy as i could yet you will not come to mefor the sake of an idea if i am heartless and callous an infidel an egotist whatever you choose at least i love you you need never fear me you would always be safe  she shook her head  arranmore she said this is so painful to me do let us cease to discuss it i have tried so hard to make you understand how i feel i cannot alter it is impossible  you tempt me he cried to play the hypocrite  no i do not arranmore she answered gently for there is no acting in this world which would deceive me  you do not doubt that i should make you a good husband  i believe you would she answered but i dare not try it  and this is the woman he murmured sadly who calls me stubborn  tea was brought in afterwards they walked in the gardens together the band was playing and they were surrounded on all sides by acquaintances a great personage stopped and talked to them for a while lady caroom admitted the news of sybils engagement after that every one stopped to express pleasure it was not until the young people appeared themselves and at once monopolized all attention that arranmore was able to draw his companion away into comparative solitude  do you by any chance correspond with brooks he asked her  she shook her head  no she answered i was thinking of that i should like him to know from one of us cant you write him arranmore  i could he answered but it would perhaps come better from you have you ever had any conversation with him about sybil  once she answered yes  then you can writeit will be better for you to write i should like to ask you a question if i may  yes  have you any idea whether the news will be in any way a blow to him  i think perhaps it may she admitted  arranmore was silent she watched him half eagerly hoping for some look some expression of sympathy she was disappointed his face did not relax it seemed almost to grow harder  he has only himself to blame he said slowly but for this ridiculous masquerading his chance was as good as atherstones quixoticism such as his is an expensive luxury  she shivered a little  that sounds hardhearted she said he is doing what he thinks right  then lord arranmore told her what he had told brooks himself  my son is quite a model young man he said but he is a prig he thinks too much about what is right and wrong about what is due to himself and he values his own judgment too highly however i have no right to complain for it is he who suffers not i may i dine at your table tonight i came over alone  certainly  they were interrupted a few minutes later by sybil and atherstone and a small host of their friends but in consequence of lord arranmores visit to homburg brooks a few days later received two letters the first was from lord arranmore  ritters hotel  dear mr brooks  the news which i believe lady caroom is sending you today may perhaps convince you of the folly of this masquerading i make you therefore the following offer i will leave england for at least five years on condition that you henceforth take up your proper position in society and consent to such arrangements as mr ascough and i may make in any case i was proposing to myself a somewhat extensive scheme of travel and the opportunity seems to me a good one for you to dispense with an incognito which may lead you some day into even worse complications i trust that for the sake of other people with whom you may be brought into contact you will accept the arrangement which i propose  i remain  yours faithfully  arranmore  the other letter was from lady caroom  ritters hotel  my dear mr brooks  i want to be the first to tell you of sybils engagement to the duke of atherstone which took place this afternoon he has been a very persistent suitor and he is a great favourite i think deservedly with every one he will i am sure make her very happy  i understand that you are still in london you must find this weather very oppressive take my advice and dont overwork yourself no cause in the world however good is worth the sacrifice of ones health  i hope that my news will not distress you you realized of course that your decision to remain known or rather unknown as kingston brooks made it at some time or other inevitable and i hope to see a good deal of you when we return to town and that you will always believe that i am your most sincere friend  catherine caroom  brooks laid the two letters down with a curious mixture of sensations he knew that a very short time ago he might have considered himself brokenhearted and he knew that as a matter of fact he was nothing of the sort he answered lady carooms letter first  27 jermyn street w  dear lady caroom  it was very kind of you to write to me and to send me the news of sybils engagement so promptly i wish her most heartily every happiness after all it is the most suitable thing which could have happened  you are right in your surmise after our conversation i realized quite plainly that under my present identity i could not possibly think of lady sybil except as a very charming and a very valued friend i was therefore quite prepared for the news which you have sent me  i am going for a few days golf and seabathing into devonshire so dont waste too much sympathy upon me my best regards to lady sybil just now i imagine that she is overwhelmed with good wishes but if she will add mine to the number i can assure you and her that i offer them most heartily  yours most sincerely  kingston brgoks  pshave you heard that your friend the bishop is going to bring a bill before the house of lords which is to exterminate me altogether  lady caroom sighed for a moment as she read the letter but immediately afterwards her face cleared  after all i think it is best she murmured and atherstone is such a dear    chapter xii  the prince of sinners speaks out  the bishop sat down amidst a little murmur of applause he glanced up and saw that his wife had heard his speech and he noted with satisfaction the long line of reporters for whose sake he had spoken with such deliberation and with occasional pauses he felt that his indictment of this new charitable departure had been scathing and logical he was not altogether displeased to see brooks himself in the strangers gallery that young man would be better able to understand now the mighty power of the church which he had so wantonly disregarded  but it was not the bishops speech which had filled brooks with dismay which had made his heart grow suddenly cold within him for this he had been preparedbut not for the adversary who was now upon his feet prepared to address the house at least he said to himself bitterly he might have been spared this it was lord arranmore who amidst some murmurs of surprise had risen to address the housepale composed supercilious as ever and brooks felt that what he could listen to unmoved from the bishop of beeston would be hard indeed to bear from this man  the intervention of lord arranmore so early in the debate was wholly unexpected every one was interested and those who knew him best prepared themselves for a little mild sensation the bishop smiled to himself with the satisfaction of a man who has secured a welcome but unexpected ally lord arranmores views as to charity and its dispensation were fairly well known  so every one listenedat first with curiosity afterwards with something like amazement the bishop abandoned his expression of gentle tolerance for one of manifest uneasiness it seemed scarcely credible that he heard aright for the marquis of arranmores forefinger was stretched out towards hima gesture at once relentless and scornful and the words to which he was forced to listen were not pleasant ones to hear  it is such sentiments as these the marquis of arranmore was sayingand his words came like drops of ice slow and distinctsuch sentiments as these voiced by such men as the lord bishop of beeston in such high places as this where we are now assembled which have created and nourished our criminal classes which have filled our prisons and our workhouses and in time future if his lordships theology is correct will people hell and as for the logic of it was ever the intelligence of so learned and august a body of listeners so insulted before is charity then for the deserving and the deserving only are we to put a premium upon hypocrisy to pass by on the other side from those who have fallen and who by themselves have no power to rise this is precisely his lordships proposition the one great charitable institution of our times founded upon a logical basis carried out with a devotion and a selfsacrifice beyond all praise he finds pernicious and pauperizing because forsooth the drunkard and criminals are welcome to avail themselves of it because it seeks to help those who save for such help must remain brutes themselves and a brutalizing influence to others  there was a moments deep silence to those who were watching the speaker closely and amongst them brooks was evident some sign of internal agitation yet when he spoke again his manner was if possible more selfrestrained than ever he continued in a low clear tone without any further gesture and emotion  my lords i heard a remark not intended for my ears upon my rising indicative of surprise that i should have anything to say upon such a subject as this lest my convictions and opinions should seem to you to be those of an outsider let me tell you this you are listening to one who for twelve years lived the life of this unhappy people dwelt amongst them as a policecourt missionaryone who was driven even into some measure of insanity by the horrors he saw and tasted and who recovered only by an ignominious flight into a faroff country his lordship the bishop of beeston has shown you very clearly how little he knows of the horrors which seethe beneath the brilliant life of this wonderful city he has brought it upon himself and youthat one who does know shall tell you something of the truth of these things  there was an intense and breathless silence this was an assembly amongst whom excitement was a very rare visitant but there were many there now who sat still and spellbound with eyes riveted upon the speaker to those who were personally acquainted with him a certain change in his appearance was manifest a spot of colour flared in his pale cheeks there was a light in his eyes which no one had ever seen there before after years of selfrepression of a cynicism partly artificial partly inevitable the natural man had broken out once more stung into life by time smooth platitudes of the great churchman against whom his attack was directed he was reckless of time fact that lady caroom brooks and many of his acquaintances were in the strangers gallery for the motion before the house was one to obtain legal and ecclesiastical control over all independent charities appealing to the general public for support under cover of which the church in the person of the bishop of beeston had made a solemn and deliberate attack upon brooks society brooks himself its aims and management  as the words fell deliberately yet without hesitation from his lips vivid scathing forceful there was not one there but knew that this man spoke of the things which he had felt the facts he marshalled before them were appalling but not a soul doubted them it was truth which he hurled at them truth before which the bishop sat back in his seat and felt his cheeks grow paler and his eyes more full of trouble a great deal of it they had heard before but never like thisnever had it been driven home into their conscience so that doubt or evasion was impossible and this man who was he they rubbed their eyes and wondered ninth marquis of arranmore owner of great estates dilettante sportsman cynic latterday sinneror an apostle touched with fire from heaven to open mens eyes gifted for a few brief minutes with the tongue of a saintly demosthenes those who knew him gaped like children and wondered and all the time his words stung them like drops of burning rain  this he concluded at last is the hell which burns for ever under this great city and it is such men as his lordship the bishop of beeston who can come here and speak of their agony in wellrounded periods and congratulate you and himself upon the increasing number of communicants in the east endwho stands in the marketplace of the world with stones for starving people but i who have been down amongst those fires i who know can tell you this not all the churches of christ not all the religious societies ever founded not all the combined labours of all the missionaries who ever breathed will quench or even abate those flames until they go to their labours in the name of humanity alone and free themselves utterly from all the cursed restrictions and stipulations of their pet creed starving men will mock at the mention of a god of justice men who are in torture body and soul are scarcely likely to respond to the teachings of a god of love save the bodies of this generation and the souls of the next may be within your reach  they thought then that he had finished he paused for an unusually long time when he spoke again he seemed to have wholly regained his usual composure the note of passion had passed from his tone his cheeks were once more of waxen pallor the deliberatelychosen words fell with a chill sarcasm from his lips  his lordship the bishop of beeston he said has also thought fit on the authority i presume of mr lavilette and his friends to make slighting reference to the accounts of the society in question as one of the largest subscribers to that society may i be allowed to set at rest his anxieties before many days the accounts from its very earliest days which have all the time been in the hands of an eminent firm of accountants will be placed before the general public in the meantime let me tell you this i am willing to sign every page of them i pledge my word to their absolute correctness the author of this movement has from the first according to my certain knowledge devoted a considerable part of his own income to the work if others who are in the enjoyment of a princely stipend for their religious labourshe looked hard at the bishopwere to imitate this course of action i imagine that there are a good many charitable institutions which would not now be begging for donations to keep them alive  he sat down without peroration and almost immediately afterwards left the house the first reading of the bishops bill was
