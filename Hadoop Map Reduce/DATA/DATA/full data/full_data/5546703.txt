the mystery explainedconclusion   271     introduction   my dear boys  this story is complete in itself but forms the sixth volume in a line issued under the general title of putnam hall series  as mentioned several times this line was started because many young folks wanted to know what happened at putnam hall military school previous to the arrival at that institution of the rover boys as already related in my rover boys series  to gratify this curiosity i wrote the first volume of this series called the putnam hall cadets showing how captain putnam organized his famous school and how it was jack ruddy and pepper ditmore came to be among his first pupils  in the second book entitled the putnam hall rivals i gave the particulars of several contests on the field of sports and also told about a thrilling balloon ride and of an odd discovery in the woods  following the second book came a third the putnam hall champions with more bitterlycontested games in one of which young major ruddys enemies played him a foul trick  from the opening of the school there had been dissatisfaction with one of the teachers and when another was engaged who proved to be a man of peculiar whims the boys went into open revolt as related in another volume called the putnam hall rebellion the cadets literally ran away and did not return to the hall until captain putnam came upon the scene to straighten matters out  the rebellion was followed by a grand outing as related in the putnam hall encampment the cadets marched far away from the school to the shore of a beautiful lake and there our heroes managed to have a good time in spite of the mean work of several of their enemies  in the present volume are related the particulars of a most puzzling mystery which at one time threatened to bring disaster to the whole school how the mystery was at last solved i leave for the pages which follow to explain  again i thank both young and old for all the nice things they have said about my books i hope the reading of the volumes affords all both pleasure and profit            affectionately and sincerely yours                                    edward stratemeyer     the mystery at putnam hall     chapter i  an encounter on the road   here we are again as the clown says in the circus  right you are pepper and ill be glad to get back to putnam hall once more responded major jack ruddy as he followed his chum from the lake steamer to the cedarville dock  hello there is andy cried pepper ditmore as he caught sight of a familiar face in the crowd of cadets andy where have you been why didnt you come on the boat with us  i got in last night answered andy snow how are you anyway and he shook hands cordially  oh im as fine as a newtooth comb answered pepper ditmore with a grin ready for study and fun  especially fun ill wager how about it jack  oh pepper usually manages to get his share came from the young major of the putnam hall battalion but andy did you hi look where you are going will you ritter cried jack rather angrily  a tall youth carrying a big dresssuit case had forced his way through the crowd hitting jack in the knee with his baggage  what do you want to block the way for demanded reff ritter sourly think you own the dock  ive got as much right here ritter as you have retorted the young major sharply dont you knock me again like that  i willif you get in my way  if you do youll take the consequences  bah dont you try to dictate to me jack ruddy growled reff ritter you got the best of me last term but youll not get the best of me this term ill tell you that  phew ritter is somewhat peppery whispered andy snow  i guess i know the reason came from a student named dale blackmore  what is it  ill tell you latertoo much of a crowd here rejoined dale  about twenty cadets all bound for putnam hall military academy had arrived on the boat from ithaca and these along with some others who had come down to the dock to see the boat come in gathered around jack ruddy and reff ritter to see the outcome of the unexpected encounter  jack ruddy had good cause to consider reff ritter his enemy but he had hoped that during the term now opening at the school the bully of putnam hall would keep his distance  i am not trying to dictate to you ritter answered jack as calmly as he could but i dont propose to let you hit me with your suitcase  huh it was an accident growled reff  oh come on reff put in gus coulter the bullys close crony let us get good seats in the carryall  thats the talk let us get in before the others take the seats came from nick paxton another crony  he pushed ahead and his elbow caught pepper ditmore directly in the ribs  not quite so swift paxton cried pepper and he gave the cadet a quick shove backwards paxton bumped into reff ritter lost his footing and fell over the dresssuit case in the bullys hand  hurrah one down cried andy snow how many yards to gain for a touchdown nick  what do you mean by knocking me down roared nick paxton as he scrambled to his feet ill not stand for it  then sit down again answered pepper merrily and next time keep your elbow out of my ribs he added come on we dont want to get left he added to his chums  a bolt was made by many of the cadets for the putnam hall carryall and soon a crowd was inside and on the front seat talking joking and cheering as suited the mood of each individual jack pepper andy and dale managed to crowd inside throwing their suitcases on the top gus coulter got in also but when he saw that reff ritter and nick paxton had been left he scrambled out again and his place was taken by fred century another student  hello peleg old sport cried pepper gaily to the driver of the turnout how have you been for the past fifty years  oh im very well thank you responded peleg snuggers  heard you had a fortune left to you went on pepper with a wink at his chums old uncle died and left you half a million  threequarters of a million put in andy snow scenting fun all in gold too  isnt that fine said jack peleg how about lending me ten or fifteen dollars  i could use a fivespot myself added dale  id like to borrow about fifty for a new bicycle came from fred century  dont be modest about lending us the cash went on pepper just hand it out as if you had always had it  i aint had no fortune left to me burst out the general utility man desperately who said i had  why everybody knows it peleg responded pepper come dont be modest about it was it really threequarters of a million  maybe it was more suggested jack  if i were you peleg id not carry so much around in my pockets said dale  i aint had a cent left to me shouted the driver of the carryall this is some of your jokes an i want you to stop it oh dear now the schools opened agin i suppose there wont be no rest fer nobuddy and he heaved a mountainous sigh  oh peleg dont be angry with me murmured pepper with a trace of tears in his voice if you get angry ill die  you behave yourself pepper ditmore or i wont drive you to the hall  peleg dont you want me to drive asked andy who was on the front seat im a crackerjack at driving  not much dont you tech them hosses shouted the general utility man in alarm that off hoss is a new one an hes mighty skittish i can tell you this mornin when i was hookin him up he nigh kicked the leg off o me  say how are we going to get to the hall came in ugly tones from reff ritter he with six other boys was standing beside the carryall  captain putnam said hed send down some carriages answered peleg snuggers there they come now and he pointed to the turnouts  pshaw i wanted to go in the carryall grumbled ritter  so did i added gus coulter  well this is full so youll have to take the carriages answered peleg snuggers everybody hold fast he shouted as he took up the reins  we are off shouted pepper gaily farewell to cedarville and ho for putnam hall  wish i had room id turn a handspring for you came from andy who was quite an acrobat  now dont you cut up any monkeyshines pleaded the driver of the carryall that new hoss wont stand for em  all right peleg ill keep as quiet as a lamb without a tail  why is a lamb without a tail quiet asked fred century quickly  give it up fred why  because he has no tale to tell  wow  what a joke  throw him out  give him some cotton to eat  say do keep quiet pleaded peleg snuggers as the boys in the carryall commenced to push fred from one seat to another want these hosses to ran away with you  better draw it mild suggested major jack we dont want any accident on the way to the hall he looked back at the crowd left on the dock has anybody seen bert field he asked  yes i saw him last week answered a student named paul singleton hell be here tomorrow  how about emerald asked pepper  coming tonight answered andy he went to ireland this summer and his brogue is worse than ever  never mind emerald is a good fellow said major jack his heart is as big as a barrel  say but wasnt reff ritter mad came from dale  oh he makes me tired answered pepper after all that happened last term wouldnt you think hed behave himself better  it isnt in him to behave himself answered fred century he is a bully and always will be  well he has got to keep his distance this term said major jack with a firm look on his face i am not going to stand for what i have in the past  nor i added pepper if he doesnt keep his distance hell suffer for it  the carryall was now leaving the little village of cedarville soon it came out on a country road that ran in the direction of putnam hall  it was an ideal day in early september and the cadets returning to the school were in high spirits one started to sing and the others joined in  hello there goes the pornell academy stage cried pepper presently  and there are some fellows we know returned jack as the turnout belonging to a rival school came closer roy bock and bat sedley  ill bet they are sore over what happened last june cried pepper  it was their own fault that they suffered came from andy  look out sang out dale and dodged down in the carryall  spat a halfdecayed apple struck the side of the turnout spat came one through the open window then the skin of a banana followed landing in jacks lap  stop that bock  dont throw things in here sedley  something to remember us by shouted roy bock the bully of pornell academy and he threw another soft apple into the carryall it landed on peppers arm leaving quite a mess there  all right if thats your game cried pepper and feeling in his pocket he brought forth an orange he had purchased on the boat taking careful aim he let fly with all force the orange landed fairly and squarely on roy bocks nose  ouch roared roy bock and clapped his hand to his nose which began to bleed  heres something for you sedley cried andy and sent a handful of peanut shells into the pornell students face  ill fix you fellows roared roy bock in a rage and catching up a heavy book that was on the seat beside him he started to throw the volume at jack and pepper  but the volume slipped and went sailing in the air in another direction catching poor peleg snuggers on the cheek the driver of the carryall was so startled that he let go the reins and fell from his seat into the dust of the road  as the reins dropped at their heels one of the horsesthe new onethrew up his head in sudden fright then he made a mad lunge forward dragging his mate with him the carryall gave a lurch and a bound that sent the occupants flying into each others laps  stop the team was the cry  the horses are running away     chapter ii  the cadets of putnam hall   it was true the team was running away one of the horses was a spirited animal and he now had the bit in his teeth the boys in the rear of the turnout looked back to see peleg snuggers still lying in the highway the stage belonging to pornell academy had turned down a side road  cant you stop them andy asked jack ruddy  i dont see how was the answer from the youth on the front seat i cant get hold of the lines  we must stop em somehow cried fred century otherwise well have a smashup sure  whoa whoa yelled half a dozen but these cries only served to scare the team more and away they shot along the country road sending the carryall swaying from side to side  look look yelled andy suddenly the regular road is shut off they are repairing it  the boys gazed ahead and saw that some wooden horses and planking had been placed across the highway this side of the barrier some bars had been taken from a fence so that those using the road might drive around through an orchard belonging to a farmer named darrison  we are going to strike those planks cried dale blackmore  maybe the team will try to jump them came from fred  if they do theyll smash the carryall sure answered pepper perhaps we had better drop out at the rear  look out sang out somebody and just then the carryall left the highway and turned into the orchard then came a scraping as the top of the turnout hit the lowhanging branches of some apple trees  whoa stop that wagon yelled a mans voice and amos darrison appeared from among the trees he made a leap for the team but they swerved to one side then came a crash as one of the wheels caught in a stump over went the carryall with the boys in it andy quick to act used his acrobatic abilities by leaping into the branches of a nearby tree then the farmer caught the team and stopped them  anybody hurt was peppers question as he crawled out of the wreck  im all right answered fred  i got a twisted ankle thats all came from dale as he limped out  look at jack cried several hes hurt  all looked and saw the young major of the school battalion lying flat on his back in the front of the carryall he had a nasty cut on the temple and his eyes were closed  he is dead murmured pepper hoarsely  oh dont say that said andy in sudden terror he had just dropped to the ground  if he aint dead hes putty badly hurted said the farmer who owned the orchard  pepper caught his chum in his arms and brought him out and laid him on the grass  he is still breathing he cried get some water and well bathe his face maybe that will bring him around  ill get the water exclaimed dale and ran towards a well located at the side of the orchard  to those who have read the other volumes in this putnam hall series the lads already mentioned will need no special introduction for the benefit of others let me state that jack ruddy and pepper ditmore were close chums living when at home in the western part of new york state jack was slightly the older of the two and was of rather a serious turn of mind pepper was full of fun and on that account was frequently called the imp  as related in my first volume entitled the putnam hall cadets the lads left home to become cadets at a new institution of learning located on cayuga lake this new school was presided over by captain victor putnam a retired army officer who had modeled his institution somewhat after the famous military academy at west point it was a large school ideally located on the shore of the lake and had attached to it a gymnasium a boathouse and several other buildings on the lower floor of the main building were the classrooms the messhall and the offices and upstairs were the dormitories  arriving at the school jack and pepper soon made a host of friends including the acrobatic andy snow dale blackmore who was a great football player paul singleton who was usually called stuffer because of his constant desire to eat joseph hogan commonly addressed as emerald because of his irish blood and joe nelson who was one of the best scholars the school ever had they also made some enemies the greatest of them being reff ritter the big bully and gus coulter and nick paxton his cronies  not long after the students learned how to drill and to march they were allowed to ballot for officers a bitter contest was waged which resulted in jack being chosen major of the hall battalion a bully named dan baxter had wanted to be major and he bribed gus coulter and some others to vote for him but without avail it may be added here that baxter was now away on a vacation but had written that he was going to return to the school before long  during their first term at putnam hall the chums had several adventures not the least of which was one in the woods where they rescued george strong one of the teachers from two of his relatives who were insane  mr strongs ancestry dated back to the revolution and he told the cadets about a family treasure buried in the vicinity of the lake how the boys went in search of the treasure and how they had numerous other adventures was related in the second volume of this series called the putnam hall rivals  with the coming of the next summer the thoughts of the students turned to various sports and in the third volume the putnam hall champions i told how the chums entered several contests both on land and on the lake and won out at that time fred century was a pupil at pornell academy but fred became so disgusted at the actions of roy bock bat sedley and some others that he quit the rival institution of learning and came to putnam hall where he was given a warm welcome  the encounters that jack and his chums had with reff ritter and his cronies were numerous and more than once ritter did his best to get the young major into serious trouble once he drugged jack with some french headache powders and when he was exposed captain putnam would have expelled him had not jack very generously asked that he be given another chance for this any ordinary youth would have been grateful but gratitude did not appear to be a part of reff ritters makeup and he soon showed himself to be as mean as ever  for some time matters ran along smoothly at putnam hall but then came trouble of an entirely new kind once during the absence of captain putnam and george strong the school was left in charge of two other teachersjosiah crabtree and pluxton cuddle crabtree was dictatorial to a degree and cuddle was a man of queer ideas one being that boys ate entirely too much  as told in the volume called the putnam rebellion the two teachers sought to subdue the boys by starving them and locking them in their dormitories they rebelled left the school by stealth and marched away to camp in the woods there the rebels split up one party under major jack and the other under ritter at last captain putnam put in an appearance and major jack explained matters as a consequence the cadets went back to the hall and then josiah crabtree and pluxton were called on to explain crabtree was retained after a stern lecture from the master of the school but cuddle was discharged  it was captain putnams custom to take his students out once or twice a year to what was called an encampmentthe lads marching to some spot where they could pitch their tents and go in for a touch of real army life with target shooting sham battles and the like in the next volume of the series called the putnam hall encampment i told how the cadets left the hall and marched to a distant lake their camping outfit was sent ahead by wagons but the wagons got lost and were finally found in the possession of roy bock and some other students of pornell they having made off with them while the drivers were in a roadhouse obtaining refreshments for this trick pepper and some of the others got after the pornellites and made them prisoners in a cave from which they could escape only by going out a back way through some water and mud and thorny bushes  while they were playing a certain trick in cedarville jack and pepper fell in with a youth named bert field he was a queer lad but did the chums a good turn and in return they promised to help him he was trying to locate a certain old man who was defrauding him out of some property the old man was discovered during a visit to a mysterious mill said to be haunted and by the chums aid bert field got what was coming to him it was thought best to send bert to school and he said he wanted to go to putnam hall  well be glad to have him with us said jack and so it was settled  following the encampment had come the regular summer vacation and the cadets had scattered far and wide jack and pepper going for a cruise around the great lakes and andy and dale going to asbury park and atlantic city reff ritter had started for a summer in the adirondacks but unexpected word from home of which more will be said later had caused him to give up the outing     chapter iii  something about a runaway   while dale and andy ran off to get the water the other boys gathered around jack the young major still lay with his eyes closed breathing faintly  he got a bad crack on the head remarked fred century  he certainly did whispered another cadet if he doesnt come around what shall we do  how did the team happen to run away questioned amos darrison  some fellows from pornell academy threw things at us explained pepper well have an account to settle with em for this he added grimly  wonder how poor snuggers made out  here he comes now was the answer and looking back toward the highway the cadets saw the driver of the carryall approaching on a swift limp  did ye stop em he gasped oh dear what a bustup but it wasnt my faultyou boys can prove that cant ye  we can peleg answered pepper much hurt  i got a nasty twist to my back when i tumbled say whats the matter with major ruddy and the general utility man forgot his own pains as he gazed at the motionless form of jack  the cadets told him and in the midst of the explanation dale and andy came back with a bucket of water and a tin dipper the majors face was bathed and a little water was put into his mouth and with a gulp he opened his eyes and stared around him  oh my head he murmured who hit me  you were in the carryall smashup jack answered pepper you got a bad one on the head  oh yes i remember now jack sat up and placed his hand to his forehead bloody eh say that was a crack all right  its lucky you werent killed said andy  better take it easy for a while advised dale maybe we had better get a doctor  oh i guess ill be all right after a bit dale answered the young major who had a horror of being placed on the sick list the knocking around stunned me thats all  let me tie a handkerchief over that cut said pepper  here ive got some courtplaster said fred producing a little package let us bind it up with that  this was done and after he had had a drink of water jack said he felt much better but when he got up on his feet he was rather shaky in the knees  ii dont think i can walk to the hall he said with a faint smile  well get a carriage answered pepper maybe mr darrison will let us have one well pay for it of course he went on knowing that the old farmer was a close person  ill let you have my threeseated carriage and a team if you want them answered amos darrison but it will cost you two dollars i cant afford to let you have em for nothing because im a poor man and taxes are heavy and so many things wanted on the farm and my wife wants  never mind well pay the two dollars interrupted pepper everybody who rides can chip in he added to the surrounding cadets  while the lads were waiting for the farmer to hook up his horses some of them and peleg snuggers examined the carryall a wheel had come off and the glass had been broken but otherwise the turnout had suffered but little  i am glad it is no worse said andy id hate to see that old carryall put out of business ive had so many nice rides in it  the axle will have to be mended before we can use it again announced peleg snuggers well have to leave it here until the wheelwright can come fer it ill take the hosses back to the school  look out that they dont run away with you warned pepper  let me ride one of them cried the acrobatic andy give me the new one ill wager he wont get away from me  youll break your neck answered the carryall driver  not at all peleg let me do it im used to horses pleaded andy  now if the truth must be told peleg snuggers did not relish taking the runaway team back to the school alone he was a little afraid of the new horse remembering how he had been kicked in the morning  well if you want to go ill let ye he said at last but remember taint my fault if ye come back killed  dont you worry no horse will ever get the best of me answered andy  a little later amos darrison brought out his threeseated carriage and all of the cadets but andy got in the baggage was left behind the farmer promising to deliver it by wagon  see you later cried pepper to andy be careful  dont worry well get there before you do answered andy  two blankets were arranged as saddles on the runaway teams backs and a few minutes later andy and peleg snuggers started after the carriage  let us catch up to them cried the acrobatic youth and urged his steed forward on a gallop  be careful i tell you cried the general utility man be careful hell run away with you  but andy was too lighthearted to pay heed to the warning and soon he was well in advance of his companion then he sighted the carriage in the distance and urged his horse to greater efforts  whoopla here we come he yelled and set up a great shouting  its andy cried pepper my but he is riding some  he always was a good one on horseback said fred  he wants to be careful that horse is an ugly one came from jack i heard a man at the dock say he wouldnt own the beast at any price  soon andy ranged up beside the carriage  youre too slow for me he sang out merrily ill have to go ahead and tell captain putnam you are coming  he slapped the horse on the neck hardly had he done so when up came the animals hind hoofs almost unseating him then the horse made a mad leap forward and started down the highway at top speed  my see him go  he is running away  andy look out for yourself  if he throws you hell kill you  so the cries rang out from the carriage as horse and rider sped over the highway leading to putnam hall  andy paid no attention to what was said of a sudden he had his hands full trying to keep on the horses back the steed was galloping along with a peculiar motion  whoa whoa jim yelled andy but jim paid no attention he was off for a run and did not care what happened  the blanket had not been securely fastened and before long it commenced to slip towards the horses tail andy tried to haul it back his efforts were but partly successful and with an end of the blanket trailing around one of his hind legs the steed became more unmanageable than ever  on and on went horse and rider until in the distance putnam hall loomed up on one side of the highway were the woods lining the lake shore on the other the broad campus leading to the school and other buildings  hell slow up now thought andy unless he bolts right into his stable if he tries that ill have to jump for it  in front of the school building the roadway widened out into several curves andy thought jim would take to one of the curves but he was mistaken on kept the steed directly past the institution of learning  on the campus were a score or more of cadets who stared in amazement at the sight of the runaway horse with the boy clinging desperately to his back  its andy snow cried henry lee the captain of company a  so it is responded bob grenwood the quartermaster of the school battalion how in the world did he get on that horse  its the one that was hitched to the carryall put in billy sabine another cadet something is wrong  lets tell captain putnam said another  whoa whoa yelled andy frantically when he realized that the horse was not going to pass into the grounds whoa i say youve gone far enough  the only effect his words had was to make jim travel a little faster away they went past the gymnasium and the stables and then along the country road leading to the farms back of the lake  well if you wont stop go on said andy presently youll get tired sooner or later old man but remember youve got to bring me back no matter how tired you are  a good halfmile was covered and then horse and rider reached a sharp turn in the highway here the trees were thick and some of the branches hung low  illustration the young major still lay with his eyes closed      the mystery of putnam hall page 19  andy bent down that he might avoid the branches but he did not get quite low enough he looked ahead saw a man standing on one side of the roadway staring in astonishment at him and the next instant he found himself caught by the throat in a treelimb and carried off the horse then jim bounded on riderless and poor andy kicking and thrashing wildly sprang free of the treelimb and landed on his shoulder in the roadway  the man who had seen him coming leaped to one side and just in the nick of time for the runaway horse passed within a foot of him the man gasped in astonishment and for several seconds did not know apparently what to do  looks like he was killed the man muttered to himself as he took a few steps forward andy had rolled over on his back and lay stretched out with his eyes closed very much as poor jack had been stretched out only a short while before  the man looked up and down the roadway and saw that nobody else was in sight that part of the highway being but little traveled then he came closer to the unconscious boy and bent over him  only stunned i reckon he muttered to himself wonder if he belongs around here  as the man bent over andy he saw the lads watch dangling from its chain fastened to a buttonhole of the youths vest then his ferretlike eyes caught sight of a fine ruby pin in andys necktie  he could easily lose that watch on the road riding like that and the pin too he muttered to himself its a fine chance to make a little haul  he straightened up and took another look around not a soul was in sight with dexterous fingers he unfastened the watch and chain and transferred them to his pocket the stickpin followed then he slipped his hand into a vestpocket and brought out a fivedollar bill and three onedollar bills  eight dollars he muttered not so bad but what it might be worse i reckon the watch chain and pin will bring me another twenty or thirty sparrow you are in luck today  he lingered wondering if andy had anything more of value about him the youth wore a ring with a cameo in it but it looked tight and hard to get off  might try his other pockets mused the thief then a distant shouting came to his ears  somebody is after him he muttered i reckon its time i cleared out it wont do for me to be seen in this neighborhood  he looked around for an instant then he walked to the roadside ran in among the trees and bushes and disappeared from view     chapter iv  a fruitless search   hello pepper  how are you fred  my heres the old bunch back again  well henry did you have a good time during the summer  how about that trip out west bob did you kill any bears or indians  getting hightoned hiring a carriage to bring you  so the cries rang out as the threeseated carriage driven by amos darrison rolled up to the front of putnam hall a crowd of cadets had rushed forward to greet the newcomers  where is andy snow asked pepper as he leaped to the ground  he went past on horseback like a streak cried bob grenwood some of the fellows just went off to tell captain putnam about it what did it mean  tell you later bob just now somebody had better go after andy that horse was running away with him  a hubbub arose in the midst of which captain putnam the owner of the school appeared he was a finelooking gentleman with a face that was at once kindly and firm  what is this i hear about andrew snow he said anxiously a horse ran away with him  in as few words as possible pepper and some of the others related the particulars of what had happened to the carryall just as they were finishing peleg snuggers came up on the other horse  this is very unfortunate murmured captain putnam well have to follow poor snow at once mr darrison will you drive me  whyeryes but it will take time captain putnam an my wife wants me to  ill pay you for your time sir interrupted the owner of the school quickly  yes sir all right sir jump in an well go right after the runaway  can i go along asked pepper  id like to go too came from stuffer singleton  so would i added bob grenwood  very well you three cadets can go along replied the captain it is possible you may be neededif poor snow has been hurt he turned to jack how do you feel major ruddy  oh i guess ill be all right after i have rested up answered jack with a faint smile  you have a cut on the forehead  yes sir but it doesnt hurt like it did  better bathe it with warm water and put something on it said captain putnam and then leaped into the carriage and pepper stuffer and bob followed  hope they find andy all right said joe nelson as the turnout moved off in the direction the runaway had taken  yes it would be too bad if andy was seriously injured answered the young major come on im going in and wash up and put some witch hazel on my forehead  glad to see you young gentlemen said a pleasant voice when the newcomers entered the school building and george strong the second assistant teacher stepped forward to shake each by the hand i hope you all had a nice time this summer and then he asked about the brokendown carryall and looked at jacks wound  although he did not say so to his chums jack was glad enough to get upstairs to his dormitory and rest the room was a large one and was occupied not only by the young major but also by pepper andy and several others while some of the boys busied themselves in arranging their things jack rested in an easy chair near the window  quite a few new fellows here this term said fred who was present i understand that all of the new dormitories that were built in the wing this summer will be filled up  that shows the school is growing popular answered the young major  jack arent you afraid somebody will try to get your position away from you went on fred  what do you mean fred try to be elected major  yes  well some of the fellows deserve the position bart connors the captain of company b would make a fine major and so would henry lee the captain of company a and sergeant dave kearney is a good fellow who deserves promotion  then you dont care so much for the position  oh yes i do care but i realize that it isnt fair to be major all the time im willing to step down and give the other fellows a show  but not a fellow like reff ritter or that dan baxter you told me about  no i couldnt stand for those chaps  reff is as sore as he can be over what happened last term  i know it  dale says he knows something about reff  i do came from dale blackmore who had entered a moment before do you know in one way i am sorry for ritter he added  what is it you know asked fred  i dont suppose i ought to speak about it but it is bound to get out sooner or later it seems mr ritter reffs father was a rich stock broker and promoter of various mining companies well this summer he got himself tangled up in some mining companies that were trying to make money too fast as a consequence he lost the most of his wealth and some folks who had bought mining stock from him came close to having him arrested for fraud it was that state of affairs that made reff give up his trip to the adirondacks and go home i got it from some close friends that the ritters were almost cleaned out and that mr ritter wanted reff to give up school and go to work but mrs ritter was too proud and insisted that reff be returned to putnam hall so he is back  well that certainly is hard luck returned fred i wonder if coulter and paxton will stick to him now he is poor my notion of it was coulter stuck to him mainly for what he could get out of it he not having much spending money of his own  well i shant throw it up to reff that he is poor said jack quickly all he has got to do is to behave himself and ill treat him as well as anybody and then the young major left the dormitory to bathe his head in the bathroom and wash up generally  in the meantime those in the carriage had driven along the country road until they came upon the unconscious form of andy all leaped out and gathered around while captain putnam made an examination  he has had a bad fall said the master of the school but i doubt if any bones are broken  they raised the sufferer up and presently andy stirred and opened his eyes  whoa he murmured whoa  he must think he is still on horseback cried pepper and but for andys pale face he would have laughed outright  snow are you hurt much asked captain putnam kindly the horse is gone you are safe  oh gasped poor andy and then he stared around in bewilderment ii was hung up in thethe tree wasnt i  if you were you must have dropped down answered bob grenwood  yes i remember now i got caught by the throat and then i droppedand thats all i know where is the horse  went on i guess answered stuffer singleton he was streaking it like an indian when you passed the hall  shall we help you to get up asked captain putnam  ii suppose so faltered andy oh dear but im weak he added as he tried to rise  let us carry him to the carriage suggested pepper and this was done and he was made as comfortable on the cushions as possible  i wonder did anybody catch the horse asked the acrobatic youth as the turnout was on its way to putnam hall  i dont know ill find out after you have been taken care of answered captain putnam you cadets are certainly arriving this term in an unusual manner he added grimly  you can lay the whole trouble at the door of some pornell students returned pepper they pelted us with soft apples and other things and that started the team to running away if it hadnt been for them we would have come to the school in the carryall all safe and sound  i shall investigate answered captain putnam briefly  hello cried pepper a moment later he was gazing at andys clothing werent you wearing a watch and a stickpin  of course replied the sufferer he put up his hands and felt around both gone i declare  did they jounce off when you were riding asked stuffer  they must have oh this is the worst yet  did you lose anything else questioned the young quartermaster  i dont know andy felt in his pockets yes my money is goneeight dollars in bills  where did you have the bills asked captain putnam  in this vestpocket it must have jounced out during the hard riding oh what luck captain ill have to go back and look for my property  you are in no condition snow to do that  ill go back said pepper stuffer and bob will you go along  sure thing cried stuffer  and if we cant find your things where you fell well look along the road all the way back to the hall added the young quartermaster  thank you answered andy and then feeling a curious fainting spell coming over him he laid back on the cushions and closed his eyes  the three cadets sprang from the carriage and made their way back to the spot where andy had been found they made a thorough search but of course failed to find any of the acrobatic youths belongings  he must have lost them farther back said pepper let us look with care as we walk along  this they did but arrived at the school without finding anything but a coatbutton and a yellow lead pencil then they walked past the school in the direction of cedarville  might as well give it up said bob its getting too dark to see very good anyway  yes and im getting dead hungry added stuffer  was there ever a time when you werent hungry asked pepper with a grin  aw now quit it cried the lad who had a reputation as an eater dont start so early in the term  i must confess im a bit hungry myself said the young quartermaster i had an early dinner  when they got back to the school they learned that andy had been put to bed and that a doctor had been summoned the acrobatic youth had been much shaken up and it was thought best to make him keep quiet for a few days  better not say anything about his loss for the present advised captain putnam i will have a man sent out to make another search  the accidents to andy and to major jack put something of a damper on the arrival for the term and a jollification that had been scheduled for that night was indefinitely postponed captain putnam questioned the cadets concerning the actions of roy bock and his cronies and then sent a stiff letter to the head of pornell academy  when reff ritter heard about the accidents he shrugged his shoulders and tossed his head  thats what they get for crowding us out of the carryall he said to coulter and paxton who roomed with him  yes and it serves em right grumbled coulter  thats what chimed in paxton     chapter v  the fight in the gymnasium   it was not until two days later that andy snow felt like himself again no bones had been broken but the acrobatic youth had received a shaking up that was severe  so far he had not been told of his loss and when he asked for his belongings he was much depressed by the news  couldnt find them anywhere he repeated to pepper oh are you sure you made a good search  we certainly did andy returned pepper we went back the next day early in the morning  and you didnt find a thing  only this button and lead pencil and this buckle  the pencil is mine but not the button and the buckle andy heaved a sigh then i am out my watch and chain the stickpin and eight dollars was there ever such luck  andy was anybody near you when you had the tumble asked pepper  near me why yes there was a man on the road just ahead of me i had forgotten all about it until now  who was he  i dont know a tall fellow with a thin leathery face  a farmer  no he looked more like a city man he had on a regular sack suit and a derby hat  i was thinking that possibly somebody robbed you while you were unconscious  perhaps that is so pep id like to see that man  you never saw him before  not that i can remember  would you know him if you saw him again  i dont know about that i didnt have much time to look at him i was busy trying to escape being hit by the tree branches  you must have been lying on the road five or ten minutes before we found you pursued pepper if that stranger was a rascal he would have had plenty of time to go through your pockets i dont see how riding could make you lose all those things at once  if he robbed me id like to get hold of him cried andy  more than likely if he did rob you hell take good care to keep out of your reach  what of the horse did they catch him  not yet most likely he left the road after he got tired of running and wandered into the woods he was a valuable animal and captain putnam is worried about him  will he hold me for that loss  i dont think soyou didnt run away with himhe ran away with you  the report of the loss of andys valuables was thoroughly circulated around putnam hall and cedarville and a reward of ten dollars for the return of the things was posted  the next day a farmer named john lane who lived not far from the school appeared there riding on the back of the runaway jim the horse looked much subdued and was covered with burrs  i was out in the woods with my son bill when we ran across the horse explained john lane i knew him right away as the animal that had belonged to jerry toller i asked jerry about it and he said he had sold the horse to you so i brought him here  you are very kind mr lane replied captain putnam id like to pay you for your trouble  oh thats all right captain putnam responded the farmer glad to do you a good turn  thank you very much any time i can do you a good turn let me know  well you might buy some of my extra hay and extra potatoes ive got some prime hay and the best potatoes ever grown in these parts and ill sell em at regular market prices  then ill take all i can use mr lane answered the captain and a little later a bargain was struck not alone for the hay and potatoes but also for some turnips cabbages and table celery  what that horse needs is exercise said john lane on departing give him a few miles every day and hell be as mild as any of em hes too fullblooded to remain standing in the stable  ill see to it that he gets the exercise answered captain putnam  on the day that the horse was returned jack pepper and fred walked down to the boathouse to look over the boats as my old readers know jack owned a sloop called the alice while fred possessed a similar craft named the ajax besides these sloops there were numerous boats belonging to the hall  well our sloops look natural said the young major  i was wishing this summer i could go out in the ajax answered fred what do you say if we take a little sail now  in which boat fred asked pepper we cant go out in both  make it the alice cried jack  no the ajax came from fred  ill toss up for it went on pepper and produced a cent head you win tail you lose and up into the air spun the coin  head cried fred  head it is and we go out in the ajax  all right but youll have to go out in the alice next time cried the young major  by the way did you hear about tom rollinson asked pepper as he walked into the boathouse to inspect his locker there  what of him asked fred  the family were burnt out this summer and lost everything  lost everything queried jack thats tough luck i shouldnt want to lose all i had  well it will happen sometimes said fred  well some lose by fire and some lose in other ways went on the young major you have heard about ritter his father  you shut your mouth about my father roared a voice from behind a dressingroom door my father is just as honest as anybody and i wont have you or anybody else running him down and then reff ritter appeared minus his coat vest and collar and his face distorted with rage  i didnt say your father was dishonest reff returned jack as calmly as he could i was simply going to state  oh you neednt try to smooth it over jack ruddy fumed the bully dont imagine that i dont know all about the mean stories you and others are circulating about my family youd like to make out that my father is the worst swindler that ever lived and i wont stand for it  reff that isnt true interrupted pepper jack hasnt said a word against your father  oh you cant bluff me pep ditmore i know better  what pepper says is truei havent said a word reff truly i havent i heard that you had lost some of your money and i said i was sorry to hear itand i am sorry i know how id feel if my father lost money you  dont smooth it over i tell you roared the bully i know you you and your cronies have been down on me ever since i came to this school and now you think you can crow over me and maybe get me to leave putnam hall but i am not going to leave and if you dare to open your mouth against me ill punch your head  youll not punch my head reff answered jack and now his tones grew stern if you dont want to believe me you neednt but ill not let you threaten me  humph you cant boss me even if you are major of the battalion  i dont want to boss anybody you behave yourself and leave me alone and ill leave you alone  the loud talking had attracted the attention of a number of cadets and they commenced to crowd around jack and ritter among the number were gus coulter and nick paxton  why dont you fight him reff suggested coulter  thats the talk added paxton show him that he cant talk about you and your father as he pleases  he wont fight he is afraid answered reff ritter with a sneer in his tones  i am not afraid ritter and you know it answered jack trying to keep his temper but you know the rules and i as major of the cadets am bound to uphold them  hit him one whispered coulter in his cronys ear ill stand by you  so will i added paxton  well if you wont fight take that for your impudence cried reff ritter and with a quick step forward he slapped jack on the cheek  the blow was but a light one yet it seemed to sink deep into jacks very heart and on the instant all thoughts of prudence and rules were cast aside his face went white and his eyes flashed fire reff ritter stepped back to guard himself but before he could do so jacks arm shot out and a heavy blow landed on the bullys chin sending him staggering into coulters arms  thats the way to do it jack came from pepper  he started it now give him what he deserves added fred  thats for the slap in the face reff ritter said jack in cold tones now mind and keep your distance  waitim not done yet yelled the bully and doubling up his fists he hurled himself on the young major  several body blows were struck and then the two clinched as ritter was partly stripped for battle while jack had on his stiff uniform the bully had a little the better of it from the beginning around and around the gymnasium floor they struggled  break away cried several cadets break away  ill break if he will answered jack  all right answered ritter and the hold of each youth was loosened but as they broke the bully tried to land his fist on jacks ear  hi that isnt fair ritter cried fred  you keep out of this century was coulters warning  ill not keep out coulter make ritter fight fair  again the two cadets faced each other now ritter was on his guard and cleverly ducked a blow aimed at his face then he hit jack on the chest and in the shoulder  thats the talk came gleefully from paxton pummel him well while you are at it  again jack struck out and this time landed on the bullys arm but then ritter swung a heavy lefthander that took the young major in the ear and sent him staggering against pepper  follow him up follow him up screamed coulter youve got him going reff finish him  thus encouraged ritter leaped in and another blow landed on jacks ear he was a bit dazed but shut his teeth hard and ducked under ritters arm then both sparred for an opening circling around the gymnasium floor once more the crowd of cadets around them growing larger and larger  its a great fight all right  say i hope none of the teachers come to cut it short  they are about evenly matched arent they  i dont know well soon find out  so the talk ran on but to it neither jack nor ritter paid attention the bully was in a fierce rage while jack tried his best to keep cool suddenly ritter leaped forward and two quick blows were delivered  jack knocked one blow aside and dodged the second then he let drive right and left as quick as lightning and with all his strength one blow took the bully in the nose and the second in the mouth over he went against one of the wooden horses then his eyes suddenly closed and in a limp mass he slid to the floor     chapter vi  captain putnam investigates   reff ritter has been knocked out  my what blows they were  well he brought it on himself said pepper  thats what added fred he struck jack after jack told him he didnt believe in fighting  he couldnt save himself because he was too close to the wooden horse came from coulter who felt bound to stick up for his crony it wasnt fair to run him up against the horse  coulter a poor excuse is worse than none answered dale  ritter was knocked out fair and square came from bart connors  while the talking was going on paxton had rushed off for water now he returned with a pailful and a sponge and commenced to bathe the fallen ones face ritter soon opened his eyes and gave a groan  lelet me alalone he muttered  get up reff said paxton go for him again  ii cant mumbled the bully and now it was seen that two of his front teeth were loose he stared around in a helpless fashion paxton put some more water on his face  has he had enough demanded jack stepping up  you go away answered coulter surlily  you wouldnt hit him when hes down would you snapped paxton  i asked you if he had enough if he has im going for a sail  illill finish this some other time mumbled ritter as he glared at the young major  no ritter youll finish it now if you finish it at all answered jack coldly you started this fight and now you must take the consequences get up if you want to go at it again  i dont want to fightnow  then you acknowledge yourself beaten  no i dont  then get up i dont want to wait here all afternoon for you  he has all he wants said pepper he wont get up  its your fight ruddy cried joe nelson  so it is put in half a dozen cadets  ritter is beaten and he knows it added harry blossom the first lieutenant of company a  ieri wont fight any more now mumbled the bully he got up slowly and then staggering to a bench sank down heavily upon it evidently his punishment at jacks hands had been heavy  boys boys what is the meaning of this  it was a loud and harsh voice from the doorway of the gymnasium that startled all of the assembled cadets the next instant josiah crabtree the head teacher strode in  skip jack here is old crabtree  run for it reff  i demand to know what is going on here went on josiah crabtree in his highpitched voice who is fighting  there was no reply the assembled cadets looked at each other no one felt like saying a word  ritter have you been fighting went on the head teacher noticing the bullys condition  i waserthat is ruddy attacked me and ieri defended myself stammered the defeated one  ruddy do you mean major ruddy questioned josiah crabtree in astonishment  yes sir  mr crabtree what ritter says is untrue burst out jack he hit me first  but you have been fighting you the major of the school battalion disgraceful  wouldnt you fight if somebody slapped you in the face demanded jack hotly  you know the rules ruddyand as major you ought to be the first to obey them  i am willing to do that sir but i wont allow anybody to slap me in the face  i didnt slap him put in ritter  yes you did came from pepper  it is truei saw it added fred  so did i added a cadet named brown  if you were struck major ruddy it was your duty to report the occurrence at the office said josiah crabtree loftily such actions as these will most likely cost you your command  oh what a shame burst out pepper  ditmore i want no words from you roared the head teacher savagely  but it wouldnt be fair to make jack suffer for something like that went on pepper bound to stick up for his chum  ha you dare to talk back to me ditmore go to your room at once and stay there until tomorrow morning  but mr crabtree  not another word go to your room and you ruddy and ritter report to me and to captain putnam at the private office at once  there was no help for it and with an angry look on his face pepper left the gymnasium and walked over to the school building  ill report as soon as i have washed up mr crabtree said ritter sullenly  so will i added jack  ill give you both ten minutes no more snapped the teacher and then he strode from the gymnasium as swiftly as he had entered it  as soon as josiah crabtree had departed a lively discussion commenced between the followers of the young major and of reff ritter only a few had seen the start of the quarrel and knew that it had been provoked entirely by the bully  im afraid i am in for it said jack dismally to fred ritter will do his best to make out that it was all my fault  well i can testify that ritter hit you first and pepper and brown can do so too answered fred  reff will get coulter and paxton to back him up  but they werent on hand when the quarrel started  that is truebut theyll stick up for reff see if they dont  i sincerely trust that captain putnam doesnt take away your majorship jack  if he does that illwell never mind what ill do  if he did it to me id feel like leaving  i was going to say that but ill not do anything hastily answered the young major and heaved a deep sigh  want me to go along  no since crabtree didnt ask any one but i wish youd hang around so i can call on you  ill go to the library  all rightand take brown if hell go  jack washed up and brushed his uniform and then made his way to captain putnams private office he found that reff ritter had hurried and gotten ahead of him and was telling his story both to the head of the school and to the first assistant teacher ritters mouth nose and one eye were swollen and he looked anything but happy  you may remain in the hallway until i call you major ruddy said captain putnam when jack appeared and the young major had to go outside closing the door after him  the telling of reff ritters story took some time and he was asked several questions by captain putnam and josiah crabtree he said that he had just been getting ready to take some gymnastic exercise when jack and some of his chums had come in and begun to talk about his father saying that they had heard he was dishonest  ruddy said he knew my father was dishonest went on reff ritter that made me mad and i ran out of the dressingroom and told him he ought to be ashamed of himself that my father was as honest as anybody then he got on his highhorse and told me to shut up or he would knock me down i told him it was a shame for him to speak so of my father then he got mad and all of a sudden he jumped at me and hit me in the mouth and the eye and then in the nose then i went for him and we had it hot and heavy until we bumped into one of the wooden horses and i went down he tried to hit me after i was down but coulter and paxton hauled him back then mr crabtree came in  a most disgraceful proceeding cried josiah crabtree and evidently major ruddys fault entirely  you are quite sure ruddy started the quarrel questioned captain putnam gravely  yes sir  and he told the other cadets that your father was dishonest  yes sir that is what made me so mad but i didnt hit him until he attacked me added ritter hastily  who was present at the time  pepper ditmore and fred century were with ruddy and gus coulter and nick paxton were with me  anybody else  i didnt see anybody  you got the worst of the fight  yes sir you see he took me unawares i guess i could whip him if we were to meet on equal terms added ritter  you may retire to the next room ritter while i question major ruddy  dont you believe me cried the bully in alarm  one side of a story is only one side answered captain putnam noncommittally  i believe ritter tells the truth put in josiah crabtree when i appeared ruddy was very insolent and so was ditmore i sent ditmore to his room as a punishment  you may call ruddy in answered the head of the school briefly he understood josiah crabtrees dictatorial manner perfectly and he only retained the man because of his unusual ability as a teacher  jack came in and was told to sit down in the chair ritter had just vacated then captain putnam asked him to tell his story and he related everything just as it had occurred  are you quite sure that you have told the plain truth major ruddy asked captain putnam after he had finished  yes sir answered jack and looked the head of the school fairly and squarely in the face  your story does not agree with that told by ritter  i believe ritter broke in josiah crabtree it was an outrage to drag in the boys father simply because he has made someerunfortunate speculations if i were you captain putnam  wait a moment mr crabtree interrupted the owner of the hall i am conducting this investigation now that we have heard the stories of the principals well hear what the witnesses have to say  fred century was there and he is in the library now said jack pepper ditmore was there too but mr crabtree sent him to his room  i will question century and ditmore and also coulter and paxton answered captain putnam you may retire to classroom three major ruddy until called  jack bowed and withdrew and walked to the classroom named it was empty and he threw himself down on a seat and gave himself up to his reflections  fred was next called and he was followed by pepper both told practically the story related by jack in the meantime george strong the second assistant teacher was sent off to summon coulter and paxton he was gone the best part of a quarter of an hour and when he came back his face was a study  captain putnam i have just made a discovery he said i would like to speak to you alone  alone queried the head of the school somewhat astonished  yes sir alone  very well then come into the next room answered captain putnam     chapter vii  pepper makes a discovery   you do noterwish me present came rather awkwardly from josiah crabtree  oh that wont matter mr crabtree answered george strong i did not desire any of the cadets present that was all  i do not care to intrude commenced the dictatorial teacher  as you please answered mr strong with a shrug of his shoulders  at first josiah crabtree was inclined to stand on his dignity and walk off but his curiosity got the better of him and he followed captain putnam and george strong into another office  i went after coulter and paxton as you directed me said the second assistant teacher when they were alone and the door had been closed at first i could not find them but at last i located paxton and then coulter where do you suppose they were  i have no idea answered captain putnam  paxton was under the window of the office listening to all that was going on he was partly hidden behind a bush so that nobody might see him  indeed that is not to his credit and coulter  coulter was at another window talking to ritter ritter was giving him some instructions and as i came up unnoticed i heard ritter say now dont make a mess of it tell the story just as i told it and be sure to stick to it that ruddy hit me first and tell nick to stick to that too those were his very words  is it possible and what did coulter say  he promised to tell the story as ritter wanted it and said he would tell paxton also to say that ruddy struck the first blow  then he virtually admitted that he struck the first blow himself  i should judge so from his talk  major ruddy said he did  but ruddy insulted him by talking of mr ritters losses began josiah crabtree  well look into that mr crabtree is that all mr strong  no i waited until coulter joined paxton the two walked out on the campus so i didnt catch what they said i told them to follow me and they are now out in the hall  i will listen to what each of them has to sayand then i will examine century and ditmore again  coulter was called into the main office and asked a great number of questions captain putnam was very stern and soon had the cadet badly twisted in his statements then paxton was told to come in and on being questioned he became more confused even than coulter then both were confronted by george strong and at last they virtually admitted that ritter had struck the first blow and that they knew nothing of the quarrel previous to that time  you may go said captain putnam at length your efforts to shield ritter do you no credit and coulter and paxton slunk out of the office silently and much worried over the thought of what punishment they might receive for trying to deceive the master of the hall  after that pepper and fred were again interviewed and crossquestioned but they stuck to their original story and as that was the story told by jack captain putnam felt that it must be true  you may go said the captain presently  have i got to go back to the dormitory queried pepper  no you may join the other cadets answered the head of the school  but sir commenced josiah crabtree  i do not see as he merits punishment mr crabtree said the captain coldly we will let it pass and he spoke so firmly that the dictatorial teacher said no more on the subject  when jack was again called into the presence of the teachers it must be admitted that he was a good deal worried there was a strict rule at putnam hall against fighting and that rule had been violated by him yet he felt he had been justified  major ruddy i have examined several witnesses to this affair and i find that your story of the occurrence is substantially correct began the head of the school ritter struck the first blow  he did he slapped me in the face that angered me so greatly that i pitched into him without thinking twice it was all done in a few seconds but i guess id do it again added jack i wouldnt let anybody slap me without getting back at him i guess if i did that id make a mighty poor soldier  at these words captain putnams face became a study he had been on the point of reading jack a stern lecture on the disgrace of breaking the school rules but now he paused when at west point a certain upper classman had once pulled his nose and regardless of consequences he had knocked the fellow down and dragged him by the heels through the dirt of the road he had considered himself justified in his actions and his whole class has stood by him that being so he did not have it in his heart to punish jack or even to find fault with him yet the discipline of the school must be maintained  major ruddy do you know what the first duty of a soldier is he asked but his voice was soft and easy  yes sir to obey orders  exactly  but there is no rule about what to do if a fellow slaps your face added jack quickly  that is true captain putnam had to turn away to conceal a sudden smile and in one way let me say i do not blame you for what you did especially as you acted on the spur of the moment but fighting must stop if i dismiss this case against you will you promise to leave ritter alone in the future  i will if he leaves me alone if he attacks me ill defend myself to the best of my ability  he wont attack youill see to that answered the captain grimly you may go but remember no more fighting  thank you sir answered jack and lost no time in leaving the office  well how did you make out questioned pepper eagerly when jack joined him on the campus  case dismissed pep  really  yes  hurrah thats the best news yet i was in fear that you would at least be cut off from your holidays  what about ritter asked fred  i dont know what captain putnam is going to do with him  the fight and the doings in the office had put jack out of the notion of taking a sail and the crowd of boys took a walk instead that lasted until it was time for the evening parade  wonder if ritter will show up for drill came from dale  well know soon answered jack  in a few minutes the drums commenced to roll and out on the parade ground poured the cadets and their officers jack had buckled on his sword and so had henry lee and bart conners the cadets had their guns that is all but the band who carried their drums and fifes and the color sergeants who carried old glory and the putnam hall banner  battalion attention came firmly from major jack ruddy and all the young soldiers stiffened up in their places  he ran his eyes over the two companies to see that every cadet was toeing the mark he did not see reff ritter  present arms carry arms shoulder arms came the various commands and the cadets made the movements with their guns the drilling was so well done that captain putnam who always looked on nodded in approval  by column of fours forward march came the next command and then the drums struck up once more the fifes joined in and four abreast the cadets moved off down the parade ground they marched up and down several times and executed various movements and then marched into the messhall or diningroom put away their guns and took their seats  ritter isnt here whispered pepper to jack  so i see was the reply  ill bet he caught it from captain putnam put in dale  silence at the table came harshly from josiah crabtree i want less talking at meals  my but hes a cheerful beggar muttered dale  imagine him at the head of the school observed pepper  ditmore did you hear me snarled the teacher i want you to keep quiet  all right mr crabtree sorry i spoke answered the imp cheerfully  then remember to keep your mouth closed after this  ahem how am i to eat if i keep my mouth closed asked pepper innocently  ha i want none of your jokes ditmore leave the table thundered josiah crabtree  im not through yet  never mind leave the table at once and the teacher glared at pepper as if to eat him up  just my luck muttered the imp and got up  heres a sandwich for you whispered dale who sat near and he passed over two slices of bread with some cold meat between  and heres a piece of cake added jack and slid it along under the edge of the table then pepper got up and left the room he did not know where to go and so walked slowly in the direction of the boathouse  as he neared the building he saw a boy come out of the structure and hurry across the float to where the alice and the ajax were tied up the boy was reff ritter  the bully of the school was in a great rage captain putnam had given him a stern lecture and told him if he did not behave in the future he would be dismissed from the school the captain had also cut him off from all holidays up to christmas and added that he must expect to take no part in putnam hall athletics the latter was the hardest blow of all for ritter had hoped that fall to make the football team  now what is he up to pepper asked himself and stuffing the napkin that held the cake and sandwich into his pocket he moved forward on a run  reff ritter had crossed the float and now he stood beside the sloop that was jacks property as pepper came closer he saw that the bully held an ax in his hand the handle shoved up the sleeve of his jacket  he is up to no good thought pepper ill watch him and see what he does  pepper stepped out of sight behind the boathouse looking through a window and a door he saw ritter walk up and down the float evidently the bully wanted to make certain that he was not being observed then with a swift movement he leaped aboard the sloop and crouched down out of sight  guess its time i got busy muttered pepper to himself and ran around the boathouse and out on the float he was soon at the side of the alice he heard a blow sound out ritter was using the ax apparently in an endeavor to chop a hole in the bottom of the sloop  of all the mean things muttered pepper to himself ill soon stop that and he made a leap over the guardrail of the craft the ax was raised for another blow but before it could be delivered pepper caught the bully by the shoulders and sent him sprawling on his back     chapter viii  the football eleven   hi let go of me spluttered reff ritter as he found himself flat on his back with the ax upraised in his two hands  ritter you leave this boat alone exclaimed pepper  humph so its you ditmore muttered the bully and now he turned over and arose  going to chop the boat to pieces i suppose went on pepper well not if i can prevent it  ill chop you to pieces roared the bully and swung the ax so suggestively that pepper leaped back in alarm youve got no right to interfere with me  this is jack ruddys sloop you have no right to touch her  aw you shut up  ill not shut up reff ritter if you make another mark on this boat ill have you locked up  humph you think youve got the best of me dont you sneered the bully but his manner showed that he was considerably disconcerted he had imagined that all the cadets were at supper and that no one would see his foul actions  i want you to get off of this boat  supposing i wont  then ill call help and advise jack to have you arrested  going to run the whole school arent you  i am going to run this affair ritter now leave the boat  oh ill leave muttered the bully and walking to the side he sprang down to the float then he ran to the boathouse and placed the ax inside dont you dare to mention this to anybody he shouted as he reappeared if you do youll get yourself in hot water my word is as good as yours and then he turned and ran towards the school building  pepper watched him out of sight  no use of reporting this to captain putnam he reasoned ritter would of course deny everything wonder if he did much damage  pepper made an examination luckily the bully had not had time to get in his nefarious work to any extent and the bottom of the sloop showed only two slight ax cuts not deep enough to do harm  caught him just in time thought pepper and then he sat down on the stern seat and munched away at the sandwich and cake washing the stuff down with a drink from the cooler in the boathouse  by the time he had finished the other cadets were coming from their supper and soon he was joined by jack dale and several others in private he told the young major of what had occurred  the rascal cried jack if he hurts my boat he shall pay for it  captain putnam must have given him a good dressing down to make him so ugly  well he deserved it  say put in dale that was mean of old crabtree to send you away from the table  never mind ill pay him back answered the imp grimly  several days passed and during that time reff ritter kept his distance the bully was in a bitter mood and even his cronies could get little out of him  the reason for this was twofold he was smarting over the treatment received at the hands of jack and captain putnam and he was also disturbed because his father had written to him stating he could allow him hardly any spending money for the term he had already borrowed a small amount from paxton and he was wondering how he was going to pay it back added to this he had gambled with some racetrack men during the summer and one of those fellows now held his iou for forty dollars  dad has got to let me have money that is all there is to it he told himself if he wont then ill write to mother shell raise it for me somehow she always does which shows how foolish an indulgent mother can sometimes be  in the meantime andy had recovered from the accident and was now around as usual another hunt had been instituted for his belongings but without success a report came in that a strange man had been seen on the road just previous to the accident and the cadets and captain putnam wondered if that individual had picked up andys things and made off with them  maybe he was the fellow i saw said andy and then he heaved a deep sigh thinking he would never hear of his property again  jack and pepper were glad to see bert field again and also to see their old friend joseph hogan emerald came back wearing a smile that was sunniness itself  sure an it does me heart good to be here once more so it does he said in his rich irish brogue i traveled all over the ould sod this summer so i did but putnam hall an the states fer me every toime  is this your last term here emerald asked dale  i think soif i am lucky and get through how about you  i hope to graduate next june  and so do jack and i added pepper but you cant always tell ill be sorry to leave putnam hall  thats so such good times as we have had here added jack  as soon as the cadets were settled down at the hall and the excitement over the runaway the loss of andys things and the fight between jack and ritter was at an end the talk of the boys turned to football and other fall sports as in the past the cadets hoped to have a good eleven and win some substantial victories  wonder if well be allowed to play pornell said jack  i dont know answered dale i rather think the captain is sore over the reply he got from the head of that school over the carryall affair and maybe he wont let us play them and in this dale was correct pornell was cut out that season but it played putnam hall the year following  dale blackmore was at the head of the football eleven and as before he organized a fine team jack andy hogan and bart conners were in their usual places  and i want you too pepper said dale  oh i can go on the subbench was the answer for pepper did not care very much for football give fred century and bert field a chance  i know what pepper wants said andy he wants us to play while he sits in the grandstand having a good time with the girls  sure thing answered the imp coolly somebody has got to entertain em  they ought to be entertained by the game came from dale  girls make me tired when they are at a football game put in the cadet named brown i took one once and she said she knew all about football after the game was half over she asked me how many runs and base hits had been made and what they had done with the bats  reff ritter felt extra sore when the football eleven went out for practice he wanted to play but captain putnam would not allow it and the bully went off by himself up the lakeshore where he sat down on a rock to smoke cigarettes and brood over his troubles while he sat there he took from his pocket a letter and read it over several times  twenty dollars by saturday i dont see how i am going to raise it he muttered to himself i guess ill have to send mother a telegram for a remittance  the first football game of the season was arranged to take place between putnam hall and an eleven from cedarville called the dauntless the dauntless players were made up of former college boys and some allaround athletes and the cadets were told that they would have a stiff time of it trying to beat the aggregation the game was to take place on the grounds at cedarville these were roped off and an admission fee was charged the entire proceeds to go to a local old folks home  ive got news cried pepper a few days before the game was to come off some of the pornell students are coming to the game and i understand they are going to try to make trouble for our team  is it the roy bock crowd questioned jack  yes  then it is up to you to keep an eye on them pepper we cant do it while we are playing  ill keep an eye on em dont fear was the answer  the eleven practiced every afternoon under the direction of mr strong who had once been a player on a college team josiah crabtree took no interest in the sport declaring it was a waste of valuable time  ive got a plan to outwit the pornellites if they try any funny work said pepper the day before the game and then he took about a dozen cadets aside and told them what his plan was all agreed to help him and did what he asked of them without delay  the day for the game dawned clear and bright and promptly on time the eleven started for cedarville in the carryall which had just come from the repair shop some of the cadets went on their bicycles and captain putnam and some of the teachers drove over in carriages  when the cadets arrived at the grounds they found quite a crowd assembled horns and banners were in evidence and from a flagpole floated the stars and stripes on one side was a grandstand and this was about threequarters filled  i see some friends of mine cried pepper and advanced to the stand  he had caught sight of laura ford and her sister flossie two young ladies who lived on the lakeshore at a place called point view lodge in the past pepper and his chums had done the ford sisters several valuable services for which laura and flossie were profoundly grateful  oh how do you do pepper called out laura on catching sight of him  arent you playing questioned flossie  no im merely an onlooker today answered pepper and he raised his cap and shook hands how have you been since i saw you last  very well thank you answered laura  we hope putnam hall will win came from her sister  you cant hope it any more than i do answered pepper and then he introduced several cadets to the young ladies and all sat down to enjoy the game  pepper has his eyes open for the appearance of the students from pornell at first a few came in and took a stand in a corner out of the way they did not belong to the bock crowd and seemed to be content to behave themselves  maybe roy bock got cold feet and stayed away said a cadet named melmore  no here he comes cried bob grenwood and sedley and four others are with him  pepper looked in the direction pointed out and saw roy bock and his cronies approaching all had big tin horns and immense wooden rattles and their pockets bulged with apples and peanuts  whoop her up dauntless yelled roy bock as soon as he reached the grandstand whoop her up and wipe up the ground with putnam hall and then he swung his big rattle and his cronies did likewise then the pornellites crowded into the grandstand and took seats near pepper and his fellow cadets and the girls they talked in loud voices and said a number of things that caused the faces of the girls to burn and made the cadets thoroughly angry  they ought to be put off the stand cried bob indignantly  and they will be put off if they keep this up answered pepper they can cheer all they please for the dauntless eleven but they have got to act like gentlemen  as soon as the two elevens appeared the practice commenced and then there was a tossup for goals which dauntless won they took the south goal and putnam hall took the ball then came the kickoff and the game was on     chapter ix  the football game   at first the playing was rather tame but inside of a few minutes both elevens warmed up and from that moment the work became fast and furious  the dauntless team had the advantage of weight but the eleven had not played together as much as had the majority of the putnam hall cadets consequently some of their combination efforts were decidedly ragged one move resulted in a bad fumble on the part of the left end the ball was captured by jack and he carried it forward fifteen yards before downed  oh my isnt it rough screamed laura ford as the young major hit the grass with great force two of the dauntless men being on top of him  oh thats all in the game was peppers comment but i shouldnt want to see anybody get his ribs stove in he added  putnam hall got the pigskin to within ten yards of the dauntless goal line and then came an unexpected turn of affairs the leather was lost by the putnam hall center and carried around the right end and up the field for thirty yards  hurrah thats the way to do it dauntless  keep it up  dauntless to the front yelled roy bock everybody in the game and then in the midst of the excitement he drew back with a soft apple in his hand and threw the halfdecayed fruit at jack it just grazed the young majors shoulder  pepper was on the watch for he had expected just such a dirty trick he leaped up and reaching over caught the pornell student by the ear  ouch yelled bock let go  you get out of the grandstand cried pepper if you dont ill get a crowd to mob you  see here ditmore  dont talkget interrupted pepper  let roy alone sang out bat sedley if you dont ill crack you one  hello you rascals came unexpectedly from nearby and a farmer named baker showed himself you here jest wait till i git my paws on you and he started in the direction of roy bock bat sedley and two of their cronies  great scott its that farmer ejaculated roy bock and he started to scramble out of the grandstand in a hurry and after him went the others  but they were not quite quick enough for darius baker and at the foot of the stand the farmer caught bock in one hand and bat sedley in the other then he swung the two together until their heads cracked  will steal my apples and pears he shrilled will talk sassy to my darter eh ill teach you and then letting go suddenly he cuffed roy bock on the ear and thumped bat sedley in the jaw so hard that that student howled outright  let up  please dont hit me again  it was all a mistake  no mistake bawled darius baker git out o here before i call the constable an have ye locked up and then roy bock and his cronies lost no time in hurrying away without so much as looking behind them  guess you know em remarked pepper when the farmer came back into the stand and resumed his seat  guess i do was the snortedout reply they came around to my place yesterday and stole my apples and pears and talked sassy to my darter an the hired man i saw em but they ran away before i could git my hands on em i vowed i take em down a peg when i met em an i guess i done it added the old farmer with evident satisfaction  you did mr baker answered pepper and youve done us a service in the bargain  hows thet  those fellows came here to make trouble for our eleven the putnam hall team  that so well then im mighty glad i cleared em out i like to see a game now an then but i want it cleanno rowdy work  there was no time to say more for everybody was interested in the game the dauntless eleven had worked the pigskin up to within a few yards of the putnam hall goal line and now over it came  a touchdown for dauntless  great work now make it a goal  the ball was brought out and the dauntless quarterback kicked a beautiful goal amid a great cheering and tooting of horns  eight minutes more to play said dale boys let us tie the score if nothing else  again the battle was on and now dale made a beautiful run being aided by some fine interference by jack and andy then hogan got the pigskin and worked it up to within five yards of the dauntless goal lineand then the whistle blew and the first half of the great game had to come to a close  the putnam hall eleven were a sober lot when they filed into their dressingroom to be rubbed down and to talk it over  well theyve only got a touchdown and goal to their credit said jack cheerfully thats not such a terrible lead to overcome  we must have more snap and ginger cried dale now i want everybody on the job from the word go  try that leftend play suggested george strong it may surprise themand anyway it can do no harm  the play he mentioned was something of a trick they had been practicing for a week it was rather intricate but dale promised to take his advice and use it at the first opportunity  the dauntless eleven scented a victory and went into the second half of the game with renewed vigor but putnam hall stood up manfully and andy got the pigskin in a manner that elicited much applause he carried it down the gridiron for eight yards and passed it over to jack then on the next down dale signaled for the trick play across the field came the ball and then back to center here a quick turn was made that bewildered the dauntless eleven on came the pigskin and almost before anybody knew it jack kicked a goal from the field  hurrah a field goal for putnam hall  talk about clever work wasnt that great  it sure was  never mind came from a dauntless supporter that doesnt count as much as the goal from a touchdown  well its blood for putnam hall anyway  again the leather went into play and once more each eleven did its level best to force the pigskin over the opponents line the dauntless aggregation were now wary of more tricks and they tried a trick of their own massing at the left and then running the ball up center but this did not work the ball was lost to andy who passed it over to dale  go it blackmore was the cry  down him cressy  on and on sped dale with the rival left end at his heels hogan and jack were pounding on behind and they stopped cressy from blocking the putnam hall captain over the line came dale to drop flat an instant later out of breath  hurrah a touchdown for putnam hall  now for a goal  the wind was blowing strongly yet andy measured the distance well and kicked the goal amid a cheering that could be heard half a mile  oh wasnt that grand murmured flossie ford  perfectly lovely added laura  its what we wanted answered pepper keep it up he yelled and blew his horn with all his might  with nine minutes more to play both elevens went at the game with great vigor the dauntless team wanted at least to make a field goalto tie the score but putnam hall held them back and two minutes before the whistle blew made another touchdown and kicked the goal when the game was ended the pigskin was on the dauntless fortyfiveyard line  putnam hall had won  what a cheering followed and what a tooting of horns and sounding of rattles the cadets cheered for their opponents and were cheered in return and then all filed off the field  a dandy game cried pepper to his chums simply great and he fairly hugged jack and andy  a splendid game was mr strongs comment  i am proud of our cadets added captain putnam  they are an honor to the school sir  yes mr strong they are  some of the boys remained in cedarville for the rest of the afternoon as soon as jack and andy had put aside their football outfits they joined pepper and the ford girls and all went to meet mr rossmore ford who had just arrived in his carriage  i am sorry i missed the game said the rich gentleman it must have been fine  oh papa it was lovely cried laura  i was so pleased to see putnam hall win added flossie  were you said mr ford and laughed goodnaturedly now i imagined you came to encourage the dauntless boys  papa you know better cried both girls  how would you young gentlemen like to drive home with us and dine at the lodge asked the gentleman  oh yes come cried flossie  do urged laura  well i dont know answered jack slowly the eleven is going to celebrate tonight and they want us otherwise id like it very much  then come some other time answered rossmore ford  thank you we will answered andy and after a few words more the fords drove off and the cadets walked away to join their fellows  it was a jolly crowd that returned to putnam hall late that afternoon and captain putnam was willing that they should have all the sport the rules of the institution permitted  bonfires tonight cried andy  biggest ever returned pepper ive got a surprise  what is it pep asked several in a chorus  if i tell you will you keep it to yourselves  sure was the ready answer  well you saw those tarroofers at work on the new top of the dock at cedarville  yes  i bought three empty tarbarrels from the foreman he is going to leave them in the woods yonder for me at seven oclock theyll make the finest bonfires you ever saw  thats the cheese cried dale slangily do you know what we can do place one barrel on top of another and touch them off theyll make the greatest blaze you ever heard of  but mums the word until the right time comes warned pepper and then the crowd dispersed for the evening drill  two boys had been listening to the talk from behind a nearby clump of bushes they were reff ritter and gus coulter  neither of the cronies had gone to the football game having preferred to walk to a cabin in the woods where they could smoke and play cards the victory of jack and his friends had put them in a particularly bad humor  i suppose they expect a great celebration with those tarbarrels muttered coulter say i tell you what lets do he cried let us sneak to the woods before they arrive and roll the barrels down to the lake  ill do it answered reff ritter anything to put a damper on that celebration  well water will dampen the tarbarrels added coulter grimly     chapter x  putting out a lively blaze   pepper was so full of high spirits that at the supper table he could not resist the temptation to play a joke he saw joe nelson using his handkerchief and on the sly took up the peppershaker and dosed the cloth liberally with pepper  poor joe caught the full benefit of the pepper and in the midst of the meal commenced to sneeze loudly  why nelson what is the matter asked mr strong who was at the table that evening  i dontkerchooknow stammered joe i believekerchoo kerchoo  exactly whispered pepper very simple explanation very  ikerchooi guess i had betterkerchoo went on joe  hes kerchooing all he needs to was jacks comment and this caused a general titter  i guess ill ask tokerchooto be excusedkerchoo went on joe and jumping up he left the table and the room he ran out on the campus and there sneezed himself free of the pepper much to his relief  joe was about to return to the messhall when he chanced to see two figures sneaking along in the semidarkness in the direction of the woods he was just able to make out that the pair were reff ritter and gus coulter when they disappeared behind the trees  now what are those fellows up to mused joe as he walked slowly to the messhall no good ill venture  he sat down and commenced to eat then of a sudden he uttered an exclamation  ive got it thats it  what is it nelson asked george strong  ohernothing stammered the cadet but when the teacher was not looking he leaned over towards jack  what is it joe whispered the young major  tell pepper i just saw ritter and coulter sneaking into the woods  you did jack closed one eye and you think  they may have learned about the barrels  if that is so well have to watch em murmured jack and immediately passed word to pepper dale and andy  the cadets could scarcely wait to finish their meal and cut themselves short on cake and pears pepper was the first out but he was quickly followed by andy and jack  let us try to surprise themif they are after the barrels said the imp  maybe theyll set fire to em before we get there suggested the acrobatic youth  if they do that ill make em pay for the barrels cried pepper i am not going to put up three dollars for another fellows fun  did you pay the roofer that much for the barrels  yes  the three boys hurried across the campus and dove into the woods beyond then pepper put up his hand for silence  let us surprise em if we can he whispered  thats the talk answered the young major  it did not take the three long to reach the vicinity where the tarbarrels had been left as they approached they saw a light flare up  they are setting em on fire cried andy  stop ritter stop coulter yelled pepper dont you light those barrels  ha ha came from the bully of the hall whats an old tarbarrel anyway guess we can fire them if we want to  those are my barrels answered pepper  he rushed forward followed by jack and andy but they were too late for on the instant a big flame shot up and all three of the tarbarrels standing in a close triangle and filled with dried leaves commenced to burn furiously as the flames shot up among the trees ritter and coulter backed away  goodby to those barrels came sorrowfully from andy well not be able to use them for the celebration tonight  ill fix you for this ritter and you too coulter called out pepper bitterly oh what luck he groaned as he saw the flames from the tarbarrels climb higher and higher what a grand bonfire they would have made on the lakefront  boys this fire is dangerous ejaculated jack  what do you mean came from the others  it is going to set fire to the woods see the dried leaves are catching already if it reaches yonder cedars there will be a terrible conflagration here  phew thats true came from pepper his merry face grew sober for the moment what shall we do  we are not responsible said andy it is ritter and coulters fault  but we dont want these grand woods to burn down went on the young major besides the wind is rising and it is blowing towards the gym and the stables the burning embers might set fire to those buildings  come on and put the blaze out said andy  how are you going to do it we havent any waterand water isnt of much account against tar anyway gracious see those flames shoot up jack added as a column of fire shot skyward  one of the trees is catching already gasped pepper we had better sound an alarm  andy go back to the school and tell the others teachers and all ordered the young major captain putnam will know what to do pepper you and i had better try to throw dirt and stones on the barrels that will keep down the flames a little  the acrobatic youth set off on a sprint in the direction of putnam hall while he was gone the others did their best to subdue the rapidlyincreasing conflagration it was hot work and soon the perspiration was pouring down their faces  its no use panted pepper when the wind sent a sudden eddy of black smoke in his face  it would take a regular fire department to put out that blaze  maybe captain putnam will send out the bucket brigade answered his chum  the wind was steadily increasing and as it whirled around it sent the sparks flying in all directions jack had one ember settle on his hand and pepper was burnt on the ear they got a good deal of smoke in their eyes and soon commenced to cough but they kept on throwing all the loose dirt and stones possible on the fire  i wish the barrels didnt have quite so much tar on em panted pepper its a wonder the roofer left so much inside  he wanted to give you the worth of your money answered the young major grimly  after what seemed a long time a shout was heard and then andy burst into view  the bucket brigade is coming with pails of water he said and some other cadets are to get rakes and wet swabs and shovels  they cant come any too quick answered pepper see two of the trees are burning already  yes and two others are catching announced jack then an extra puff of wind sent all of the cadets from the vicinity of the blazing barrels  i suppose ritter and coulter didnt dream of such a fire when they started it was andys comment  just the same they are responsible answered jack gravely  a yell came from afar and soon some cadets ran into view each carrying a bucket of water leading them was george strong who had a longhandled rake and a shovel  boys boys didnt you know better than to light a fire here cried the teacher  we didnt do it answered jack  the water was thrown on the blazing barrels and then the teacher tried to knock them flat with his rake but that caused a heavy shower of sparks to ascend setting fire to some nearby bushes  it will be better to use the shovel said jack dirt will put out such a fire quicker than anything  i believe you major ruddy answered mr strong and then he sent some cadets back for more shovels and a few pickaxes with which to loosen up the dirt  soon many more cadets arrived and with them captain putnam among the number were coulter and ritter and the pair looked much dismayed  say i didnt think the fire would spread to the woods whispered gus coulter  hush warned his crony dont you admit that we did it if it comes to the worst say it was an accident that we were trying to light a torch to sneak the barrels away when they took fire  all right  more water was thrown on the barrels and then a small army of cadets commenced to dig up dirt and stones with which to cover the burning objects this worked very well on the barrels but to reach the trees was different one thick cedar was blazing away like a torchthe flames far above their heads  let us cut that tree down ordered captain putnam  two axes had been brought along and dale used one while peleg snuggers wielded the other soon the cedar commenced to totter  look out cried captain putnam and then crash the tree came down directly on top of the tarbarrels up went a thick cloud of smoke and sparks but the cadets were ready with dirt and stones and the danger of a new blaze was quickly averted  while the tree was being cut down the cadets and teachers had been busy with pickaxes and shovels and also with their rakes and wet swabs and had put out much of the fire elsewhere one more tree had to be leveled and this work was done by joe and bart then after five minutes more of hard work the last of the fire was extinguished and the crowd in the woods was left in darkness  hello its dark enough now cried pepper well need a lantern to get out with  heres a torch answered one cadet and took up a cedar bough and commenced to wave it into a flame  no more of that bates cried captain putnam we have had enough of fire well go back in the dark snuggers you stay here and see to it that the fire doesnt break out again  yes sir answered the general utility man  here is a pistol if it does break out fire two shots for an alarm  yes sir  ill send alexander pop here with more water and with some lunch for youll have to stay all night went on the owner of the school alexander pop was a colored man who had come to the school to wait on the table  yes sir answered snuggers he did not much relish remaining in the woods all night but he felt that he had to obey orders  one by one the cadets and the teachers returned to putnam hall the conflagration in the woods had rather broken up the anticipated celebration in honor of the football victory  now i want to know who placed those tarbarrels in the woods said captain putnam when he had assembled the cadets in the school building  it was jerry cole the roofer from cedarville answered john fenwick a small youth usually called mumps he was known as a toady and a sneak and was very chummy with dan baxter  how do you know fenwick  i saw him with the barrels on his wagon  why should he put the barrels there  i will tell you answered pepper stepping forward i bought them to celebrate with tonight i thought theyd make a dandy bonfire  indeed then you set them ablaze ditmore  no sir my idea was to roll them to the lakeshore and pile them one on top of the other  then who did set them on fire in the woods  for the moment nobody spoke but pepper jack and andy as well as joe looked at reff ritter and gus coulter  i want an answer cried captain putnam sternly who started that fire  he looked around from one cadet to another but nobody spoke     chapter xi  a mysterious happening   it was a rule of honor among the cadets of putnam hall that no student should tell on another to do that would have been to put ones self down as a sneak and none of our friends wanted such a reputation  i ask again who started that fire went on captain putnam with increased sternness  i rather think i know the guilty parties said george strong who had walked away on an errand and had just returned ritter and coulter what have you to say  the two culprits started and coulter turned pale  why ier stammered gus ithat is he did not know how to proceed he did not dare deny his guilt not knowing but what the assistant teacher might have seen him and his crony light the tarbarrels  well if youerwant to know the truth captain putnam weerstarted the fire stammered reff ritter but it was an accident  an accident  yes sir we wereergoing to roll the barrels down to the lakegoing to hide em so that ditmore and his friends couldnt find em you know well we didnt want to get the tar on our hands so weerstarted a little fire to see byit was dark under the trees all of a sudden the barrels blazed up weerdidnt expect such a big blaze  thats it cried coulter eagerly we just made the fire at first to see by  then you didnt really want to fire the barrels under the trees  no sir came from both of the guilty ones  it was a rash thing to do to start such a blaze in this wind you might have burnt down the whole woods and endangered the school buildings  i dont believe ritter and coulter whispered andy to pepper  neither do i was the reply  ditmore you said the barrels belonged to you went on the owner of the school  yes sir i bought them from the tarroofer in cedarville and he delivered them we were going to have a great bonfireand we did and the imp said this so dryly that even captain putnam had to smile  well i presume i shall have to drop the matter said the captain after a few more questions but let me warn you all about fires in those woods in the future if a fire gained headway here we might burn everything down to the ground  so from an official standpoint the matter was dropped ritter beckoned to coulter and they hurried away followed by nick paxton and one or two others  well that ends the tarbarrel celebration said pepper rather mournfully i really ought to make ritter and coulter pay for the barrels  you wont get any money out of ritter remarked bart conners  how do you know bart  because he hasnt any he asked for credit at the store yesterdayto buy some cigarettesand the shopkeeper refused saying ritter owed him eighty cents already  humph mused pepper and said no more  come onforget it cried jack well celebrate anyway  weve got other barrels came from dale  the cadets rushed out and to the lakeshore and soon several bonfires were blazing merrily around these the students congregated and sang songs and cut up generally dale had to make a speech and the boys caught him up on their shoulders and carried him around the campus  isnt it grand murmured bert field i am mighty glad i came to putnam hall  so am i answered fred century its much different from what it was at pornell academy  it was a great victory fred wasnt it  it certainly was bert i am only sorry for one thing  what is that  that it wasnt pornell we beat instead of that other club  oh well well get a chance at pornell some day answered bert field  the celebration along the lakeshore lasted until halfpast eleven then the bell was rung and laughing and singing the cadets trooped off to their various dormitories  all quiet by midnight came the order  fifteen minutes yet cried andy consulting his watch whoopla here goes and in the joyousness of high spirits he turned a handspring over one of the beds then he turned another spring over a table and stood on his head on one of the chairs  hurrah for snows imperial consolidated circus cried pepper the one and only aggregation of stupendous wonders on the face of the globe the marvelous twisting and deathdefying acrobat walk up and see the bloodcurdling exhibition it will cost you but the small sum of a dime ten cents children double price and no grandfathers unaccompanied by their parents admitted line will form on the left and everybody will please have his cash ready transfers not accepted on this line  good for pepper came from jack when he fails as a student he can turn dimemuseum shouter  on the right you will see our most mysterious wonder major jacobus ruddonowsky the royal russian sword swallower went on the imp pointing to his chum he swallows two swords for breakfast three for lunch and six to eight for dinner with daggers for dessert he is wonderfully strong and can carry on his arms an amount of gold lace that would break a camels back as soon as the tent is full he will sing for you that famous ditty entitled how i love to line you up when im major of the gang  wow that is where you caught it jack cried dale with a grin  and here we have a third wonder went on pepper pointing to the football captain commodore daleo the leatherball juggler the most renowned juggler of the spheroid in the world you think it is here but it is not for lo he has juggled it over the line and kicked it as high as an airship he will show you  silence in here came a voice from the doorway and josiah crabtree appeared i will have silence  oh dear murmured pepper anybody got any silence to spare mr crabtree wants some  you must all be in bed by midnight and the light must be out went on the teacher this unseemly revel must cease and then he walked on to stop the noise coming from the other dormitories  say pepper how do you like that murmured fred  i knew there would be frost sighed the imp every time old crabtree appears we get a cold wave  be thankful he didnt mark you down for extra lessons said andy  if he did that id rebel returned pepper  after that the talk was carried on in whispers and each cadet lost no time in disrobing a few minutes after midnight all were in bed and one after another lost himself in the land of dreams  the day had been a particularly strenuous one for jack and the young major slept soundly until the risingbell rang loudly then he rubbed his eyes sleepily and stretched himself  wish i didnt have to get up just yet he murmured i could sleep another hour without half trying  same here responded pepper  i never feel awake until after ive had a wash came from andy who had just leaped up  soon all of the cadets in the dormitory were dressing and one by one they washed up and went below andy and jack were the last to leave  whats the matter asked the acrobatic youth as he saw the young major searching around for something  im looking for my watch and chain andy  where did you put it  where i always doon the stand at the head of my bed  maybe it fell on the floor  if it did it isnt there now jack got down on his knees to look around and then turned over the bedclothes and some other things  maybe pepper played a joke on you jack  that may be so ill go down and ask him about it  the young major looked through his clothing and all over the dormitory and then hurried below as it was sunday morning there was no drill and the cadets were gathering in the messhall for breakfast  pepper did you see my watch asked jack coming up to his chum  your watch no was the ready reply  you didnt cried the young major and now he was more concerned than ever  saw it last night when you put it on the stand as usual  you didnt hide it come now tell the truth  honor bright the last i saw of it was when you placed it on the stand when you went to bed  its gone and the chain with it  you dont mean it jack did you look all around  everywhere  did you ask the other fellows about it  no but i will right away  the young major walked to one roommate after another and asked about his watch and chain all denied knowing anything about the timepiece several had seen him place the watch on the stand at the head of the bed but that was all  well its a mystery what has become of it thats sure was jacks comment it certainly couldnt walk off by itself  well a good watch knows how to run remarked pepper dryly for he couldnt help having his joke but seriously jack do you think somebody stole the watch and chain  i dont know what to think  i dont imagine anybody in our dormitory would do such a thing  neither do i but the watch and chain are gone the question is where  hadnt you better report the matter to captain putnam  i will after i have taken another look around answered the young major and left the messroom just as the bell rang for breakfast  why did major ruddy leave asked josiah crabtree harshly as he saw that the young officer was missing  he had something of importance to attend to answered pepper  humph it is his duty to be at the table on time if he wants his breakfast muttered the dictatorial teacher  jack did not come back for the best part of half an hour by that time the breakfast was nearly over  major ruddy what does this mean demanded josiah crabtree  a matter of importance mr crabtree answered the young officer  i cannot permit cadets to come in late to breakfast  this couldnt be helped sir i will explain to you and to captain putnam directly after i have finished  very well if it is of real importance i will let it pass but otherwise i shall mark you for being tardy returned josiah crabtree harshly  jack merely bowed and then he sat down and ate his breakfast while he was doing so pepper leaned over to him  find the watch he whispered  nonot the least trace of it answered jack  the young major did not feel much like eating the watch was a gold one and the chain was also of gold and both were valuable they had been a birthday gift from his parents  say jack this is as bad as my loss came from andy in a low tone what are you going to do about it  i dont know i want to talk the matter over with captain putnam first answered the young officer     chapter xii  an invitation accepted   captain putnam looked very grave when jack reported the loss of the gold watch and chain  you are certain you left them on the stand when you went to sleep he questioned  yes sir pepper ditmore saw me put them there and dale blackmore saw it too  and you have looked everywhere for them  yes sir  i will go up and look around with you  all right sir but it will do no good answered the young major  you say that all your roommates deny taking the watch and chain  yes sir they say they didnt see the watch at all after we went to bed  major ruddy do you suspect anybody of this crime demanded the owner of the school looking jack full in the face  no sir was the prompt answer its a complete mystery to me all i know about it is that i left the watch and chain on the stand at the head of my bed when i went to sleep and this morning they were gone  did any of the other cadets enter your dormitory during the night  not that i know of  they may have been skylarking and may have carried the watch and chain off byaccident let us say finished the captain significantly  if anybody came in nobody who sleeps in our room seems to be aware of it  captain putnam and jack passed up to the dormitory followed by josiah crabtree they were soon joined by pepper and the other occupants of the apartment another search was made but the gold watch and chain were not found nor were any clues concerning the timepiece unearthed  what were the watch and chain worth asked fred  i dont know maybe fifty or sixty dollars answered jack  then if they were stolen the thief made quite a haul  do you think they were stolen century demanded the owner of the school  doesnt it look like it sir  but if they were stolen who is guilty asked josiah crabtree glaring around from one cadet to another  for the moment nobody spoke  i dont suspect any of my roommates said jack quickly i think it was done by some outsider  some other cadet asked crabtree  possibly or else by some of the help  gracious ruddy ieri hope you dont suspect me stammered the teacher  no sir i meant some of the servants  ah i see josiah crabtree looked relieved you may be right perhaps some of the new colored help took the watch he went on to captain putnam  i will start an investigation returned the owner of the school  captain putnam was as good as his word and over an hour was spent in questioning the help and the other cadets but without results the investigation was continued monday morning but not the first trace of the missing watch and chain was discovered anywhere  it assuredly is a mystery said captain putnam at last what do you make of it mr strong he asked of his second assistant  it is a very unfortunate occurrence answered george strong if there is a thief in putnam hall we ought to locate him as long as he remains undetected none of us will be safe  how are you going to catch him  i dont know we might try to trace up the watch and chain through the authorities  i hate to let the authorities know anything has been stolen in the school it gives us a bad name in public the two men were alone so they could speak freely  it will give the school a worse name if we dont get the watch and chain back i am afraid major ruddy can hold you for the worth of them  he can and i expect to pay for them if we dont get them back i will think it over and perhaps ill report the loss  later on the authorities were notified that a watch and chain were missing no details were given but the police were asked to look out for the watch and chain in pawnbroking establishments and elsewhere  i shall also offer a reward said the owner of the school and the next day a bulletin was posted offering a reward of ten dollars for information leading to the recovery of the timepiece and conviction of the thief  its tough to go without your watch jack said pepper  captain putnam is going to loan me one for the present was the young majors reply its only a silver affair but he says it keeps good time and thats the main thing  a day or two after the reward was offered jack pepper and andy received an invitation to take dinner at point view lodge with the fords and spend the evening there the weather was now growing colder and the fords expected before long to close up their summer home and move to the city for the winter  say this is all to the merry cried pepper as he read the invitation of course well go  if captain putnam will let us added andy anxiously  i think he will returned jack he is so cut up over this watch affair i think he will do almost anything for me  the three went to the captain and showed the invitation and were told that they could go to point view lodge but that they must be back at putnam hall by ten oclock  its lucky we can go in our uniforms said pepper otherwise i suppose wed have to go in full dress eh  sure thing  how are we going to get to the lodge we cant walk  might hire a carriage for once  too slow the lodge is so far off we could make better time on our bicycles  but if it rainsor snows  then well have to take a carriage  the three cadets watched the weather anxiously it remained clear and cool up to the afternoon of the day they were going and then grew cloudy  looks like rain or snow to me announced jack  oh dont croak cried andy its a bit cloudy but thats all i guess it will hold off until morning  got your bicycle ready for the trip andy questioned pepper  sure i oiled up this morning how about you  ready since yesterday and jacks wheel is ready too was the answer oh say dont you anticipate a dandy time at point view lodge  yes indeed the ford girls are just all right  best ever chimed in jack  dont forget to fill your lamps cried andy as he turned away  mine is full answered jack  ill see to mine came from pepper glad you mentioned it it will be quite dark on the road tonight and i dont want to run in a hole and take a header  none of us want to do that wed look fine going into the lodge with our faces and hands all dirt and our uniforms torn  the cadets hurried away in various directions they had been talking in the gymnasium near one of the dressingrooms and they did not know that anybody else was near but mumps the sneak had overheard every word as soon as they had gone the younger cadet hurried off toward the boathouse here he found half a dozen students assembled including ritter and coulter  say do you fellows know that ruddy ditmore and snow are going out tonight he said he always loved to tell the news and thought himself quite important in so doing  where to asked one of the cadets  to point view lodgethe place where the ford family live theyve got an invitation to dinner  lucky dogs came from another cadet as he spoke he looked at reff ritter but that individual merely scowled and took surreptitious whiffs at a cigarette he was smoking  how are they going to point view asked another who was present  going on their bicycles answered mumps its quite a ride isnt it  oh not for them they can make it in half an hour if they try but theyll find it pretty dark tonight im thinking added the cadet with a glance out of the boathouse window at the leaden sky  the talk continued and ritter listened closely to every word then he arose and motioned to coulter and the two walked outside  did you hear what mumps said he asked of his crony  about those chaps going to the fords home  yes  what of it  i was thinking we might spoil their fun  and get caught as we did with the tarbarrels grumbled gus coulter  well take good care that nobody sees us this time  what are you thinking of doing asked coulter curiously  come with me and ill tell you answered reff ritter and took his crony by the arm slowly they walked across the campus and as they did so ritter unfolded a plot that had just then come into his head  what do you think of it he asked after he had finished  very good if it will work and we are not caught  well not get caught if youll do as i say listen gus all you need to do is to stand on guard to give me warning if anybody comes ill do the rest  when do you want to get to work  reff ritter looked around anxiously it was cold on the campus and growing darker rapidly only a few cadets were in sight  come on now he answered well see if the coast is clear  they walked to the end of the gymnasium building where in a long room the bicycles of the students were kept it was pitch dark inside and not a soul was in sight  now you remain outside said ritter if you see anybody coming begin to whistle yankee doodle as loud as you can dont wait for me for ill go out the back way  all right but let me know when you are through answered coulter somewhat nervously  sure  coulter took his stand outside of the building and peered forth eagerly in the darkness only three cadets were in view and they presently entered the school building then ten minutes went bya long wait for the youth who was aiding ritter in his plot then reff came quickly from the gymnasium  anybody around he asked hurriedly  no  good enough  have you finished reff  yes  did you get at all three of the wheels  i sure did say they will have their own troubles see if they dont chuckled the bully but come on before anybody sees us he added and stalked away in the darkness with his crony beside him     chapter xiii  the work of the enemy   it was not until a few minutes after five oclock that jack andy and pepper hurried down to the gymnasium to get their wheels at the last moment andy discovered that one of his buttons was loose and had to be sewed on and jack had trouble with the new cap he was going to wear it was a trifle too large and he had to place a strip of paper under the band to make it stay on his head properly  it certainly feels like snow said pepper as the three got out their bicycles i am sure well get a snowstorm before long  i dont care if only it holds off till we get back returned andy  they lit the acetylene gas lamps with which their wheels were provided and then ran the bicycles down to the roadway  have a good time cried stuffer who had come out to see them off  dont worry about that replied pepper gaily  ill wager youll have a dandy spread went on the lad who loved to eat  wish you were along stuffer asked jack  do i well now dont mention it and stuffers eyes fairly watered in anticipation  ill bring you something if i get the chance sang out pepper as he gave his bicycle a shove and leaped into the saddle solong  jack and andy followed their chum and with a parting cry to stuffer all three pedaled along the highway leading to point view lodge it was now night but the three gaslamps lit up the road so well that they had little difficulty in finding their way  we are not due until six oclock said jack so we can take it easy no use of getting into a perspiration over it  well not sweat much tonight answered pepper too cold i move we keep at it until we reach that old barn near the lodge then we can rest a bit so that we wont appear at the place all out of breath  two miles were covered and then they came to a place where the highway was unusually rough  let me go ahead and pick the way sang out andy and forged to the front  better slack up a little returned the young major no use of taking chances when we have plenty of time  scarcely had he uttered the words when there came a cry from the acrobatic youth his wheel commenced to wobble and twist over into some bushes he shot to fall with a crash in their midst  hello whats the matter with you sang out pepper and leaped quickly to the road an example followed by jack  bicycle has gone to pieces i guess spluttered andy as he essayed to scramble out of the bushes  are you hurt demanded jack anxiously  only a few scratches jack say that was a narrow escape wasnt it  thought you said your wheel was in good condition came from pepper  so it was when i looked at it this morning  whats wrong now  the handlebars are loose for one thing i dont know what else is wrong until i look it over  the machine was brought forth from the bushes the lampglass had been smashed and the light had gone out andy stopped the flow of acetylene gas and then his chums turned the rays of the other lamps on the disabled bicycle  handlebars loose and also nuts on the front wheel cried andy after an examination say i believe some enemy did this  who questioned the young major  i dont know maybe ritter or coulter  hurry up and tighten things cried pepper we dont want to be late  better be late than have a nasty tumble returned jack while you are at it andy better look the whole machine over carefully  i will jack and maybe you had better look your machines over too  good advice  while andy was fixing his bicycle pepper and the young major inspected their own bicycles  well i never gasped the imp as the light fell on his rear wheel another quarter of a mile and i would have had a spill and no mistake  same here came from jack oh isnt this the worst yet  whats wrong queried the acrobatic youth  the back wheel is loose and two of the sprockets of the sprocketwheel have been filed down to let the chain slip answered pepper  and my handlebars are loose and the chain all but filed in two cried jack boys this was done on purpose  of course came from both of the others  done by our enemies  sure  ritter and his cronies  well wed have to prove that answered andy slowly  dont you believe it andy  i do but that isnt proof  and that isnt getting us to point view lodge came from pepper i guess well have to walk he added with something like a groan  walk we cant walk that distance replied the young major  well we cant trust ourselves on these machines we might if we had lots of time but that we havent got  the three cadets stared blankly at each other here they were on a lonely road and what to do none of them knew  oh if i only had ritter here wouldnt i punch his head good muttered pepper  ritter will keep let us look over the machines and make up our minds what is to be done said jack  the more they inspected the wheels the more hopeless appeared the task of fixing them up so they could be used  we simply havent got time to bother with them announced jack weve got to get to the lodge some other way  well what way asked andy  i wonder if we could hire a rig at the next farmhouse  well we can try that answered pepper  trundling their bicycles they hurried along the country road until they reached a farmhouse  looks as if they were all out or gone to bed was jacks comment for not a light showed about the place  well soon know returned pepper and he pounded lustily on the front door  there was no answer to this summons and he pounded again but nobody appeared  gone away for the day i guess he said now what  let us leave our wheels in the barn said jack we can come back for them any time  this they did and after a look around the place to make certain nobody was there they passed out on the road once more pepper looked at his watch  fifteen minutes to six he announced  oh well never get there on time groaned andy  well be lucky if we get there at all tonight answered the young major  they are looking for us by now came from pepper wonder what they will think when we dont show up  theyll think we are pretty mean i guess answered the acrobatic youth  here comes some kind of a turnout now cried pepper  he pointed down the highway they could see a lantern swinging idly to and fro it was hung under a farmwagon and presently they saw the turnout drawn by a pair of goodlooking horses the wagon was filled with barrels of potatoes and on the seat sat a rawboned old farmer half asleep  hello there challenged jack out of the darkness hold up a minute please  hi whats this a holdup exclaimed the old farmer and then of a sudden he reached between the barrels of potatoes and brought forth a long horsepistol and pointed it at them  dont shoot cried pepper thinking the old fellow might be just scared enough to pull the trigger of his ancient weapon this isnt any holdup  who be you and the farmer peered forth anxiously in the darkness  we are cadets from putnam hall  oh i see waal dont ye try to play no trick on ezra cole or ill let fly with this hosspistol sure ez youre born  we dont want to play any tricks mr cole answered jack we are in trouble and i was wondering if you could help us out  wots the trouble  in as few words as possible the young major and his chums explained the difficulty the old farmer listened with interest  i know mr ford he buys garden sass from me he said  we dont know how we are going to get to the lodge unless we can find somebody to drive us over said pepper could you do it if we paid you  wot with this load o potatoes not much  couldnt you leave your potatoes here asked andy ill give you fifty cents to drive me over  and so will i added pepper  that will be a dollar and a half for the three of us mr cole put in jack  hum the old farmer began to look interested its a putty stiff drive to point view an id have to come back fer the potatoes  make it two dollars cried jack and do it as quickly as you can  hum got the cash with you young man  yes here it is and the young major held up two onedollar bills  all right im your man cried ezra cole i aint in no hurry to git to hum an two dollars aint picked up every day jest wait till i drive in an leave my potatoes where they will be safe  might leave em with our bicycles said jack  so i will  it did not take the old farmer long to unload his barrels of potatoes then he swept out his farmwagon and spread some horseblankets for the boys to sit upon they leaped in and he took up the lines once more  glang he shouted to his team and cracked his whip and off they went along the road at a good gait  great julius cæsar cried andy after a quarter of a mile had been passed talk about bumping the bumps this road has em beaten to a frazzle  getting your moneys worth andy asked the imp with a grin  aint no springs on this wagon said ezra cole with a grin but dont you mind it will give you a fine appetite fer that dinner when you git there  it will if it doesnt knock out our teeth so we cant chew murmured jack  on and on they rattled at a good pace until the lights of point view lodge shone in the distance  just drop us off at the gate cried jack we dont want to ride up to the piazza in such a rig as this  why hello have you arrived at last cried a voice from out of the darkness and then laura and flossie appeared standing by the gate the three cadets looked glumly at each other and then pepper commenced to snicker and all burst into a hearty spell of laughter     chapter xiv  at the ford mansion   dont you admire our very fashionable turnout questioned pepper as he came forward and shook hands with the girls  its the latest in carriages came from andy  oh murmured laura did you really come all the way from putnam hall in that  it must have been hard riding was flossies comment  no we didnt come all the way answered pepper well tell you about it later he added then ezra cole was paid the old farmer lost no time in driving away  as the girls and boys walked slowly toward the mansion the cadets told the particulars of the breakdown on the road  and you really think some of your rivals did it questioned laura how mean  id never speak to them again added flossie with a flash of her eyes  well well talk a whole lot to em answered pepper grimly  but you have got to prove them guilty first said laura  once at the mansion the situation was explained to mr and mrs ford and the boys were conducted by a servant to a bathroom where they might wash and brush up and make themselves otherwise presentable they did not linger long and when they came below the foldingdoors to the diningroom were opened and the butler announced dinner  it was a jolly meal and the cadets were made to feel perfectly at home mr ford asked them how they were getting along in school and was surprised when told that they hoped to graduate from the hall the following june  we shall miss your visits to the lodge said mrs ford  youll have to visit us anywayif you get a chance said laura and all of the cadets said they would remember her kind words then they talked about old times and especially about the time when the boys had visited the lodge and killed the tiger that had escaped from the circus as related in the putnam hall cadets and of how the girls had visited the cadets in the woods when the boys had run away from the hall as told of in the putnam hall rebellion  id like to go to a boardingschool said flossie it must be lots of fun  fun and work mixed answered andy  after the dinner over which they took their time the young folks gathered around the piano and sang and played and they also had several dances with the old folks looking on all too soon it came time for the boys to go back to the hall  i have ordered the auto around said rossmore ford john can take you back and he can also stop for your bicycles if you wish  thank you very much answered jack well ride home in the auto with pleasure but i guess we had better let the bicycles rest tonight where they are eh fellows  yes answered pepper and andy  a little later the cadets said goodnight the big touring car was brought around and they got in the tonneau then the chauffeur turned on the power and away they shot into the darkness the girls crying a goodby after them  well we had a dandy time in spite of the breakdown remarked the young major  but we have got to find out who played this trick on us came from pepper  that may be easier said than done said andy whoever was mean enough to play such a trick will do his best to lay low  when the boys got back to the hall they found that the majority of their friends had gone to bed only stuffer singleton was up reading a novel by the light of a waxcandle he had smuggled up to the room  hello have a good time queried the boy who loved to eat as he cast aside the volume  bang up answered jack and then he went on quickly stuffer were you near the gym this afternoon  no why  somebody was mean enough to tamper with our bicycles answered the young major and gave a few particulars  oh you can bet it was the ritter crowd or ritter alone said stuffer quickly it would be just like them to do their best to spoil your fun  it was not until two days later that jack and his chums had a chance to go for their brokendown wheels they found them exactly as they had been left and explained to the owner of the barn how they happened to be there  its all right said the farmer you can leave them here a month if you want to he knew captain putnam well having sold him some straw for the school stables  the cadets had to trundle the bicycles back to putnam hall and then had many hours work in fixing the wheels so they could be used again  during those two days the youths made many inquiries but were unable to get a clue as to who had played the trick ritter and coulter laid low and kept out of their way  following the game with the dauntless club came several other football contests and putnam hall won two games and lost one then the weather turned off cold with a promise of snow in the air  during those days it must not be supposed that the search for jacks gold watch and chain was abandoned it was continued with spirit but no clue was brought to light  its as much of a mystery as the disappearance of my things when the horse ran away with me said andy i dont suppose ill ever hear of those things either  yes but that was different andy said the young major you were on a public highway where anybody might pick up the things supposing you merely dropped them but i was right here where everybody is supposed to be honest  it gives the school a black eye doesnt it  thats it i know captain putnam feels terrible about it too  do you suspect any of the hired help  i dont know what to think  the weather grew colder rapidly and one morning the cadets arose to find the ground covered with snow to a depth of several inches  hurrah shouted fred see the snow doesnt it look inviting  want a roll in it fred questioned bart field  not exactly i was thinking of a snowball fight  thats the talk let us get up a fight after school hours cried bart conners  pepper was at the window slyly he raised the sash and scooped up a big handful of snow from the broad ledge outside andy was nearby bending over lacing up his shoe  welcome to the snow cried the imp gaily and let a portion of the frozen mass slip down the acrobatic youths collar  wow snorted andy straightening up with a jerk hi you what do you take me for an icebox and he commenced to squirm as the cold snow ran down his backbone then he made a dive for pepper and chased the imp around the dormitory over two of the beds they flew and then brought up in a corner with a crash  have mercy on the furniture cried joe nelson  dont knock over the table added stuffer  give me that snow cried andy and managed to get a small portion from pepper how do you like that and he plastered the snow in the imps left ear  hurrah snow from snow cried jack  twill warm peppers blood so it will was emerald hogans comment  more snow had been scooped from the windowsill by fred and joe and soon a battleroyal was in progress in the dormitory but it came to an abrupt end when dave kearney appeared  stop it cried the young sergeant crabtree is coming  all over whispered jack all as orderly as lambs and at once every cadet settled down and started in an orderly fashion to finish his morning toilet  what was the noise in here demanded josiah crabtree as he threw open the door and strode into the dormitory  he glared around savagely but nobody answered him  i demand to know what was going on here he continued  mr crabtree did you speak to me asked pepper meekly  i spoke to you all thundered the teacher what were you doing in here  i am dressing mr crabtree answered andy  i am dressing mr crabtree came from jack  i am dressing too put in fred  and so was i dressing said stuffer with a smile  and i was dressing supplemented pepper come to think of it i rather fancy we were all dressing you see we always do dress when we get up in the morning mr crabtree he added with a simple smile  i want none of your impudence ditmore  oh dear was i impudent murmured the imp i didnt know it i beg ten thousand pardonsyes a million if youd rather sir  be quiet youyou forward boy something was going on in here if i find out what it was i shall punish all of you and having thus delivered himself josiah crabtree strode out of the dormitory banging the door after him  isnt he an angel murmured andy  the sweetest teacher that ever grew returned pepper  id like to know how long captain putnam will put up with him was jacks comment  i dont believe it will be very long answered fred  the cadets finished their dressing and hurried below on account of the storm the morning drill was held in the gymnasium and then the young soldiers marched to the messroom on the way several could not resist the temptation to pick up some snow and throw it at each other  hi you stop that roared reff ritter as a snowball took him in the neck who threw that he demanded but nobody answered him i believe it was you ditmore he went on turning an ugly look on pepper  thats one for tampering with our bicycles ritter retorted pepper  it was a chance shot taken on the spur of the moment but it told reff ritter started and turned pale  whoertold you iertampered with your bicycles he stammered  never mind who told me ritter we are going to get square with you and dont you forget it  who said i touched em grumbled the bully  never mind about that  you are trying to corner me that whats you are up to grumbled ritter but you shant do it i never touched your wheels and you cant prove that i did now dont you throw any more snowballs at me or ill report you and then ritter hurried into the messroom as fast as he could  pepper jack and andy looked at each other  he is guilty i know it said pepper firmly  i believe you answered the young major and andy nodded his head to show that he agreed with his chums     chapter xv  the snowball battle   now then fellows for the greatest snowball battle of the age  here is where company a smothers company b  rats you mean that company b will bury company a out of sight  hi major ruddy what side are you going on queried bart conners who still commanded company b  he is coming on our side answered henry lee the captain of the other company  well i cant fight on both sides answered the young major with a laugh  go with the company that wins suggested pepper with a grin  toss up a cent for it suggested andy  all right ill toss up answered jack and did so and it was decided that he should fight with company b  good enough cried pepper who was in that command now company a is licked sure  not much was the answer from stuffer singleton well win sure  we will unless you stop to eat a doughnut put in joe nelson and at this remark a general laugh went up for stuffer had once lost a longdistance running race because he stopped on the way to devour some cookies he had in his pocket  it was after school hours and the cadets had gathered on the field where during the summer corn had been raised it was to be a battle between the two companies of the school battalion with the company captain as leader on each side  the preliminary rules were speedily arranged lines were drawn at either end of the field about five hundred feet apart in the center about a hundred feet apart two other lines were drawn along the latter lines the cadets arranged themselves  now then fighting will begin when the schoolbell rings out four cried the cadet who had been made referee the company that chases the other company over its back line wins the contest no fighting with anything but snow allowed anybody using his fists or a stone or a lump of ice will be ruled out of the contest  with all possible speed the young soldiers started to supply themselves with snowballs and soon each had ten to twenty in his hands and pockets and under his arms or at his feet  get ready shouted bart as he glanced hastily at his watch  give it to em hot when the bell rings came from henry lee  half a minute more and the hall bell commenced to toll out the hour the bell had not yet ceased to ring when there came a grand shower of snowballs from each company the shower was so thick that a few of the snowballs hit each other  forward shouted captain bart  forward echoed captain henry  and then the two long lines of cadets rushed forward over the snowcovered field until they were within thirty or forty feet of each other then came another shower of snowballs  wow yelled one cadet oh my nose  cæsars helmet that hit me in the eye came from another  say dont try to knock out all my teeth added a third  charge yelled the captain of company a charge get em on the run right now  stand firm came from the commander of company b now then fire  the rush of company a was met with an extra heavy volley of snowballs the cadets staggered under the onslaught and then came to a halt  now then up and at em yelled captain bart and yelling like wild indians his command charged on company a the snowballs flew thick and fast and slowly but surely company a was forced to give ground until it stood on the line from which it had started but by that time company b was out of ammunition and had to pause to manufacture more snowballs  in the ranks of company a were ritter coulter and paxton paxton had of late somewhat dropped the others but reff and gus were as thick as ever they were now standing side by side  say id like to give it to ruddy and those others muttered coulter  so would i whispered ritter in return confound em id like to know if they really know the truth about the bicycles  i dont see how they found out nobody was around when you fixed em up  maybe somebody was spying that sneak of a mumps for instance  if he was and told on us ill fix him for it  both cadets were making snowballs near a hollow as ritter scraped the snow up he uncovered several jagged stones  say look here he whispered and pointed at the stones lets fix up some special snowballs for ruddy  company he added with a knowing look at his crony  all right but be careful you are not caught answered gus coulter  both cadets got down close to the jagged stones and adroitly slipped several of them into the snowballs they were making  wait till we are pretty close directed ritter then let drive for all you are worth  who will you aim at  ruddy and ditmore  all right ill aim at snow and ill let ruddy have one too  again came a ringing warcry and in a moment more the battle was continued back and forth swayed the lines of cadets first towards one end of the field and then towards the other it was plainly to be seen that the commands were about evenly matched  how long is this battle to last questioned joe nelson  half an hour answered fred century who was beside him  time is almost up then came from bert field who had been fighting so hard he was almost out of breath  five minutes more came from the referee now then if either side is going to do something pitch in  forward came simultaneously from both captains and forward plunged company a and company b and the snowballs commenced to fly as thickly as before neither side would give ground and at last the two lines were within fifteen to twenty feet of each other right in the center of the field  the time was almost up and each command was getting rid of the last of the snowballs when jack saw a snowball leave coulters hand and sail swiftly towards pepper the imp did not see it until it was quite close to him and failed in his attempt to dodge the snowball hit him full in the temple and over he went as if struck with a club  pepper cried the young major in horror and started to rush to his chums assistance when another snowball came flying through the air it struck jack over the ear and he too went down all but knocked unconscious  a bugle blew and the great snowballing contest came to an end  a tie a tie was the cry neither side wins  let the two captains shake hands and call it off said one cadet  im willing cried bart readily  so am i added henry and then the pair shook hands while a great cheer rolled up from both sides but the cheer came to an abrupt end when fred century cried out  pepper ditmore is hurt  and so is major ruddy came from emerald hogan  a crowd quickly gathered around each wounded cadet pepper had a nasty cut over the left eye and jack had a lump behind his right ear  they must have been hit with soakers was dales comment as he bent over pepper  looks as if pepper was hit with a stone came from andy  a stone cried bart field  yes a stone that cut was never made by a snowball or a piece of ice either  shall i get a doctor asked stuffer anxiously  oh are they as bad as that asked bob grenwood  i dont know answered bert soberly wait a minute and well see if they come around  oh what a crack murmured jack and then he sat up and stared around him pepper was also stirring and he slowly put one hand to the cut on his temple  let us carry em to the hall suggested bert its getting too cold out here and besides they are all in a sweat from the snowballing  when pepper was picked up andy saw something lying beneath him in the snow he picked it up  hello look here he called out and held the object up  a stone  where did it come from andy  it was under peppers body i believe it was in the snowball that hit him  who would be so mean  i rather guess i know answered pepper and looked around for ritter and coulter but the bully and his crony had disappeared  pepper and jack were carried tenderly into the hall and placed in easy chairs in the reception room presently both had recovered consciousness fully and each had his head bound up in bandages  phew but that was a crack i got sighed the imp i thought a rock had hit me  it was coulter who threw that snowball said the young major i saw him do it and i was running to help you up when i got struck myself and went down  and i am pretty sure ritter hit you jack came from andy anyway i saw him aiming for you just before you staggered and fell  andy those fellows must have hit us with stones muttered the imp  i feel sure they did ritter struck me with a snowball on the hand and it left a deep scratch now no ordinary snowball would do that besides that i picked up a sharp stone from where pepper was lying  it was against the rules of the contest to use stones put in dale who was near  sure it was cried stuffer if those chaps really used stones they ought to be punished for it  the news quickly went the rounds as was to be expected when henry lee heard it he quickly sought out captain bart  i hope you dont think i allowed any such underhand work he said anxiously  not for a minute henry cried the captain of company b if ritter and coulter did it they did it on their own responsibility i think them just mean enough too for they are down on major ruddy and pepper ditmore  if they are guilty id like to have them courtmartialed muttered the commander of company a such underhand work is a disgrace to putnam hall  wait and see if it can be proven answered bart conners then if it is proven well read ritter and coulter a lecture they wont forget in a hurry he added significantly     chapter xvi  in which more valuables vanish   that night it snowed again and in the morning the storm raged furiously around putnam hall so that the landscape on all sides was completely blotted out the cadets had to remain indoors and it was hard work to keep a path clear to the gymnasium and the stables  well be snowbound and no mistake observed andy well i dont care much it will give me a chance to catch up in my lessons  very far behind andy asked jack  more than i like to think about jack i want to graduate with honor you know  oh we all want to do that  hows the head  still sore but i guess ill be all right again in a few days  how about you pepper  ill be all right too andy but it was a fierce crack added pepper as his hand went up gingerly to his plasteredup cut  going to lodge a complaint against ritter and coulter  what good would it do we cant actually prove that they used stones  let it pass if we make a complaint it will only stir up more bad blood said the young major but in the future i am going to watch ritter and coulter pretty closely  the boys were kept at the hall for all of that week getting no further than the gymnasium for recreation the wind blew furiously at times so that the snow was piled up into numerous drifts one reaching almost to the top of the carriageshed and another completely hiding the posts of the gate entrance  this must be tough on some of the farmers observed dale think of trying to get the milk to the station in such weather  well a farmer usually has enough to eat answered stuffer that counts for a good deal now if a fellow was snowbound and didnt have any grub he did not finish but shook his head dolefully to stuffer such a fate was beyond words  as was to be expected ritter and coulter kept out of the way of jack and pepper once the young major met the pair on the stairs but they simply glared at him and passed on before he could say a word  during all this time captain putnam had been doing his best to solve the mystery concerning the disappearance of jacks gold watch and chain but though all the hired help and the cadets and teachers were watched and questioned nothing of importance came to light peleg snuggers said he had once seen a strange man near the stables and captain putnam wondered if that individual could have sneaked into the school and committed the robbery  but if he did that why didnt he take more he said in speaking of the matter to george strong  i am sure i dont know sir answered the teacher for the matter of that why wouldnt any thief take more if he had the chance  i give it up strong this thing makes me feel sick  well we must keep our eyes open answered george strong and then the conversation changed to the lessons for the next day  on tuesday morning pepper chanced to go to a bureaudrawer in which he kept his collars cuffs neckties and jewelry he commenced to look for something and ended by turning out everything in the compartment  whats wrong pepper asked jack lost some diamonds  its my ruby scarfpin jack did you see it  no not for some time did you have it in that drawer  i did  when did you wear it last  the night we took dinner with the fords  are you sure you put it back when you came home  positive i keep it in this case and pepper held up an empty jewelry case  gracious this is becoming interesting murmured the young major first my watch and chain and now your scarfpin he looked pointedly at his chum pepper do you think he stopped short  think what jack  oh id hate to say it pepper and the young major shrugged his shoulders  were you going to mention ritter and coulter  i was but maybe it wouldnt be fair its a terrible thing to think anybody a thief  that is true but maybe they took them as a joke and hid them  that is past a joke  pepper continued to hunt around until it was time to go below then he marched straight to captain putnams private office  the captain listened with a sinking heart to what the cadet had to say it was terrible to think that a thief was at large in the school and could not be caught  you are positive that you had the scarfpin when you came home ditmore he questioned  yes sir  and you put it in the case in the drawer  i did  was the drawer locked  part of the time sometimes i forgot and left the key in the lock  what sort of a scarfpin was it  it was a sort of a clover effect of gold with a ruby and three small diamonds  and how much was it worth  i believe my mother paid thirtyfive dollars for it it was a christmas gift so i am not sure about the value  well take another look for it and report to me again tomorrow answered captain putnam with a heavy sigh then of a sudden he added do you suspect anybody of taking the scarfpin  i have no clue whatever to the theft answered pepper slowly  but have you any suspicions ditmore and the masters voice grew a trifle stern  only in a general way  please explain yourself  ieri hardly know what to say sir stammered pepper there may be nothing in it at all  in what come out with it  why you see sir some of the cadets in this school are not good friends with me and major ruddy and maybe they thought they would play a trick on us by taking his watch and chain and my scarfpin  humph a mighty poor trick who are those cadets  i dont want to accuse them captain putnam  i understand but who are the cadets  reff ritter and gus coulter  oh yes i remember now you and major ruddy have had quite some trouble with them in the past  yes sir but id hate to think they did such a mean thing as this added pepper hastily  well take a look around and report again tomorrow returned captain putnam and then closed his desk slowly and thoughtfully  pepper did take a look around but it was of no use not a trace of the missing scarfpin could be found  this certainly beats the nation remarked dale when the cadets were talking the affair over first andy loses his jewelry then jack and now pepper wonder if i hadnt better put my cufflinks in the captains safe and he cut a wry face they cost me a dollar and a quarter  ill wager captain putnam would give a good deal to catch the thief remarked stuffer say pep i hope you dont suspect anybody in this dormitory he added anxiously  no stuffer was the quick answer then pepper broke into a grin of course if it was a doughnut or a pie id suspect you right off  huh its no crime to take something to eat grunted stuffer  id hate to think any cadet was guilty came from emerald twould blacken the character of the whole school so it would  well jack and pepper have some bitter enemies said dale significantly and all present knew to whom he referred  well you cant always tell said dale and shrugged his broad shoulders  at that moment fred century came hurrying into the dormitory  have you heard the latest news he cried  no what is it questioned andy  maybe we are going to have an extra holiday suggested pepper  better yet maybe old crabtree has resigned added jack  perhaps fred is going to give us a spread came from stuffer id like that firstrate  no the news is more important than all that came from fred  well what is it fred  dont keep us on pins and needles any longer  well the news is that there have been more robberies committed here answered fred  more robberies came from half a dozen throats  yes the teachers were going to keep the thing quiet but it leaked out through mumps and nick paxton  what has been taken now asked jack curiously  a watch a scarfpin and a fivedollar gold piece  and who was robbed burst out andy  the watch was taken from paxton the scarfpin from ritter and coulter lost the fivedollar gold piece  is it possible murmured the young major and then he looked meaningly at his chums here was news indeed  when did you learn of this fred asked dale  just a few minutes ago mumps told me and paxton told frank barringer ritter coulter and paxton went to the office to report mumps said ritter was as mad as hops ritters watch was only a silver affair but he says it came down to him from his grandfather and was valuable as an heirloom  well this is certainly getting interesting was peppers comment if that thief isnt caught hell end up by cleaning out the whole school  after this i am going to hide my valuables said dale  ditto here cried stuffer i havent got much but what i own i want to keep  a little later the cadets filed out of the dormitory leaving jack pepper and andy together  well i am mighty glad i didnt accuse ritter and coulter said the young major this puts something of a different light on the subject  but who is guilty do you think asked andy  i dont know what to think answered the young major  this will drive captain putnam wild came from pepper and he was right the master of the hall was worried as he had never been worried before he made a rigid investigation but it brought nothing new to light according to the stories told by ritter coulter and paxton the articles stolen had been taken from their bureaudrawers and that was all those cadets could tell about the mysterious affair  we must set a strict watch captain putnam said george strong  and we must catch that thief added josiah crabtree sourly ii shall be almost afraid to go to sleep after this he added nervously  if these thefts keep on i dont know what i am going to do said captain putnam and his voice had a sound of despair in it     chapter xvii  the tugofwar   for several days nothing was talked of at putnam hall but the mysterious disappearance of the students watches and jewelry the cadets could not get the matter off their minds and as a consequence recitations became very poor  i shall offer a substantial reward said captain putnam and one afternoon a notice was posted in the school proper and in the gymnasium offering one hundred dollars for information leading to the capture of the thief  say i shouldnt mind earning that reward murmured dale  a fellow could have no end of a good time on a hundred dollars murmured stuffer think what a spread he could give and his eyes sparkled in anticipation  it would be a bad thing for stuffer to get the reward came from andy  why id like to know demanded that cadet  because youd eat yourself into a state of acute indigestion  rats i dont eat any more than you do grumbled stuffer  well i dont see any chance of your getting the reward was jacks comment that thief had hidden his tracks well  with the deep snow on the ground drills had to be held in the gymnasium and several contests were also arranged the cadets got up a tugofwar between one team headed by pepper and another headed by dale and the excitement over this contest waged so high that the thefts were for the time being forgotten  the tugofwar was held late one afternoon in the gymnasium a line was drawn on the floor and the long rope laid across this on either side wooden cleats were nailed down so that the contestants might brace their feet  the two teams consisted of eight cadets each with pepper were andy jack and fred century while on dales side were bart field bart conners and some other cadets already introduced  now then pepper cried one of his friends see what you can do  dont give him a chance dale yank him right over the line cried one of dales friends  ill bet pepper ditmore loses said nick paxton who was present ritter and coulter had said they did not consider a tugofwar between such teams worth witnessing  frank barringer was timekeeper and referee and at the appointed hour he made both teams line up and catch hold of the rope  all ready he asked  there was a moment of silence  drop was the cry and on the instant both teams tightened their holds on the rope and dropped down on the wooden cleats  hold them pepper  dont let em haul you up dale  glue yourself down jack  stone foundation fred stone foundation  so the cries ran on as the two tugofwar teams held on to the long rope like grim death each team determined not to give in an inch  for fully five minutes the rope remained as when the teams had first dropped then of a sudden dale gave a hiss and up came his men to haul in on the rope several inches and then drop as before  hurrah thats the way to do it  every inch counts boys  watch your chance for another  get it back pepper get it back  there followed another tense strain then dales team came up once more and brought rope in another six inches  thats the way to do it now then a good stiff pull and youll have em over  wake up pepper its time you and your men got on the job cried henry lee  i knew dales team would win said paxton  hardly had paxton spoken when dales team came up for another haul but this time pepper and his men were on the alert and in a twinkling they commenced to haul insix inches a foot a foot and a half and then two feetand then they dropped the strain being as much as they could stand  hurrah look at that  they got back all they lost and more  hold em dale stone foundation  a great many cries arose dale and his supporters braced back as well as they could then dale gave the word to come up for another haul  back and forth went the rope the center knot first on one side of the line and then on the other for several minutes it looked as if dales team might win but then the tide turned again and with a strength that was surprising peppers team gave a long pull a strong pull and a pull all together and brought the center knot over the winning line  hurrah pepper ditmores team wins  say that was a great tug wasnt it  my foot slipped said one of dales supporters  so did mine same from a cadet on the other side  it was a fair contest said frank barringer pepper ditmores team wins my private opinion is both sides did well he added  they certainly did was mr strongs comment he had watched the contest with interest  after the tugofwar came a contest on the flying rings here andy was in his element and the acrobatic youth easily outdistanced all of his competitors  very good indeed snow said the gymnastic instructor really you go at it as if you were a professional  say andy some day you can join the circus suggested the young major  maybe his folks came from a circus sneered nick paxton it isnt fair to bring in a professional  sour grapes paxton cried stuffer you know that andy snows father is a business man in the city andy just takes to gymnastic exercises thats all  humph i dont think such an exhibition much  just the same paxton youd give a good deal to do as well retorted the youth who loved to eat and turned his back on the other cadet  thanksgiving came and went in another storm the snow was so deep that getting away from the hall was out of the question so those who had planned to go home for the holiday were somewhat disappointed but captain putnam provided good cheer in abundance with plenty of turkey and cranberry sauce pumpkin pie and nuts for the evening the boys got up an entertainment in the assembly room with monologues and dialogues and also some singing by the school glee club and some very good violin and mandolin playing pepper jack and andy took part in the entertainment and everybody but josiah crabtree enjoyed the exhibition crabtree did not believe in such tomfoolery as he expressed it and told captain putnam the cadets should have given a shakespearian recital or something like that instead  perhaps so mr crabtree answered the master of the hall but as the boys are virtually snowed in i thought id let them have a little fun  after thanksgiving the cadets settled down to the grind once more counting the days to christmas when they could go home for two weeks  ive got to go to cedarville said jack one afternoon after the snowstorm had cleared away who will go along i am going to walk it just for the exercise  ill go cried pepper  so will i added andy where are you going  to the shoe shop and the postoffice  the three cadets were soon on the way fred century and bert field pelting them with snowballs as they left it was cold but clear and all were in the best of spirits  i see theyve got a new man of all work around the school observed pepper as the three trudged on i hope captain putnam doesnt think of discharging peleg snuggers  that new man is a sly kind of a fellow came from andy i was walking through the hallway last evening and he came up behind me as silently as a cat after a mouse  ive got my own idea about that man of all work said the young major with a faint smile  what do you mean jack  if i tell you will you keep it to yourself both of you  sure was the prompt answer  well i dont think john smith is a man of all work at all  he isnt cried andy then what is he  i think he is a private detective  oh jack can that be possible ejaculated pepper but it must be so for i watched the fellow last evening and he didnt do much work and he didnt seem to like it that i had an eye on him  of course if he is a detective captain putnam has engaged him to clear up this mystery of the robberies said andy well i dont blame the captain for this is surely going to give the school a bad name  dont breathe a word of this to any one went on jack of course if the thief knew a detective was so near hed be more on guard than ever  i only hope he gets the rascal whoever he is  wonder if it can be one of the cadets mused andy  i dont know it is either some cadet or else one of the hired help but it is an awful state of affairs answered jack  by the way jack how about the new election of officers said pepper a little later going to try for the majorship again  no why should i ive been major long enough i believe in giving the other fellows a show  who for instance  well id like to see bart conners made major hes one of the best soldiers we have and he keeps company b up to the scratch  bart is all right but what about the other fellows  well i am not so anxious about the captaincies let the best fellows win  i think reff ritter would like to be a captain or major  he never will behe cant get the support why hardly any of the cadets go with reff any more even paxton seems to have dropped him about the only close friend he has is gus coulter  maybe the boys have dropped him because his father is no longer rich  no i dont think that for quite a number of the cadets are far from rich and yet they are considered good fellows its ritters ways he is too domineering the fellows wont stand for his bullying manner  when does the election take place  the tenth day of decembera week from next wednesday  and you are sure you dont want to run again jack  yes quite sure pepper you can run if you want to and the young major smiled broadly  not for me cried the imp id rather have my fun and by the way ive got an idea for some fun with old crabtree he added suddenly  what is it questioned andy eagerly  pepper closed one eye suggestively  just you wait and see he answered crabtree is going to wake up to a big surprise some morningand when he does well maybe hell stop chewing his victuals for awhile     chapter xviii  a curious meeting   as the cadets were good walkers it did not take them long to cover the distance to cedarville they stopped at a shoe store and at a candy store for some chocolates and then started for the postoffice  i guess jack is looking for a letter from his best girl remarked pepper with a grin  maybe youre looking for a letter yourself returned the young major  no such luck and the imp heaved a deep sigh none of the girls ever write to me  rats came from andy i saw you get a letter from flossie ford only a few days ago  i am looking for a check from dad said jack i want it to buy christmas presents with  so early  better early than too late  thats true  the three cadets entered the local postoffice as they did so they came face to face with a big cadet who was carrying a dresssuit case  why see its dan baxter cried andy  hello baxter coming back to putnam hall queried the young major  i am was the short answer of the bully  been away quite awhile put in pepper  yes answered baxter shortly and without another word he hurried out of the postoffice  not very sociable remarked jack dryly  he acts as if he had something on his mind said pepper  i wonder if he will be as bullying as he used to be mused andy  if he is hell get punched answered pepper he had not forgotten his former encounters with dan baxter  its queer that baxter and ritter dont hit it off better said pepper while jack was asking about letters they seem to be two of a kind  they are in some ways answered andy but somehow i think ritter is the worse of the two  in a moment the young major came up he was smiling broadly  heres the letter from dad and what do you think he sent me a check for ten dollars more than i asked for isnt that fine  best ever answered pepper  id like the same kind of a check returned andy  while you are wishing make it double the amountit doesnt cost any more chattered the imp  from the postoffice the cadets strolled down the main street of the village and then turned a corner near which were some new buildings  there is another cadet cried jack pointing ahead hello where is he going  he and his chums looked and saw the boy in the uniform of a putnam hall student enter an unfinished building he was accompanied by a heavyset man wearing a long overcoat and a soft hat the two were in earnest conversation  that looked like reff ritter to me cried pepper  it was ritter answered andy  who was the man asked the young major  that is what i want to know cried andy say im going to follow them  the acrobatic youth was plainly excited and his chums could not help but notice it  what are you going to follow them for andy asked jack  i want to see that man  do you know him  i dont knowyet i want to find out  if we follow them ritter will think it mighty queer was peppers comment  i dont carei want to get a good look at that man answered andy doggedly  the acrobatic youth led the way and his chums felt compelled to follow ritter and the stranger had passed between two buildings they found a side doorway of one structure wide open and stepped into a lathed but unplastered hallway andy bounded up on an unfinished front piazza and stepped through an open casement into a lathed but unplastered parlor  shall we follow asked pepper of jack  might as well returned the young major andy may get into trouble with ritter and if so we want to be on hand to help him  ritter and the man were talking in a low tone so that what was said could not be overheard they had stepped into the house to get out of the keen wind that had sprung up andy tiptoed his way across the unfinished parlor and applied his eye to a crack where a lath was missing he watched until the man shoved back his soft hat and turned his face around then he uttered a low cry  see anything andy whispered pepper  that manhes the same fellowi feel sure of it gasped the acrobatic youth  what are you talking about  that man dont you remember how the horse ran away with me and i got caught in the tree and was knocked unconscious dont you remember my telling how i had seen a man ahead of me just before the accident well that is the man  are you sure  i think so of course i didnt get a very good look at himi had my hands full with the horse but i think that is the man  then maybe he robbed you andy  maybe he did  dont say that unless you are sure of it warned jack its a serious accusation and may get you into trouble  oh i know enough to go slow answered the acrobatic youth  ritter and the stranger had turned to the rear of the house and the watchers saw something passed between them then a minute later ritter turned and hurried off by a back way while the stranger turned to leave by the way he had come  andy was undecided what to do and while he still hesitated the man came through to the front of the house  hello he cried as he caught sight of the three cadets what are you doing here  perhaps we might ask the same question returned jack as he saw that andy did not know what to say  have you been following me demanded the man suspiciously  why should we follow you asked pepper  no reason at all so far as i know i only asked the question and now the man tried to speak as carelessly as possible  i saw you come in here a few minutes ago and i followed because i want to speak to you said andy shoving to the front and eyeing the fellow closely  what do you wish to speak about  havent i met you before  at these words the man started but quickly recovered  i dont think so he answered slowly looking andy straight in the eyes you see i am a stranger in cedarville  didnt i meet you in september on the road back of putnam hall school asked the acrobatic youth sharply  in september the man shook his head slowly no i wasnt here in septemberi was in boston  you are sure about that demanded andy  certainly i am sure growled the man do you doubt my word  if it wasnt you it was a man who looks very much like you said andy pointedly will you tell me your name  its none of your business boy i never met you and that settles it im in a hurry now ive got to get to ithaca so ill thank you to let me pass and so speaking the stranger brushed forward andy put out his hand as if to detain him but then changed his mind in a moment more the man was hurrying down the street he turned the nearest corner without looking back  i believe he is the same fellow and i believe he robbed me cried andy  possibly he is but you are not sure of it answered the young major and it would be foolhardy to have him arrested when you have no evidence against him  he acted as if he was scared came from pepper that growl of his was all put on  i wish i had forced him to give me his name and address  thats true  you can get that from reff ritter  providing ritter will give it added jack he may be as backward about it as the man was himself  why should he be if the man is honest  perhaps he wont want it known that he met the man said pepper he came in here rather sneakingly  where did ritter go  to the hall most likely its time we got back too  the three cadets left the vicinity of the unfinished buildings and were soon on the way to the school as they trudged along they talked over what had happened and also discussed the arrival of dan baxter  baxter will try to stir things up said jack and he was right the bully did stir up the whole school but it was not until the next term after the young major had left  about half the distance to putnam hall had been covered when the three cadets discovered a crowd ahead of them  who are those fellows asked pepper  pornell academy lads announced andy and see they have spotted us  he was right the other crowd nine strong were students from pornell they were led by roy bock and a fellow named grimes they had been goodnaturedly snowballing each other but now they stopped  three putnam hall cadets cried bock come on fellows heres a chance for sport  lets snowball em good and proper exclaimed grimes  everybody on the jump yelled another pornell youth  lets surround em was the suggestion offered  well hammer the daylights out of em came from one lad who could only be brave when backed up by a crowd  yes surround em dont let em get away cried bock come on and he led the way on the run making snowballs as he moved     chapter xix  about a set of teeth   i am afraid we are in for it whispered the young major as he saw the rush of the pornell students each armed with all the snowballs he could carry  shall we run away asked andy i guess we can run as fast as they can  never replied pepper i am going to the hall and on this road  so am i added jack  then let us rush em suggested andy we cant stand and fight nine of emwell be snowed under  rush it is returned the young major wait till i give the signal  on came the enemy and soon the snowballs were flying at a lively rate it was growing dark but the aim of the pornell students was good and the chums were hit several times they threw snowballs in return hitting bock in the breast and grimes in the chin  come on throw em over roared bock roll em in the snow  and stuff some snow down their backs added grimes  now then all together cried jack keep as close as possible one two three  side by side the three chums bounded forward straight for the line of pornellites they came on swiftly and took the enemy by surprise jack bumped into bock hurling him flat and pepper bowled over grimes andy bent low and caught another student by the legs sending him over into a fourth and both went flat then the three cadets caught a fifth and ran him along the road and into a hollow where he went into snow up to his waist  stop em stop em was the cry but the putnam hall boys could not be stopped turning they delivered a parting shower of snowballs and then ran on in the direction of the school  i guess the pornell fellows will remember that for awhile panted pepper when they felt safe  and just think of itthree to nine chuckled andy  they thought they had us dead to rights came from jack well i guess we showed them a trick or two they wont forget right away  are they following us asked the acrobatic youth looking back  i reckon not replied pepper must have had enough and he smiled broadly  the three cadets were tired out from their long walk and the contest on the road and when the school was reached all were glad enough to sit down and rest previous to having supper andy looked around for reff ritter but that cadet kept himself out of sight  ill see him after supper said the acrobatic youth  it was not until nearly bedtime that he got a chance to question the bully he followed ritter up to his dormitory which chanced just then to be unoccupied  reff i want to talk to you he said when the bully was on the point of closing the door in his face  what do you want andy snow im not feeling well tonight and i am tired out from a walk i took to cedarville  i wont keep you long reff i want to ask you about the man you met in cedarville whats his name  reff ritter stopped short and showed that the question took him by surprise  man i met he stammered  yes the man you met at the new buildings in cedarville  who said i met any one  we saw you i and major ruddy and pep ditmore  huh been spying on me eh and reff ritters face took on its old look of sourness  it was an accident but i want to know who that man was  what for  i have my reasons  i dont see that i am called on to answer your questions andy snow if i want to meet anybody ill do it  then you refuse to tell me who the man was  tell me why you want to know and maybe ill tell you who he is answered the bully after studying the acrobatic youths face for a moment  very well do you remember the time the horse ran away with me and left me unconscious on the road  i heard about it  well just before i was knocked unconscious i saw a man on the road ahead of me  well  i think it was the man you met this afternoon  that man cried the bully and now he showed a sudden interest  yes and that is why i want to know his name and where he comes from  you must be mistaken snow that man doesnt belong around here  where is he from  i think he comes from boston but i am not sure  and his name  why do you ask these questions do you think he had something to do with your being thrown from the horse  no not with being thrown from the horse reff but if youll remember when i came to my senses my watch was gone also my stickpin and eight dollars in bills  and you think that man took them questioned reff ritter in a voice that sounded strained  i wont say that until i know more about the man if you say he is a good honest man why then ill be bound to believe i am mistaken  i dont know much about him but i dont think he is a thief answered the bully slowly his name is smith cameron smith and he is a commercial traveler i only met him twice once about two weeks ago and today he knows myermy uncle and is doing some business for him and he wanted to see me about it thats all but i am sure you are mistaken about his robbing you  i didnt say he robbed mein fact i am not positive he was the man i saw on the road  i dont think he was near cedarville at the time he spends most of his time around boston is that all you want to know if it is im going to lie down and try to get some sleep went on reff ritter passing his hand over his forehead  yes thats all answered andy shortly much obliged and he left the dormitory  he was not at all satisfied with the way reff ritter had acted evidently the bully was much put out over the fact that his meeting with cameron smith was known  he didnt say much about what business he had with the man mused andy it all sounds rather fishy to me wish i had some way of finding out more about this cameron smith guess ill write to some of my friends in boston and see if they can find out anything about him and andy sent a letter the very next morning  on this same day pepper had a sharp wrangle with josiah crabtree the dictatorial teacher accused pepper of copying an example in algebra from another cadet and a bitter altercation followed  i didnt do it and i dont want you to say so flared up pepper his cheeks aflame  ditmore be silent roared josiah crabtree not another word or ill send you to captain putnam  i dont carei didnt copy muttered pepper its a shame to say i did  youll stay in after school commanded crabtree majestically  the accusation and the fact that he had to stay in when the others were allowed to go out and have their fun did not suit the imp at all while he sat in the classroom all alone he thought again of something that had come into his mind before  ill do it he said firmly ill do it tonight ill show him that he cant accuse me for nothing  since the fall term at putnam hall had opened josiah crabtree had been making frequent trips to ithaca to a wellknown dentist located in that city although many of the cadets did not know it a few and among them pepper were aware that the teacher was having a new set of false teeth made now the teeth were finished and josiah crabtree was wearing them with great satisfaction and not a little pride he fancied that the new teeth added not a little to his personal appearance  it was peppers plan to get hold of these teeth and hide them how the trick was to be accomplished he did not yet know but he resolved to watch his chances  that evening as luck would have it josiah crabtree retired early as was his custom he placed his false teeth in a glass of water on a stand in his room watching through a keyhole pepper saw him do this and then calmly waited for the teacher to go bed and fall asleep  the door was locked but the imp was equal to the emergency the room next to that occupied by crabtree was vacant and he entered this and threw open the window the window of the teachers apartment was less than three feet away and the sash was pulled down a few inches to let in fresh air  pepper was not such an acrobat as andy but he quickly raised the next window and moved into the teachers apartment in a trice he had secured the new set of teeth and then he retired as quickly as he had come leaving both windows as he had found them  now what shall i do with the teeth the cadet asked himself he was strongly tempted to tell jack and andy of the trick but decided to keep the matter to himself  at last another idea came into the imps head and after everybody had apparently gone to bed he stole downstairs and entered the assembly room of the school he had previously tied the set of teeth to a bit of fishing line having a sinker at the other end he now took aim at the central chandelier and by good luck sent the sinker and line whirling around one of the pendants leaving the set of teeth dangling below a foot or more  wont there be a surprise when they see em up there he muttered and wont crabtree have a job getting them down  oh my what a thing to do came a voice from out of the darkness pepper whirled around quickly but the speaker had vanished banging a door after him  who was that was the question pepper asked himself he could not place the voice and was much disturbed would the intruder who had seen his actions expose him  ill have to chance it he told himself rather dubiously i cant get the teeth down anyway too bad i thought i was alone and then he hurried off to bed in anything but a comfortable frame of mind  illustration this was a signal for the discharge of all sorts of things at the dangling object      the mystery of putnam hall page 192     chapter xx  pepper a prisoner   at the usual hour the next morning josiah crabtree arose and dressed himself he was in a far from happy frame of mind for a tailors bill he had to pay was higher than he thought it ought to be  having donned his garments and washed himself and combed his hair he turned to the stand to get his new set of teeth  he took up the glass and peered into it  hum he mused i thought i put them in therein fact i was sure of it he murmured  he set the glass down and commenced to look around on the bureau on his bookcase on the shelf and even on the chairs but of course nothing in the shape of the set of teeth came to light  this is queer mighty queer said the teacher to himself now let me think what i did with them yes i put them in the glass i am positive of it  he examined the glass once more turning it around and around then he commenced a systematic search of the room at the conclusion something like a groan escaped his lips  they are gone gone he murmured hollowly and i left the old set at the dentists to be made over oh what shall i do i cannot go to the classroom without my teeth the cadets would roar at me it must be a trick a wicked trick oh if only i could find out who did this awful thing  he made another hunt and then not knowing what else to do opened his door and hailed a passing cadet  kindly ask captain putnam to step here as soon as he can he mumbled  yes sir answered the cadet and looked curiously at the teacher got a toothache mr crabtree  no i have no toothache mumbled the teacher send captain putnam as soon as you can and then he dove back into his bedroom  several minutes passed and george strong put in an appearance  dalling said you wanted to see captain putnam he said the captain has left for buffalo on business can i do anything for you  mr strong a wicked trick has been played on me burst out josiah crabtree  a trick  yes my teeth are gone the new set i had made some cadet has taken them  can it be possible murmured george strong where did you leave them  in that glass on the stand oh what shall i do my other set is at the dentists getting fixed  maybe i can send for them  hardly since the dentist is at ithaca oh what a wretch to take my teeth i cannot go to the classroom without my teeth i would be the laughingstock of the entire school it is a dreadful state of affairs  i dont see how i can help you out sir answered george strong sympathetically  i shall have to stay here until something is done see if you cant find the cadet who took the teeth  i will do what i can answered george strong and left the room  josiah crabtree was walking up and down nervously when there came a timid knock on the door he opened it to confront mumps  well fenwick what do you want demanded the teacher harshly the sneak of the school generally had some tale of woe to tell and he was just now in no humor to listen to any such recital  please mr crabtree did you lose anything asked mumps nervously  ha what is that come in what do you know cried josiah crabtree and caught mumps by the arm  i didnt do itreally and truly i didnt cried the sneak in sudden terror ii only found it out by accident  about myermy teeth  yes sir  what do you know about them fenwick quick out with it  oh sir please dont hurt my arm so  tell me what you know  ii know where your teeth are sir ii saw them put there last night  where are they  hanging on the chandelier in classroom eight  and who put them there roared the teacher in amazement  pepper ditmore sir but oh sir please dont say i told on him or hell hammer the life out of me cried mumps in alarm  how did he get them  i dont know that sir ii went downstairs toerto put away a book for another cadet and i saw pepper ditmore sneak into room eight i watched him and he threw a string with the teeth on em up over the chandelier i thought they might be yours so i came here to find out  did you get theerthe teeth  oh no sir they are too high up youll have to get a ladder to get them down  the rascal howled josiah crabtree oh wait till i get my hands on him but i must get the teeth first he thought for a moment fenwick find snuggers and send him to me at once  yes sir  and dont say a word of this to any one added the teacher as the sneak hurried off  it took mumps fully five minutes to locate peleg snuggers wondering what was wanted the general utility man hurried to the teachers apartment  i want you to get my set of teeth said josiah crabtree i am told they are fastened to the chandelier in room eight get a ladder and get them down immediately and do it as quietly as you can  yes sir answered snuggers and left to do the errand teeth on the chandelier he murmured wot an idee bet some o the cadets did thet trick how funny he did look without his grinders in  pepper had not told any one about his trick but on a blackboard in the hall he had chalked the words              set of teeth for sale           see chandelier in room no 8             crabtree am oic  this scrawl had attracted the attention of fully a score of cadets and one after another they entered the classroom designated to find out what it meant when they saw the teeth dangling in the air they set up a roar  hello look at the set of teeth  they must belong to old crabtree  wonder what he wants for them  i reckon teeth come high by the look of things  the crowd of cadets kept growing larger until the room was crowded then one cadet took a blackboard eraser and threw it at the teeth this was a signal for a general discharge of all sorts of things at the dangling object  in the midst of the excitement george strong came in  boys boys be quiet cried the teacher what is the meaning of so much noise and then he too caught sight of the dangling teeth who placed those there he asked  there was no reply and he was on the point of sending a cadet for a stepladder when the door opened and in came peleg snuggers with the very thing wanted  mr crabtree sent me to git em explained the general utility man  hurrah peleg to the rescue cried andy  now peleg do the great balancing act said fred century  i will hold the ladder for you snuggers said mr strong boys stand back he added afraid that some of the lads might attempt some joke while the general utility man was in the air  the stepladder was placed in position and snuggers mounted cautiously to the top he could just reach the chandelier and the teeth and it took him some time to cut the teeth loose  ill take em right to mr crabtree he said on coming down hes in a mighty big hurry for em  very well returned george strong  pepper was watching matters closely and he at once guessed that somebody had told josiah crabtree where the teeth were  it must have been the fellow who spotted me last night reasoned the imp wonder if he told my name if he did pepper ended the question with a big sigh  with great eagerness josiah crabtree received the set of teeth and examined them to see if they were all right then having placed them where they belonged he strode forth from his room in quest of the cadet who had played the trick  pepper was just sitting down at the breakfast table when there was a sudden step behind him and the next moment he found himself jerked out of his place  you come with me young man stormed josiah crabtree i have an account to settle with you  what do you want mr crabtree asked the imp as meekly as he could  you know well enough cried the teacher come and he led pepper out of the messhall his grip on the youths arm was so firm that it hurt not a little  mr crabtree you are hurting my arm  i dont care if i am snapped the teacher you come along and he fairly dragged pepper along the hall  where to  youll soon see  what is wrong  you know well enough ditmore you took myermy set of teeth you have made me the laughingstock of the whole school you shall suffer for it  who says i took the teeth  john fenwick saw you place them on the chandelier oh you need not deny it  mumps well he always was a sneak answered pepper  he is a nice manly youth  with a firm grip still on peppers arm the irate teacher led the way to a room looking out on the rear it was an apartment less than ten feet square and plainly furnished with two chairs and a couch in one corner was a stand with a washbowl and pitcher of water the single window was stoutly barred  going to make a prisoner of me asked pepper as the door was opened and he was thrust into the room  you shall stay here for the present snapped josiah crabtree when i let you out i think youll be a sadder and perhaps a wiser boy  am i to have my breakfast  no answered the teacher  then he banged the door shut locked it and walked swiftly away     chapter xxi  a grave accusation   well i suppose i ought not to complain mused pepper as he sat down on one of the chairs a fellow cant have his fun without paying for it but just wait till i catch mumps ill give him a piece of my mind and maybe more  he got up presently and looked out of the window he could see but little excepting a stretch of snow the celllike room was almost without heat and he had to clap his hands together and stamp his feet to keep warm  i think id give a dollar for some breakfast he muttered wonder if i could attract the attention of one of the servants and bribe him to get me something  as he walked around the little room his eyes caught some writing on the wall there were several bits of doggerel one running as follows            i am a prisoner of old josiah            id feel much better if i had a fire  i can sympathize with that fellow murmured pepper as he slapped his hands across his chest trying to get up more circulation then he walked around the room reading another doggerel or two finally he drew out a lead pencil  guess ill play shakespeare myself he murmured and after some thought scribbled down the following                          and i am jugged           alone in solitude and by myself           alone i sit and think and think           and think again old crabtree           base villain that he is hath put me here           and why ah thereby hangs a tale horatio           his teeth the teeth that chew the best of steak           set on our tablethose i found and hid           and mumps the sneak hath told on me alas           when will my martyrdom end  having finished his attempt at blank verse pepper continued to walk around the room he was hungry and cold and inside of an hour grew somewhat desperate  crabtree has no right to starve me and allow me to catch cold he told himself i dont believe captain putnam will stand for it im going to attract some attention  he took up one of the chairs and with it commenced to pound on the door he had been pounding for several minutes when he heard some one on the outside  pepper came in a low voice  oh jack is that you  yes stop that noise or ill get caught  i want to get out i havent had any breakfast and it is as cold as greenland in here  if i had a key id let you out but it isnt in the lock went on the young major  try some of the other keys jack  i will was the reply and the young major hurried off to return with several keys from other doors but not one of them fitted the lock before him  too bad he murmured  major ruddy came in the harsh voice of josiah crabtree behind him what are you doing here  i came to talk to ditmore answered jack boldly  who gave you permission  nobody i came as major of the battalion when a cadet is placed in the guardhouse the major has a right to go and see him  hum growled josiah crabtree he took but little interest in the military side of the school and consequently did not know all the rules well i can do the talking here you are excused  mr crabtree ditmore tells me that he is very cold and he has had no breakfast  ha so he is complaining eh well ill attend to him you may go  are you going to give him his breakfast  yeswhen he deserves itnot before  how about keeping him in such a cold room  that is my affair  if he gets sick will you take the blame  major ruddy i am not here to be questioned by you snapped the dictatorial teacher  pepper belongs to my command and he is my personal friend i dont think you have any right to starve him and keep him in a cold room in such weather as this i shall complain to captain putnam as soon as he gets back and in the meantime complain to mr strong  i am in charge while captain putnam is away  then if pepper takes cold from this youll be to blame and youll foot the doctors bill answered jack and walked away  he spoke so sharply that josiah crabtree became worried and a little later pepper was served with a cup of black coffee and several slices of bread without butter it was a meager meal but it was better than nothing and the imp disposed of all there was of it then a servant appeared with a couple of blankets used by the cadets when in camp  you can wrap yourself in these if you are cold so mr crabtree says said the servant and he went out again locking the door as before  humph must take me for an indian muttered pepper nevertheless he wrapped the blankets around him and then felt considerably warmer  the morning passed slowly and at noon pepper was given a bowl of soup and several additional slices of unbuttered bread the soup was hot and good and he wished there was more of it  mr crabtree says that is all you can have said the waiter who served him  crabbed crabtree muttered pepper and said no more  in the middle of the afternoon directly after school was over josiah crabtree appeared this time he was accompanied by george strong  ditmore we have come to have a talk with you cried crabtree and let me say at the start that i want the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth as they say in court  are you going to try me for my life demanded the imp  i am going to try you on a very serious charge snapped josiah crabtree  do not be too hasty mr crabtree put in george strong mildly  mr crabtree if you want to know about the teeth let me confess that i took them and hung them up where they were found said pepper  ha so you are willing to confess eh  i am i did it for funbut i suppose you dont see the fun added pepper dryly so dryly in fact that george strong had to turn away to hide a sudden smile  it was a low contemptible trick returned josiah crabtree but i must say i do not think it quite as bad as your other doings  my other doings asked the imp somewhat mystified  mr crabtree do not be hasty i beg of you put in the under teacher  ditmore how did you get the teeth demanded josiah crabtree  it was very easy sir if you must know i went into the vacant bedroom next to your room climbed from one window to the other and the trick was done  were you alone  yes sir absolutely alone  have you been alone when visiting the other rooms in this building demanded josiah crabtree sharply  mr crabtree began george strong but the head teacher motioned for the assistant to be silent  ii dont understand stammered pepper  you have shown your expertness in visiting rooms during the night and without awakening anybody went on josiah crabtree coldly some time ago other rooms were visited in this building and various things were takensome things of great valuethings which have not been returned now ditmore  mr crabtree stop cried pepper and his eyes flashed with sudden fire i know what is in your mind now but dont you dare to accuse me dont you dare  i want you to tell me the truth  i have told you all i know i took the teeth as a joke and i put them where they could easily be found  and about the other things the head teacher paused suggestively  i know no more about the other things that have disappeared than you do do you think id rob myself and my best friends  in a case of this kind a person might rob himself just to throw the public off the scent  do you dare to accuse me of these mysterious thefts cried pepper hotly  i think  mr crabtree i beg of you to be careful cried george strong why not drop this whole matter until captain putnam returns because ditmore played a joke on you does not say that he is aa criminal  thank you for that mr strong said the cadet warmly i know i had no right to play that jokei have no right to play any of my jokesbut i only did it for fun i think it isis horrible for mr crabtree to even think that ithatthat pepper could not go on for his emotion choked him  oh you cant deceive me sneered josiah crabtree i am sure that  mr crabtree i insist that you drop this matter until captain putnam returns interrupted george strong  you insist roared the irate instructor  i do sir  who is in authority here you or i  you are the head teacher but i feel bound to protect captain putnams interests during his absence you have no right to accuse any cadet of a crime unless you have proof against him have you any proof against ditmore  you heard how he acknowledged taking the teeth  and he said it was a jokeand i believe it was that and nothing more there is a wide difference between an innocent joke and a premeditated crime take my advice and say no more until you have consulted with captain putnam  ha you are against mejust as the cadets are against me stormed josiah crabtree i know i am right but we can wait since you insist he turned towards pepper ill corner you yet you young rascal he cried bitterly  and the two teachers passed out of the celllike room the door was again locked and pepper was left a prisoner as before     chapter xxii  the mystery goes on   when nightfall came and pepper still remained a prisoner both jack and andy commenced to worry about their chum  its a shame to keep him in that cold room said the young major  wonder if we can get him out on the sly returned the acrobatic youth id be willing to run quite a risk to set him free so he could sleep in his own bed tonight  let us sneak down after dark and see what we can do suggested jack  of course the fact that pepper was a prisoner was known throughout the whole school many who had laughed over the teeth affair thought it too bad that the imp should be locked up in a cold room but others including reff ritter and gus coulter said it served him right  he was too fresh growled coulter  let him stay there a week it will do him good added ritter  you leave things to old crabtree said dan baxter he knows how to put the screws on a cadet  right you are came from ritter  the one boy who had little to say was mumps the sneak was scared almost to death feeling certain that pepper would square up with him as soon as liberated the others did not know how mumps had acted or jack and andy might have given the sneak a sound thrashing  the young major and the acrobatic youth talked the affair over and were joined in the discussion by bert field dave kearney and one or two others they were on the point of going below when fred century came in  crabtree is certainly going to make sure of keeping pepper a prisoner said he  how do you know that asked jack quickly  he has placed a guard in front of the door so nobody can open it  a guard  yes  who  two cadetscrane and barlow they are to remain on guard three hours and then some others are to relieve them  then we cant do a thing groaned andy we might bribe crane but nobody could bribe barlow hes a sticker on everything he does  jack went below and found that the report about the guard was true the cadets were on duty and he was not allowed to even speak to pepper  its too bad he said on returning to the dormitory i guess poor pepper will have to remain where he is  we might protest to mr strong suggested bart conners  it wouldnt do any good crabtree is in charge during captain putnams absence  one after another the cadets went to bed jack was the last to retire and it was a long while before he dropped off to sleep then he dreamed about pepper up in the far north sitting on a cake of ice in a bathingsuit which showed how much he had the welfare of his chum at heart  in the morning josiah crabtree went below early he expected captain putnam back by noon and wished to be prepared to make a proper report to the head of the school on his arrival  he had just seated himself at the desk in the office when there came a knock on the door  come in he said shortly thinking it might be a servant the newcomer was bart conners  well conners what is it demanded the head teacher  i want to report that i was robbed last night answered the captain of company b  robbed ejaculated josiah crabtree did you say robbed  yes sir  what of where when josiah crabtrees manner showed his tremendous excitement  of a diamond stickpin i left it in one of my scarfs last night and this morning it was gone ive looked all over but i cant find it  how late was it when you retired  about ten oclock  and when did you get up  at the first bell  and you noticed it was gone at once  yes for i wanted to lock it away in my bureau as captain putnam warned us to do when the others things were stolen  this is strange do you suspect anybody  at this question bart conners shook his head  very well i will look into the matter immediately after breakfast  scarcely had josiah crabtree spoken when dan baxter appeared at the door  i want to tell you something he said sourly i want somebody locked up  locked up queried the startled teacher what is wrong and as he asked the question bart conners looked on with interest  ill tell you burst out dan baxter last night i went to bed with eleven dollars in my vestpocket this morning every cent of the money is gone i want it back if i dont get it back captain putnam has got to stand the loss for i wont and the bully looked more sour than ever  you robbed too cried josiah crabtree faintly will it ever stop what is the school coming to  have you any idea who took the money dan asked bart conners  no i was dead tired and slept like a dog but i know i had the eleven dollars when i went to bed and now its gone  so is my diamond stickpin and the captain of company b gave the particulars  humph muttered the bully i heard of those other robberies but i didnt think id get touched as quick as this if it keeps on the whole school will be cleaned out  yes and captain putnam will be ruined added bart gravely  i will see you two cadets later said josiah crabtree and shut the office desk with a bang he hurried away leaving bart and dan baxter to console themselves as best they could  josiah crabtree was thinking of pepper he had accused the imp only the day before of these crimes and here the thefts were continuing while pepper was a close prisoner  perhaps he got out during the night he muttered i must make sure of it for to be fair to the dictatorial teacher he really thought pepper might be the guilty party  he questioned the cadets who had been on guard during the night one and all declared that pepper had remained a prisoner all night and was still in the celllike room then he spoke to the imp himself  did you go out last night he asked  how could i asked pepper  answer my question ditmore  no i didnt go out i have been here ever since you brought me in yesterday  teacher and cadet looked sharply at each other and there was a silence that could be felt from one of the guards pepper had learned how bart and dan baxter had been robbed  you know i didnt go out went on pepper you know that i am not guilty of the crimes that have been committed in this school as soon as captain putnam returns i want to see him so he can hear my side of the story  at these words josiah crabtree winced he felt that captain putnam might not agree with him concerning the treatment given to pepper and that pepper might get him into hot water even george strong had intimated this  ditmore he said slowly and mildly ieri feel that perhaps i have been a bit harsh with you your trick upset me very much such a trick would upset anybody if ieraccused you falsely i am sorry for it supposing i let you go and supposing we drop the whole matter  i am willing to drop the matter providing you will retract what you said about my being connected with theseerthese other things answered pepper slowly  well ii must have been mistaken i didnt say you were guilty i only said it looked suspiciousthe way you prowled around and the way you got into my room but if you are willing well drop the entire matter and you can go to your room and get ready for breakfast  pepper thought rapidly he was angry over being accused of the crimes yet he knew he had gone too far in his joke at josiah crabtrees expense  all right sir well drop the matter mr crabtree he said goodmorning and a moment later he quitted his prison and was on his way to his dormitory  the cadets had much to talk about that daythe sudden liberation of pepper and the losses bart conners and dan baxter had suffered at noon captain putnam came back and he had the captain of company b and dan baxter in his office for the best part of an hour but nothing came of the conference excepting that the owner of the hall said he would pay all losses and gave baxter his eleven dollars on the spot then he had a long conference with the new man of all work who was really a detective in disguise but that individual was as much in the dark as anybody he had seen nobody prowling around during the night  we must get at the bottom of this affair said captain putnam to george strong if we do not the school will surely be ruined he was told about the affair of the teeth but paid little attention knowing that josiah crabtree could be left to manage his own differences with the students  pepper had dropped the matter so far as it concerned josiah crabtree but he did not drop it so far as it concerned mumps he watched the sneak that day and the next and managed at last to catch mumps at the boathouse  now i am going to give you the thrashing you deserve cried the imp and caught the sneak by the collar  lemme go shrieked mumps lemme go or ill tell captain putnam on you  no you wont answered pepper if you do ill promise you another licking at the first chance i get  and then and there he boxed the sneaks ears and then threw him down in the snow washing his face and shoving a lot of the snow down inside the lads shirt mumps yelled like a wild indian but pepper did not let up until he felt that he had given the sneak all he deserved  you say a word and ill give you a double dose the next time warned pepper and this so scared mumps he never once opened his mouth about the affair     chapter xxiii  an election of officers   election of officers tomorrow  as if every cadet at the school didnt know it pepper  well andy have you made up your mind how you are going to vote  sure i have replied the acrobatic youth i am going to vote for bart conners for major since jack dont want to run again  thats the way i am going to vote too  how about the two captains asked joe nelson  well i think ill vote for dave kearney for one answered pepper i am not so sure about the other  whats the matter with harry blossom asked bert field he seems to be a nice sort  he is  i understand reff ritter wants to be a captain put in stuffer  sure an hed be afther wantin to be major only he aint popular enough came from emerald  coulter is out for a captaincy too said jack who had come up during the talk  do you think either of them will be elected asked andy  not if i can prevent it replied the young major neither of them deserves any office  i understand dan baxter wants to be major said stuffer talk about gall what has he ever done for the school nothing  he wont get the office said jack  is bart going to have a walkover asked pepper  hardly both dave kearney and harry blossom will run against him and so will bob grenwood and they all have their friends  well let the best fellows win say i cried andy and then he ran off to do some fancy stunts in the gymnasium  the excitement attending the disappearance of bart connerss stickpin and dan baxters money had somewhat subsided and now the cadets could think of nothing but the coming election  how many cadets are there to vote asked pepper as he and jack walked away to the river to skate  eightythree  then it will take fortytwo votes to elect anybody  thats it  well i hope bart gets the fortytwo votes  i have been doing a little figuring and i think he can count on at least thirtyone votes but i am not so sure of the other eleven  the election of officers was made the occasion of a holiday at putnam hall immediately after breakfast the battalion was formed and marched around the campus and then to the gymnasium here captain putnam made a little speech in which he announced that the balloting for a major would be immediately followed by the balloting for one captain and then the other and then for the lieutenants  it is now ninethirty concluded captain putnam balloting for a new major will take place promptly at ten oclock  captain putnam may i say a word asked major jack saluting with his sword  certainly major ruddy  fellow cadets began jack in a clear steady voice all i wish to say is this as major of the putnam hall battalion i have enjoyed myself very much and i trust my successor whoever he may be will have as good a time i understand that some of you want to vote for me again let me say that i am not a candidate and will not accept the office even if elected i expect to leave this institution next june and in the meantime hope to devote my time mostly to my studies i thank you for your attention  hurrah shouted a number of the cadets  three cheers for major ruddy shouted pepper and they were given with a will  well never get a better major called out one enthusiastic cadet  after that there was a great canvassing for votes dan baxter was unusually active and jack and pepper felt certain that he was trying one of his old tricks namely that of buying votes some of the poorer cadets had very little spending money and it was a great temptation to them to have money offered for their ballots of course buying votes was dishonorable and baxter had to work on the sly ritter also tried to buy votes but soon found out that very few of the cadets would even listen to him because of the way he had misled them in the past  at last came the time to vote and the ballotbox was placed on a table in charge of two cadets and george strong who had consented to act as judge of the election  this is for a new major only announced george strong you will step up and vote as your names are called  it took but a few minutes to cast the eightythree ballots then the vote was tabulated while the boys stood around on the tiptoe of expectation  i will read the result announced captain putnam after receiving a paper from mr strong and he read as follows            whole number of votes cast 83            necessary to a choice 42            paul singleton has 4            henry lee has 5            harry blossom has 7            david kearney has 9            reffton ritter has 12            daniel baxter has 18            bart conners has 28  nobody is elected said pepper in a disappointed voice  boys you will have to try it again said captain putnam  i beg to withdraw my name from the list of candidates cried paul singleton all who voted for me will kindly vote for bart conners who is my choice  we must beat ritter and baxter said andy in a low voice  thats right cried another of the cadets but how  let us try to make up a slate proposed jack who was something of a politician harry blossom and dave kearney might withdraw in favor of bart conners if the fellows promised to support them for the two captaincies  let us see if it can be done returned pepper quickly hustle now for weve got to vote again in fifteen minutes  they hurried around and interviewed blossom and kearney and about twenty other cadets as a consequence the pair named said they would withdraw in favor of bart conners if supported for the captaincies later in the meantime henry lee said he would drop out also since he expected to leave school in june  once again the ballots were cast and now it was easy to see that bart ritter and baxter were exceedingly anxious both ritter and baxter did their best to gain the votes dropped by henry lee and paul singleton  i will read the result said captain putnam a few minutes later and amid a breathless silence he read the following            whole number of votes cast 83            necessary to a choice 42            robert grenwood has 5            reffton ritter has 10            daniel baxter has 12            bart conners has 56  hurrah for bart conners shouted half a dozen cadets in chorus  bart conners is declared elected major for the ensuing term went on captain putnam major conners allow me to congratulate you and he came forward and held out his hand  and let me congratulate you too added major jack and he shook hands also  a great number of cadets and some teachers come up to shake bart by the hand ritter and baxter were conspicuous by their absence each of the bullies was chagrined at the poor showing he had made instead of gaining on the second ballot they had lost  that shows how much one can depend on his friends growled baxter to mumps  never mind dan maybe youll be elected a captain answered the toady and sneak  i dont want to be a captain i want to be a major or nothing grumbled the bully  a little later the balloting for a captain for company a was started there were half a dozen candidates including both ritter and coulter and ritter did all he could to get the boys who had voted for baxter to support him and then bribed coulter to step out in his favor but jack pepper and bart conners worked hard for harry blossom as agreed and as a consequence harry was elected on the third ballot by fiftytwo votes  hurrah for harry blossom was the cry and the newlyelected captain of company a was congratulated on all sides  this election was followed by that for a captain for company b here the struggle was as fierce as before but dave kearney won out on the sixth ballot then came ballots for the lieutenants and bob grenwood came out strong with fiftyfive votes dale blackmore was made the new quartermaster much to his delight although dale cared more for athletics than he did for military matters  not one of the ritter or the baxter crowd got an office much to their disgust baxter went off by himself to sulk but ritter and coulter denounced their rivals openly  i reckon votes were bought said ritter  sure they were bought responded coulter  so they were by ritter  company retorted andy who overheard the talk  oh give us a rest snow muttered ritter i dont want the old office anyway and all my real friends know it  sour grapes answered the acrobatic youth  dont you get fresh or ill punch your head cried the bully savagely  will you answered andy just you try it if you dare  i will came hotly from ritter and leaping forward he hit andy a sharp blow on the chin  the assault came so suddenly that the acrobatic youth had no time to defend himself he staggered and fell and as he went down the bully gave him a sharp kick in the side     chapter xxiv  andy shows his courage   stop that ritter what do you mean by kicking andy when he is down  it was pepper who uttered these words as he rushed up from the other side of the campus  i didnt kick him retorted ritter he was startled for he had not anticipated being seen  you did  a fight a fight was the cry and soon a crowd of cadets began to collect  slowly andy arose to his feet his face was pale for both the blow on the chin and the kick in the side had been severe  youyou brute he gasped you dirty brute  hi dont you call me a brute roared ritter  you are a brute put in pepper no fairminded chap would kick a fellow when he was down  ditmore you keep out of this grumbled the bully  im going to see that andy has fair play returned pepper  the encounter had occurred after captain putnam and the teachers had disappeared so there was little chance of an interruption by the hall authorities  andy stood up and tried to collect himself he was boiling mad for the attack had been a dastardly one  had enough demanded the bully coming closer and with his fists clenched  no i havent answered the acrobatic youth and then of a sudden he sprang high in the air to come down on ritters shoulder then he caught the bully around the neck with one arm  hi hi let up began ritter ii  ill not let up retorted andy you brought this on yourself reff ritter and now you can take the consequences how do you like that and that and that  each that was accompanied by a stinging blow one on the ear one on the eye and one on the nose the second made the bullys left optic black and the third caused the blood to spurt freely then andy landed another blow on ritters mouth leaped to the ground and shoved the fellow from him  ill give you those for an opener he said breathing heavily you can have some more in another minute  youyou rat hissed the bully and came at andy with a rush but the acrobatic youth dodged and ritter ran full tilt into dan baxter  hi keep your distance ritter growled baxter  ill fix him yelled ritter and made another lunge for andy this time he hit andy on the shoulder but the acrobatic youth came back at him in doublequick order and ritter received a blow in the chin that bowled him over into the arms of nick paxton as he went over his eyes closed and then he slid in a heap to the ground  a knockout for snow  say that was a smashing blow  it served ritter right he kicked andy when he was down  yes and he hit him before he was ready  paxton coulter and several others gathered around the fallen bully and rubbed his face with some snow in a few minutes he opened his eyes and stared around  dontdont hit me again he mumbled between his bleeding teeth  have you had enough demanded andy if you havent stand up and get some more  dontdont hit me again  then you have had enough  illill meet you another time  no you wont ritter youll meet me now  thats the talk cried several finish the fight  i dont want to fight any more answered the bully and his words came in almost a whine  then you have had enough yes or no  iveive had enough said ritter in a low tone  very well see that you remember this lesson declared andy and then turned on his heel and walked towards the hall followed by a dozen of his admirers  andy it was great the way you jumped on him declared pepper  it was only a little acrobatic stunt declared andy but it came in mighty handy i shouldnt have tried it only he didnt fight fairhitting me before i was ready and kicking me when i was down  you watch out that he doesnt play you foul said dale who was present  ill keep my eyes open  it was soon whispered around the school how andy had met and vanquished the bully and as a consequence many of the fellows who had toadied to ritter deserted him even paxton gave him the cold shoulder openly and baxter simply sneered at him only gus coulter clung to ritter and the pair seemed to become greater cronies than ever  after the election of officers and the fight matters ran along swiftly until the midwinter holidays during those days many of the boys visited their homes captain putnam spent his time in trying to clear up the mystery surrounding the disappearance of the things from the hall but without success the detective he had hired unearthed nothing of importance and was discharged one of the waiters left of his own accord and the master of the school could not help but wonder if he was the guilty party  in the meantime andy and his chums had been trying to find out something about cameron smith they were equally unsuccessful for no one they knew in boston had ever heard of that individual his name was not in the directory  there was something strange about him said andy i wish ritter would tell us more about him but i know it would be useless to ask reff he hasnt spoken to me since the fight  after the holidays came some fine skating on the lake and also some iceboating  fred century had had a new iceboat built at cedarville it was called the skimmer and he was exceedingly proud of the craft  you must come out with me he said to jack pepper and andy one saturday afternoon the ice is as smooth as glass and the wind is just right  all right cried pepper a sail will suit me down to the ground  jack and andy were also pleased to go and the quartet of boys were soon down at the boathouse where the skimmer was tied up  they were just getting aboard of the iceboat when they saw another craft heave in sight  who is that on board asked andy  it is reff ritter answered pepper and gus coulter is with him  the iceboat belongs to a fellow in cedarville said a cadet standing near ritter hired it for a week  the second craft was called the rosebud and was rather a finelooking outfit with steel runners and a snowywhite sail  he must have paid something to rent that observed jack i thought he didnt have much money  he says his father is in business again and is doing better answered paxton who was present hello reff he called out want another passenger  i dont want you answered the bully briefly  all right you dont have to have me growled paxton  say century do you want to race me asked ritter as he brought the rosebud alongside the dock  i dont know answered fred slowly what do you say he whispered to the others  do you think you can beat him asked pepper  i can try  then go ahead said jack you dont care do you andy  not at allif fred can beat him was the reply from the acrobatic youth  all right ill race called out fred but you will have to carry four the same as myself  humph growled ritter i dont know about that  ill go reff cried mumps  so will i added a cadet named white  all right jump aboard cried the bully and mumps and white lost no time in doing as bidden  where do you want to race to asked fred  up to dorsetts point and back  all right are you ready  yes  then let her go yelled the owner of skimmer and in a moment the iceboat race had started     chapter xxv  the man at point view lodge   at first it was an even race reff ritter knew how to handle an iceboat to perfection and brought his craft up in the breeze in a manner that won considerable admiration  take care that he doesnt beat you fred said pepper if he does he will never get done crowing over you  this race isnt over yet answered the owner of the skimmer wait till we round the bend yonder  when the bend mentioned was gained the rosebud was a good three lengths in the lead  goodby shouted coulter here is where we leave you behind  your iceboat isnt in it with this added mumps  well tell them you are coming byandby came from ritter  dont answer them whispered jack fred can we do anything to help the boat along  just shift a little more to the leftthats it was the reply now well soon get the breeze and then well do better  freds words proved true as the skimmer rounded the bend a good stiff blast struck her sails and away she started after the rosebud  now we are going some cried andy his face brightening  make her hum cried pepper  slowly but surely the skimmer crept up on the rosebud until the bow of the second craft overlapped the stern of the first  not walking away so fast now are you questioned pepper cheerily  just wait well beat you see if we dont growled coulter  swing the mainsail over cried ritter  his order was obeyed and the rosebud commenced to pick up again but the skimmer kept on steadily and at last when the turningpoint was reached was several lengths ahead  now for the homestretch cried jack  i hope we win by about a mile was andys wish  the turningpoint was a wellknown rock and the skimmer came around this in fine style but just as this was accomplished ritter allowed the rosebud to swing around out of the proper course  look out youll run us down yelled fred in alarm  clear the track yelled ritter angrily clear the track  the clown muttered jack does he want to run into us  fred worked quickly assisted by all the others and the skimmer was thrown out of her course on rushed both of the iceboats and the rosebud slid by the other with less than six inches to spare  ritter that wasnt fair shouted fred i wont race with a fellow who wont sail fair  you go to grass i dont care about the race anyway howled the bully  you are beaten and you know it cried pepper  in a regular race such actions would disqualify you was jacks comment  oh dont preach i know what i am doing grumbled ritter and then he steered off in another direction and out of hearing  what a mean bully he is getting to be said fred it seems to me he is much worse than he was when i first came to the hall  he is slowly but surely losing his grip here and that is souring him answered jack before he knows it he wont have a friend in the world as it is about the only fellow who is really friendly with him is coulter paxton doesnt have much to do with him and mumps merely toadies to him the same as he toadies to dan baxter and some of the rest  where shall we go now asked fred  anywhere you please came from the others  shall we take a run up to point view and fred looked quizzically at first one and then another of his friends  might do that answered jack but the lodge is shut up you know the fords are at their city home for the winter  well we can run up that way anyway said pepper one place is as good as another  the course of the iceboat was slightly changed and in less than a quarter of an hour they swept up to the dock attached to point view lodge the sails were lowered and they went ashore to stretch their legs for sitting on the iceboat rather cramped them  might as well take a look around the lodge while we are here suggested jack  is there a caretaker here asked andy  i dont think so but there may be  the four youths walked through the snow in the direction of the mansion which was set among some heavy trees  hello what is that an animal track asked jack pointing to a trail among the trees  looks more like human footprints to me replied pepper  then somebody must be here  funny the trail leads from the side fence came from andy if it was some person who belonged here why wouldnt he come from the road or the dock  maybe it was easier to come that way than by the road right after the snow fell suggested pepper  they walked forward to the mansion and saw that the trail led to the back door and then around to a side window  hello i dont like this exclaimed jack what would a person be doing at the side window  try the window suggested fred they had already tried the door to find it locked  jack stood on a flat rock that was handy and took hold of the lower sash much to his surprise it went up with ease  its open he exclaimed do you know what i think i think somebody came here and got into the house by this window  a tramp perhaps said fred  or a burglar vouchsafed andy  do you think he is in the house now asked pepper  that is something for us to find out if he is we must catch him and turn him over to the authorities  have we a right to enter the house questioned andy  i am sure mr ford would want us to do so andy  i guess you are right but be careful jack that fellow whoever he is may be a desperate character  perhaps he isnt here now said fred he may have looted the place and skipped  ill soon see cried jack pepper do you want to go in with me you other fellows might stay on guard  sure ill go in answered the imp  in a moment more the two cadets stood in the sittingroom of the mansion  better not make too much noise whispered jack if he is here we may be able to take him unawares  as the sky was overcast that afternoon it was rather dark in the mansion and the cadets could see but little as they made their way from one room to another they were just entering the diningroom when peppers foot struck something and sent it spinning across the floor  whats that asked his chum  i dont knowsounded like a spoon or a fork was the reply pepper walked forward bent down and felt around yes its a silver fork  it made as much noise as if it was a dozen of em murmured his chum  hark  pepper put up his hand and both listened intently they had heard a noise as of footsteps overhead  somebody is up there whispered jack  it must be the fellow we are after returned pepper what shall we do next go after him  yes but we had better try to arm ourselves  ive got the fork  ill take this said jack picking up a bronze ornament from the mantelpiece  hardly daring to breathe the two cadets stole from the diningroom to the hall and prepared to mount the stairs as they did this they heard more footsteps this time in the rear of the upper floor of the mansion  there he goes jack  sounds as if he was going to try to get out the back way  hi there stop called pepper at the top of his voice stop you rascal  dont you try to stop me was the reply from the upper hallway if you do it will be the worse for you  who is he asked pepper quickly ive heard that voice before  i think i know answered his chum come on and well soon see if i am right     chapter xxvi  what the constable thought   up the stairs went the two cadets jack leading the way on the upper landing they paused for the sounds of footsteps had suddenly ceased  which way did he go whispered pepper  i dont know pepper go slow now we dont want to walk into any trap  with caution the chums made their way to the back end of the hall as they did this a door close by came open and a cold draught of air met the lads  this way cried jack he has opened a window that air comes from outside  he rushed through the open door to find himself in a bedroom in an alcove was a window and this was wide open beyond the window was the top of a back porch with a trellis reaching to the ground  there he goes exclaimed jack pointing down among the trees  stop stop came in a cry from the side of the mansion and a moment later andy appeared followed by fred  stop the rascal shouted jack and bounced out on the porch with all speed down the trellis he came with pepper following  by this time the fleeing individual had gained the shelter of a number of trees beyond these was a hedge and he dove through this and then into some brushwood that lined the highway  can you catch him andy asked jack  i can try was the answer  keep back unless you want to get shot roared the man and he raised something he held in his hand it was too dark to see if it was a pistol  andy came to a halt and in a few moments his companions joined him by this time the fellow was out of sight the cadets strained their ears but in the snow no sounds of footsteps reached them  i guess we have lost him murmured fred  sorry i didnt keep after him grumbled andy  he might have shot you  come on let us make a hunt for him cried jack and this was done but though they searched the vicinity for the best part of half an hour they failed to locate the man who had fled  jack who do you think it was questioned pepper as the four boys gathered in the mansion and lit one of the lamps for it was now quite dark  i may be mistaken but to me his voice sounded like that of the man reff ritter met in cedarville cameron smith  just what i think cried the imp did you get a look at his face  not a close look and it was too dark to see much but that smith had a queer catch in his voice and this fellow had the same thing  yes i remember that  was that the fellow reff met demanded andy  we are not sure andy but we think so  what was he doing here asked fred  that remains for us to find out answered pepper certainly the man had no right here otherwise he wouldnt have run away as he did  let us take a look through the house suggested pepper  a handlamp was lit and the boys began a systematic inspection of the lodge they found nothing disturbed in most of the rooms but when they inspected the library all set up a shout  the safe  it has been blown open  yes and look the contents are scattered all over the floor  it was true the small safe that was located under a bend of the stairs had been drilled and the door blown asunder on the floor of the library lay the shattered door and likewise several bundles of papers and legallooking documents they also saw a case that had contained silverware  wonder how much he took said pepper  he took something that is sure answered jack  we must have come in right after he blew the safe open said andy  boys i think we ought to notify the authorities at once and also notify the fords cried jack this is a serious piece of business  let us go to the nearest farmhouse and tell the folks suggested andy  he hardly uttered the words when a loud ring at the front door of the mansion made every cadet jump  there is somebody now cried fred  ill see who it is said pepper and went off followed by jack  when they opened the door they found themselves confronted by a farmer named fasick who lived in that vicinity  hello cried the farmer on noticing the uniforms the boys wore what are you cadets doing here  who are you questioned jack  im isaac fasick and i own the farm down the road a spell i saw the lights here and as mr ford asked me to keep an eye on his property i made up my mind id come over and see what it meant is he here on a visit  not that we know of mr fasick answered jack come in out of the cold and well tell you something  the burly farmer entered and the cadets quickly related what had occurred when mr fasick saw the shattered safe he was all but stunned  the pesky rascal he ejaculated did he run away with much  that we dont know for we have no idea what was in the safe replied jack  he must have taken some of the silver spoons and knives and forks put in pepper here is the empty silverware case and i found a loose silver fork on the floor of the diningroom  the fords will be the only ones to tell just what was taken said andy and the sooner we notify them the better  i dont know if they are in the city or not said isaac fasick i know they meant to travel some this winter  they are at their city home just now i got a letter day before yesterday answered the former major of the school battalion he did not deem it necessary to say the letter was from laura ford  let us telegraph to them said pepper but what about the thief we ought to get right after him  we can tell jed plodders said the farmer hes the cedarville constable and pretty smart too  jed will never catch that fellow answered jack hell be miles and miles away before the constable gets his badge pinned on to go after him  oh jed is smart cried the farmer hes my wifes second cousin and the whole family is mighty cute  all right let him catch the thief answered pepper  matters were talked over for several minutes and the boys decided to separate andy and pepper to remain on guard at the lodge and fred and jack to run the iceboat to cedarville and take isaac fasick along  now dont you run into no airholes cried the farmer as he took a seat on the skimmer i dont want to drown just yet not me  well be on our guard answered the owner of the craft  the wind is just right said jack as the mainsail was hoisted this was true and the run to the village took but a few minutes while the boys went off to send their message to the fords isaac fasick hunted up the constable and related what had occurred  ha a robbery eh cried the constable looking highly important  thats it jed  and you caught the boys in the house all alone went on the constable trying to look very wise  why yes i did  maybe they did the robbery isaac  by gum i didnt think of that jed exclaimed the farmer  it would be an easy way of tryin to look innercent went on the constable they fixed it all upblow open the safe hide the silver an other valerables an then when you surprise em they try to put the crime off on sumbuddy else  say jed do you think thats so asked the farmer his suspicions aroused  dont it look reasonable isaac  it sure does jed but to think them boys would do sech a terruble deed  some o them boys at boardinschool spend a fierce sight o money some of em drink an gamble they aint above gittin money by hook or crook ef they need it yes they may be guilty and the constable swelled out with his own importance  perhaps you better question em suggested the farmer timidly  question em snorted the constable yes i will an ill do moreill hold em until this mysterious case is cleared up     chapter xxvii  looking for clues   having sent their message to the fords the two cadets turned in the direction where the farmer had said the constable lived  i dont think old plodders will be able to do a thing said jack hell look wise and ask a lot of questions and thats all  a block had been covered when they saw the farmer and the constable approaching on his breast jed plodders had pinned a bright silver star and he carried a policemans club in his hand  there they are cried isaac fasick  is them the cadets queried the guardian of the peace  thats two of em the other two said theyd stay an watch the house  stop cried the constable and pointed his club at the cadets  are you constable plodders questioned jack  thats who i be was the stern reply now then out with it young fellers you broke into mr fords house didnt you now dont try to fool me fer it wont wash you broke into the house and mr fasick ketched you at it didnt he and the constable cast what was meant for an eagle eye on jack and then on fred he had made up his mind that he would surprise both of the boys into a confession  the two cadets stared in wonder at the constable and then a smile came into jacks face the situation was so ludicrous he felt like laughing jed plodders saw the smile and frowned deeply  this aint no laughing matter you scamp he bellowed you broke into the ford house an tried to steal the silverware now dont try to deny it or it will be the wuss fer you you done it now didnt you and he pointed his club at first one cadet and then the other  no we didnt do it burst out fred you are a great big chump to think we did  hi hi dont you talk to me like that roared the guardian of the peace  then dont you accuse us of any crime came quickly from jack  didnt mr fasick find you at the house demanded the constable  he did but we didnt go there to steal we went there to see if everything was all right he went there for the same purpose  say dont you go for to mix me up in this robbery interrupted isaac fasick hastily i didnt have a thing to do with it  no more had we answered fred we just sailed to the place on my iceboat we can prove it  we are friends of the ford family we can easily prove that too added jack mr ford and his wife both asked us when we were in this vicinity to take a look and see if everything was all right we found a strange man in the mansion and we did our best to catch him but he got away what we want you to do is to get busy and try to catch that rascal if you dont do it well make a complaint against you for neglect of duty  while jack had been major of the school battalion he had been in the habit of speaking in an authoritative voice and now he used the same tone in addressing jed plodders the constable stared at the cadet for a moment and then his jaw dropped and likewise the club in his hand  wellerif youre friends o the family mebbe that alters theerthe case he stammered why didnt you say so fust  you didnt give us a chance answered fred  what you want to do is to go to the house and then try to get on the track of that robber said jack well help you all we can  i got to send word to mr ford  we have already done that and he will probably come as quickly as he can or send somebody  did you git a good look at the man  no not a very good look  then you haint got no idee who he might be went on the constable  well i think commenced jack and then broke off short and at the same time pinched freds arm it would do little or no good to acquaint the constable with their suspicion that the rascal might be the man named cameron smith  what do you think demanded jed plodders  i think i saw the man in cedarville once but i am not certain i rather imagine he was a stranger around here  thets what he was came from isaac fasick there haint no thieves livin in these parts we are all honest folks  several other men of cedarville were told about the robbery and a crowd of half a dozen got on the iceboat and sailed to point view lodge when they arrived at the house they found that pepper and andy had brought in some wood and started a cheerful blaze in the big fireplace of the livingroom  it was so cold we couldnt stand it said pepper i dont think mr ford will mind  the constable and the other newcomers inspected the damage done to the safe with interest and walked through the rooms of the house the cadets showed them just how the thief had made his escape and jed plodders and two of the men went off to see if they could trail the evildoer  i think at least one of us ought to stay here until mr ford comes said pepper  supposing you and i stay suggested andy fred and jack can take the iceboat back to the hall and explain matters to captain putnam  this was agreed to and a little later the skimmer was on the way to the school it was now after eight oclock and the cadets were hungry andy and pepper were to have their meals sent to them from the fasick farmhouse  tying up at the boathouse landing jack and fred hurried into the hall as they passed one of the classrooms they came face to face with reff ritter  got back late didnt you said the bully to fred  yes was the short reply  the bully passed on without another word  jack was in a quandary what should he tell captain putnam if he told of his suspicions concerning cameron smith he would drag reff ritter into the mixup  i guess i had better wait until something more turns up he thought if i mention this smith and he is innocent both he and reff will be terribly angry at me  as briefly as possible the former major of the school battalion related what had occurred at point view lodge captain putnam listened with keen interest  it is a pity you didnt catch that robber said he for all we know he may be the fellow who has been stealing here  well we couldnt get him answered jack maybe constable plodders will be more successful  i hardly think so ruddy so you left snow and ditmore at the lodge  yes sir we thought mr ford would like them to remain until he got there or sent somebody  i see captain putnam mused for a moment i dont see that i can do anything you had better go and get your supper tell the head waiter i sent you in  yes sir said jack and he and fred hurried off to the messhall the waiter was inclined to grumble a little at having to serve them at such a late hour but nevertheless he got them plenty to eat and they pitched in as only hungry boys can  on the following morning came word from cedarville that mr ford had arrived and jack and fred were allowed to take the skimmer and sail to point view lodge there they met the gentleman who was somewhat excited over what had occurred  the loss of the silverware is a serious one said he the ware came from my wifes grandfather and she prized it very highly i meant to take it to the city with me but forgot to ship it and so we placed it in the safe here a couple of gold napkinrings are also gone and likewise my old gold watch  mr ford i wish to tell you something in private said jack and then he took the gentleman aside and related his suspicions concerning cameron smith  i think this is assuredly worth looking into jack said rossmore ford slowly i shall put a firstclass city detective on this case and ill tell him about this cameron smith hell soon be able to find out who the chap is if he is an honest man well and good but if not well round him up and make him give an account of himself  please dont mention our names said jack gravely and please dont mention reff ritter  ill remember that answered the owner of the lodge     chapter xxviii  to the rescue   if this weather keeps on skating and iceboating will soon be over jack  right you are pepper i think if we want any more skating this season we had better go out this afternoon  just what i say cried dale blackmore if it starts to rain the ice will be gone in no time  all out for a skate as soon as school is dismissed came from andy  a week had passed and during that time nothing had been learned concerning the robbery at point view lodge mr ford had hired two city detectives but so far neither these men nor the local constable had been able to accomplish anything one city detective was trying to locate cameron smith but that individual could not be traced  during the past few days the weather had moderated greatly much of the snow was gone and the cadets feared that soon the ice on the lake would disappear and then skating would be a thing of the past  spring will be here before you know it said pepper  yes and then summer and the end of our days at putnam hall added jack with something of a sigh  jack how are you getting along in your studies questioned andy  fairly well i find latin rather hard how about you andy  mathematics is my bugbear jack some of those problems old crabtree gives us are corkers  well you must be sure to pass andy and then it will be goodby to crabtree forever  after school was dismissed about twenty of the cadets hurried down to the lakefront to go skating  i see reff ritter has hired the rosebud again remarked pepper as he was adjusting his skates fred are you going to take out the skimmer  no i dont think it is safe skating is one thing to sail a heavy iceboat is another  just my idea added stuffer  they watched reff ritter sail away the only person with the bully was gus coulter jack and pepper watched ritter closely and then looked questioningly at each other what did ritter know about cameron smith and was the man really the fellow who had robbed the ford mansion  soon the merry shouts of the cadets proved they were enjoying themselves thoroughly some started a race while others formed sides for a hockey contest with dale blackmore as captain of one five and emerald hogan as captain of the other  let us go down the shore a bit suggested jack to pepper and andy and the three joined hands for the spin all felt like letting out as andy expressed it and they covered over a mile almost before they knew it  the ice is getting pretty rotten said jack as his skate cut in so deeply that he would have fallen had not his chums supported him  yes a day or two more and skating will be at an end answered andy  jack are you going in for baseball this spring questioned pepper  no i am going in for nothing but study towards the end of the term  well i guess ill have to do the sameif i want to graduate answered pepper and he heaved a deep sigh as he thought of all the fun he would have to miss  the three cadets skated on until they came to a spot where the shore made a sharp turn on the point of land were a number of trees and bushes so they could not see what was beyond  listen cried andy somebody is calling  help help came the cry help  somebody must have broken in exclaimed jack come on maybe we can save him  he broke away and led around the point of land beyond were some rocks and a sort of cove where the ice was extra soft  there is an iceboat exclaimed andy its the rosebud  its in the water ejaculated pepper and see gus coulter is clinging to it  where is ritter  i dont know  i see ritter burst out jack he is clinging to the ice yonder trying to crawl out come on fellows weve got to help them both  help help screamed gus coulter and his voice showed that he was almost scared to death ritter did not call but was making frantic efforts to get on top of the ice which seemed to break away as he placed his weight on it  it took jack pepper and andy but a minute to get to the vicinity of the mishap as he skated forward the former major of the school battalion stripped off the sweater he was wearing  join hands with me he called to his chums now be careful not too near the hole remember ill throw ritter the end of the sweater  his chums understood and while they held hands jack advanced cautiously the ice cracked ominously but step by step he drew closer to where ritter was clinging  catch hold he cried as he swung one end of the sweater toward the unfortunate youth  youyou wont let go questioned the bully suspiciously  of course not retorted jack hold tight now and well haul you up  he gave the signal and andy and pepper pulled back with all their might and jack did the same slowly but surely reff ritter came up out of the icy water his teeth chattering loudly soon he was out of danger  run for the nearest farmhouse cried jack put the sweater on if you want to and he tossed the garment over  it was coulters fault growled reff ritter he swung the sail the wrong way and then he ran off as advised  such meanness snorted pepper and coulter may be drowned  ritter was always willing to lay the blame on somebody else added andy  the chums skated as closely as possible to where the iceboat was drifting in a sheet of open watera spot where some days before a farmer had been cutting ice to the craft coulter was clinging and still crying piteously  help came in a chattering tone please help me somebody or ill be drodrowned i cant hohold on mumuch longer  we are coming coulter yelled pepper  im nearly frofrozen to dedeath chattered the suffering cadet  if we only had a line we might throw it to him said andy  ive got an idea exclaimed pepper come on and get that fallen tree  he pointed to the shore where a long sapling lay partly uncovered in the snow he skated off for this with andy at his heels  while andy and pepper were doing their best to get the sapling out of the snow and drag it over the ice jack circled the spot where the rosebud was drifting the iceboat was now within ten feet of the ice so he could see coulter quite plainly the poor fellow had been ducked in the water and was shaking from head to feet from cold  well soon have you ashore gus he called out keep up your courage  ii cant hold on much longer was the gaspedout reply i am freefreezing to dedeath  at that moment a blast of air came sweeping across the lake it caught the sail of the iceboat and tilted the craft over in the water  oh oh screamed coulter and then as the iceboat whirled around the exhausted cadet lost his grip and commenced to slip slowly downward soon he was in the water up to his shoulders  save me he yelled oh ruddy dont let me drown please sasave mme please and then of a sudden his head went under out of sight  jack was for the moment struck dumb with horror he felt that coulter was drowning before his very eyes then a sudden noble determination came to him and measuring his distance carefully he leaped for the iceboat and managed to catch the swaying mast he went down in the water up to his knees but held on to a stay with his left hand  the icy water made the youth gasp but he set his teeth hard and looked down for coulter presently he saw the other cadet bob upward then a hand came up and was waved frantically jack tried his best to reach that hand but could not then coulter commenced to sink again from sight  i must save him i must thought jack and an instant later leaped boldly into the waters of the icy lake     chapter xxix  a real hero   it was a desperate plunge to take for the former major of the school battalion ran the risk of getting a chill that would kill him but jack was a hero and he could not bear to see gus coulter drowned before his eyes  as the icy waters closed over him he struck out boldly for the spot where he had last beheld the struggling youth then his hand came in contact with coulters body and he caught the cadet by the arm  as soon as coulter felt himself touched he swung around and the next instant had jack by the shoulder in a grip like that of death itself  the former major of the school battalion realized only too well that he must not let the drowning boy catch him by the neck otherwise both would go down to rise no more he shoved coulter as far off as possible and at the same time struck out to regain the surface of the lake  when the pair came up they were some distance from the iceboat and also some distance from the edge of the ice  help help yelled jack to pepper and andy  the latter had succeeded in getting the sapling free of the snow and were dragging it to the ice on the lakeshore  hello jacks in too cried andy in horror  hurry with the tree yelled jack as he commenced to swim for the edge of the ice quick now or well both go down again this water is frightfully cold  a few strokes brought jack and coulter to the edge of the ice coulter was still holding fast but his strength was rapidly growing weaker his head shook so that his teeth rattled like castanets  luckily jack reached a spot where the shore ice was tolerably firm more than this the water was somewhat shallow so he could stand on the bottom while pepper and andy shoved out the end of the sapling to him  here ill lift gus out he called his own teeth chattering not a little he cacant helhelp hihimself  he lifted the other cadet as high as he could and with a shove sent him rolling on the ice beyond andy and pepper caught coulter by the feet and immediately dragged him out of harms way then jack caught hold of the end of the sapling and was hauled up by his chums  how in the world did you fall in gasped andy  i didnt fall ini jujumped in  oh jack came from pepper talk about nerve but come you had better get to shelter as soon as you can  yes i fefeel as if i wawas turning to iiice chattered the other  the darwood farmhouse is just over the hill let us run to that suggested andy here put on my sweater and he stripped off the garment in an instant  dodont leave mme came from coulter he was on his knees being too weak to rise to his feet  ill carry you on my back cried pepper come take hold  coulter was too far gone to aid himself and andy had to place him on peppers back then off the whole party started andy holding jack by the arm and thus giving him some support  where did ritter go asked jack as they sped over the hill in the direction of the farmhouse mentioned  i think he went up the lake in the direction of the saldy farm answered andy  the darwood farmhouse set back from the road among some cedar trees rushing up to the back door the boys pounded vigorously  who is there demanded a mans voice and then mr darwood showed himself  please let us in we are nearly frozen cried jack  hello been in the water eh cried samuel darwood come right in and ill stir up the fire and he stepped aside that the cadets might enter  when pepper deposited his burden in a chair it was seen that gus coulter was in a bad way his eyes were closed and he was shaking as with convulsions  here well strip off some of his wet clothes and rub him down cried andy and can you get something hot to drink mr darwood  sure i can cried the farmer but ill pile some wood on the fire first he added  illustration catch hold jack cried as he swung one end of the sweater toward the unfortunate youth      the mystery of putnam hall page 259  he was as good as his word and soon the fire was roaring and the kitchen got thoroughly warm the farmer was home alone but he knew how to make some hot coffee which he speedily offered to all of the cadets coulter could hardly drink and it was a good halfhour before he felt at all like even speaking he was propped up in a big rockingchair directly in front of the fire and andy and pepper took turns at trying to restore his blood to circulation jack was not so far gone and soon felt quite like himself the wet uniforms were hung up to dry mr darwood in the meantime lending the lads some other garments he had been the one to cut the ice from the lake at that spot so he felt in some measure responsible for the mishap even though he had put up several danger signs to which ritter and coulter had paid no attention  i dont know that we will care to skate back to the hall said pepper mr darwood could you take us back in your sleigh if we paid you for it  ill take you back and it shant cost you a cent answered the farmer quickly  hadnt we better find out what became of reff ritter questioned jack  ill run over to the saldy farm and see answered andy and set off without delay  while andy was gone samuel darwood went to the barn to hitch up his team jack pepper and coulter remained in the kitchen coulter sat staring at the fire but occasionally his eyes wandered to jack suddenly while the others were silent he spoke  say but youre a fine fellow jack ruddy he said a fine fellow and im aa skunk thats what i am a lowdown mean skunk  never mind now gus answered jack kindly he hardly knew what to say at this outburst  youyou jumped in and saved me from drowning didnt you  yes but anybody would do that gus for a schoolmate  no they wouldnt reff ritter wouldnt he would have left me to drown and coulter shuddered youre a real hero jack ruddy and im aa skunk yes a mean lowdown skunkand i always have been and now gus coulter buried his face in his hands  jack certainly deserves great credit for jumping in after you said pepper warmly it was a mighty cold plunge for anybody to take  oh lets drop it came modestly from the hero of the occasion  i am not going to drop it retorted gus coulter with spirit you saved my life and i want everybody to know it especially reff ritter he would have left me to drown  reff had to save himself he was chilled to the bone when we got him out answered jack  if you had been reff you wouldnt have run away and left me to drown went on coulter stubbornly  at this jack was silent  you dont know it all jack ruddy reff and i had a quarrel he said hehe didnt want to have anything more to do with me i believe hehe would have been glad to have me drown  oh dont say that gus burst out pepper  but i will say it flared out gus coulter after this i am going to cut reff ritter and i am going to tell what i know about him too and i am going to get nick paxton to tell what he knows too  what do you know about him asked jack with sudden interest  oh i know a good deal  coulter answer me honestly do you know anything about his dealings with a certain man named cameron smith  oh do you know that fellow questioned the other cadet and he stared wonderingly at jack  i know a little about him  dont you have anything to do with him jack and dont you have much to do with reff they are both bad oh you dont know how bad and gus coulter shook his head to emphasize his words  what did you and reff quarrel about gus asked pepper  we quarreled aboutabout oh i dont know how i can speak of it but i suppose ive got to if i want to remain honest we quarreled over something i found one day in his private box i got suspicious of him and when he was taking a nap i took his key and opened the box and in the box what do you suppose i found  what came simultaneously from jack and pepper  your watch and chain jack     chapter xxx  the mystery explainedconclusion   my watch and chain cried the former major of the school battalion  yes  what did you do about it why didnt you report it to me or to captain putnam  i was so stunned i didnt know what to do i couldnt believe that reff had taken them and that he was guilty of the robberies that were going on i locked the box up and put the key back in his pocket that night i accused him of the theft and we had a quarrel and almost came to blows he said he didnt take the watch and chain that he found them in the gymnasium near the lockers he said he was only keeping them to get square with you and that he would return them to you before the term closed  found them in the gym repeated pepper  i dont believe it came firmly from the former major of the school battalion i believe he took them and i believe he took the other things too  and i believe that myself now cried gus coulter oh my eyes are open i used to think reff was a pretty good fellow even though something of a bully but i am learning that he is bad through and through paxton saw him sneaking through the dormitories at night and he got afraid of him and cut him  and what of cameron smith asked jack you said he was bad  he is i didnt know it at first but i heard about it during the holidays when he and reff went off on what they called a good time  can you give me smiths real address  he claims to come from boston but i know reff once sent him a letter addressed to springfield care of the excelsior hotel  having once opened his mind gus coulter talked freely of his doings with reff ritter he said the bully had quite some money at times but the amount was quickly spent  just as mr darwood drove around to the door with his sleigh andy came back to the farmhouse  i had some hot words with ritter he explained he was just as bullying as ever and gave us no credit for hauling him out of the lake and he said if coulter was drowned it would be his own fault oh he is the limit  the ride to putnam hall was a short one and on arriving at the school the cadets hurried to their dormitories to change their damp clothing for suits which were perfectly dry in the meantime jack asked pepper to find captain putnam and tell the master of the school that he wished to see him on a matter of great importance  a little later the former major of the school battalion entered the captains private office followed by pepper and andy they found captain putnam staring at a telegram that had just come in  well what can i do for you he asked  ive got something to tell you sir returned jack and as briefly as possible he narrated what had occurred on the lake and repeated what coulter had told him as he progressed captain putnam shook his head sadly  it must be true he said almost brokenly it all fits inthis telegram and what you say  the telegram repeated jack  yes ruddy this telegram is from mr ford he states that cameron smith has been caught and has made a confession that he looted the safe at point view lodge smith was partly intoxicated at the time of his capture and informed the detective that some jewelry he had in his possession had come from reff ritter he stated that ritter took the stuff from the cadets and the others while they slept and it was smiths part to pawn the things and divide the proceeds  and ritter was guilty of all the thefts at the hall cried pepper  yes and he even took some of his own things just for a blind according to this man smith what coulter has to say and paxton seems to corroborate his story  what a terrible thing to do murmured jack  smith had a bunch of pawn tickets hidden away in a drawer and they represent all the things taken from this school and they also represent some other things namely those lost by you snow at the time the horse ran away with you  then it was cameron smith after all whom i saw and who robbed me when i was unconscious cried the acrobatic youth  yes he was a bad man and i have no doubt but that he was the one to lead ritter astray  what are you going to do with ritter  i cannot do otherwise than have him arrested but i hate to have such a scandal attached to the school and captain putnam heaved a sigh that came from the bottom of his heart  in the meantime reff ritter had come back to putnam hall in another sleigh and had gone to his dormitory to change his clothes here he was confronted by coulter and a little later by nick paxton and a hot discussion arose which ended in blows both coulter and paxton fell upon the bully together and punished him severely the pair told ritter what they thought of him and each declared that he was going to expose the bully to captain putnam  ill tell all i know about ruddys watch and chain and about you and that cameron smith too declared coulter  dont you do it shouted ritter  and ill tell what i know about your sneaking in and out of the dormitories at night added paxton and then he and coulter went off together  they reached the office just as jack andy and pepper were about to leave each told his story and both were closely questioned by the master of the school  how long ago did you find this out about the watch and chain coulter demanded captain putnam  only a few days ago sir  you should have told me before and you paxton should have told me about ritters sneaking around  oh i thought it was only fun at first pleaded paxton  he is undoubtedly guilty and there remains nothing to do but to have him arrested  it was not long after this when he and george strong went on a hunt for reff ritter to place him in the guardroom until an officer of the law could be summoned ritter could not be found and it was not until some time later that peleg snuggers brought in the information that the cadet had been seen leaving the hall dresssuit case in hand by a side door  he has run away cried george strong  if so perhaps it is just as well murmured captain putnam to prosecute him in court would create a terrible scandal i would rather pay for the stolen things out of my own pocket  reff ritter had indeed run away by some means unknown he managed to get to a town at the end of the lake and there boarded a midnight train bound west he was traced as far as chicago but that was the last seen or heard of him until many years later when it was learned that he had gone to alaska with some gold miners he got very little gold for a large amount of hard work and drifted from place to place picking up odd jobs that offered themselves  the announcement that ritter was the fellow who had perpetrated the many thefts at putnam hall created strong excitement in the school but the matter was hushed up as much as possible by captain putnam and the master saw to it that every cadet got back the things that belonged to him and also squared matters with the teachers  in due course of time cameron smith was tried for the robbery of point view lodge and was sent to prison for a term of years he admitted robbing andy after the runaway and the acrobatic youth got back from the pawnbrokers the things taken on that occasion  after the excitement had passed jack pepper andy and their chums of the senior class buckled down to hard work for the rest of the term as a consequence jack graduated at the head of the class with joe nelson second andy third stuffer fourth pepper fifth henry lee sixth and fred century seventh  i must congratulate you ruddy cried captain putnam warmly all through your term at this school you have made a record to be proud of and the other graduates have made fine records too i shall hate to part with all of you  and i shall hate to leave putnam hall answered the former major of the school battalion i have had the time of my life since i have been here  so have i put in pepper  the best ever chimed in andy  i shall never forget putnam hall no matter where i go came from stuffer  the best school there ever was added joe nelson                                       and now kind reader let me add a few words more and then bring this story of the putnam hall mystery to a close as i promised some years ago when i gave you the putnam hall cadets i have now related in detail the most important events that transpired at the military school during the first years of its existence what took place there after jack ruddy and his chums left will be found set down in another line of books called the rover boys series starting with the rover boys at school in that volume you will not only meet the three jolly rover brothersdick tom and sambut also learn more concerning the doings of bart conners harry blossom and dave kearney and again meet that dictatorial old teacher josiah crabtree and the bully dan baxter and his toady mumps the rover boys went to putnam hall for a number of years and had just as good a time as did jack and his friends  the graduation exercises at putnam hall were that year very elaborate and many visitors were present including the parents and brothers and sisters of the graduates and mr and mrs ford and laura and flossie  oh i am so glad that you came out at the head of the class jack cried laura as she came up to shake his hand  thank you very much laura he answered and then as he took her hand he looked full into her clear eyes id rather have your congratulations than anything else he added  oh jack she murmured and then she gave him a glance that thrilled him through and through heretofore they had only been friends but from that moment a deeper sentiment seemed to stir them both and years later when jack became settled in business pretty laura ford became mrs ruddy in the same year pepper who went into the insurance business with his father married flossie and all were very happy andy remained a jolly bachelor to visit one or the other of his chums as suited him he went into business with jack and the firm prospered greatly  the fun when the school broke up for the term was of the nevertobeforgotten variety great bonfires were lit along the lakeshore and around these the cadets gathered to sing and cut up generally some of the boys caught peleg snuggers and made him ride a wooden horse while others captured mumps and made the sneak dive headfirst into a barrel that contained several pounds of pulverized charcoal when the cadet came forth he was a sight to behold one bonfire was made up of discarded schoolbooks  farewell to thee forever cried pepper as he cast in an old grammar and a volume of ciceros works never again shall i need thee thank goodness and this speech brought forth a roar of laughter  everybody in a grand march shouted andy a little later jack as our old major you must lead off  so i will answered jack with a happy smile battalion attention present firebrands forward march  and then the cadets marched around and across the campus waving their firebrands and singing and cheering lustily and here let us wish them all good luck and say goodby   the end     the famous rover boys series  by arthur m winfield  edward stratemeyer                                        american stories of american boys and girls
