is intended as far as possible to give an exact insight into the theory of relativity to those readers who from a general scientific and philosophical point of view are interested in the theory but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics the work presumes a standard of education corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination and despite the shortness of the book a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the reader the author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form and on the whole in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated in the interest of clearness it appeared to me inevitable that i should repeat myself frequently without paying the slightest attention to the elegance of the presentation i adhered scrupulously to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist l boltzmann according to whom matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler i make no pretence of having withheld from the reader difficulties which are inherent to the subject on the other hand i have purposely treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a stepmotherly fashion so that readers unfamiliar with physics may not feel like the wanderer who was unable to see the forest for the trees may the book bring some one a few happy hours of suggestive thought  december 1916 a einstein    part i  the special theory of relativity  physical meaning of geometrical propositions   in your schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance with the noble building of euclids geometry and you remember  perhaps with more respect than love  the magnificent structure on the lofty staircase of which you were chased about for uncounted hours by conscientious teachers by reason of our past experience you would certainly regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the most outoftheway proposition of this science to be untrue but perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if some one were to ask you what then do you mean by the assertion that these propositions are true let us proceed to give this question a little consideration  geometry sets out form certain conceptions such as plane point and straight line with which we are able to associate more or less definite ideas and from certain simple propositions axioms which in virtue of these ideas we are inclined to accept as true then on the basis of a logical process the justification of which we feel ourselves compelled to admit all remaining propositions are shown to follow from those axioms ie they are proven a proposition is then correct true when it has been derived in the recognised manner from the axioms the question of truth of the individual geometrical propositions is thus reduced to one of the truth of the axioms now it has long been known that the last question is not only unanswerable by the methods of geometry but that it is in itself entirely without meaning we cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line goes through two points we can only say that euclidean geometry deals with things called straight lines to each of which is ascribed the property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it the concept true does not tally with the assertions of pure geometry because by the word true we are eventually in the habit of designating always the correspondence with a real object geometry however is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it to objects of experience but only with the logical connection of these ideas among themselves  it is not difficult to understand why in spite of this we feel constrained to call the propositions of geometry true geometrical ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature and these last are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the genesis of those ideas geometry ought to refrain from such a course in order to give to its structure the largest possible logical unity the practice for example of seeing in a distance two marked positions on a practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our habit of thought we are accustomed further to regard three points as being situated on a straight line if their apparent positions can be made to coincide for observation with one eye under suitable choice of our place of observation  if in pursuance of our habit of thought we now supplement the propositions of euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two points on a practically rigid body always correspond to the same distance lineinterval independently of any changes in position to which we may subject the body the propositions of euclidean geometry then resolve themselves into propositions on the possible relative position of practically rigid bodies geometry which has been supplemented in this way is then to be treated as a branch of physics we can now legitimately ask as to the truth of geometrical propositions interpreted in this way since we are justified in asking whether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have associated with the geometrical ideas in less exact terms we can express this by saying that by the truth of a geometrical proposition in this sense we understand its validity for a construction with rule and compasses  of course the conviction of the truth of geometrical propositions in this sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete experience for the present we shall assume the truth of the geometrical propositions then at a later stage in the general theory of relativity we shall see that this truth is limited and we shall consider the extent of its limitation     notes   it follows that a natural object is associated also with a straight line three points a b and c on a rigid body thus lie in a straight line when the points a and c being given b is chosen such that the sum of the distances ab and bc is as short as possible this incomplete suggestion will suffice for the present purpose    the system of coordinates   on the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has been indicated we are also in a position to establish the distance between two points on a rigid body by means of measurements for this purpose we require a  distance  rod s which is to be used once and for all and which we employ as a standard measure if now a and b are two points on a rigid body we can construct the line joining them according to the rules of geometry  then starting from a we can mark off the distance s time after time until we reach b the number of these operations required is the numerical measure of the distance ab this is the basis of all measurement of length   every description of the scene of an event or of the position of an object in space is based on the specification of the point on a rigid body body of reference with which that event or object coincides this applies not only to scientific description but also to everyday life if i analyse the place specification  times square new york a i arrive at the following result the earth is the rigid body to which the specification of place refers  times square new york is a welldefined point to which a name has been assigned and with which the event coincides in spaceb  this primitive method of place specification deals only with places on the surface of rigid bodies and is dependent on the existence of points on this surface which are distinguishable from each other but we can free ourselves from both of these limitations without altering the nature of our specification of position if for instance a cloud is hovering over times square then we can determine its position relative to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole perpendicularly on the square so that it reaches the cloud the length of the pole measured with the standard measuringrod combined with the specification of the position of the foot of the pole supplies us with a complete place specification on the basis of this illustration we are able to see the manner in which a refinement of the conception of position has been developed  a we imagine the rigid body to which the place specification is referred supplemented in such a manner that the object whose position we require is reached by the completed rigid body  b in locating the position of the object we make use of a number here the length of the pole measured with the measuringrod instead of designated points of reference  c we speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which reaches the cloud has not been erected by means of optical observations of the cloud from different positions on the ground and taking into account the properties of the propagation of light we determine the length of the pole we should have required in order to reach the cloud  from this consideration we see that it will be advantageous if in the description of position it should be possible by means of numerical measures to make ourselves independent of the existence of marked positions possessing names on the rigid body of reference in the physics of measurement this is attained by the application of the cartesian system of coordinates  this consists of three plane surfaces perpendicular to each other and rigidly attached to a rigid body referred to a system of coordinates the scene of any event will be determined for the main part by the specification of the lengths of the three perpendiculars or coordinates x y z which can be dropped from the scene of the event to those three plane surfaces the lengths of these three perpendiculars can be determined by a series of manipulations with rigid measuringrods performed according to the rules and methods laid down by euclidean geometry  in practice the rigid surfaces which constitute the system of coordinates are generally not available  furthermore the magnitudes of the coordinates are not actually determined by constructions with rigid rods but by indirect means if the results of physics and astronomy are to maintain their clearness the physical meaning of specifications of position must always be sought in accordance with the above considerations   we thus obtain the following result every description of events in space involves the use of a rigid body to which such events have to be referred the resulting relationship takes for granted that the laws of euclidean geometry hold for distances the distance being represented physically by means of the convention of two marks on a rigid body     notes   here we have assumed that there is nothing left over ie that the measurement gives a whole number this difficulty is got over by the use of divided measuringrods the introduction of which does not demand any fundamentally new method  a einstein used potsdamer platz berlin in the original text in the authorised translation this was supplemented with tranfalgar square london we have changed this to times square new york as this is the most well knownidentifiable location to english speakers in the present day note by the janitor  b it is not necessary here to investigate further the significance of the expression coincidence in space this conception is sufficiently obvious to ensure that differences of opinion are scarcely likely to arise as to its applicability in practice   a refinement and modification of these views does not become necessary until we come to deal with the general theory of relativity treated in the second part of this book    space and time in classical mechanics   the purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their position in space with time i should load my conscience with grave sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were i to formulate the aims of mechanics in this way without serious reflection and detailed explanations let us proceed to disclose these sins  it is not clear what is to be understood here by position and space i stand at the window of a railway carriage which is travelling uniformly and drop a stone on the embankment without throwing it then disregarding the influence of the air resistance i see the stone descend in a straight line a pedestrian who observes the misdeed from the footpath notices that the stone falls to earth in a parabolic curve i now ask do the positions traversed by the stone lie in reality on a straight line or on a parabola moreover what is meant here by motion in space  from the considerations of the previous section the answer is selfevident in the first place we entirely shun the vague word space of which we must honestly acknowledge we cannot form the slightest conception and we replace it by motion relative to a practically rigid body of reference the positions relative to the body of reference railway carriage or embankment have already been defined in detail in the preceding section if instead of  body of reference  we insert  system of coordinates which is a useful idea for mathematical description we are in a position to say  the stone traverses a straight line relative to a system of coordinates rigidly attached to the carriage but relative to a system of coordinates rigidly attached to the ground embankment it describes a parabola with the aid of this example it is clearly seen that there is no such thing as an independently existing trajectory lit pathcurve but only a trajectory relative to a particular body of reference  in order to have a complete description of the motion we must specify how the body alters its position with time  ie for every point on the trajectory it must be stated at what time the body is situated there these data must be supplemented by such a definition of time that in virtue of this definition these timevalues can be regarded essentially as magnitudes results of measurements capable of observation if we take our stand on the ground of classical mechanics we can satisfy this requirement for our illustration in the following manner we imagine two clocks of identical construction  the man at the railwaycarriage window is holding one of them and the man on the footpath the other each of the observers determines the position on his own referencebody occupied by the stone at each tick of the clock he is holding in his hand in this connection we have not taken account of the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the velocity of propagation of light with this and with a second difficulty prevailing here we shall have to deal in detail later     notes   that is a curve along which the body moves    the galileian system of coordinates   as is well known the fundamental law of the mechanics of galileinewton which is known as the law of inertia can be stated thus a body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line this law not only says something about the motion of the bodies but it also indicates the referencebodies or systems of coordinates permissible in mechanics which can be used in mechanical description the visible fixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to a high degree of approximation now if we use a system of coordinates which is rigidly attached to the earth then relative to this system every fixed star describes a circle of immense radius in the course of an astronomical day a result which is opposed to the statement of the law of inertia so that if we adhere to this law we must refer these motions only to systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed stars do not move in a circle a system of coordinates of which the state of motion is such that the law of inertia holds relative to it is called a  galileian system of coordinates the laws of the mechanics of galfleinewton can be regarded as valid only for a galileian system of coordinates    the principle of relativity in the restricted sense   in order to attain the greatest possible clearness let us return to our example of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling uniformly we call its motion a uniform translation uniform because it is of constant velocity and direction  translation  because although the carriage changes its position relative to the embankment yet it does not rotate in so doing let us imagine a raven flying through the air in such a manner that its motion as observed from the embankment is uniform and in a straight line if we were to observe the flying raven from the moving railway carriage we should find that the motion of the raven would be one of different velocity and direction but that it would still be uniform and in a straight line expressed in an abstract manner we may say  if a mass m is moving uniformly in a straight line with respect to a coordinate system k then it will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line relative to a second coordinate system k1 provided that the latter is executing a uniform translatory motion with respect to k in accordance with the discussion contained in the preceding section it follows that  if k is a galileian coordinate system then every other coordinate system k is a galileian one when in relation to k it is in a condition of uniform motion of translation relative to k1 the mechanical laws of galileinewton hold good exactly as they do with respect to k  we advance a step farther in our generalisation when we express the tenet thus if relative to k k1 is a uniformly moving coordinate system devoid of rotation then natural phenomena run their course with respect to k1 according to exactly the same general laws as with respect to k this statement is called the principle of relativity in the restricted sense  as long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were capable of representation with the help of classical mechanics there was no need to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity but in view of the more recent development of electrodynamics and optics it became more and more evident that classical mechanics affords an insufficient foundation for the physical description of all natural phenomena at this juncture the question of the validity of the principle of relativity became ripe for discussion and it did not appear impossible that the answer to this question might be in the negative  nevertheless there are two general facts which at the outset speak very much in favour of the validity of the principle of relativity even though classical mechanics does not supply us with a sufficiently broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical phenomena still we must grant it a considerable measure of  truth since it supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies with a delicacy of detail little short of wonderful the principle of relativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the domain of mechanics but that a principle of such broad generality should hold with such exactness in one domain of phenomena and yet should be invalid for another is a priori not very probable  we now proceed to the second argument to which moreover we shall return later if the principle of relativity in the restricted sense does not hold then the galileian coordinate systems k k1 k2 etc which are moving uniformly relative to each other will not be equivalent for the description of natural phenomena in this case we should be constrained to believe that natural laws are capable of being formulated in a particularly simple manner and of course only on condition that from amongst all possible galileian coordinate systems we should have chosen one k0 of a particular state of motion as our body of reference we should then be justified because of its merits for the description of natural phenomena in calling this system  absolutely at rest and all other galileian systems k  in motion if for instance our embankment were the system k0 then our railway carriage would be a system k relative to which less simple laws would hold than with respect to k0 this diminished simplicity would be due to the fact that the carriage k would be in motion iereallywith respect to k0 in the general laws of nature which have been formulated with reference to k the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the carriage would necessarily play a part we should expect for instance that the note emitted by an organpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel would be different from that emitted if the axis of the pipe were placed perpendicular to this direction  now in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun our earth is comparable with a railway carriage travelling with a velocity of about 30 kilometres per second if the principle of relativity were not valid we should therefore expect that the direction of motion of the earth at any moment would enter into the laws of nature and also that physical systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the orientation in space with respect to the earth for owing to the alteration in direction of the velocity of revolution of the earth in the course of a year the earth cannot be at rest relative to the hypothetical system k0 throughout the whole year however the most careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical space ie a physical nonequivalence of different directions this is very powerful argument in favour of the principle of relativity    the theorem of the addition of velocities employed in classical mechanics   let us suppose our old friend the railway carriage to be travelling along the rails with a constant velocity v and that a man traverses the length of the carriage in the direction of travel with a velocity w how quickly or in other words with what velocity w does the man advance relative to the embankment during the process  the only possible answer seems to result from the following consideration if the man were to stand still for a second he would advance relative to the embankment through a distance v equal numerically to the velocity of the carriage as a consequence of his walking however he traverses an additional distance w relative to the carriage and hence also relative to the embankment in this second the distance w being numerically equal to the velocity with which he is walking thus in total be covers the distance wvw relative to the embankment in the second considered we shall see later that this result which expresses the theorem of the addition of velocities employed in classical mechanics cannot be maintained  in other words the law that we have just written down does not hold in reality for the time being however we shall assume its correctness    the apparent incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle of relativity   there is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to which light is propagated in empty space every child at school knows or believes he knows that this propagation takes place in straight lines with a velocity c 300000 kmsec at all events we know with great exactness that this velocity is the same for all colours because if this were not the case the minimum of emission would not be observed simultaneously for different colours during the eclipse of a fixed star by its dark neighbour by means of similar considerations based on observa tions of double stars the dutch astronomer de sitter was also able to show that the velocity of propagation of light cannot depend on the velocity of motion of the body emitting the light the assumption that this velocity of propagation is dependent on the direction in space is in itself improbable  in short let us assume that the simple law of the constancy of the velocity of light c in vacuum is justifiably believed by the child at school who would imagine that this simple law has plunged the conscientiously thoughtful physicist into the greatest intellectual difficulties let us consider how these difficulties arise  of course we must refer the process of the propagation of light and indeed every other process to a rigid referencebody coordinate system as such a system let us again choose our embankment we shall imagine the air above it to have been removed if a ray of light be sent along the embankment we see from the above that the tip of the ray will be transmitted with the velocity c relative to the embankment now let us suppose that our railway carriage is again travelling along the railway lines with the velocity v and that its direction is the same as that of the ray of light but its velocity of course much less let us inquire about the velocity of propagation of the ray of light relative to the carriage it is obvious that we can here apply the consideration of the previous section since the ray of light plays the part of the man walking along relatively to the carriage the velocity w of the man relative to the embankment is here replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment w is the required velocity of light with respect to the carriage and we have                                 w  cv  the velocity of propagation ot a ray of light relative to the carriage thus comes cut smaller than c  but this result comes into conflict with the principle of relativity set forth in section v for like every other general law of nature the law of the transmission of light in vacuo in vacuum must according to the principle of relativity be the same for the railway carriage as referencebody as when the rails are the body of reference but from our above consideration this would appear to be impossible if every ray of light is propagated relative to the embankment with the velocity c then for this reason it would appear that another law of propagation of light must necessarily hold with respect to the carriage  a result contradictory to the principle of relativity  in view of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it than to abandon either the principle of relativity or the simple law of the propagation of light in vacuo those of you who have carefully followed the preceding discussion are almost sure to expect that we should retain the principle of relativity which appeals so convincingly to the intellect because it is so natural and simple the law of the propagation of light in vacuo would then have to be replaced by a more complicated law conformable to the principle of relativity the development of theoretical physics shows however that we cannot pursue this course the epochmaking theoretical investigations of h a lorentz on the electrodynamical and optical phenomena connected with moving bodies show that experience in this domain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena of which the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo is a necessary consequence prominent theoretical physicists were theref ore more inclined to reject the principle of relativity in spite of the fact that no empirical data had been found which were contradictory to this principle  at this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena as a result of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and space it became evident that in realily there is not the least incompatibilitiy between the principle of relativity and the law of propagation of light and that by systematically holding fast to both these laws a logically rigid theory could be arrived at this theory has been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish it from the extended theory with which we shall deal later in the following pages we shall present the fundamental ideas of the special theory of relativity    on the idea of time in physics   lightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment at two places a and b far distant from each other i make the additional assertion that these two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously if i ask you whether there is sense in this statement you will answer my question with a decided yes but if i now approach you with the request to explain to me the sense of the statement more precisely you find after some consideration that the answer to this question is not so easy as it appears at first sight  after some time perhaps the following answer would occur to you the significance of the statement is clear in itself and needs no further explanation of course it would require some consideration if i were to be commissioned to determine by observations whether in the actual case the two events took place simultaneously or not i cannot be satisfied with this answer for the following reason supposing that as a result of ingenious considerations an able meteorologist were to discover that the lightning must always strike the places a and b simultaneously then we should be faced with the task of testing whether or not this theoretical result is in accordance with the reality we encounter the same difficulty with all physical statements in which the conception  simultaneous  plays a part the concept does not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility of discovering whether or not it is fulfilled in an actual case we thus require a definition of simultaneity such that this definition supplies us with the method by means of which in the present case he can decide by experiment whether or not both the lightning strokes occurred simultaneously as long as this requirement is not satisfied i allow myself to be deceived as a physicist and of course the same applies if i am not a physicist when i imagine that i am able to attach a meaning to the statement of simultaneity i would ask the reader not to proceed farther until he is fully convinced on this point  after thinking the matter over for some time you then offer the following suggestion with which to test simultaneity by measuring along the rails the connecting line ab should be measured up and an observer placed at the midpoint m of the distance ab this observer should be supplied with an arrangement eg two mirrors inclined at 900 which allows him visually to observe both places a and b at the same time if the observer perceives the two flashes of lightning at the same time then they are simultaneous  i am very pleased with this suggestion but for all that i cannot regard the matter as quite settled because i feel constrained to raise the following objection  your definition would certainly be right if only i knew that the light by means of which the observer at m perceives the lightning flashes travels along the length a arrow m with the same velocity as along the length b arrow m but an examination of this supposition would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the means of measuring time it would thus appear as though we were moving here in a logical circle  after further consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful glance at me  and rightly so  and you declare  i maintain my previous definition nevertheless because in reality it assumes absolutely nothing about light there is only one demand to be made of the definition of simultaneity namely that in every real case it must supply us with an empirical decision as to whether or not the conception that has to be defined is fulfilled that my definition satisfies this demand is indisputable that light requires the same time to traverse the path a arrow m as for the path b arrow m is in reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis about the physical nature of light but a stipulation which i can make of my own freewill in order to arrive at a definition of simultaneity  it is clear that this definition can be used to give an exact meaning not only to two events but to as many events as we care to choose and independently of the positions of the scenes of the events with respect to the body of reference  here the railway embankment we are thus led also to a definition of  time  in physics for this purpose we suppose that clocks of identical construction are placed at the points a b and c of the railway line coordinate system and that they are set in such a manner that the positions of their pointers are simultaneously in the above sense the same under these conditions we understand by the  time  of an event the reading position of the hands of that one of these clocks which is in the immediate vicinity in space of the event in this manner a timevalue is associated with every event which is essentially capable of observation  this stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis the validity of which will hardly be doubted without empirical evidence to the contrary it has been assumed that all these clocks go at the same rate if they are of identical construction stated more exactly when two clocks arranged at rest in different places of a referencebody are set in such a manner that a particular position of the pointers of the one clock is simultaneous in the above sense with the same position of the pointers of the other clock then identical  settings  are always simultaneous in the sense of the above definition     notes   we suppose further that when three events a b and c occur in different places in such a manner that a is simultaneous with b and b is simultaneous with c simultaneous in the sense of the above definition then the criterion for the simultaneity of the pair of events a c is also satisfied this assumption is a physical hypothesis about the the of propagation of light it must certainly be fulfilled if we are to maintain the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo    the relativity of simulatneity   up to now our considerations have been referred to a particular body of reference which we have styled a  railway embankment we suppose a very long train travelling along the rails with the constant velocity v and in the direction indicated in fig 1 people travelling in this train will with a vantage view the train as a rigid referencebody coordinate system they regard all events in                         fig 01 file fig01gif   reference to the train then every event which takes place along the line also takes place at a particular point of the train also the definition of simultaneity can be given relative to the train in exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment as a natural consequence however the following question arises   are two events eg the two strokes of lightning a and b which are simultaneous with reference to the railway embankment also simultaneous relatively to the train we shall show directly that the answer must be in the negative  when we say that the lightning strokes a and b are simultaneous with respect to be embankment we mean the rays of light emitted at the places a and b where the lightning occurs meet each other at the midpoint m of the length a arrow b of the embankment but the events a and b also correspond to positions a and b on the train let m1 be the midpoint of the distance a arrow b on the travelling train just when the flashes as judged from the embankment of lightning occur this point m1 naturally coincides with the point m but it moves towards the right in the diagram with the velocity v of the train if an observer sitting in the position m1 in the train did not possess this velocity then he would remain permanently at m and the light rays emitted by the flashes of lightning a and b would reach him simultaneously ie they would meet just where he is situated now in reality considered with reference to the railway embankment he is hastening towards the beam of light coming from b whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of light coming from a hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from b earlier than he will see that emitted from a observers who take the railway train as their referencebody must therefore come to the conclusion that the lightning flash b took place earlier than the lightning flash a we thus arrive at the important result  events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not simultaneous with respect to the train and vice versa relativity of simultaneity every referencebody coordinate system has its own particular time  unless we are told the referencebody to which the statement of time refers there is no meaning in a statement of the time of an event  now before the advent of the theory of relativity it had always tacitly been assumed in physics that the statement of time had an absolute significance ie that it is independent of the state of motion of the body of reference but we have just seen that this assumption is incompatible with the most natural definition of simultaneity if we discard this assumption then the conflict between the law of the propagation of light in vacuo and the principle of relativity developed in section 7 disappears  we were led to that conflict by the considerations of section 6 which are now no longer tenable in that section we concluded that the man in the carriage who traverses the distance w per second relative to the carriage traverses the same distance also with respect to the embankment in each second of time but according to the foregoing considerations the time required by a particular occurrence with respect to the carriage must not be considered equal to the duration of the same occurrence as judged from the embankment as referencebody hence it cannot be contended that the man in walking travels the distance w relative to the railway line in a time which is equal to one second as judged from the embankment  moreover the considerations of section 6 are based on yet a second assumption which in the light of a strict consideration appears to be arbitrary although it was always tacitly made even before the introduction of the theory of relativity    on the relativity of the conception of distance   let us consider two particular points on the train  travelling along the embankment with the velocity v and inquire as to their distance apart we already know that it is necessary to have a body of reference for the measurement of a distance with respect to which body the distance can be measured up it is the simplest plan to use the train itself as referencebody coordinate system an observer in the train measures the interval by marking off his measuringrod in a straight line eg along the floor of the carriage as many times as is necessary to take him from the one marked point to the other then the number which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down is the required distance  it is a different matter when the distance has to be judged from the railway line here the following method suggests itself if we call a1 and b1 the two points on the train whose distance apart is required then both of these points are moving with the velocity v along the embankment in the first place we require to determine the points a and b of the embankment which are just being passed by the two points a1 and b1 at a particular time t  judged from the embankment these points a and b of the embankment can be determined by applying the definition of time given in section 8 the distance between these points a and b is then measured by repeated application of thee measuringrod along the embankment  a priori it is by no means certain that this last measurement will supply us with the same result as the first thus the length of the train as measured from the embankment may be different from that obtained by measuring in the train itself this circumstance leads us to a second objection which must be raised against the apparently obvious consideration of section 6 namely if the man in the carriage covers the distance w in a unit of time  measured from the train  then this distance  as measured from the embankment  is not necessarily also equal to w     notes   eg the middle of the first and of the hundredth carriage    the lorentz transformation   the results of the last three sections show that the apparent incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the principle of relativity section 7 has been derived by means of a consideration which borrowed two unjustifiable hypotheses from classical mechanics these are as follows  1 the timeinterval time between two events is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference  2 the spaceinterval distance between two points of a rigid body is independent of the condition of motion of the body of reference  if we drop these hypotheses then the dilemma of section 7 disappears because the theorem of the addition of velocities derived in section 6 becomes invalid the possibility presents itself that the law of the propagation of light in vacuo may be compatible with the principle of relativity and the question arises how have we to modify the considerations of section 6 in order to remove the apparent disagreement between these two fundamental results of experience this question leads to a general one in the discussion of section 6 we have to do with places and times relative both to the train and to the embankment how are we to find the place and time of an event in relation to the train when we know the place and time of the event with respect to the railway embankment  is there a thinkable answer to this question of such a nature that the law of transmission of light in vacuo does not contradict the principle of relativity  in other words  can we conceive of a relation between place and time of the individual events relative to both referencebodies such that every ray of light possesses the velocity of transmission c relative to the embankment and relative to the train  this question leads to a quite definite positive answer and to a perfectly definite transformation law for the spacetime magnitudes of an event when changing over from one body of reference to another  before we deal with this we shall introduce the following incidental consideration up to the present we have only considered events taking place along the embankment which had mathematically to assume the function of a straight line in the manner indicated in section 2 we can imagine this referencebody supplemented laterally and in a vertical direction by means of a framework of rods so that an event which takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this framework fig 2 similarly we can imagine the train travelling with the velocity v to be continued across the whole of space so that every event no matter how far off it may be could also be localised with respect to the second framework without committing any fundamental error we can disregard the fact that in reality these frameworks would continually interfere with each other owing to the impenetrability of solid bodies in every such framework we imagine three surfaces perpendicular to each other marked out and designated as  coordinate planes   coordinate system  a coordinate system k then corresponds to the embankment and a coordinate system k to the train an event wherever it may have taken place would be fixed in space with respect to k by the three perpendiculars x y z on the coordinate planes and with regard to time by a time value t relative to k1 the same event would be fixed in respect of space and time by corresponding values x1 y1 z1 t1 which of course are not identical with x y z t it has already been set forth in detail how these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical measurements  obviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following manner what are the values x1 y1 z1 t1 of an event with respect to k1 when the magnitudes x y z t of the same event with respect to k are given  the relations must be so chosen that the law of the transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied for one and the same ray of light and of course for every ray with respect to k and k1 for the relative orientation in space of the coordinate systems indicated in the diagram 7fig 2 this problem is solved by means of the equations                            eq 1 file eq01gif                                  y1  y                                 z1  z                           eq 2 file eq02gif  this system of equations is known as the  lorentz transformation   if in place of the law of transmission of light we had taken as our basis the tacit assumptions of the older mechanics as to the absolute character of times and lengths then instead of the above we should have obtained the following equations                               x1  x  vt                                 y1  y                                 z1  z                                 t1  t  this system of equations is often termed the  galilei transformation the galilei transformation can be obtained from the lorentz transformation by substituting an infinitely large value for the velocity of light c in the latter transformation  aided by the following illustration we can readily see that in accordance with the lorentz transformation the law of the transmission of light in vacuo is satisfied both for the referencebody k and for the referencebody k1 a lightsignal is sent along the positive xaxis and this lightstimulus advances in accordance with the equation                                 x  ct  ie with the velocity c according to the equations of the lorentz transformation this simple relation between x and t involves a relation between x1 and t1 in point of fact if we substitute for x the value ct in the first and fourth equations of the lorentz transformation we obtain                           eq 3 file eq03gif                            eq 4 file eq04gif  from which by division the expression                                 x1  ct1  immediately follows if referred to the system k1 the propagation of light takes place according to this equation we thus see that the velocity of transmission relative to the referencebody k1 is also equal to c the same result is obtained for rays of light advancing in any other direction whatsoever of cause this is not surprising since the equations of the lorentz transformation were derived conformably to this point of view     notes   a simple derivation of the lorentz transformation is given in appendix i    the behaviour of measuringrods and clocks in motion   place a metrerod in the x1axis of k1 in such a manner that one end the beginning coincides with the point x10 whilst the other end the end of the rod coincides with the point x1i what is the length of the metrerod relatively to the system k in order to learn this we need only ask where the beginning of the rod and the end of the rod lie with respect to k at a particular time t of the system k by means of the first equation of the lorentz transformation the values of these two points at the time t  0 can be shown to be                         eq 05a file eq05agif                          eq 05b file eq05bgif   the distance between the points being eq 06   but the metrerod is moving with the velocity v relative to k it therefore follows that the length of a rigid metrerod moving in the direction of its length with a velocity v is eq 06 of a metre  the rigid rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest and the more quickly it is moving the shorter is the rod for the velocity vc we should have eq 06a   and for stiii greater velocities the squareroot becomes imaginary from this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity c plays the part of a limiting velocity which can neither be reached nor exceeded by any real body  of course this feature of the velocity c as a limiting velocity also clearly follows from the equations of the lorentz transformation for these became meaningless if we choose values of v greater than c  if on the contrary we had considered a metrerod at rest in the xaxis with respect to k then we should have found that the length of the rod as judged from k1 would have been eq 06   this is quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which forms the basis of our considerations  a priori it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something about the physical behaviour of measuringrods and clocks from the equations of transformation for the magnitudes z y x t are nothing more nor less than the results of measurements obtainable by means of measuringrods and clocks if we had based our considerations on the galileian transformation we should not have obtained a contraction of the rod as a consequence of its motion  let us now consider a secondsclock which is permanently situated at the origin x10 of k1 t10 and t1i are two successive ticks of this clock the first and fourth equations of the lorentz transformation give for these two ticks                                   t  0  and                          eq 07 file eq07gif  as judged from k the clock is moving with the velocity v as judged from this referencebody the time which elapses between two strokes of the clock is not one second but                          eq 08 file eq08gif  seconds ie a somewhat larger time as a consequence of its motion the clock goes more slowly than when at rest here also the velocity c plays the part of an unattainable limiting velocity    theorem of the addition of velocities the experiment of fizeau   now in practice we can move clocks and measuringrods only with velocities that are small compared with the velocity of light hence we shall hardly be able to compare the results of the previous section directly with the reality but on the other hand these results must strike you as being very singular and for that reason i shall now draw another conclusion from the theory one which can easily be derived from the foregoing considerations and which has been most elegantly confirmed by experiment  in section 6 we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities in one direction in the form which also results from the hypotheses of classical mechanics this theorem can also be deduced readily horn the galilei transformation section 11 in place of the man walking inside the carriage we introduce a point moving relatively to the coordinate system k1 in accordance with the equation                                 x1  wt1  by means of the first and fourth equations of the galilei transformation we can express x1 and t1 in terms of x and t and we then obtain                               x  v  wt  this equation expresses nothing else than the law of motion of the point with reference to the system k of the man with reference to the embankment we denote this velocity by the symbol w and we then obtain as in section 6                             wvw         a  but we can carry out this consideration just as well on the basis of the theory of relativity in the equation                           x1  wt1         b  we must then express x1and t1 in terms of x and t making use of the first and fourth equations of the lorentz transformation instead of the equation a we then obtain the equation                          eq 09 file eq09gif   which corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocities in one direction according to the theory of relativity the question now arises as to which of these two theorems is the better in accord with experience on this point we axe enlightened by a most important experiment which the brilliant physicist fizeau performed more than half a century ago and which has been repeated since then by some of the best experimental physicists so that there can be no doubt about its result the experiment is concerned with the following question light travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity w how quickly does it travel in the direction of the arrow in the tube t see the accompanying diagram fig 3 when the liquid above mentioned is flowing through the tube with a velocity v   in accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly have to take for granted that the propagation of light always takes place with the same velocity w with respect to the liquid whether the latter is in motion with reference to other bodies or not the velocity of light relative to the liquid and the velocity of the latter relative to the tube are thus known and we require the velocity of light relative to the tube  it is clear that we have the problem of section 6 again before us the tube plays the part of the railway embankment or of the coordinate system k the liquid plays the part of the carriage or of the coordinate system k1 and finally the light plays the part of the                        figure 03 file fig03gif   man walking along the carriage or of the moving point in the present section if we denote the velocity of the light relative to the tube by w then this is given by the equation a or b according as the galilei transformation or the lorentz transformation corresponds to the facts experiment  decides in favour of equation b derived from the theory of relativity and the agreement is indeed very exact according to recent and most excellent measurements by zeeman the influence of the velocity of flow v on the propagation of light is represented by formula b to within one per cent  nevertheless we must now draw attention to the fact that a theory of this phenomenon was given by h a lorentz long before the statement of the theory of relativity this theory was of a purely electrodynamical nature and was obtained by the use of particular hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure of matter this circumstance however does not in the least diminish the conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test in favour of the theory of relativity for the electrodynamics of maxwelllorentz on which the original theory was based in no way opposes the theory of relativity rather has the latter been developed trom electrodynamics as an astoundingly simple combination and generalisation of the hypotheses formerly independent of each other on which electrodynamics was built     notes   fizeau found eq 10  where eq 11  is the index of refraction of the liquid on the other hand owing to the smallness of eq 12 as compared with i  we can replace b in the first place by eq 13  or to the same order of approximation by  eq 14  which agrees with fizeaus result    the heuristic value of the theory of relativity   our train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised in the following manner experience has led to the conviction that on the one hand the principle of relativity holds true and that on the other hand the velocity of transmission of light in vacuo has to be considered equal to a constant c by uniting these two postulates we obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular coordinates x y z and the time t of the events which constitute the processes of nature in this connection we did not obtain the galilei transformation but differing from classical mechanics the lorentz transformation  the law of transmission of light the acceptance of which is justified by our actual knowledge played an important part in this process of thought once in possession of the lorentz transformation however we can combine this with the principle of relativity and sum up the theory thus  every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is transformed into a law of exactly the same form when instead of the spacetime variables x y z t of the original coordinate system k we introduce new spacetime variables x1 y1 z1 t1 of a coordinate system k1 in this connection the relation between the ordinary and the accented magnitudes is given by the lorentz transformation or in brief  general laws of nature are covariant with respect to lorentz transformations  this is a definite mathematical condition that the theory of relativity demands of a natural law and in virtue of this the theory becomes a valuable heuristic aid in the search for general laws of nature if a general law of nature were to be found which did not satisfy this condition then at least one of the two fundamental assumptions of the theory would have been disproved let us now examine what general results the latter theory has hitherto evinced    general results of the theory   it is clear from our previous considerations that the special theory of relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics in these fields it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory but it has considerably simplified the theoretical structure ie the derivation of laws and  what is incomparably more important  it has considerably reduced the number of independent hypothese forming the basis of theory the special theory of relativity has rendered the maxwelllorentz theory so plausible that the latter would have been generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less unequivocally in its favour  classical mechanics required to be modified before it could come into line with the demands of the special theory of relativity for the main part however this modification affects only the laws for rapid motions in which the velocities of matter v are not very small as compared with the velocity of light we have experience of such rapid motions only in the case of electrons and ions for other motions the variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too small to make themselves evident in practice we shall not consider the motion of stars until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity in accordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a material point of mass m is no longer given by the wellknown expression                          eq 15 file eq15gif  but by the expression                          eq 16 file eq16gif   this expression approaches infinity as the velocity v approaches the velocity of light c the velocity must therefore always remain less than c however great may be the energies used to produce the acceleration if we develop the expression for the kinetic energy in the form of a series we obtain                          eq 17 file eq17gif   when eq 18 is small compared with unity the third of these terms is always small in comparison with the second  which last is alone considered in classical mechanics the first term mc2 does not contain the velocity and requires no consideration if we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a pointmass depends on the velocity we shall speak of its essential significance later  the most important result of a general character to which the special theory of relativity has led is concerned with the conception of mass before the advent of relativity physics recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance namely the law of the canservation of energy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental laws appeared to be quite independent of each other by means of the theory of relativity they have been united into one law we shall now briefly consider how this unification came about and what meaning is to be attached to it  the principle of relativity requires that the law of the concervation of energy should hold not only with reference to a coordinate system k but also with respect to every coordinate system k1 which is in a state of uniform motion of translation relative to k or briefly relative to every  galileian  system of coordinates in contrast to classical mechanics the lorentz transformation is the deciding factor in the transition from one such system to another  by means of comparatively simple considerations we are led to draw the following conclusion from these premises in conjunction with the fundamental equations of the electrodynamics of maxwell a body moving with the velocity v which absorbs  an amount of energy e0 in the form of radiation without suffering an alteration in velocity in the process has as a consequence its energy increased by an amount                          eq 19 file eq19gif  in consideration of the expression given above for the kinetic energy of the body the required energy of the body comes out to be                          eq 20 file eq20gif   thus the body has the same energy as a body of mass                           eq21 file eq21gif  moving with the velocity v hence we can say if a body takes up an amount of energy e0 then its inertial mass increases by an amount                          eq 22 file eq22gif   the inertial mass of a body is not a constant but varies according to the change in the energy of the body the inertial mass of a system of bodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy the law of the conservation of the mass of a system becomes identical with the law of the conservation of energy and is only valid provided that the system neither takes up nor sends out energy writing the expression for the energy in the form                          eq 23 file eq23gif  we see that the term mc2 which has hitherto attracted our attention is nothing else than the energy possessed by the body  before it absorbed the energy e0  a direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not possible at the present time 1920 see  note p 48 owing to the fact that the changes in energy e0 to which we can subject a system are not large enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the inertial mass of the system                                  eq 22 file eq22gif   is too small in comparison with the mass m which was present before the alteration of the energy it is owing to this circumstance that classical mechanics was able to establish successfully the conservation of mass as a law of independent validity  let me add a final remark of a fundamental nature the success of the faradaymaxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance resulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such things as instantaneous actions at a distance not involving an intermediary medium of the type of newtons law of gravitation according to the theory of relativity action at a distance with the velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a distance or of action at a distance with an infinite velocity of transmission this is connected with the fact that the velocity c plays a fundamental role in this theory in part ii we shall see in what way this result becomes modified in the general theory of relativity     notes   e0 is the energy taken up as judged from a coordinate system moving with the body   as judged from a coordinate system moving with the body  note the equation e  mc2 has been thoroughly proved time and again since this time    experience and the special theory of relativity   to what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by experience  this question is not easily answered for the reason already mentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of fizeau the special theory of relativity has crystallised out from the maxwelllorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomena thus all facts of experience which support the electromagnetic theory also support the theory of relativity as being of particular importance i mention here the fact that the theory of relativity enables us to predict the effects produced on the light reaching us from the fixed stars these results are obtained in an exceedingly simple manner and the effects indicated which are due to the relative motion of the earth with reference to those fixed stars are found to be in accord with experience we refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position of the fixed stars resulting from the motion of the earth round the sun aberration and to the influence of the radial components of the relative motions of the fixed stars with respect to the earth on the colour of the light reaching us from them the latter effect manifests itself in a slight displacement of the spectral lines of the light transmitted to us from a fixed star as compared with the position of the same spectral lines when they are produced by a terrestrial source of light doppler principle the experimental arguments in favour of the maxwelllorentz theory which are at the same time arguments in favour of the theory of relativity are too numerous to be set forth here in reality they limit the theoretical possibilities to such an extent that no other theory than that of maxwell and lorentz has been able to hold its own when tested by experience  but there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained which can be represented in the maxwelllorentz theory only by the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis which in itself  ie without making use of the theory of relativity  appears extraneous  it is known that cathode rays and the socalled brays emitted by radioactive substances consist of negatively electrified particles electrons of very small inertia and large velocity by examining the deflection of these rays under the influence of electric and magnetic fields we can study the law of motion of these particles very exactly  in the theoretical treatment of these electrons we are faced with the difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an account of their nature for since electrical masses of one sign repel each other the negative electrical masses constituting the electron would necessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual repulsions unless there are forces of another kind operating between them the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us   if we now assume that the relative distances between the electrical masses constituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of the electron rigid connection in the sense of classical mechanics we arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree with experience guided by purely formal points of view h a lorentz was the first to introduce the hypothesis that the form of the electron experiences a contraction in the direction of motion in consequence of that motion the contracted length being proportional to the expression                          eq 05 file eq05gif  this hypothesis which is not justifiable by any electrodynamical facts supplies us then with that particular law of motion which has been confirmed with great precision in recent years  the theory of relativity leads to the same law of motion without requiring any special hypothesis whatsoever as to the structure and the behaviour of the electron we arrived at a similar conclusion in section 13 in connection with the experiment of fizeau the result of which is foretold by the theory of relativity without the necessity of drawing on hypotheses as to the physical nature of the liquid  the second class of facts to which we have alluded has reference to the question whether or not the motion of the earth in space can be made perceptible in terrestrial experiments we have already remarked in section 5 that all attempts of this nature led to a negative result before the theory of relativity was put forward it was difficult to become reconciled to this negative result for reasons now to be discussed the inherited prejudices about time and space did not allow any doubt to arise as to the prime importance of the galileian transformation for changing over from one body of reference to another now assuming that the maxwelllorentz equations hold for a referencebody k we then find that they do not hold for a referencebody k1 moving uniformly with respect to k if we assume that the relations of the galileian transformstion exist between the coordinates of k and k1 it thus appears that of all galileian coordinate systems one k corresponding to a particular state of motion is physically unique this result was interpreted physically by regarding k as at rest with respect to a hypothetical æther of space on the other hand all coordinate systems k1 moving relatively to k were to be regarded as in motion with respect to the æther to this motion of k1 against the æther ætherdrift  relative to k1 were attributed the more complicated laws which were supposed to hold relative to k1 strictly speaking such an ætherdrift ought also to be assumed relative to the earth and for a long time the efforts of physicists were devoted to attempts to detect the existence of an ætherdrift at the earths surface  in one of the most notable of these attempts michelson devised a method which appears as though it must be decisive imagine two mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reflecting surfaces face each other a ray of light requires a perfectly definite time t to pass from one mirror to the other and back again if the whole system be at rest with respect to the æther it is found by calculation however that a slightly different time t1 is required for this process if the body together with the mirrors be moving relatively to the æther and yet another point it is shown by calculation that for a given velocity v with reference to the æther this time t1 is different when the body is moving perpendicularly to the planes of the mirrors from that resulting when the motion is parallel to these planes although the estimated difference between these two times is exceedingly small michelson and morley performed an experiment involving interference in which this difference should have been clearly detectable but the experiment gave a negative result  a fact very perplexing to physicists lorentz and fitzgerald rescued the theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body relative to the æther produces a contraction of the body in the direction of motion the amount of contraction being just sufficient to compensate for the differeace in time mentioned above comparison with the discussion in section 11 shows that also from the standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty was the right one but on the basis of the theory of relativity the method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory according to this theory there is no such thing as a  specially favoured  unique coordinate system to occasion the introduction of the ætheridea and hence there can be no ætherdrift nor any experiment with which to demonstrate it here the contraction of moving bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory without the introduction of particular hypotheses  and as the prime factor involved in this contraction we find not the motion in itself to which we cannot attach any meaning but the motion with respect to the body of reference chosen in the particular case in point thus for a coordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of michelson and morley is not shortened but it is shortened for a coordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun     notes   the general theory of relativity renders it likely that the electrical masses of an electron are held together by gravitational forces    minkowskis fourdimensional space   the nonmathematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering when he hears of fourdimensional things by a feeling not unlike that awakened by thoughts of the occult and yet there is no more commonplace statement than that the world in which we live is a fourdimensional spacetime continuum  space is a threedimensional continuum by this we mean that it is possible to describe the position of a point at rest by means of three numbers coordinales x y z and that there is an indefinite number of points in the neighbourhood of this one the position of which can be described by coordinates such as x1 y1 z1 which may be as near as we choose to the respective values of the coordinates x y z of the first point in virtue of the latter property we speak of a  continuum and owing to the fact that there are three coordinates we speak of it as being  threedimensional  similarly the world of physical phenomena which was briefly called  world  by minkowski is naturally four dimensional in the spacetime sense for it is composed of individual events each of which is described by four numbers namely three space coordinates x y z and a time coordinate the time value t the world is in this sense also a continuum for to every event there are as many neighbouring events realised or at least thinkable as we care to choose the coordinates x1 y1 z1 t1 of which differ by an indefinitely small amount from those of the event x y z t originally considered that we have not been accustomed to regard the world in this sense as a fourdimensional continuum is due to the fact that in physics before the advent of the theory of relativity time played a different and more independent role as compared with the space coordinates it is for this reason that we have been in the habit of treating time as an independent continuum as a matter of fact according to classical mechanics time is absolute ie it is independent of the position and the condition of motion of the system of coordinates we see this expressed in the last equation of the galileian transformation t1  t  the fourdimensional mode of consideration of the world is natural on the theory of relativity since according to this theory time is robbed of its independence this is shown by the fourth equation of the lorentz transformation                          eq 24 file eq24gif   moreover according to this equation the time difference dt1 of two events with respect to k1 does not in general vanish even when the time difference dt1 of the same events with reference to k vanishes pure  spacedistance  of two events with respect to k results in  timedistance  of the same events with respect to k but the discovery of minkowski which was of importance for the formal development of the theory of relativity does not lie here it is to be found rather in the fact of his recognition that the fourdimensional spacetime continuum of the theory of relativity in its most essential formal properties shows a pronounced relationship to the threedimensional continuum of euclidean geometrical space  in order to give due prominence to this relationship however we must replace the usual time coordinate t by an imaginary magnitude eq 25 proportional to it under these conditions the natural laws satisfying the demands of the special theory of relativity assume mathematical forms in which the time coordinate plays exactly the same role as the three space coordinates formally these four coordinates correspond exactly to the three space coordinates in euclidean geometry it must be clear even to the nonmathematician that as a consequence of this purely formal addition to our knowledge the theory perforce gained clearness in no mean measure  these inadequate remarks can give the reader only a vague notion of the important idea contributed by minkowski without it the general theory of relativity of which the fundamental ideas are developed in the following pages would perhaps have got no farther than its long clothes minkowskis work is doubtless difficult of access to anyone inexperienced in mathematics but since it is not necessary to have a very exact grasp of this work in order to understand the fundamental ideas of either the special or the general theory of relativity i shall leave it here at present and revert to it only towards the end of part 2     notes   cf the somewhat more detailed discussion in appendix ii     part ii  the general theory of relativity   special and general principle of relativity   the basal principle which was the pivot of all our previous considerations was the special principle of relativity ie the principle of the physical relativity of all uniform motion let as once more analyse its meaning carefully  it was at all times clear that from the point of view of the idea it conveys to us every motion must be considered only as a relative motion returning to the illustration we have frequently used of the embankment and the railway carriage we can express the fact of the motion here taking place in the following two forms both of which are equally justifiable   a the carriage is in motion relative to the embankment b the embankment is in motion relative to the carriage  in a the embankment in b the carriage serves as the body of reference in our statement of the motion taking place if it is simply a question of detecting or of describing the motion involved it is in principle immaterial to what referencebody we refer the motion as already mentioned this is selfevident but it must not be confused with the much more comprehensive statement called the principle of relativity which we have taken as the basis of our investigations  the principle we have made use of not only maintains that we may equally well choose the carriage or the embankment as our referencebody for the description of any event for this too is selfevident our principle rather asserts what follows  if we formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained from experience by making use of  a the embankment as referencebody b the railway carriage as referencebody  then these general laws of nature eg the laws of mechanics or the law of the propagation of light in vacuo have exactly the same form in both cases this can also be expressed as follows  for the physical description of natural processes neither of the reference bodies k k1 is unique lit  specially marked out  as compared with the other unlike the first this latter statement need not of necessity hold a priori it is not contained in the conceptions of  motion and  referencebody  and derivable from them only experience can decide as to its correctness or incorrectness  up to the present however we have by no means maintained the equivalence of all bodies of reference k in connection with the formulation of natural laws our course was more on the following iines in the first place we started out from the assumption that there exists a referencebody k whose condition of motion is such that the galileian law holds with respect to it  a particle left to itself and sufficiently far removed from all other particles moves uniformly in a straight line with reference to k galileian referencebody the laws of nature were to be as simple as possible but in addition to k all bodies of reference k1 should be given preference in this sense and they should be exactly equivalent to k for the formulation of natural laws provided that they are in a state of uniform rectilinear and nonrotary motion with respect to k  all these bodies of reference are to be regarded as galileian referencebodies the validity of the principle of relativity was assumed only for these referencebodies but not for others eg those possessing motion of a different kind in this sense we speak of the special principle of relativity or special theory of relativity  in contrast to this we wish to understand by the general principle of relativity the following statement  all bodies of reference k k1 etc are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena formulation of the general laws of nature whatever may be their state of motion but before proceeding farther it ought to be pointed out that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract one for reasons which will become evident at a later stage  since the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been justified every intellect which strives after generalisation must feel the temptation to venture the step towards the general principle of relativity but a simple and apparently quite reliable consideration seems to suggest that for the present at any rate there is little hope of success in such an attempt let us imagine ourselves transferred to our old friend the railway carriage which is travelling at a uniform rate as long as it is moving unifromly the occupant of the carriage is not sensible of its motion and it is for this reason that he can without reluctance interpret the facts of the case as indicating that the carriage is at rest but the embankment in motion moreover according to the special principle of relativity this interpretation is quite justified also from a physical point of view  if the motion of the carriage is now changed into a nonuniform motion as for instance by a powerful application of the brakes then the occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful jerk forwards the retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical behaviour of bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage the mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously considered and for this reason it would appear to be impossible that the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the nonuniformly moving carriage as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in uniform motion at all events it is clear that the galileian law does not hold with respect to the nonuniformly moving carriage because of this we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of absolute physical reality to nonuniform motion in opposition to the general principle of relatvity but in what follows we shall soon see that this conclusion cannot be maintained    the gravitational field   if we pick up a stone and then let it go why does it fall to the ground  the usual answer to this question is because it is attracted by the earth modern physics formulates the answer rather differently for the following reason as a result of the more careful study of electromagnetic phenomena we have come to regard action at a distance as a process impossible without the intervention of some intermediary medium if for instance a magnet attracts a piece of iron we cannot be content to regard this as meaning that the magnet acts directly on the iron through the intermediate empty space but we are constrained to imagine  after the manner of faraday  that the magnet always calls into being something physically real in the space around it that something being what we call a magnetic field in its turn this magnetic field operates on the piece of iron so that the latter strives to move towards the magnet we shall not discuss here the justification for this incidental conception which is indeed a somewhat arbitrary one we shall only mention that with its aid electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented much more satisfactorily than without it and this applies particularly to the transmission of electromagnetic waves the effects of gravitation also are regarded in an analogous manner  the action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly the earth produces in its surrounding a gravitational field which acts on the stone and produces its motion of fall as we know from experience the intensity of the action on a body dimishes according to a quite definite law as we proceed farther and farther away from the earth from our point of view this means  the law governing the properties of the gravitational field in space must be a perfectly definite one in order correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action with the distance from operative bodies it is something like this the body eg the earth produces a field in its immediate neighbourhood directly the intensity and direction of the field at points farther removed from the body are thence determined by the law which governs the properties in space of the gravitational fields themselves  in contrast to electric and magnetic fields the gravitational field exhibits a most remarkable property which is of fundamental importance for what follows bodies which are moving under the sole influence of a gravitational field receive an acceleration which does not in the least depend either on the material or on the physical state of the body for instance a piece of lead and a piece of wood fall in exactly the same manner in a gravitational field in vacuo when they start off from rest or with the same initial velocity this law which holds most accurately can be expressed in a different form in the light of the following consideration  according to newtons law of motion we have  force  inertial mass x acceleration  where the inertial mass is a characteristic constant of the accelerated body if now gravitation is the cause of the acceleration we then have  force  gravitational mass x intensity of the gravitational field  where the gravitational mass is likewise a characteristic constant for the body from these two relations follows                                  eq 26 file eq26gif   if now as we find from experience the acceleration is to be independent of the nature and the condition of the body and always the same for a given gravitational field then the ratio of the gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all bodies by a suitable choice of units we can thus make this ratio equal to unity we then have the following law the gravitational mass of a body is equal to its inertial law  it is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in mechanics but it had not been interpreted a satisfactory interpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the following fact  the same quality of a body manifests itself according to circumstances as  inertia  or as  weight  lit  heaviness  in the following section we shall show to what extent this is actually the case and how this question is connected with the general postulate of relativity     the equality of inertial and gravitational mass as an argument for the general postule of relativity   we imagine a large portion of empty space so far removed from stars and other appreciable masses that we have before us approximately the conditions required by the fundamental law of galilei it is then possible to choose a galileian referencebody for this part of space world relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in motion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion as referencebody let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus gravitation naturally does not exist for this observer he must fasten himself with strings to the floor otherwise the slightest impact against the floor will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room  to the middle of the lid of the chest is fixed externally a hook with rope attached and now a  being  what kind of a being is immaterial to us begins pulling at this with a constant force the chest together with the observer then begin to move upwards with a uniformly accelerated motion in course of time their velocity will reach unheardof values  provided that we are viewing all this from another referencebody which is not being pulled with a rope  but how does the man in the chest regard the process  the acceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction of the floor of the chest he must therefore take up this pressure by means of his legs if he does not wish to be laid out full length on the floor he is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a room of a home on our earth if he releases a body which he previously had in his land the accelertion of the chest will no longer be transmitted to this body and for this reason the body will approach the floor of the chest with an accelerated relative motion the observer will further convince himself that the acceleration of the body towards the floor of the chest is always of the same magnitude whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the experiment  relying on his knowledge of the gravitational field as it was discussed in the preceding section the man in the chest will thus come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational field which is constant with regard to time of course he will be puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this gravitational field just then however he discovers the hook in the middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it and he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is suspended at rest in the gravitational field  ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion  i do not believe we ought to if we wish to remain consistent  we must rather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither reason nor known mechanical laws even though it is being accelerated with respect to the galileian space first considered we can nevertheless regard the chest as being at rest we have thus good grounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of reference which are accelerated with respect to each other and as a result we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity  we must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of interpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational field of giving all bodies the same acceleration or what comes to the same thing on the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass if this natural law did not exist the man in the accelerated chest would not be able to interpret the behaviour of the bodies around him on the supposition of a gravitational field and he would not be justified on the grounds of experience in supposing his referencebody to be  at rest  suppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of the lid and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope the result of this will be to strech the rope so that it will hang  vertically  downwards if we ask for an opinion of the cause of tension in the rope the man in the chest will say the suspended body experiences a downward force in the gravitational field and this is neutralised by the tension of the rope  what determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the gravitational mass of the suspended body on the other hand an observer who is poised freely in space will interpret the condition of things thus   the rope must perforce take part in the accelerated motion of the chest and it transmits this motion to the body attached to it the tension of the rope is just large enough to effect the acceleration of the body that which determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the inertial mass of the body guided by this example we see that our extension of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass thus we have obtained a physical interpretation of this law  from our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a general theory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of gravitation in point of fact the systematic pursuit of the general idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the gravitational field before proceeding farther however i must warn the reader against a misconception suggested by these considerations a gravitational field exists for the man in the chest despite the fact that there was no such field for the coordinate system first chosen now we might easily suppose that the existence of a gravitational field is always only an apparent one we might also think that regardless of the kind of gravitational field which may be present we could always choose another referencebody such that no gravitational field exists with reference to it this is by no means true for all gravitational fields but only for those of quite special form it is for instance impossible to choose a body of reference such that as judged from it the gravitational field of the earth in its entirety vanishes  we can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing which we brought forward against the general principle of relativity at theend of section 18 it is certainly true that the observer in the railway carriage experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the application of the brake and that he recognises in this the nonuniformity of motion retardation of the carriage but he is compelled by nobody to refer this jerk to a  real  acceleration retardation of the carriage he might also interpret his experience thus  my body of reference the carriage remains permanently at rest with reference to it however there exists during the period of application of the brakes a gravitational field which is directed forwards and which is variable with respect to time under the influence of this field the embankment together with the earth moves nonuniformly in such a manner that their original velocity in the backwards direction is continuously reduced    in what respects are the foundations of classical mechanics and of the special theory of relativity unsatisfactory   we have already stated several times that classical mechanics starts out from the following law material particles sufficiently far removed from other material particles continue to move uniformly in a straight line or continue in a state of rest we have also repeatedly emphasised that this fundamental law can only be valid for bodies of reference k which possess certain unique states of motion and which are in uniform translational motion relative to each other relative to other referencebodies k the law is not valid both in classical mechanics and in the special theory of relativity we therefore differentiate between referencebodies k relative to which the recognised  laws of nature  can be said to hold and referencebodies k relative to which these laws do not hold  but no person whose mode of thought is logical can rest satisfied with this condition of things he asks   how does it come that certain referencebodies or their states of motion are given priority over other referencebodies or their states of motion  what is the reason for this preference in order to show clearly what i mean by this question i shall make use of a comparison  i am standing in front of a gas range standing alongside of each other on the range are two pans so much alike that one may be mistaken for the other both are half full of water i notice that steam is being emitted continuously from the one pan but not from the other i am surprised at this even if i have never seen either a gas range or a pan before but if i now notice a luminous something of bluish colour under the first pan but not under the other i cease to be astonished even if i have never before seen a gas flame for i can only say that this bluish something will cause the emission of the steam or at least possibly it may do so if however i notice the bluish something in neither case and if i observe that the one continuously emits steam whilst the other does not then i shall remain astonished and dissatisfied until i have discovered some circumstance to which i can attribute the different behaviour of the two pans  analogously i seek in vain for a real something in classical mechanics or in the special theory of relativity to which i can attribute the different behaviour of bodies considered with respect to the reference systems k and k1  newton saw this objection and attempted to invalidate it but without success but e mach recognsed it most clearly of all and because of this objection he claimed that mechanics must be placed on a new basis it can only be got rid of by means of a physics which is conformable to the general principle of relativity since the equations of such a theory hold for every body of reference whatever may be its state of motion     notes   the objection is of importance more especially when the state of motion of the referencebody is of such a nature that it does not require any external agency for its maintenance eg in the case when the referencebody is rotating uniformly    a few inferences from the general principle of relativity   the considerations of section 20 show that the general principle of relativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the gravitational field in a purely theoretical manner let us suppose for instance that we know the spacetime  course  for any natural process whatsoever as regards the manner in which it takes place in the galileian domain relative to a galileian body of reference k by means of purely theoretical operations ie simply by calculation we are then able to find how this known natural process appears as seen from a referencebody k1 which is accelerated relatively to k but since a gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of reference k1 our consideration also teaches us how the gravitational field influences the process studied  for example we learn that a body which is in a state of uniform rectilinear motion with respect to k in accordance with the law of galilei is executing an accelerated and in general curvilinear motion with respect to the accelerated referencebody k1 chest this acceleration or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving body of the gravitational field prevailing relatively to k it is known that a gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in this way so that our consideration supplies us with nothing essentially new  however we obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we carry out the analogous consideration for a ray of light with respect to the galileian referencebody k such a ray of light is transmitted rectilinearly with the velocity c it can easily be shown that the path of the same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we consider it with reference to the accelerated chest referencebody k1 from this we conclude that in general rays of light are propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields in two respects this result is of great importance  in the first place it can be compared with the reality although a detailed examination of the question shows that the curvature of light rays required by the general theory of relativity is only exceedingly small for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice its estimated magnitude for light rays passing the sun at grazing incidence is nevertheless 17 seconds of arc this ought to manifest itself in the following way as seen from the earth certain fixed stars appear to be in the neighbourhood of the sun and are thus capable of observation during a total eclipse of the sun at such times these stars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the sun by an amount indicated above as compared with their apparent position in the sky when the sun is situated at another part of the heavens the examination of the correctness or otherwise of this deduction is a problem of the greatest importance the early solution of which is to be expected of astronomers2  in the second place our result shows that according to the general theory of relativity the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in the special theory of relativity and to which we have already frequently referred cannot claim any unlimited validity a curvature of rays of light can only take place when the velocity of propagation of light varies with position now we might think that as a consequence of this the special theory of relativity and with it the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the dust but in reality this is not the case we can only conclude that the special theory of relativity cannot claim an unlinlited domain of validity  its results hold only so long as we are able to disregard the influences of gravitational fields on the phenomena eg of light  since it has often been contended by opponents of the theory of relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the general theory of relativity it is perhaps advisable to make the facts of the case clearer by means of an appropriate comparison before the development of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics were looked upon as the laws of electricity at the present time we know that electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic considerations only for the case which is never strictly realised in which the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to each other and to the coordinate system should we be justified in saying that for this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the fieldequations of maxwell in electrodynamics  not in the least electrostatics is contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case  the laws of the latter lead directly to those of the former for the case in which the fields are invariable with regard to time no fairer destiny could be allotted to any physical theory than that it should of itself point out the way to the introduction of a more comprehensive theory in which it lives on as a limiting case  in the example of the transmission of light just dealt with we have seen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive theoretically the influence of a gravitational field on the course of natural processes the iaws of which are already known when a gravitational field is absent but the most attractive problem to the solution of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key concerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational field itself let us consider this for a moment  we are acquainted with spacetime domains which behave approximately in a  galileian  fashion under suitable choice of referencebody ie domains in which gravitational fields are absent if we now refer such a domain to a referencebody k1 possessing any kind of motion then relative to k1 there exists a gravitational field which is variable with respect to space and time3  the character of this field will of course depend on the motion chosen for k1 according to the general theory of relativity the general law of the gravitational field must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in this way even though by no means all gravitationial fields can be produced in this way yet we may entertain the hope that the general law of gravitation will be derivable from such gravitational fields of a special kind this hope has been realised in the most beautiful manner but between the clear vision of this goal and its actual realisation it was necessary to surmount a serious difficulty and as this lies deep at the root of things i dare not withhold it from the reader we require to extend our ideas of the spacetime continuum still farther     notes   by means of the star photographs of two expeditions equipped by a joint committee of the royal and royal astronomical societies the existence of the deflection of light demanded by theory was first confirmed during the solar eclipse of 29th may 1919 cf appendix iii   this follows from a generalisation of the discussion in section 20    behaviour of clocks and measuringrods on a rotating body of reference   hitherto i have purposely refrained from speaking about the physical interpretation of space and timedata in the case of the general theory of relativity as a consequence i am guilty of a certain slovenliness of treatment which as we know from the special theory of relativity is far from being unimportant and pardonable it is now high time that we remedy this defect but i would mention at the outset that this matter lays no small claims on the patience and on the power of abstraction of the reader  we start off again from quite special cases which we have frequently used before let us consider a space time domain in which no gravitational field exists relative to a referencebody k whose state of motion has been suitably chosen k is then a galileian referencebody as regards the domain considered and the results of the special theory of relativity hold relative to k let us supposse the same domain referred to a second body of reference k1 which is rotating uniformly with respect to k in order to fix our ideas we shall imagine k1 to be in the form of a plane circular disc which rotates uniformly in its own plane about its centre an observer who is sitting eccentrically on the disc k1 is sensible of a force which acts outwards in a radial direction and which would be interpreted as an effect of inertia centrifugal force by an observer who was at rest with respect to the original referencebody k but the observer on the disc may regard his disc as a referencebody which is  at rest   on the basis of the general principle of relativity he is justified in doing this the force acting on himself and in fact on all other bodies which are at rest relative to the disc he regards as the effect of a gravitational field nevertheless the spacedistribution of this gravitational field is of a kind that would not be possible on newtons theory of gravitation but since the observer believes in the general theory of relativity this does not disturb him he is quite in the right when he believes that a general law of gravitation can be formulated a law which not only explains the motion of the stars correctly but also the field of force experienced by himself  the observer performs experiments on his circular disc with clocks and measuringrods in doing so it is his intention to arrive at exact definitions for the signification of time and spacedata with reference to the circular disc k1 these definitions being based on his observations what will be his experience in this enterprise   to start with he places one of two identically constructed clocks at the centre of the circular disc and the other on the edge of the disc so that they are at rest relative to it we now ask ourselves whether both clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the nonrotating galileian referencebody k as judged from this body the clock at the centre of the disc has no velocity whereas the clock at the edge of the disc is in motion relative to k in consequence of the rotation according to a result obtained in section 12 it follows that the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of the clock at the centre of the circular disc ie as observed from k it is obvious that the same effect would be noted by an observer whom we will imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the circular disc thus on our circular disc or to make the case more general in every gravitational field a clock will go more quickly or less quickly according to the position in which the clock is situated at rest for this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable definition of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest with respect to the body of reference a similar difficulty presents itself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity in such a case but i do not wish to go any farther into this question  moreover at this stage the definition of the space coordinates also presents insurmountable difficulties if the observer applies his standard measuringrod a rod which is short as compared with the radius of the disc tangentially to the edge of the disc then as judged from the galileian system the length of this rod will be less than i since according to section 12 moving bodies suffer a shortening in the direction of the motion on the other hand the measaringrod will not experience a shortening in length as judged from k if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the radius if then the observer first measures the circumference of the disc with his measuringrod and then the diameter of the disc on dividing the one by the other he will not obtain as quotient the familiar number p  314    but a larger number4 whereas of course for a disc which is at rest with respect to k this operation would yield p exactly this proves that the propositions of euclidean geometry cannot hold exactly on the rotating disc nor in general in a gravitational field at least if we attribute the length i to the rod in all positions and in every orientation hence the idea of a straight line also loses its meaning we are therefore not in a position to define exactly the coordinates x y z relative to the disc by means of the method used in discussing the special theory and as long as the co ordinates and times of events have not been defined we cannot assign an exact meaning to the natural laws in which these occur  thus all our previous conclusions based on general relativity would appear to be called in question in reality we must make a subtle detour in order to be able to apply the postulate of general relativity exactly i shall prepare the reader for this in the following paragraphs     notes   the field disappears at the centre of the disc and increases proportionally to the distance from the centre as we proceed outwards   throughout this consideration we have to use the galileian nonrotating system k as referencebody since we may only assume the validity of the results of the special theory of relativity relative to k relative to k1 a gravitational field prevails    euclidean and noneuclidean continuum   the surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me i can get from any one point on this table to any other point by passing continuously from one point to a  neighbouring  one and repeating this process a large number of times or in other words by going from point to point without executing jumps i am sure the reader will appreciate with sufficient clearness what i mean here by  neighbouring  and by  jumps  if he is not too pedantic we express this property of the surface by describing the latter as a continuum  let us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal length have been made their lengths being small compared with the dimensions of the marble slab when i say they are of equal length i mean that one can be laid on any other without the ends overlapping we next lay four of these little rods on the marble slab so that they constitute a quadrilateral figure a square the diagonals of which are equally long to ensure the equality of the diagonals we make use of a little testingrod to this square we add similar ones each of which has one rod in common with the first we proceed in like manner with each of these squares until finally the whole marble slab is laid out with squares the arrangement is such that each side of a square belongs to two squares and each corner to four squares  it is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business without getting into the greatest difficulties we only need to think of the following if at any moment three squares meet at a corner then two sides of the fourth square are already laid and as a consequence the arrangement of the remaining two sides of the square is already completely determined but i am now no longer able to adjust the quadrilateral so that its diagonals may be equal if they are equal of their own accord then this is an especial favour of the marble slab and of the little rods about which i can only be thankfully surprised we must experience many such surprises if the construction is to be successful  if everything has really gone smoothly then i say that the points of the marble slab constitute a euclidean continuum with respect to the little rod which has been used as a  distance  lineinterval by choosing one corner of a square as  origin i can characterise every other corner of a square with reference to this origin by means of two numbers i only need state how many rods i must pass over when starting from the origin i proceed towards the  right  and then  upwards in order to arrive at the corner of the square under consideration these two numbers are then the  cartesian coordinates  of this corner with reference to the  cartesian coordinate system which is determined by the arrangement of little rods  by making use of the following modification of this abstract experiment we recognise that there must also be cases in which the experiment would be unsuccessful we shall suppose that the rods  expand  by in amount proportional to the increase of temperature we heat the central part of the marble slab but not the periphery in which case two of our little rods can still be brought into coincidence at every position on the table but our construction of squares must necessarily come into disorder during the heating because the little rods on the central region of the table expand whereas those on the outer part do not  with reference to our little rods  defined as unit lengths  the marble slab is no longer a euclidean continuum and we are also no longer in the position of defining cartesian coordinates directly with their aid since the above construction can no longer be carried out but since there are other things which are not influenced in a similar manner to the little rods or perhaps not at all by the temperature of the table it is possible quite naturally to maintain the point of view that the marble slab is a  euclidean continuum this can be done in a satisfactory manner by making a more subtle stipulation about the measurement or the comparison of lengths  but if rods of every kind ie of every material were to behave in the same way as regards the influence of temperature when they are on the variably heated marble slab and if we had no other means of detecting the effect of temperature than the geometrical behaviour of our rods in experiments analogous to the one described above then our best plan would be to assign the distance one to two points on the slab provided that the ends of one of our rods could be made to coincide with these two points  for how else should we define the distance without our proceeding being in the highest measure grossly arbitrary  the method of cartesian coordinates must then be discarded and replaced by another which does not assume the validity of euclidean geometry for rigid bodies  the reader will notice that the situation depicted here corresponds to the one brought about by the general postitlate of relativity section 23     notes   mathematicians have been confronted with our problem in the following form if we are given a surface eg an ellipsoid in euclidean threedimensional space then there exists for this surface a twodimensional geometry just as much as for a plane surface gauss undertook the task of treating this twodimensional geometry from first principles without making use of the fact that the surface belongs to a euclidean continuum of three dimensions if we imagine constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface similar to that above with the marble slab we should find that different laws hold for these from those resulting on the basis of euclidean plane geometry the surface is not a euclidean continuum with respect to the rods and we cannot define cartesian coordinates in the surface gauss indicated the principles according to which we can treat the geometrical relationships in the surface and thus pointed out the way to the method of riemman of treating multidimensional noneuclidean continuum thus it is that mathematicians long ago solved the formal problems to which we are led by the general postulate of relativity    gaussian coordinates   according to gauss this combined analytical and geometrical mode of handling the problem can be arrived at in the following way we imagine a system of arbitrary curves see fig 4 drawn on the surface of the table these we designate as ucurves and we indicate each of them by means of a number the curves u 1 u 2 and u 3 are drawn in the diagram between the curves u 1 and u 2 we must imagine an infinitely large number to be drawn all of which correspond to real numbers lying between 1 and 2 fig 04 we have then a system of ucurves and this infinitely dense system covers the whole surface of the table these ucurves must not intersect each other and through each point of the surface one and only one curve must pass thus a perfectly definite value of u belongs to every point on the surface of the marble slab in like manner we imagine a system of vcurves drawn on the surface these satisfy the same conditions as the ucurves they are provided with numbers in a corresponding manner and they may likewise be of arbitrary shape it follows that a value of u and a value of v belong to every point on the surface of the table we call these two numbers the coordinates of the surface of the table gaussian coordinates for example the point p in the diagram has the gaussian coordinates u 3 v 1 two neighbouring points p and p1 on the surface then correspond to the coordinates                         p       uv                         p1     u  du v  dv  where du and dv signify very small numbers in a similar manner we may indicate the distance lineinterval between p and p1 as measured with a little rod by means of the very small number ds then according to gauss we have                  ds2  g11du2  2g12dudv  g22dv2  where g11 g12 g22 are magnitudes which depend in a perfectly definite way on u and v the magnitudes g11 g12 and g22 determine the behaviour of the rods relative to the ucurves and vcurves and thus also relative to the surface of the table for the case in which the points of the surface considered form a euclidean continuum with reference to the measuringrods but only in this case it is possible to draw the ucurves and vcurves and to attach numbers to them in such a manner that we simply have                              ds2  du2  dv2  under these conditions the ucurves and vcurves are straight lines in the sense of euclidean geometry and they are perpendicular to each other here the gaussian coordinates are samply cartesian ones it is clear that gauss coordinates are nothing more than an association of two sets of numbers with the points of the surface considered of such a nature that numerical values differing very slightly from each other are associated with neighbouring points  in space  so far these considerations hold for a continuum of two dimensions but the gaussian method can be applied also to a continuum of three four or more dimensions if for instance a continuum of four dimensions be supposed available we may represent it in the following way with every point of the continuum we associate arbitrarily four numbers x1 x2 x3 x4 which are known as  coordinates adjacent points correspond to adjacent values of the coordinates if a distance ds is associated with the adjacent points p and p1 this distance being measurable and well defined from a physical point of view then the following formula holds  ds2  g11dx12  2g12dx1dx2     g44dx42  where the magnitudes g11 etc have values which vary with the position in the continuum only when the continuum is a euclidean one is it possible to associate the coordinates x1   x4 with the points of the continuum so that we have simply  ds2  dx12  dx22  dx32  dx42  in this case relations hold in the fourdimensional continuum which are analogous to those holding in our threedimensional measurements  however the gauss treatment for ds2 which we have given above is not always possible it is only possible when sufficiently small regions of the continuum under consideration may be regarded as euclidean continua for example this obviously holds in the case of the marble slab of the table and local variation of temperature the temperature is practically constant for a small part of the slab and thus the geometrical behaviour of the rods is almost as it ought to be according to the rules of euclidean geometry hence the imperfections of the construction of squares in the previous section do not show themselves clearly until this construction is extended over a considerable portion of the surface of the table  we can sum this up as follows gauss invented a method for the mathematical treatment of continua in general in which  sizerelations   distances  between neighbouring points are defined to every point of a continuum are assigned as many numbers gaussian coordinates as the continuum has dimensions this is done in such a way that only one meaning can be attached to the assignment and that numbers gaussian coordinates which differ by an indefinitely small amount are assigned to adjacent points the gaussian coordinate system is a logical generalisation of the cartesian coordinate system it is also applicable to noneuclidean continua but only when with respect to the defined size or distance small parts of the continuum under consideration behave more nearly like a euclidean system the smaller the part of the continuum under our notice    the spacetime continuum of the speical theory of relativity considered as a euclidean continuum   we are now in a position to formulate more exactly the idea of minkowski which was only vaguely indicated in section 17 in accordance with the special theory of relativity certain coordinate systems are given preference for the description of the fourdimensional spacetime continuum we called these  galileian coordinate systems for these systems the four coordinates x y z t which determine an event or  in other words a point of the fourdimensional continuum  are defined physically in a simple manner as set forth in detail in the first part of this book for the transition from one galileian system to another which is moving uniformly with reference to the first the equations of the lorentz transformation are valid these last form the basis for the derivation of deductions from the special theory of relativity and in themselves they are nothing more than the expression of the universal validity of the law of transmission of light for all galileian systems of reference  minkowski found that the lorentz transformations satisfy the following simple conditions let us consider two neighbouring events the relative position of which in the fourdimensional continuum is given with respect to a galileian referencebody k by the space coordinate differences dx dy dz and the timedifference dt with reference to a second galileian system we shall suppose that the corresponding differences for these two events are dx1 dy1 dz1 dt1 then these magnitudes always fulfil the condition       dx2  dy2  dz2  c2dt2  dx1 2  dy1 2  dz1 2  c2dt1 2  the validity of the lorentz transformation follows from this condition we can express this as follows the magnitude                     ds2  dx2  dy2  dz2  c2dt2  which belongs to two adjacent points of the fourdimensional spacetime continuum has the same value for all selected galileian referencebodies if we replace x y z sq rt i  ct  by x1 x2 x3 x4 we also obtaill the result that               ds2  dx12  dx22  dx32  dx42  is independent of the choice of the body of reference we call the magnitude ds the  distance  apart of the two events or fourdimensional points  thus if we choose as timevariable the imaginary variable sq rt i  ct instead of the real quantity t we can regard the spacetime contintium  accordance with the special theory of relativity  as a  euclidean  fourdimensional continuum a result which follows from the considerations of the preceding section     notes   cf appendixes i and 2 the relations which are derived there for the coordlnates themselves are valid also for coordinate differences and thus also for coordinate differentials indefinitely small differences    the spacetime continuum of the general theory of realtiivty is not a eculidean continuum   in the first part of this book we were able to make use of spacetime coordinates which allowed of a simple and direct physical interpretation and which according to section 26 can be regarded as fourdimensional cartesian coordinates this was possible on the basis of the law of the constancy of the velocity of tight but according to section 21 the general theory of relativity cannot retain this law on the contrary we arrived at the result that according to this latter theory the velocity of light must always depend on the coordinates when a gravitational field is present in connection with a specific illustration in section 23 we found that the presence of a gravitational field invalidates the definition of the coordinates and the ifine which led us to our objective in the special theory of relativity  in view of the resuits of these considerations we are led to the conviction that according to the general principle of relativity the spacetime continuum cannot be regarded as a euclidean one but that here we have the general case corresponding to the marble slab with local variations of temperature and with which we made acquaintance as an example of a twodimensional continuum just as it was there impossible to construct a cartesian coordinate system from equal rods so here it is impossible to build up a system referencebody from rigid bodies and clocks which shall be of such a nature that measuringrods and clocks arranged rigidly with respect to one another shaill indicate position and time directly such was the essence of the difficulty with which we were confronted in section 23  but the considerations of sections 25 and 26 show us the way to surmount this difficulty we refer the fourdimensional spacetime continuum in an arbitrary manner to gauss coordinates we assign to every point of the continuum event four numbers x1 x2 x3 x4 coordinates which have not the least direct physical significance but only serve the purpose of numbering the points of the continuum in a definite but arbitrary manner this arrangement does not even need to be of such a kind that we must regard x1 x2 x3 as space coordinates and x4 as a  time  coordinate  the reader may think that such a description of the world would be quite inadequate what does it mean to assign to an event the particular coordinates x1 x2 x3 x4 if in themselves these coordinates have no significance  more careful consideration shows however that this anxiety is unfounded let us consider for instance a material point with any kind of motion if this point had only a momentary existence without duration then it would to described in spacetime by a single system of values x1 x2 x3 x4 thus its permanent existence must be characterised by an infinitely large number of such systems of values the coordinate values of which are so close together as to give continuity corresponding to the material point we thus have a unidimensional line in the fourdimensional continuum in the same way any such lines in our continuum correspond to many points in motion the only statements having regard to these points which can claim a physical existence are in reality the statements about their encounters in our mathematical treatment such an encounter is expressed in the fact that the two lines which represent the motions of the points in question have a particular system of coordinate values x1 x2 x3 x4 in common after mature consideration the reader will doubtless admit that in reality such encounters constitute the only actual evidence of a timespace nature with which we meet in physical statements  when we were describing the motion of a material point relative to a body of reference we stated nothing more than the encounters of this point with particular points of the referencebody we can also determine the corresponding values of the time by the observation of encounters of the body with clocks in conjunction with the observation of the encounter of the hands of clocks with particular points on the dials it is just the same in the case of spacemeasurements by means of measuringrods as a litttle consideration will show  the following statements hold generally  every physical description resolves itself into a number of statements each of which refers to the spacetime coincidence of two events a and b in terms of gaussian coordinates every such statement is expressed by the agreement of their four coordinates x1 x2 x3 x4 thus in reality the description of the timespace continuum by means of gauss coordinates completely replaces the description with the aid of a body of reference without suffering from the defects of the latter mode of description it is not tied down to the euclidean character of the continuum which has to be represented    exact formulation of the general principle of relativity   we are now in a position to replace the pro visional formulation of the general principle of relativity given in section 18 by an exact formulation the form there used all bodies of reference k k1 etc are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena formulation of the general laws of nature whatever may be their state of motion cannot be maintained because the use of rigid referencebodies in the sense of the method followed in the special theory of relativity is in general not possible in spacetime description the gauss coordinate system has to take the place of the body of reference the following statement corresponds to the fundamental idea of the general principle of relativity all gaussian coordinate systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of the general laws of nature  we can state this general principle of relativity in still another form which renders it yet more clearly intelligible than it is when in the form of the natural extension of the special principle of relativity according to the special theory of relativity the equations which express the general laws of nature pass over into equations of the same form when by making use of the lorentz transformation we replace the spacetime variables x y z t of a galileian referencebody k by the spacetime variables x1 y1 z1 t1 of a new referencebody k1 according to the general theory of relativity on the other hand by application of arbitrary substitutions of the gauss variables x1 x2 x3 x4 the equations must pass over into equations of the same form for every transformation not only the lorentz transformation corresponds to the transition of one gauss coordinate system into another  if we desire to adhere to our oldtime threedimensional view of things then we can characterise the development which is being undergone by the fundamental idea of the general theory of relativity as follows  the special theory of relativity has reference to galileian domains ie to those in which no gravitational field exists in this connection a galileian referencebody serves as body of reference ie a rigid body the state of motion of which is so chosen that the galileian law of the uniform rectilinear motion of isolated material points holds relatively to it  certain considerations suggest that we should refer the same galileian domains to nongalileian referencebodies also a gravitational field of a special kind is then present with respect to these bodies cf sections 20 and 23  in gravitational fields there are no such things as rigid bodies with euclidean properties thus the fictitious rigid body of reference is of no avail in the general theory of relativity the motion of clocks is also influenced by gravitational fields and in such a way that a physical definition of time which is made directly with the aid of clocks has by no means the same degree of plausibility as in the special theory of relativity  for this reason nonrigid referencebodies are used which are as a whole not only moving in any way whatsoever but which also suffer alterations in form ad lib during their motion clocks for which the law of motion is of any kind however irregular serve for the definition of time we have to imagine each of these clocks fixed at a point on the nonrigid referencebody these clocks satisfy only the one condition that the readings which are observed simultaneously on adjacent clocks in space differ from each other by an indefinitely small amount this nonrigid referencebody which might appropriately be termed a referencemollusc is in the main equivalent to a gaussian fourdimensional coordinate system chosen arbitrarily that which gives the mollusc a certain comprehensibility as compared with the gauss coordinate system is the really unjustified formal retention of the separate existence of the space coordinates as opposed to the time coordinate every point on the mollusc is treated as a spacepoint and every material point which is at rest relatively to it as at rest so long as the mollusc is considered as referencebody the general principle of relativity requires that all these molluscs can be used as referencebodies with equal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws of nature the laws themselves must be quite independent of the choice of mollusc  the great power possessed by the general principle of relativity lies in the comprehensive limitation which is imposed on the laws of nature in consequence of what we have seen above    the solution of the problem of gravitation on the basis of the general principle of relativity   if the reader has followed all our previous considerations he will have no further difficulty in understanding the methods leading to the solution of the problem of gravitation  we start off on a consideration of a galileian domain ie a domain in which there is no gravitational field relative to the galileian referencebody k the behaviour of measuringrods and clocks with reference to k is known from the special theory of relativity likewise the behaviour of isolated material points the latter move uniformly and in straight lines  now let us refer this domain to a random gauss coordinate system or to a mollusc as referencebody k1 then with respect to k1 there is a gravitational field g of a particular kind we learn the behaviour of measuringrods and clocks and also of freelymoving material points with reference to k1 simply by mathematical transformation we interpret this behaviour as the behaviour of measuringrods docks and material points tinder the influence of the gravitational field g hereupon we introduce a hypothesis that the influence of the gravitational field on measuringrods clocks and freelymoving material points continues to take place according to the same laws even in the case where the prevailing gravitational field is not derivable from the galfleian special care simply by means of a transformation of coordinates  the next step is to investigate the spacetime behaviour of the gravitational field g which was derived from the galileian special case simply by transformation of the coordinates this behaviour is formulated in a law which is always valid no matter how the referencebody mollusc used in the description may be chosen  this law is not yet the general law of the gravitational field since the gravitational field under consideration is of a special kind in order to find out the general lawoffield of gravitation we still require to obtain a generalisation of the law as found above this can be obtained without caprice however by taking into consideration the following demands  a the required generalisation must likewise satisfy the general postulate of relativity  b if there is any matter in the domain under consideration only its inertial mass and thus according to section 15 only its energy is of importance for its etfect in exciting a field  c gravitational field and matter together must satisfy the law of the conservation of energy and of impulse  finally the general principle of relativity permits us to determine the influence of the gravitational field on the course of all those processes which take place according to known laws when a gravitational field is absent ie which have already been fitted into the frame of the special theory of relativity in this connection we proceed in principle according to the method which has already been explained for measuringrods clocks and freely moving material points  the theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general postulate of relativity excels not only in its beauty  nor in removing the defect attaching to classical mechanics which was brought to light in section 21 nor in interpreting the empirical law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass  but it has also already explained a result of observation in astronomy against which classical mechanics is powerless  if we confine the application of the theory to the case where the gravitational fields can be regarded as being weak and in which all masses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities which are small compared with the velocity of light we then obtain as a first approximation the newtonian theory thus the latter theory is obtained here without any particular assumption whereas newton had to introduce the hypothesis that the force of attraction between mutually attracting material points is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them if we increase the accuracy of the calculation deviations from the theory of newton make their appearance practically all of which must nevertheless escape the test of observation owing to their smallness  we must draw attention here to one of these deviations according to newtons theory a planet moves round the sun in an ellipse which would permanently maintain its position with respect to the fixed stars if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves and the action of the other planets under consideration thus if we correct the observed motion of the planets for these two influences and if newtons theory be strictly correct we ought to obtain for the orbit of the planet an ellipse which is fixed with reference to the fixed stars this deduction which can be tested with great accuracy has been confirmed for all the planets save one with the precision that is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of observation attainable at the present time the sole exception is mercury the planet which lies nearest the sun since the time of leverrier it has been known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of mercury after it has been corrected for the influences mentioned above is not stationary with respect to the fixed stars but that it rotates exceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the sense of the orbital motion the value obtained for this rotary movement of the orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century an amount ensured to be correct to within a few seconds of arc this effect can be explained by means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of hypotheses which have little probability and which were devised solely for this purponse  on the basis of the general theory of relativity it is found that the ellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in the manner indicated above  that for all the planets with the exception of mercury this rotation is too small to be detected with the delicacy of observation possible at the present time  but that in the case of mercury it must amount to 43 seconds of arc per century a result which is strictly in agreement with observation  apart from this one it has hitherto been possible to make only two deductions from the theory which admit of being tested by observation to wit the curvature of light rays by the gravitational field of the sunx and a displacement of the spectral lines of light reaching us from large stars as compared with the corresponding lines for light produced in an analogous manner terrestrially ie by the same kind of atom  these two deductions from the theory have both been confirmed     notes   first observed by eddington and others in 1919 cf appendix iii pp 126129   established by adams in 1924 cf p 132     part iii  considerations on the universe as a whole   cosmological difficulties of newtons theory   part from the difficulty discussed in section 21 there is a second fundamental difficulty attending classical celestial mechanics which to the best of my knowledge was first discussed in detail by the astronomer seeliger if we ponder over the question as to how the universe considered as a whole is to be regarded the first answer that suggests itself to us is surely this as regards space and time the universe is infinite there are stars everywhere so that the density of matter although very variable in detail is nevertheless on the average everywhere the same in other words however far we might travel through space we should find everywhere an attenuated swarm of fixed stars of approrimately the same kind and density  this view is not in harmony with the theory of newton the latter theory rather requires that the universe should have a kind of centre in which the density of the stars is a maximum and that as we proceed outwards from this centre the groupdensity of the stars should diminish until finally at great distances it is succeeded by an infinite region of emptiness the stellar universe ought to be a finite island in the infinite ocean of space  this conception is in itself not very satisfactory it is still less satisfactory because it leads to the result that the light emitted by the stars and also individual stars of the stellar system are perpetually passing out into infinite space never to return and without ever again coming into interaction with other objects of nature such a finite material universe would be destined to become gradually but systematically impoverished  in order to escape this dilemma seeliger suggested a modification of newtons law in which he assumes that for great distances the force of attraction between two masses diminishes more rapidly than would result from the inverse square law in this way it is possible for the mean density of matter to be constant everywhere even to infinity without infinitely large gravitational fields being produced we thus free ourselves from the distasteful conception that the material universe ought to possess something of the nature of a centre of course we purchase our emancipation from the fundamental difficulties mentioned at the cost of a modification and complication of newtons law which has neither empirical nor theoretical foundation we can imagine innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose without our being able to state a reason why one of them is to be preferred to the others  for any one of these laws would be founded just as little on more general theoretical principles as is the law of newton     notes   proof  according to the theory of newton the number of lines of force which come from infinity and terminate in a mass m is proportional to the mass m if on the average the mass density p0 is constant throughout tithe universe then a sphere of volume v will enclose the average man p0v thus the number of lines of force passing through the surface f of the sphere into its interior is proportional to p0 v for unit area of the surface of the sphere the number of lines of force which enters the sphere is thus proportional to p0 vf or to p0r hence the intensity of the field at the surface would ultimately become infinite with increasing radius r of the sphere which is impossible    the possibility of a finite and yet unbounded universe   but speculations on the structure of the universe also move in quite another direction the development of noneuclidean geometry led to the recognition of the fact that we can cast doubt on the infiniteness of our space without coming into conflict with the laws of thought or with experience riemann helmholtz these questions have already been treated in detail and with unsurpassable lucidity by helmholtz and poincaré whereas i can only touch on them briefly here  in the first place we imagine an existence in two dimensional space flat beings with flat implements and in particular flat rigid measuringrods are free to move in a plane for them nothing exists outside of this plane that which they observe to happen to themselves and to their flat  things  is the allinclusive reality of their plane in particular the constructions of plane euclidean geometry can be carried out by means of the rods eg the lattice construction considered in section 24 in contrast to ours the universe of these beings is twodimensional but like ours it extends to infinity in their universe there is room for an infinite number of identical squares made up of rods ie its volume surface is infinite if these beings say their universe is  plane there is sense in the statement because they mean that they can perform the constructions of plane euclidean geometry with their rods in this connection the individual rods always represent the same distance independently of their position  let us consider now a second twodimensional existence but this time on a spherical surface instead of on a plane the flat beings with their measuringrods and other objects fit exactly on this surface and they are unable to leave it their whole universe of observation extends exclusively over the surface of the sphere are these beings able to regard the geometry of their universe as being plane geometry and their rods withal as the realisation of  distance   they cannot do this for if they attempt to realise a straight line they will obtain a curve which we  threedimensional beings  designate as a great circle ie a selfcontained line of definite finite length which can be measured up by means of a measuringrod similarly this universe has a finite area that can be compared with the area of a square constructed with rods the great charm resulting from this consideration lies in the recognition of the fact that the universe of these beings is finite and yet has no limits  but the sphericalsurface beings do not need to go on a worldtour in order to perceive that they are not living in a euclidean universe they can convince themselves of this on every part of their  world provided they do not use too small a piece of it starting from a point they draw  straight lines  arcs of circles as judged in three dimensional space of equal length in all directions they will call the line joining the free ends of these lines a  circle for a plane surface the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter both lengths being measured with the same rod is according to euclidean geometry of the plane equal to a constant value p which is independent of the diameter of the circle on their spherical surface our flat beings would find for this ratio the value                          eq 27 file eq27gif  ie a smaller value than p the difference being the more considerable the greater is the radius of the circle in comparison with the radius r of the  worldsphere by means of this relation the spherical beings can determine the radius of their universe  world  even when only a relatively small part of their worldsphere is available for their measurements but if this part is very small indeed they will no longer be able to demonstrate that they are on a spherical  world  and not on a euclidean plane for a small part of a spherical surface differs only slightly from a piece of a plane of the same size  thus if the spherical surface beings are living on a planet of which the solar system occupies only a negligibly small part of the spherical universe they have no means of determining whether they are living in a finite or in an infinite universe because the  piece of universe  to which they have access is in both cases practically plane or euclidean it follows directly from this discussion that for our spherebeings the circumference of a circle first increases with the radius until the  circumference of the universe  is reached and that it thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for still further increasing values of the radius during this process the area of the circle continues to increase more and more until finally it becomes equal to the total area of the whole  worldsphere  perhaps the reader will wonder why we have placed our  beings  on a sphere rather than on another closed surface but this choice has its justification in the fact that of all closed surfaces the sphere is unique in possessing the property that all points on it are equivalent i admit that the ratio of the circumference c of a circle to its radius r depends on r but for a given value of r it is the same for all points of the  worldsphere  in other words the  worldsphere  is a  surface of constant curvature  to this twodimensional sphereuniverse there is a threedimensional analogy namely the threedimensional spherical space which was discovered by riemann its points are likewise all equivalent it possesses a finite volume which is determined by its radius 2p2r3 is it possible to imagine a spherical space to imagine a space means nothing else than that we imagine an epitome of our  space  experience ie of experience that we can have in the movement of  rigid  bodies in this sense we can imagine a spherical space  suppose we draw lines or stretch strings in all directions from a point and mark off from each of these the distance r with a measuringrod all the free endpoints of these lengths lie on a spherical surface we can specially measure up the area f of this surface by means of a square made up of measuringrods if the universe is euclidean then f  4pr2  if it is spherical then f is always less than 4pr2 with increasing values of r f increases from zero up to a maximum value which is determined by the  worldradius but for still further increasing values of r the area gradually diminishes to zero at first the straight lines which radiate from the starting point diverge farther and farther from one another but later they approach each other and finally they run together again at a counterpoint to the starting point under such conditions they have traversed the whole spherical space it is easily seen that the threedimensional spherical space is quite analogous to the twodimensional spherical surface it is finite ie of finite volume and has no bounds  it may be mentioned that there is yet another kind of curved space  elliptical space it can be regarded as a curved space in which the two  counterpoints  are identical indistinguishable from each other an elliptical universe can thus be considered to some extent as a curved universe possessing central symmetry  it follows from what has been said that closed spaces without limits are conceivable from amongst these the spherical space and the elliptical excels in its simplicity since all points on it are equivalent as a result of this discussion a most interesting question arises for astronomers and physicists and that is whether the universe in which we live is infinite or whether it is finite in the manner of the spherical universe our experience is far from being sufficient to enable us to answer this question but the general theory of relativity permits of our answering it with a moduate degree of certainty and in this connection the difficulty mentioned in section 30 finds its solution    the structure of space according to the general theory of relativity   according to the general theory of relativity the geometrical properties of space are not independent but they are determined by matter thus we can draw conclusions about the geometrical structure of the universe only if we base our considerations on the state of the matter as being something that is known we know from experience that for a suitably chosen coordinate system the velocities of the stars are small as compared with the velocity of transmission of light we can thus as a rough approximation arrive at a conclusion as to the nature of the universe as a whole if we treat the matter as being at rest  we already know from our previous discussion that the behaviour of measuringrods and clocks is influenced by gravitational fields ie by the distribution of matter this in itself is sufficient to exclude the possibility of the exact validity of euclidean geometry in our universe but it is conceivable that our universe differs only slightly from a euclidean one and this notion seems all the more probable since calculations show that the metrics of surrounding space is influenced only to an exceedingly small extent by masses even of the magnitude of our sun we might imagine that as regards geometry our universe behaves analogously to a surface which is irregularly curved in its individual parts but which nowhere departs appreciably from a plane something like the rippled surface of a lake such a universe might fittingly be called a quasieuclidean universe as regards its space it would be infinite but calculation shows that in a quasieuclidean universe the average density of matter would necessarily be nil thus such a universe could not be inhabited by matter everywhere  it would present to us that unsatisfactory picture which we portrayed in section 30  if we are to have in the universe an average density of matter which differs from zero however small may be that difference then the universe cannot be quasieuclidean on the contrary the results of calculation indicate that if matter be distributed uniformly the universe would necessarily be spherical or elliptical since in reality the detailed distribution of matter is not uniform the real universe will deviate in individual parts from the spherical ie the universe will be quasispherical but it will be necessarily finite in fact the theory supplies us with a simple connection   between the spaceexpanse of the universe and the average density of matter in it     notes   for the radius r of the universe we obtain the equation                          eq 28 file eq28gif  the use of the cgs system in this equation gives 2k  1081027 p is the average density of the matter and k is a constant connected with the newtonian constant of gravitation    appendix i  simple derivation of the lorentz transformation supplementary to section 11   for the relative orientation of the coordinate systems indicated in fig 2 the xaxes of both systems pernumently coincide in the present case we can divide the problem into parts by considering first only events which are localised on the xaxis any such event is represented with respect to the coordinate system k by the abscissa x and the time t and with respect to the system k1 by the abscissa x and the time t we require to find x and t when x and t are given  a lightsignal which is proceeding along the positive axis of x is transmitted according to the equation                                  x  ct  or                   x  ct  0                   1  since the same lightsignal has to be transmitted relative to k1 with the velocity c the propagation relative to the system k1 will be represented by the analogous formula                  x  ct  o                   2  those spacetime points events which satisfy x must also satisfy 2 obviously this will be the case when the relation            x  ct  l x  ct                   3  is fulfilled in general where l indicates a constant  for according to 3 the disappearance of x  ct involves the disappearance of x  ct  if we apply quite similar considerations to light rays which are being transmitted along the negative xaxis we obtain the condition             x  ct  µx  ct                  4  by adding or subtracting equations 3 and 4 and introducing for convenience the constants a and b in place of the constants l and µ where                          eq 29 file eq29gif  and                          eq 30 file eq30gif  we obtain the equations                          eq 31 file eq31gif  we should thus have the solution of our problem if the constants a and b were known these result from the following discussion  for the origin of k1 we have permanently x  0 and hence according to the first of the equations 5                          eq 32 file eq32gif  if we call v the velocity with which the origin of k1 is moving relative to k we then have                          eq 33 file eq33gif  the same value v can be obtained from equations 5 if we calculate the velocity of another point of k1 relative to k or the velocity directed towards the negative xaxis of a point of k with respect to k in short we can designate v as the relative velocity of the two systems  furthermore the principle of relativity teaches us that as judged from k the length of a unit measuringrod which is at rest with reference to k1 must be exactly the same as the length as judged from k of a unit measuringrod which is at rest relative to k in order to see how the points of the xaxis appear as viewed from k we only require to take a  snapshot  of k1 from k this means that we have to insert a particular value of t time of k eg t  0 for this value of t we then obtain from the first of the equations 5                                 x  ax  two points of the xaxis which are separated by the distance dx  i when measured in the k1 system are thus separated in our instantaneous photograph by the distance                          eq 34 file eq34gif  but if the snapshot be taken from kt  0 and if we eliminate t from the equations 5 taking into account the expression 6 we obtain                          eq 35 file eq35gif  from this we conclude that two points on the xaxis separated by the distance i relative to k will be represented on our snapshot by the distance                          eq 36 file eq36gif  but from what has been said the two snapshots must be identical hence dx in 7 must be equal to dx in 7a so that we obtain                          eq 37 file eq37gif  the equations 6 and 7b determine the constants a and b by inserting the values of these constants in 5 we obtain the first and the fourth of the equations given in section 11                          eq 38 file eq38gif  thus we have obtained the lorentz transformation for events on the xaxis it satisfies the condition           x2  c2t2  x2  c2t2                  8a  the extension of this result to include events which take place outside the xaxis is obtained by retaining equations 8 and supplementing them by the relations                          eq 39 file eq39gif  in this way we satisfy the postulate of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo for rays of light of arbitrary direction both for the system k and for the system k this may be shown in the following manner  we suppose a lightsignal sent out from the origin of k at the time t  0 it will be propagated according to the equation                          eq 40 file eq40gif  or if we square this equation according to the equation            x2  y2  z2  c2t2  0                  10  it is required by the law of propagation of light in conjunction with the postulate of relativity that the transmission of the signal in question should take place  as judged from k1  in accordance with the corresponding formula                                 r  ct  or         x2  y2  z2  c2t2  0                  10a  in order that equation 10a may be a consequence of equation 10 we must have     x2  y2  z2  c2t2  s x2  y2  z2  c2t2       11  since equation 8a must hold for points on the xaxis we thus have s  i it is easily seen that the lorentz transformation really satisfies equation 11 for s  i for 11 is a consequence of 8a and 9 and hence also of 8 and 9 we have thus derived the lorentz transformation  the lorentz transformation represented by 8 and 9 still requires to be generalised obviously it is immaterial whether the axes of k1 be chosen so that they are spatially parallel to those of k it is also not essential that the velocity of translation of k1 with respect to k should be in the direction of the xaxis a simple consideration shows that we are able to construct the lorentz transformation in this general sense from two kinds of transformations viz from lorentz transformations in the special sense and from purely spatial transformations which corresponds to the replacement of the rectangular coordinate system by a new system with its axes pointing in other directions  mathematically we can characterise the generalised lorentz transformation thus   it expresses x y x t in terms of linear homogeneous functions of x y x t of such a kind that the relation       x2  y2  z2  c2t2  x2  y2  z2  c2t2       11a  is satisficd identically that is to say if we substitute their expressions in x y x t in place of x y x t on the lefthand side then the lefthand side of 11a agrees with the righthand side    appendix ii  minkowskis fourdimensional space world supplementary to section 17   we can characterise the lorentz transformation still more simply if we introduce the imaginary eq 25 in place of t as timevariable if in accordance with this we insert                                x1  x                               x2  y                               x3  z                               x4  eq 25  and similarly for the accented system k1 then the condition which is identically satisfied by the transformation can be expressed thus   x12  x22  x32  x42  x12  x22  x32  x42     12  that is by the aforementioned choice of  coordinates 11a see the end of appendix ii is transformed into this equation  we see from 12 that the imaginary time coordinate x4 enters into the condition of transformation in exactly the same way as the space coordinates x1 x2 x3 it is due to this fact that according to the theory of relativity the  time x4 enters into natural laws in the same form as the space co ordinates x1 x2 x3  a fourdimensional continuum described by the coordinates x1 x2 x3 x4 was called world by minkowski who also termed a pointevent a  worldpoint from a happening in threedimensional space physics becomes as it were an  existence  in the fourdimensional  world  this fourdimensional  world  bears a close similarity to the threedimensional  space  of euclidean analytical geometry if we introduce into the latter a new cartesian coordinate system x1 x2 x3 with the same origin then x1 x2 x3 are linear homogeneous functions of x1 x2 x3 which identically satisfy the equation          x12  x22  x32  x12  x22  x32  the analogy with 12 is a complete one we can regard minkowskis  world  in a formal manner as a fourdimensional euclidean space with an imaginary time coordinate  the lorentz transformation corresponds to a  rotation  of the coordinate system in the fourdimensional  world    appendix iii  the experimental confirmation of the general theory of relativity   from a systematic theoretical point of view we may imagine the process of evolution of an empirical science to be a continuous process of induction theories are evolved and are expressed in short compass as statements of a large number of individual observations in the form of empirical laws from which the general laws can be ascertained by comparison regarded in this way the development of a science bears some resemblance to the compilation of a classified catalogue it is as it were a purely empirical enterprise  but this point of view by no means embraces the whole of the actual process  for it slurs over the important part played by intuition and deductive thought in the development of an exact science as soon as a science has emerged from its initial stages theoretical advances are no longer achieved merely by a process of arrangement guided by empirical data the investigator rather develops a system of thought which in general is built up logically from a small number of fundamental assumptions the socalled axioms we call such a system of thought a theory the theory finds the justification for its existence in the fact that it correlates a large number of single observations and it is just here that the  truth  of the theory lies  corresponding to the same complex of empirical data there may be several theories which differ from one another to a considerable extent but as regards the deductions from the theories which are capable of being tested the agreement between the theories may be so complete that it becomes difficult to find any deductions in which the two theories differ from each other as an example a case of general interest is available in the province of biology in the darwinian theory of the development of species by selection in the struggle for existence and in the theory of development which is based on the hypothesis of the hereditary transmission of acquired characters  we have another instance of farreaching agreement between the deductions from two theories in newtonian mechanics on the one hand and the general theory of relativity on the other this agreement goes so far that up to the preseat we have been able to find only a few deductions from the general theory of relativity which are capable of investigation and to which the physics of prerelativity days does not also lead and this despite the profound difference in the fundamental assumptions of the two theories in what follows we shall again consider these important deductions and we shall also discuss the empirical evidence appertaining to them which has hitherto been obtained   a motion of the perihelion of mercury  according to newtonian mechanics and newtons law of gravitation a planet which is revolving round the sun would describe an ellipse round the latter or more correctly round the common centre of gravity of the sun and the planet in such a system the sun or the common centre of gravity lies in one of the foci of the orbital ellipse in such a manner that in the course of a planetyear the distance sunplanet grows from a minimum to a maximum and then decreases again to a minimum if instead of newtons law we insert a somewhat different law of attraction into the calculation we find that according to this new law the motion would still take place in such a manner that the distance sunplanet exhibits periodic variations but in this case the angle described by the line joining sun and planet during such a period from perihelionclosest proximity to the sunto perihelion would differ from 3600 the line of the orbit would not then be a closed one but in the course of time it would fill up an annular part of the orbital plane viz between the circle of least and the circle of greatest distance of the planet from the sun  according also to the general theory of relativity which differs of course from the theory of newton a small variation from the newtonkepler motion of a planet in its orbit should take place and in such away that the angle described by the radius sunplanet between one perhelion and the next should exceed that corresponding to one complete revolution by an amount given by                          eq 41 file eq41gif  nb  one complete revolution corresponds to the angle 2p in the absolute angular measure customary in physics and the above expression giver the amount by which the radius sunplanet exceeds this angle during the interval between one perihelion and the next in this expression a represents the major semiaxis of the ellipse e its eccentricity c the velocity of light and t the period of revolution of the planet our result may also be stated as follows  according to the general theory of relativity the major axis of the ellipse rotates round the sun in the same sense as the orbital motion of the planet theory requires that this rotation should amount to 43 seconds of arc per century for the planet mercury but for the other planets of our solar system its magnitude should be so small that it would necessarily escape detection   in point of fact astronomers have found that the theory of newton does not suffice to calculate the observed motion of mercury with an exactness corresponding to that of the delicacy of observation attainable at the present time after taking account of all the disturbing influences exerted on mercury by the remaining planets it was found leverrier 1859 and newcomb 1895 that an unexplained perihelial movement of the orbit of mercury remained over the amount of which does not differ sensibly from the above mentioned 43 seconds of arc per century the uncertainty of the empirical result amounts to a few seconds only   b deflection of light by a gravitational field  in section 22 it has been already mentioned that according to the general theory of relativity a ray of light will experience a curvature of its path when passing through a gravitational field this curvature being similar to that experienced by the path of a body which is projected through a gravitational field as a result of this theory we should expect that a ray of light which is passing close to a heavenly body would be deviated towards the latter for a ray of light which passes the sun at a distance of d sunradii from its centre the angle of deflection a should amount to                          eq 42 file eq42gif  it may be added that according to the theory half of figure 05 this deflection is produced by the newtonian field of attraction of the sun and the other half by the geometrical modification  curvature  of space caused by the sun  this result admits of an experimental test by means of the photographic registration of stars during a total eclipse of the sun the only reason why we must wait for a total eclipse is because at every other time the atmosphere is so strongly illuminated by the light from the sun that the stars situated near the suns disc are invisible the predicted effect can be seen clearly from the accompanying diagram if the sun s were not present a star which is practically infinitely distant would be seen in the direction d1 as observed front the earth but as a consequence of the deflection of light from the star by the sun the star will be seen in the direction d2 ie at a somewhat greater distance from the centre of the sun than corresponds to its real position  in practice the question is tested in the following way the stars in the neighbourhood of the sun are photographed during a solar eclipse in addition a second photograph of the same stars is taken when the sun is situated at another position in the sky ie a few months earlier or later as compared whh the standard photograph the positions of the stars on the eclipsephotograph ought to appear displaced radially outwards away from the centre of the sun by an amount corresponding to the angle a  we are indebted to the british royal society and to the royal astronomical society for the investigation of this important deduction undaunted by the first world war and by difficulties of both a material and a psychological nature aroused by the war these societies equipped two expeditions  to sobral brazil and to the island of principe west africa  and sent several of britains most celebrated astronomers eddington cottingham crommelin davidson in order to obtain photographs of the solar eclipse of 29th may 1919 the relative discrepancies to be expected between the stellar photographs obtained during the eclipse and the comparison photographs amounted to a few hundredths of a millimetre only thus great accuracy was necessary in making the adjustments required for the taking of the photographs and in their subsequent measurement  the results of the measurements confirmed the theory in a thoroughly satisfactory manner the rectangular components of the observed and of the calculated deviations of the stars in seconds of arc are set forth in the following table of results                         table 01 file table01gif   c displacement of spectral lines towards the red  in section 23 it has been shown that in a system k1 which is in rotation with regard to a galileian system k clocks of identical construction and which are considered at rest with respect to the rotating referencebody go at rates which are dependent on the positions of the clocks we shall now examine this dependence quantitatively a clock which is situated at a distance r from the centre of the disc has a velocity relative to k which is given by                                  v  wr  where w represents the angular velocity of rotation of the disc k1 with respect to k if v0 represents the number of ticks of the clock per unit time  rate  of the clock relative to k when the clock is at rest then the  rate  of the clock v when it is moving relative to k with a velocity v but at rest with respect to the disc will in accordance with section 12 be given by                          eq 43 file eq43gif  or with sufficient accuracy by                          eq 44 file eq44gif  this expression may also be stated in the following form                          eq 45 file eq45gif  if we represent the difference of potential of the centrifugal force between the position of the clock and the centre of the disc by f ie the work considered negatively which must be performed on the unit of mass against the centrifugal force in order to transport it from the position of the clock on the rotating disc to the centre of the disc then we have                          eq 46 file eq46gif  from this it follows that                          eq 47 file eq47gif  in the first place we see from this expression that two clocks of identical construction will go at different rates when situated at different distances from the centre of the disc this result is aiso valid from the standpoint of an observer who is rotating with the disc  now as judged from the disc the latter is in a gravititional field of potential f hence the result we have obtained will hold quite generally for gravitational fields furthermore we can regard an atom which is emitting spectral lines as a clock so that the following statement will hold  an atom absorbs or emits light of a frequency which is dependent on the potential of the gravitational field in which it is situated  the frequency of an atom situated on the surface of a heavenly body will be somewhat less than the frequency of an atom of the same element which is situated in free space or on the surface of a smaller celestial body  now f   k mr where k is newtons constant of gravitation and m is the mass of the heavenly body thus a displacement towards the red ought to take place for spectral lines produced at the surface of stars as compared with the spectral lines of the same element produced at the surface of the earth the amount of this displacement being                          eq 48 file eq48gif  for the sun the displacement towards the red predicted by theory amounts to about two millionths of the wavelength a trustworthy calculation is not possible in the case of the stars because in general neither the mass m nor the radius r are known  it is an open question whether or not this effect exists and at the present time 1920 astronomers are working with great zeal towards the solution owing to the smallness of the effect in the case of the sun it is difficult to form an opinion as to its existence whereas grebe and bachem bonn as a result of their own measurements and those of evershed and schwarzschild on the cyanogen bands have placed the existence of the effect almost beyond doubt while other investigators particularly st john have been led to the opposite opinion in consequence of their measurements  mean displacements of lines towards the less refrangible end of the spectrum are certainly revealed by statistical investigations of the fixed stars  but up to the present the examination of the available data does not allow of any definite decision being arrived at as to whether or not these displacements are to be referred in reality to the effect of gravitation the results of observation have been collected together and discussed in detail from the standpoint of the question which has been engaging our attention here in a paper by e freundlich entitled zur prüfung der allgemeinen relativitumlauttstheorie die naturwissenschaften 1919 no 35 p 520 julius springer berlin  at all events a definite decision will be reached during the next few years if the displacement of spectral lines towards the red by the gravitational potential does not exist then the general theory of relativity will be untenable on the other hand if the cause of the displacement of spectral lines be definitely traced to the gravitational potential then the study of this displacement will furnish us with important information as to the mass of the heavenly bodies 5a     notes   especially since the next planet venus has an orbit that is almost an exact circle which makes it more difficult to locate the perihelion with precision  the displacentent of spectral lines towards the red end of the spectrum was definitely established by adams in 1924 by observations on the dense companion of sirius for which the effect is about thirty times greater than for the sun rwl  translator    appendix iv  the structure of space according to the general theory of relativity supplementary to section 32   since the publication of the first edition of this little book our knowledge about the structure of space in the large  cosmological problem  has had an important development which ought to be mentioned even in a popular presentation of the subject  my original considerations on the subject were based on two hypotheses  1 there exists an average density of matter in the whole of space which is everywhere the same and different from zero  2 the magnitude  radius  of space is independent of time  both these hypotheses proved to be consistent according to the general theory of relativity but only after a hypothetical term was added to the field equations a term which was not required by the theory as such nor did it seem natural from a theoretical point of view  cosmological term of the field equations   hypothesis 2 appeared unavoidable to me at the time since i thought that one would get into bottomless speculations if one departed from it  however already in the twenties the russian mathematician friedman showed that a different hypothesis was natural from a purely theoretical point of view he realized that it was possible to preserve hypothesis 1 without introducing the less natural cosmological term into the field equations of gravitation if one was ready to drop hypothesis 2 namely the original field equations admit a solution in which the  world radius  depends on time expanding space in that sense one can say according to friedman that the theory demands an expansion of space  a few years later hubble showed by a special investigation of the extragalactic nebulae  milky ways  that the spectral lines emitted showed a red shift which increased regularly with the distance of the nebulae this can be interpreted in regard to our present knowledge only in the sense of dopplers principle as an expansive motion of the system of stars in the large  as required according to friedman by the field equations of gravitation hubbles discovery can therefore be considered to some extent as a confirmation of the theory  there does arise however a strange difficulty the interpretation of the galactic lineshift discovered by hubble as an expansion which can hardly be doubted from a theoretical point of view leads to an origin of this expansion which lies  only  about 109 years ago while physical astronomy makes it appear likely that the development of individual stars and systems of stars takes considerably longer it is in no way known how this incongruity is to be overcome  i further want to rernark that the theory of expanding space together with the empirical data of astronomy permit no decision to be reached about the finite or infinite character of threedimensional space while the original  static  hypothesis of space yielded the closure finiteness of space   k  coordinate system x y  twodimensional coordinates x y z  threedimensional coordinates x y z t  fourdimensional coordinates  t  time i
