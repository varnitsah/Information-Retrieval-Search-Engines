sunset                      304     a bride of the plains     chapter i  god bless them all they are good lads   it was now close on eight oclock and more than two hours ago since first the dawn broke over that lowlying horizon line which seems so far away and tinged the vast immensity of the plain first with grey and then with mauve and paletoned emerald with rose and carmine and crimson and bloodred until the suntriumphant and glorious at lastwoke the sunflowers from their sleep gilded every tiny blade of grass and every sprig of rosemary and caused every head of stately maize to quiver with delight at the warmth of his kiss  the plain stretched its limitless expanse as far as human eye can reacha sea of tall straight stems with waves of brilliant green and plumecrowned crests shimmering like foam in the sunlight  as far as human eye can seeand further much further stillthe sea of maize countless upright stems hundreds of thousands of emerald green sheaths crowned with flaxen tendrils like a maidens hair down on the grounda carpet for the feet of the majestic cornhundreds and thousands of orangecoloured pumpkins turning their huge shiny carcases to the ripening rays of the sun and all around in fantastic lines rows of tall sunflowers a blaze of amber with thick velvety hearts laden with seed  and all of it stretching out apparently to infinity beyond that horizon line which is still hidden by a silvery haze impalpable womb that cradles the lifegiving heat  stately stems of maizecountless as the pebbles on a beach as the specks of foam upon the crest of a wave limitless as the sea and like the sea mutable everchanging restlessbending to every breath of the summer breeze full of strange sweet sounds of moanings and of sighs as the emerald sheaths tremble in the wind or down below the bright yellow carcases of the pumpkins crack and shiver in the growing heat  an ocean of tall maize and gailycoloured pumpkins as far as the eye can reach and long dividing lines of ambercoloured sunflowers vivid and riotous flaunting their crude colouring in the glowing sunlight  here and there the dull dark green of hemp breaks the unvarying stretches of maize and far away there is a tanya cottage with a group of stunted acacias near it and a well whose tall gaunt arm stretches weirdly up to the sky whilst to the south the sluggish maros winds its slow course lazily toward the parent stream  an ocean of maize and of pumpkins and of sunflowers with here and there the tall crested stems of hemp and above it the skyblue and already glowing through the filmy mist which every minute grows more ethereal and more impalpable as veil upon veil of heatholding vapours are drawn from before its face  a beautiful morning in midseptember and yet in all this vast immensity of fertile land and ripening fruit there is no sign of human toil no sound of beast or creaking waggon no sign of human life around that distant tanya  the tiny lizard in his comfortable position on the summit of a gigantic pumpkin can continue his matutinal sleep in peace the stork can continue undisturbed his preparations for his impending long voyage over seas man has not yet thought to break by travail or by song the peaceful silence of the plain  and yet the village lies not very far away close to the maros the small low hempthatched houses scarcely peep above the sea of tallstemmed maize only the whitewashed tower of the church with its redpainted roof stands out clear and abrupt against the sky  and now the sharp cracked sound of the elevation bell breaks the silence of the summers morning the good pater bonifácius is saying mass he at any rate is astir and busy with his days work and obligations surely it is strange that at so late an hour in midseptember with the maize waiting to be gathered in the population of marosfalva should still be absent from the fields  hej but stranger what would you such a day is this fourteenth of september  what you did not know it the fourteenth of september the ugliest blackest most godforsaken day in the whole year  you did not know you cannot guess then what kind of a stranger are you if you do not know that on this hideous fourteenth of september all the finest lads of marosfalva and the villages around are taken away by the abominable government away for three years to be made into soldiers to drill and to march to carry guns and bayonets to obey words of command that they dont understand to be packed off from place to placefrom arad to bistricz from kecskemét to nagyvárad aye and as far as bosnia toowherever that may be  yes kind sir the lads of marosfalva and of fekete of kender and of görcz are taken away just like that in batches every year packed into one of those detestable railways like so many heads of cattle and separated from their mothers their sisters their sweethearts all because a hateful government for which the people of marosfalva do not care one brass fillér has so decreed it  mind you it is the same in all the other villages and in every town in hungaryso at least we have been given to understandbut we have nothing to do with other villages or with the towns they do just as the good god wills them to do it is our ladsthe lads of marosfalva and kender and fekete and görczwho have to be packed off in trainloads today and taken away from us for three years  three years why the lad is a mere child when he goesoneandtwenty on his last birthday bless himstill wanting a mothers care of his stomach and his clothes and a fathers heavy stick across his back from time to time to keep him from drink and too much lovemaking  three years when he comes back he is a man has notions of his own has seen the world and cares no more about his native village and the narrow cottage where he used to run in and out barefooted barechested bareheaded and comfortably dirty from head to foot  three years and what are the chances that he come back at all bosnia where in the world is that and if you are a soldier why then you go to war you get shot at killed may be or at any rate maimed three years you may never come back and when you do you are not the same youngster whom your mother kissed your father whacked and your sweetheart wept over  three years nay but tis a lifetime mother is old she may never see her son again girls are vain and fickle they will turn their thoughts in other directionsthere are the men who have done their military service who have paid their toll to the abominable government up at budapest and who are therefore free to court and free to marry  aye aye thats how it is they must go through with it though they hate it allevery moment of it they hate to be packed into railway carriages like so many dried heads of maize in a barn they hate to wear the heavy cloth clothes the hard boots the leather pouches and belts my god how they hate it  and the rude alien sergeant with his vorwärts and marsch and rechts and linksi ask you in the name of the holy virgin what kind of gibberish is that  but they must all goall those at least who are whole and sound in body bless them they are sound enough when they go it is when they come back     yes they must all go those who are sound in eyes and wind and limb and it is very difficult to cheat the commission who come to take our lads away there was benkó for instance he starved himself for three months this summer hoping to reduce his chest measurements by a few needful centimètres but it was no use the doctor who examined him said that with regular food and plenty of exercise he would soon put on more flesh and he would get both for the next three years and jánosyou rememberhe chopped off one of his toesthinking that would get him off those hated three years of service but it seems there is a new decree by which the lads need not be possessed of all ten toes in order to serve the hateful government  no no it is no use trying to get out of it they measure you and bang your chest and your back they look at your eyes and make you open your mouth to look at your teeth but anyhow they take you away for three years  they make you swear that you will faithfully serve your country and your king during that time that you will obey your superiors and follow your leader wherever he may command over land and by water by water i ask you when there was albert and jenö who could not bear even the sight of water they would not have gone in a boat on the maros if you had offered them a gold piece each how could they swear that they would follow some fool of a german officer on water  they could not swear that they knew they could not do it but they were clapped in prison like common malefactors and treated like brigands and thieves until they did swear and after thatwell they had once to cross the theiss in a ferryboatthey were made to do it  oh no nothing happened to them then but albert came back after his three years service with two of his front teeth gone and we all know that jenö now is little better than an idiot  so now you know stranger why we at marosfalva call the fourteenth day of september the very blackest in the whole calendar and why at eight oclock in the morning nobody is at work in the fields  for the fourteenth day being such a black one we must all make the most of the few hours that come before it at nine oclock of that miserable morning the packing of our lads into the train will commence but until then they are making merry bless them they are true hungarians you know they will dance and they will sing they will listen to gipsy music and kiss the girls so long as there is breath in their body so long as they are free to do it  at nine oclock today they cease to be free men they are under the orders of corporals and sergeants and officers who will command them to go vorwärts and rechts and links and all that godforsaken gibberish and put them in irons and on bread and water if they do not obey but yesterday on the thirteenth of september that is they were still free to do as they liked they could dance and sing and get drunk as much as they chose  so the big barn that belongs to ignácz goldstein the jew is thrown open for a nights dancing and music and jollification at five oclock in the afternoon the gipsies tuned up there was a supper which lasted many hours after which the dancing began the first csárdás was struck up at eight oclock last evening the last one is being danced now at eight oclock in the morning while the whole plain lies in silence under the shimmering sky and while pater bonifácius reads his mass all alone in the little church and prays fervently for the lads who are going away today for three years away from his care and his tender paternal attention away from their homes their weeping mothers and sorrowing sweethearts  god bless them all they are good lads but weak impulsive easily led toward good or evil they are dancing now when they should be praying but god bless them all they are good lads     chapter ii  money wont buy everything   inside the barn the guttering candles were burning low no one thought of blowing them out so they were just left to smoke and to smoulder and to help render the atmosphere even more stifling than it otherwise would have been  the heat has become almost unbearableunbearable that is to anyone not wholly intent on pleasure to the exclusion of every other sensation every other consciousness the barn built of huge pine logs strawthatched and raftered is filled to overflowing with peoplemen women even childrenall bent upon one great allabsorbing objectthat object forgetfulness  the indifferent the stolid may call it what he will but it is the common wish to forget that has brought all these peopleyoung and oldtogether in ignácz goldsteins barn this nightthe desire to forget that hideous fateful fourteenth of september which comes with such heartrending regularity year after yearthe desire to forget that the lads the flower of the neighbouring villages are going away today    for three yearsnay very likely for everthree years and all packed up like cattle in a railway truck and put under the orders of some brutal sergeant who is not hungarian and can only say vorwärts or marsch and is backed in his arbitrary commands by the whole weight of government king and country  for three yearsand there is always war going on somewhereand that awful bosnia wherever it may belads from hungarian villages go there sound in body and in limb and come back bent with ague halt lame or blind  three years more like for ever  and therefore the whole population of marosfalva and of the villages round spends its last happy fourandtwenty hours in trying to forget that nine oclock of the fourteenth day of september is approaching with sure and giant strides everyone has a wish to forget the parents and grandparents the sisters the sweethearts the lads themselves the future is so hideous let the joy of the present kill all thoughts of those coming three years  marosfalva is the rallyingpoint where this final annual jollification takes place they all come over on the thirteenth from fekete and görcz and kender in order to dance and to sing at marosfalva in the barn which belongs to ignácz goldstein the jew marosfalva boasts of a railway station and it is from here that at nine oclock in the morning the lads will be entrained so all day on the thirteenth there has been a pilgrimage along the crossroads from the outlying villages and hamlets round marosfalvaa stream of men and women and young children all determined to forget for a few hours the coming separation of the morrow by five oclock in the afternoon all those had assembled who had meant to come and dancing in the barn had begun  ignácz goldsteins barn has always been the setting in which the final drama of the happy year is acted after that night spent there in dancing and music and merrymaking down goes the curtain on the comedy of life and the tragedy of tears begins  since five oclock in the afternoon the young people have been dancingwaltzing polkaing dancing the csárdásmostly the csárdás the dance of the nation of the people the most exhilarating most entrancing most voluptuous dance that feet of man have ever trod the girls and lads are indefatigable the slow and languorous lassu slow movement alternates with the mad merry csárdás they twirl and twist advance retreat separate and reunite in a mad intoxicating whirl small booted feet stamp on the rough wooden floor sending up clouds of dust what matter if the air becomes more and more stifling there are tears and sighs to be stifled too  ho there czigány play up faster faster tis not a funeral dirge you are playing  the gipsy musicians hot and perspiring have blown and scraped and banged for fifteen solid hours no one would ever think of suggesting that a gipsy needed rest the clarinetist it is true rolled off his seat at one time and had to be well shaken ere he could blow again but the leaderas good a leader mind you as could be found in the kingdomhad only paused when the dancers were exhausted or when bite and sup were placed before him there they were perched up on a rough platform made up of packingcases borrowed from the stationmaster the czimbalom player in the centre his fat brown hands wield the tiny clappers with unerring precision up and down the strings with that soft lingering tone which partakes of the clavecins and the harp alike at the back the doublebass lean and dark with jetblack eyes that stare stolidly at his leader  there is a second fiddle and the fat clarinetist and of course the leaderhe whose match could not be found in the kingdom he stands on the very edge of the rough platform his fiddle under his chin and he stoops well forward so that his hands and instrument almost touch the foremost of the dancing pairs  theythe dancerscrowd closely round the gipsy band for so must the csárdás be danced as near the musicians as possible as close together as the wide sweeping petticoats of the girls will allow  such petticoats one on the top of the other ten or a dozen or more and all of different colour the girls are proud of these petticoatsthe number of them is a sign of prosperity and now as they dance and swing from the hips these petticoats fly out caught by the currents of air until they look like gargantuan showers of vividlycoloured petals shaken by giant hands  above the petticoats the girls waists look slim in the dark tightfitting corslet above which again rises the rich olivetinted breast and throat full white sleeves of linen crown the bare ruddy arms and ribbons of national coloursred white and greenfloat from the shoulders and the waist  the smooth thick hair is closely plaited from the crown of the head in two long tight plaits it is drawn rigidly away from the forehead giving that quaint hard finish to the round merry face which is so characteristic of the asiatic ancestry  each one of them a little picture which seems to have stepped straight out of a velasquez canvas the bellshaped skirt the stiff corslet the straight tight hair and round eyes full of vitality  the men wear their linen shirt and full trousers with fringed embroidered ends the leather waistcoat and broad belt covered with metal bosses and wrought with brightcoloured woollen threads they get very excited in the mazes of the dance they shout to the gipsies to play faster and ever faster each holds his partner tightly round the slim waist and swings her round and round till she stumbles giddy and almost faint in his arms  and round the dancers in a semicircle the spectators stand in a dense crowdthe older folk and the girls who have not secured partnersthey watch and watch indefatigable like the dancers untiring like the musicians and behind this semicircle in the dark corners of the barn the children foot it too with the same ardour the same excitement as their elders  the last csárdás of this memorable night it is eight oclock now and through the apertures in the log wall the brilliant light of this late summers morning enters triumphant and crude  andor is dancing with elsapretty fairhaired elsa the daughter of old kapus benkó1 an old reprobate if ever there was one such a handsome couple they look is it not a shame that andor must go todayfor three years perhaps for ever  footnote 1 in hungary the surname precedes the christian name  the tears that have struggled up to elsas tender blue eyes despite her will to keep them back add to the charm of her engaging personality they help to soften the somewhat serious expression of her young face her cheeks are glowing with the excitement of the dance her graceful figure bends to the pressure of andors arm around her waist  ten or a dozen cotton petticoats are tied round that slim waist of hers no two of a like colour and as she twists and twirls in andors arms the petticoats fly out till she looks like a huge flower of many hues with superposed corollas blue green pink and yellow beneath which her small feet shod in boots of brilliant leather look like two crimson stamens  the tightfitting corslet bodice and the full white sleeves of the shift make her figure appear peculiarly slim and girlish and her bare throat and shoulders are smooth and warmly tinted like some luscious fruit  no wonder that andor feels this dance this movement the music the girls sweet quick breath going to his head like wine elsa was always pretty always dainty and gentle but now she is excited tearful at the coming parting and by all the saints a more exquisite woman never came out of paradise  the semicircle of spectators composed of older folk draws closer round the dancers but the other couples remain comparatively unheeded it is elsa and andor whom everyone is watching  he is tall and broadshouldered with the supple limbs of a young stag and the mad irresponsible movements of a colt his dark eyes shine like two stars out of his sunburnt face his muscular arms encircle elsas fine waist with a grip that is almost masterful the wide sleeves of his linen shirt flutter above his shoulders till they look like wings and he like some messenger of the gods come to carry this exquisite prey off from the earth  what a wellmatched couple murmur the older women as they watch  elsa will be the beauty of the village within the next year mark what i say added a kindly old soul turning to her neighboura slatternly illkempt middleaged woman who was casting looks on andor and elsa that were none too kind  hm retorted the latter with sour mien then tis as well that that goodfornothing will be safely out of the way  i would not call andor goodfornothing irma néni2 said one of the men who stood close by he has not had much chance to do anything for himself yet     footnote 2 aunt irmathe words aunt néni and uncle bácsi are used indiscriminately in hungary when addressing elderly people and do not necessarily imply any relationship  and he never will snapped the woman with a click of her thin jaws i know the sortalways going to do wonderful things in a future which never comes well at any rate while he is a soldier they will teach him that he is no better than other lads that come from the same village and not even as good seeing that he has never any money in his wallet  andor will be rich some day suggested the kindly old soul who had first spoken dont you forget it irma néni  i have no special wish to remember it my good kati retorted irma dryly  i thought murmured the other seeing that andor has really courted elsa this summer that    perhaps     my daughter has plenty of admirers said irma in her bittertoned snappish way and has no reason to wait for one who only may be rich some day  bah lakatos pál cannot live for ever andor will have every fillér of his money when he dies and pál will cut up very well  lakatos pál is a youngish mannot fifty i imagine concluded irma with a sneer he may live another thirty years and elsa would be an old woman herself by then  the other woman said nothing more after that it was no use arguing the point irma was the wife of old kapusboth of them as shiftless thriftless illconditioned a pair as ever stole the daylight from god in order to waste it in idleness how they came to be blessed with such a pretty winning daughter as elsa an all tooindulgent god only knew  what however was well known throughout the village was that as kapus and his wife never had a crown to bless themselves with and had never saved enough to earn a rest for themselves in their old age they had long ago determined that their daughter should be the means of bringing prosperity to them as soon as she was old enough for the marriagemarket  elsa was beautiful thank the good god for that kapus had never saved enough to give her a marriageportion either and had she been ugly or only moderately pretty it would have been practically impossible to find a husband for her but if she became the beauty of marosfalvaas indeed she was alreadythere would be plenty of rich men who would be willing to waive the question of the marriageportion for the sake of the glory of having captured the loveliest matrimonial prize in the whole countryside  leave irma néni alone mother said the man who had first taken up the cudgels in favour of andor we all know that she has very ambitious views for elsa please god she may not be disappointed  from more than one group of spectators came similar or other comments on pretty elsa and her partner the general consensus of opinion seemed to be that it was as well andor was going away for three years old kapus and his wife would never allow their daughter to marry a man with pockets as empty as their own and it was no use waiting for dead mens shoes lakatos pál the rich uncle from whom andor was bound to inherit some day was little past the prime of life until he died how would andor and a penniless wife contrive to live for lakatos pál was a miser and hoarded his moneymoreover he was a confirmed bachelor and womanhater he would do nothing for andor if the young man chose to marry  ah well it was a pity for a betterlooking bettermatched pair could not be found in the whole county of arad  lucky for you béla that andor goes off today for three years said a tall handsome girl to her neighbour you would not have had much chance with elsa otherwise  the man beside her made no immediate reply he was standing with legs wide apart his hands buried in the pockets of his trousers at the girls words which were accompanied by a provocative glance from her large dark eyes he merely shrugged his wide shoulders and jingled some money in his pockets  the girl laughed  money wont buy everything you know my good béla she said  it will buy most things he retorted  the consent of irma néni for instance she suggested  and a girls willingness to exchange the squalor of a mud hut for comfort luxury civilization  unlike most of the young men here tonight who wore the characteristic costume of the countrysidefull white linen shirt and trousers broad leather belt embossed and embroidered and high leather boots béla was dressed in a town suit of darkcoloured cloth cut by a provincial tailor from arad he was short of stature though broadshouldered and firmly knit but his face was singularly ugly owing to the terrible misfortune which had befallen him when he lost his left eye the scar and hollow which were now where the eye had once been gave the whole face a sinister expression which was further accentuated by the irregular line of the eyebrows and the sneer which habitually hovered round the full hard lips  béla was not good to look on and this is a serious defect in a young man in hungary but he was well endowed with other attributes which made him very attractive to the girls he had a fine and lucrative position seeing that he was his lordships bailiff and had an excellent salary a good house and piece of land of his own as well as the means of adding considerably to his income since his lordship left him to conclude many a bargain over corn and plums and horses and pigs erös béla was rich and influential he lived in a stonebuilt house which had a garden round it and at least five rooms inside with a separate kitchen and a separate livingroom therefore he was a very eligible young man and one greatly favoured by mothers of penniless girls nor did the latter look askance on béla despite the fact that he had only one eye and that never a pleasant word escaped his lips  even now he was looking on at the dancing with a heavy scowl upon his face the girl near himshe with the dark oriental eyes and the thin hooked nose klara goldstein the jewessgave him a nudge with her brown pointed elbow  i wouldnt let andor see the temper you are in my friend she said with a sarcastic little laugh we dont want any broken bones before the train goes off this morning  there will be broken bones if he does not look out muttered the other between his teeth as he drew a tightly clenched fist from his pocket  bah why should you care retorted klara who seemed to take an impish delight in teasing the young man you are not in love with elsa are you  what is it to you growled béla surlily  nothing she replied only that we have always been friends you and ieh béla  and she turned her large lustrous eyes upon him peering at him through her long black lashes she was a handsome girl of course and she knew itknew how to use her eyes and make the men forget that she was only a jewess a thing to be played with but despisedno better than a gipsy wench not for a hungarian peasant to look upon as an equal to think of as a possible mate  béla whose blood was hot in him what with the wine which he had drunk and the jealous temper which was raging in his brain was nevertheless sober enough not to meet the languorous glances which the handsome jewess bestowed so freely upon him  we are still friendsare we not béla she reiterated slowly  of coursewhy not he grunted what has our friendship to do with andor and elsa  only this that i dont like to see a friend of mine make a fool of himself over a girl who does not care one hairpin for him  béla smothered a curse  how do you know that he asked  everyone knows that elsa is over head and ears in love with andor and just wont look at anyone else  oho he sneered everyone knows that do they well you can tell that busybody everyone from me that before the year is out kapus elsa will be tokened to me and that when andor comes back from having marched and drilled and paced the barrackyard he will find that kapus elsa is kapus no longer but erös the wife of erös béla the mother of his firstborn to this i have made up my mind and when i make up my mind to anything neither god nor the devil dares to stand in my way  hush hush in heavens name she protested quickly the neighbours will hear you  he shrugged his shoulders and murmured something very uncomplimentary anent the ultimate destination of those neighbours  some of them certainly had heard what he said for he had not been at pains to lower his voice his riches and his position had made him something of an oracle in marosfalva and he held all the peasantry in such contempt that he cared little what everyone thought of him he therefore remained indifferent and sulky now whilst many glances of goodhumoured mockery were levelled upon him  no one of course thought any the worse of erös béla for desiring the beauty of the village for himselfhe was rich and could marry whom he pleased and that he should loudly and openly proclaim his determination to possess himself of the beautiful prize was only in accordance with the impulsive hotheaded somewhat bombastic temperament of the magyars themselves  fortunately those chiefly concerned in erös bélas loudly spoken determination had heard nothing of the colloquy between him and the jewess the wild loud music of the csárdás their own gyrations and excitement shut them out entirely from their surroundings  their stamping tripping twirling feet had carried them into another world altogether ignácz goldsteins barn had become a fairy bower they themselves were spirits living in that realm of bliss there was no longer any impending separation no military service no blank and desolate three years andor his arm tightly clasped round elsas waist his head bowed till his lips touched her bare shoulder contrived to whisper magic words in her ear  magic wordssimple commonplace words spoken by myriads of men before and since into myriads of willing ears in every tongue this earth hath ever known but to elsa it seemed as if the magyar tongue had never before sounded so exquisite to her the words were magic because they wrought a miracle in her she had been a girla child ere those words were spoken she liked andor she liked her father and her mother little emma over the way mari néni who was always kind she had loved them all been pleased when she saw them glad to give them an affectionate kiss  but now since that last csárdás had begun a strange and mysterious current had gone from andors arm right through her heart something had happened which caused her cheeks to glow with a fire other than that produced by the heat of the dance and made her own hands tremble when they rested on andors shoulder and there was that in his look which made her eyes burn and fill with tears  you are beautiful elsa i love you  she could not answer him of course how could she when she felt that her throat was choked with sobs yet she felt so happy so happy that never since the day of her first communion when pater bonifácius had blessed her and assured her that her soul was as white as that of an angelnever since then had she known such perfect such absolute happiness she could not speak she almost thought once that she was going to faint so strange was the thrill of joy which went right through her when andors lips rested for one brief sweet moment upon her shoulder   and now the lights are burning low the gipsies scrape their fiddles with a kind of wild enthusiasm which pervades them just as much as the dancers round and round in a mad twirl now the men hold the girls with both hands by the waist the girls put a hand on each of their partners shoulders thus they spin round and round petticoats flying booted feet stamping the ground  the young faces are all hot and streaming quick breaths come in short panting gasps from these young chests the spectators join in the excitement the men stamp and clap their heels to the rhythm of the dance the women beat their hands one against the other to that same wild syncopated measure old men grasp middleaged women round the waist smiling selfdeprecatingly they too begin to tread hej tis not so long ago we were young too and that wild hungarian csárdás fires the blood until it glows afresh  everyone moves every body sways it is impossible to keep quite still while that intoxicating rhythm fills the air  only klara the jewess stands by stolid and immovable the magyar blood is not in her hers is the languorous oriental blood the supple sinuous movements of the levant she watches this bacchanalian whirligig with a sneer upon her thin red lips beside her erös béla too is still the scowl has darkened on his face his one eye leers across the group of twirling dancers to that one couple close to the musicians platform  in the noise that goes on around him he cannot of course hear the words which andor speaks but he sees the movements of the young mans lips and the blush which deepens over elsas face that one eye of his keener than any pair of eyes has seen the furtive kiss quick and glowing which grazed the girls bare shoulder and noted the quiver which went right through the young slender body and the look that shot through the quicklyveiled blue eyes  he was only a peasant a rough son of the soil whose temperament was hot with passion and whose temper had never known a curb he had never realized until this moment how beautiful elsa was and how madly he loved her for he called the jealous rage within by the sacred name of love and love to a magyar peasant is his whole existence the pivot round which he frames his life his thoughts of the present his dreams of the future  the soil and the womanthey are his passions his desires his religionto own a bit of landof hungarian landand the woman whom he loves those two possessions will satisfy himbeyond these there is nothing worth havinga plough of coursea hut wherein to sleepan ox or two perhapsa cowa horse  but the soil and the woman on whom he has fixed his lovewell call it love    he certainly calls it sothose two possessions make the hungarian peasant more contented than any king or millionaire of western civilization  erös béla had the land his father left him a dozen kataszter land measure about two and threequarter acres or so elsa was the woman whom he loved and the only question was whohe or andorwould be strong enough to gain the object of his desire     chapter iii  you will wait for me   but now it is all over the final bar of the csárdás has been played the last measure trodden from the railway station far away the sharp clang of a bell has announced the doleful fact that in half an hour the train will start for arad thence to brassó where the recruits will be enrolled ticketed docketed like so many heads of cattlemostly unwillingmade to do service for their country  in half an hour the train starts and there is so much still to say that has been left unsaid so many kisses to exchange so many promises protestations oaths  the mothers fearful and fussy look for their sons in among the crowd like hens in search of their chicks their wizened faces are hard and wrinkled like winter apples they carry huge baskets on their arms overfilled with the last delicacies which their fond toilworn hands will prepare for the beloved son for the next three yearsa piece of smoked bacon a loaf of rye bread a cake of maizeflour  the lads themselvesexcited after the dance and not quite as clearheaded as they were before that last cask of hungarian wine was tapped in ignácz goldsteins cellarfeel the intoxication of the departure now the quick goodbyes the womens tears a latent spirit of adventure smothers their sorrow at leaving home  the gipsies have struck up a melancholy magyar folksong the crowd breaks up in isolated groups mothers and fathers with their sons whisper in the dark corners of the barn the father who did his service thirty years ago gives sundry good adviceno rebellion quiet obedience no use complaining or grumbling the three years are quickly over the mother begs her darling not to give way to drink and not to get entangled with one of the hussies in the towns women and wine the two besetting temptations that assail the magyar peasantlet the darling boy resist both for his sorrowing mothers sake  but the lad only listens with half an ear his dark eyes roam around the barn in search of the sweetheart he wants one more protestation of love from her lips one final oath of fidelity  andor has neither father to admonish him nor mother to pray over him the rich uncle lakatos pál with whom he has lived hitherto does not care enough about him to hang weeping round his neck  and elsa has given her father and mother the slip and joined andor outside the barn  her blue eyestired after fifteen hours of pleasureblink in the glare of the brilliant sun andor puts his arm round her waist and she closing her aching eyes allows him to lead her away  and now they are wandering down the great dusty high road beneath the sparse shade of the stunted acacias that border it they feel neither heat nor dust and say but little as they walk from behind them muffled by louder sounds come the sweet sad strains of the magyar lovesong csak egy kis lány van a világon      there is but one girl in all the world     and she is my own white dove     oh how great must gods love be for me     that he thought of giving you to me  elsa you will wait for me asked andor with deep passionate anxiety at last  i will wait for you andor replied the girl simply if the good god will give me the strength  the strength elsa will be in yourself he urged if only you love me as i love you  three years is such a long time she sighed  i will count the weeks that separate us elsathe daysthe hours  i too will be counting them  when i come back i will at once talk with pali bácsihe is getting tired of managing his propertyi know that at times lately he has felt that he needed a rest and that he means to ask me to see to everything for him he will give me that nice little house on the fekete road and the mill to look after we can get married at once elsawhen i come back  he talked on somewhat ramblingly at times incoherently it was easy to see that he was trying to cheat sorrow to appear cheerful and hopeful because he saw that elsa was quite ready to give way to tears it was so hard to walk out of fairyland just when she had entered it and found it more beautiful than anything else in life the paths looked so smooth and so inviting and fairy forms beckoned to her from afar it all would have been so easy if only the good god had willed it so she thought of the many sins whichin her innocent lifeshe had committed and for which pater bonifácius had given her absolution perhaps if she had been betterbeen more affectionate with her mother more forbearing with her father the good god would have allowed her to have this happiness in full which now appeared so shadowy  she fell to wishing that andor had not been quite so fine and quite so strong that his chest had been narrower or his eyesight less keen womanlike she felt that she would have loved him just as much and more if he were less vigorous less powerful and in that case the wicked government would not want him he could stay at home and help pali bácsi to look after his lands and his mills and she could marry him before the spring  then the pressure of his arm round her waist recalled her to herself she turned and met his glowing compelling eyes she felt that wonderful vitality in him which made him what he was strong in body and strong in soul his love was strong because his body was strong as was his soul his spirit and his limbs and she no longer wished him to be weak and delicate for then it would no longer be andorthe andor whom she loved  the clang of the distant bell chased away elsas last hovering dreams andor did not hear it he was pressing the girl closer and closer to him unmindful of his surroundings unmindful that he was on the high road and that frequently oxcarts went by laden with people and that passersby were hurrying now toward the railway station  true that no one took any notice of this young man and maid everyone was either too much absorbed in the business of the morning or too much accustomed to these final scenes of farewell and tenderness ere the lads went off for their three years service to throw more than a cursory glance on these two  i love you elsa my dove my rose andor reiterated over and over again you will wait for my return will you not  i will wait andor replied the girl through her sobs  the thought of you will lighten my nights and bring sunshine to my dreary days every morning and every evening when i say my prayers i shall ask my guardian angel to fly over to yours and to tell him to whisper in your ear that i love you beyond all else on earth  we must part now andor she said earnestly the second bell has gone long ago  not yet elsa not yet he pleaded just walk as far as that next acacia tree there no one will see us and i want one more kiss before i go  she never thought to resist him since her own heart was at one with his wish and he was going away so soon and for so long so they walked as far as the next acacia tree and there he took her in his arms and kissed her on the cheeks the eyes the lips  god alone knows elsa he said and now his own voice was choked with sobs what it means to me to leave you you are the one woman in the world for me and i will thank the good god on my knees every day of my life for the priceless blessing of your love  after that they walked back hand in hand they had wandered far and in a quarter of an hour the train would be starting it meant a week in prison in arad for any recruit to miss the train and andor did mean to be brave and straight and to avoid prison during the three years  the gipsy musicians had carried their instruments over to the railway station here they had ensconced themselves in full view of the train and were playing one after the other the favourite songs of those who were going away  when andor and elsa reached the station the crowd in and around it was dense noisy and full of animation and colour a large batch of recruits who had come by the same train from more distant villages had alighted at marosfalva and joined in the bustle and the singing they had got over the pang of departure from home half an hour or an hour ago they had already left the weeping mothers and sweethearts behind so now they set to with a will in true hungarian fashion to drown regrets and stifle unmanly tears by singing their favourite songs at the top of their rough voices and ogling those girls of marosfalva who happened to be unattached  the captain in command with his lieutenant was pacing up and down the station platform he now gave a command to a couple of sergeants and the entraining began helterskelter now for it was no use losing a good seat whilst indulging in a final kiss or tear there was a general stampede for the carriages and trucks the recruits on ahead behind them the trail of women the mothers with their dark handkerchiefs tied round their heads the girls with pale tearstained faces their petticoats of many colours swinging round their shapely hips as they run the fathers the brothers  here comes pater bonifácius who has finished saying his mass just in time to see the last of his lads he has tucked his soutane well up under his sash and he is running across the platform his rubicund kindly face streaming with excitement  pater pater here  a score of voices cry to him from different carriages and he hurries on grasping each rough hot hand as it is extended out to him  bless you my children he cries and the large red cotton handkerchief wanders surreptitiously from his nose to his eyes bless you and keep you  be good lads he admonishes earnestly remember your confession and the holy sacraments no drinking  oh pater comes in protesting accents all around him  well not more than is good for you abstinence on fridaysa regular confession and holy communion and holy mass on sundays will help to keep you straight before the good god  theres the last bell clang clang in two minutes comes the horn and then we are off the gipsies are playing the saddest of sad songs it seems as if ones heartstrings were being wrenched out of ones body  there is but one girl in all the world  for each lad only one girland she is there at the foot of the carriagesteps a corner of her ribbon or handkerchief or cotton petticoat stuffed into her mouth to keep her from bursting into sobs the mothers now are dryeyed and silent they look with dull unseeing gaze on this railway train the engine the carriages which will take their lads away from them many have climbed up on the steps of the carriages hanging on to the handrails so as to be near the lads as long as possible their position is a perilous one the sergeants as well as the railway officials have to take hold of them by the waist and to drag them forcibly down to the ground before they will give way  it is the mothers who are the most obstinate they cling to the handrails to the steps even to the wheelsthere will be a fearful accident if they are not driven off by force and they will yield only to force guards and porters take hold of them by the waist and drag them away from their perilous positions  they fight with stolid obstinacy they will hang on to the trainthey are the mothers you seeand yet from where they are they cannot always see their sons herded in with forty or fifty other lads in a truck some standing some squatting on the ground or on the provision baskets but if you cannot see your son it is always something to be on the step of the train which is about to take him away  the lads are all singing now at the top of their voices but down below on the platforms there is but little noise the mothers do not speak because they are fighting for places on the steps of the railwaycarriages where the boys are they press their lips tightly together and when a guard or a porter comes to drag them away they just hit out with their elbowsstolidly silently  the fathers and the other older men stand about in groups leaning on their sticks talking in whispers recounting former experiences of entraining or recruiting of those abominable three years and the young girlsthe sweethearts the sisters the friendsdare not speak for fear they should break down and help to unman the lads  andor by dint of fighting and obstinacy has kept his place in the door of one of the carriages he sits on the floor with his feet down on the step below and refuses to quit his position for anyone several lads from the rear have tried to throw him out or to drag him in but andor is mightily strongyou cannot move him if he be not so minded  elsa sitting on the step lower down is resting her elbow on his knee there is no thought of hiding their love for one another let the whole village know it or the whole countryside they do not care they are not going to deprive themselves of these last few minutesthese heavenborn seconds whilst their hands can still meet their eyes can speak the words which their lips no longer dare frame  i love you  you will wait for me  in those few words lies all the consolation for the present all the hope of the future with these words engraved upon heart and memory they can afford to look more serenely upon these blank and dreary three years  it was as well to have spoken them as well to have actually put into words what they had already known in their hearts long ago now they can afford to wait and andor will do it with confidence he is a man and he is free he viewed the future as a master views his slave the future is his to do with what he likes to mould to shape in accordance with his will  the land which must one day be his and elsa his already andor almost fell to wishing that the train would start quicklyso many seconds would have been lived of those three intervening years  elsa tries to look as full of hope as he does she is only a woman and the future is not hers to make at will she is not the conqueror the lord and king of her own destiny there are so many difficulties in the path of her life which she would like to forget at this moment so as not to embitter the happiness which has come to her there is her shiftless mother and vagabond father there is the pressure of poverty and filial dutyit is easy for andorhe is a man  you will wait for me elsa andor asks for the twentieth time and for the twentieth time her lips murmur an assent even though her heart is heavy with foreboding  there goes the horn  elsa my love one more kiss cries andor as he presses her closely ever more closely to his heart god bless you my rose you will wait for me  the engine gives a shrill whistle all the men nowrealizing the dangerdrag their womenfolk away from the slowlyrevolving wheels the gipsy musicians strike up the first spirited bars of the rákóczy march as with much puffing and ponderous creakings and groanings the heavilyladen train with its human freight steams away from the little station  my son my son  benkó my son  jános  endre  a few heartrending cries as each revolution of the wheels takes the lads a little further away from their homes  elsa you will wait for me comes as a final appealing cry from andor  he stands in the door of the carriage which he holds wide open and through a mist of tears which he no longer tries to suppress he sees elsa standing there quite stilla small image of beauty and of sorrow the sun glints upon her hair it shines and sparkles like living gold her hands are clasped tightly together and with her full manyhued petticoats round her slim waist and tiny redshod feet she looks like a flower  the crowd below moves alongside of the trainfor the first minute or so they all keep up with it close to the carriage at the door of which can still be seen the head of son or brother or sweetheart but now the engine puts on more speed the wheels revolve more quicklysome of the crowd fall away unable to run so fast  only the mothers try to keep upthe old women some of them barefooted stolid looking straight before themhardly looking at the train just running    alongside the train first of all then they must needs fall backbut still they run along the metals even though the train moves away so quickly now that soon even a mother could not distinguish her sons head like a black pinpoint leaning out of the carriage window  so they runone or two women run thus for over a kilomètre they run long after the train has disappeared from view  but elsa stood quite still she did not try to run after the train  through the noise of the puffing engine the final cries of farewell through all the noise and the bustle andors cry rose above all his final appeal to her to be true  elsa you will wait for me     chapter iv  now that he is dead   stranger if you should ever be driving on the main road between szeged and arad tell your driver to pull up at the village of marosfalva its one broad street runs inland at right angles from the road you will then have on your right two or three bits of meadowland overshadowed by willow trees which slope down to the maros beyond the maros lies the great plainthe fields of maize and pumpkin of hemp and sunflower and who knows what lies beyond the fields  but on your left will be the village of marosfalva with the wayside inn and public bar kept by ignácz goldstein standing prominently at the corner immediately facing you two pollarded acacias are planted near the door of the inn above the lintel of which a painted board scribbled over with irregular lettering invites the traveller to enter a wooden verandah with tumbledown roof and wormeaten supporting beams runs along two sides of the house and from the roof hang a number of gailycoloured and decorated earthenware pots and jars  the open space in front of the inn and the whole of the length of the one street of marosfalva are very dusty and dry in the summer in the autumn and spring they are a sea and river of mud and in the winter the snow hides the deep frozen crevasses but place and street are as god made them and it is not mans place to interfere to begin with the cattle and geese and pigs must all pass this way on their way to the water so of course it is impossible to do anything with the ground even if one were so minded  the inn is the only house in marosfalva which boldly faces the street all the others seem to be looking at it over their shoulders the front of one house facing the back of its neighbour with a bit of garden or yard between and so on the whole kilomètre length of the street  but each house has its wooden verandah which shields the living rooms against the glare of the sun in summer and shelters them from snow and rain in winter these wooden verandahs are in a greater or lesser state of repair and smartness and under the roof of every verandah hang rows of the same quaintlydecorated and picturesque earthenware jars  round every house too there are groups of gay sunflowers and of dull green hemp and the roofs thatched with maizestalks are ornamented along the top with wooden carvings which stand out clear and fantastic against the intense blue of the sky  then stranger if you should alight at the top of the street and did wander slowly down its dusty length you will presently see it widen out just in front of the church it stands well there doesnt itat one end of this open place with its flat whitewashed façade and towerredroofed and crowned with a metal cross that glints in the sunthe whole building so like in shape to a large white hen with head erect and crimson comb and wings spread out flat to the ground  the presbytery is close byyou cannot miss it it is a onestoried house with a row of greenshuttered windows along the front and at the side a low gate which leads to a small garden at the back and over which appears a vista of brilliant perennials and a stiff row of purple asters  there is the tiny schoolhouse too which in the late summer is made very gay in front with vividly coloured dahliasan orgy of yellow and brickred of magenta and orange  if your driver has come along with you down the street he will point out to you the house of barna jenömayor of the commune of marosfalvaa personage of vast consideration in the villagea consideration which he shares with hóhér aladár who is the village justice of the peace and with erös béla who is my lord the counts bailiff  then lower down beyond the church is the big barn belonging to ignácz goldstein where on special occasions as well as on fine sunday afternoons the young folk meet for their simplehearted innocent amusementsfor their dancing their singing and their courtships and further on still are the houses of the poorer peasantsof men like kapus benkó who has never saved a fillér and until lately when he was stricken down with illness had to work as a day labourer for wage instead of owning a bit of land of his own and planting it up for his own enjoyment here the houses are much smaller and squalidlooking they have no verandahsonly a narrow door and tiny diminutive windows which are not made to open and shut the pieces of ground around them are also planted like the others with hemp and with sunflowers but even these look less majestic less prosperous than those which surround the houses higher up the streets their brown heads are smaller more sparsely laden with the good oilbearing seeds and the stems of the hemp do not look as if they ever would make a thatch  the street itself is wide and a regular heattrap in summer in the autumn and the spring it is ankledeep in mud and of course in the winter it is buried in snow but in the late summer it is at its best one or two heavy showers of rain have laid the dust and the sunflowers and dahlias round the little schoolhouse and by the presbytery are very gaysuch a note of crude and vivid colour which even puts the decorated jars to shame  also the sun has lost some of its unbearable heat after four oclock in the afternoon it is pleasant to sit or stand outside ones house for a bit of gossip with a neighbour the brownlegged blackeyed children coolly clad in loose white shifts barefooted and bareheaded can play outside now the little girls with brightcoloured kerchiefs tied round their heads and pink or blue petticoats round their waists vie with the dahlias in hue  on sunday afternoons it is cool enough to dance in ignácz goldsteins barn the black day in the calendarthe fourteenth of septemberhas come and gone and the lads have gone with it except for the weeping mothers and sweethearts the ordinary village life has resumed its peaceful course but then there are every year a few weeping mothers and sweethearts in marosfalva or kender or görcz just as there is everywhere else the lads have to go and do their military service as soon as they come of age  and then others come back about this time those who have completed their three years and they must be made welcome with dancing and musicthe things which a hungarian peasant loves best in all the world  and as the days are still long and the evenings warm there are the strolls handinhand arminarmafter the dancingup the village street as far as the slowlyflowing maros one or two of the lads who have come home after three years have found their sweethearts waiting for thembut only one or two three years is a long long time girls cannot afford to wait for husbands while their youth and good looks fly away so quickly and the lads too are fickle some of them have apparently forgotten amongst the more showy more lively beauties of garrison towns the doeeyed girl to whom they had promised faith they are ready as soon as they come back for new courtships fresh lovemaking another girlwith blue eyes this time and fair hair instead of brown  then of course there are those who never will come back that awful mysterious place called bosnia has swallowed them up there was fighting it seems in bosnia and many were killed two lads from marosfalva one from fekete and two from kender  bosnia must belong to the crown of hungarywhatever that may meanthe politicians say so anyhow and in order that the crown of hungary should have what rightly belongs to it the lads from our villages have to fight and get killed  is that just i ask you so the mothers argue  the sweethearts weep for awhile and then cast about for fresh fish out of the waters of life sometimes there are mistakes lads who have been reported killed turn up at the village on the appointed day either hale and hearty or maimed and crippled in either case they are welcome but at times the mistake is the other way no black report has come the mothers the fathers the sweethearts expect the young soldier homehe does not come the others return on a given daythey arrive by trainlaczi or benkó or pál is not amongst them where is he well they were not all in the same regiment they have seen little or nothing of one another during these three years  the anxious mothers rush to barna jenöthe mayorand he drafts a letter of inquiry which is duly sent off to the proper authorities at budapest in the course of timenot very promptlythe reply comes a letter of condolence curtly worded the name of laczi or benkó or pál as the case may be was inadvertently omitted from the list of killed after the skirmish near banialuka  sometimes also the young soldier having received his discharge does not care to return to his native village he has lost his taste for pigs and geese for digging and sowing he has had a glimpse of life and wants to see some more the emigration agents at budapest are active and persuasive america is a land of gold they say no further trouble but to stoop and pick up the gold just where it lies  and the lad listens and ponders he will not go home for he is afraid that his mothers tears will deter him from his purpose he follows the advice of the emigration agent expends his last fillér sells his spare shirt and takes passage at fiume on a big ship which conveys him to the land of riches  oh those lads who go away like that come back sure enough broken in health and spirits dying of that relentless and mysterious disease called homesickness they drift back after a few years to their villages having amassed a little money perhaps but having lost that vitality that love of life and of enjoyment which is the characteristic of these sons of hungarythe land of warmth and of sunshine of generous wines and luscious corn  and erös béla walking arminarm with kapus elsa on that warm sunday afternoon had talked much of andor and of his untoward fate  the two young people had met outside the church after benediction they had strolled down as far as the maros and back again into the village  the warm late september sunshine shed a golden glow upon the thatched roofs of the cottages and made every brightcoloured pot that hung under the verandahs gleam with manyhued and dazzling reflections it touched the red roof of the little church with an additional coat of glittering crimson and caused the metal cross upon the spire to throw out vivid sparks of light  the festive air of a sunday afternoon hung upon the village street men and maids walked by arminarm the girls in their finery with cotton petticoats swinging out and highheeled boots clinking as they walked the men with round felt hats tilted rakishly over one eye their bronzed faces suffused in smiles the song never for long absent from their lips  from the top of the street a flock of geese in charge of a diminutive maiden of ten was slowly waddling down toward the stream shaking their grey and white feathers under the hot kiss of the sun and behind them in slow majesty a herd of cows and oxensnowwhite with graceful tall horns lyreshaped and slenderambled lazily along  elsa and béla had paused outside the house of hóhér aladárwho was the village justice of the peace and husband to ilona bélas only sister  a mightily rich man was hóhér aladár and ilona was noted for being the most thrifty housewife in a country where most housewives are thrifty and for being a model cook in a land where good cooks abound  her house was a pattern of orderliness and cleanliness always immaculately whitewashed outside and the little shutters painted a vivid green it literally shone with dazzling brightness on these hot summer afternoons the woodwork of the verandah was elaborately carved the pots that hung from the roof had not a chip or crack in them  no wonder that erös béla was proud of these housewifely qualities in his only sister and that he loved to make a display of them before his fiancée whose own mother was so sadly lacking in them  now he pushed open the front door and stood aside to allow elsa to enter and as she did so the sweet scent of rosemary and lavender greeted her nostrils she looked round her with unfeigned appreciation and a little sighhardly of envy but wholly wistfulescaped her lips the room was small and raftered and low but little light came through the two small windows built one on each side of the front door but even in the dim light the furniture shone with polish and the wooden floor bore every sign of persistent and vigorous scrubbing there was a cloth of coloured linen upon the centre table beautifully woven in a chessboard pattern of red and blue by ilonas deft hands the pewter and copper cooking utensils on and about the huge earthenware stove were resplendently bright and the carved oak dowerchestwith open liddisplayed a dazzling wealth of snowwhite linenhandwoven and handembroideredtowels sheets pillowcases all lying in beautiful bundles neatly tied with red ribbons and bows  again elsa sighedin that quaint wistful little way of hers if her mother had been as thrifty and as orderly as ilona then mayhap her own marriage with erös béla need never have come about she could have mourned for andor quietly by herself and the necessity of a wealthy soninlaw would probably never have presented itself before her mothers mind  but now she followed ilona into the best bedroom the sanctum sanctorum of every hungarian peasant homethe room that bears most distinctly the impress of the housewifely character that presides over it and as elsa stood upon the threshold of her future sisterinlaws precious domain she forgot her momentary sadness in the hope of a brighter future when she too would make her new home orderly and sweetscented with beautifullypolished furniture and floors radiant with cleanliness the thought of what her own best bedroom would be like delighted her fancy it was a lovely room for bélas house was larger by far than his sisters the rooms were wider and more lofty and the windows had large clear panes of glass in them she would have two beautiful bedsteads in the room and the bedspreads would be piled up to the ceiling with down pillows and duvets covered in scarlet twill she would have two beautiful spreads of crochetwork a washstand with marble top and white crockery and there would be a stencilling of rose garlands on the colourwashed walls  so now her habitual little sigh was not quite so wistful as it had been before the future need not after all be quite so black as she sometimes feared and surely the good god would be kind to her in her married life seeing that she obeyed his commandment and honoured her mother by doing what her mother wished  ilona in the best bedroom was busy as usual with duster and brush she did not altogether approve of bélas choice of a wife and her greetings of elsa were always of a lukewarm character and were usually accompanied by lengthy lectures on housewifery and the general management of a kitchen  elsa always listened deferentially to these lectures with eyes downcast and an attitude of meekness but in her own heart she was thankful that her future home would lie some distance out of the village and that ilona would probably have but little time to walk out there very often  in the meanwhile however she hated these sunday afternoon visits with their attendant homilies from ilona first then from aladárwho was selfimportant and dictatorial and finally from béla who was invariably disagreeable and sarcastic whenever he saw his sister and his fiancée together  fortunately today béla had said that she need not stay more than a few minutes  well just pay our respects to ilona and aladár he had said pompously and take another walk before the sun goes down  and elsataking him at his wordhad made but a meteoric appearance in her future sisterinlaws cottagea hasty greeting a brief peck on ilonas two cheeks and one on aladárs bristly face then the inevitable homily and as soon as ilona paused in the latter in order to draw breath elsa gave her another peck by way of farewell explained hastily that her mother was waiting for her and fled incontinently from the rigid atmosphere of the best bedroom  béla and his brotherinlaw had started on politics and it took a little time before elsa succeeded in persuading him to have that nice walk with her before the sun went down but now they were out again in the sunshine at last and elsa was once more able to breathe freely and with an infinity of relief  i wonder said béla dryly if you are really taking in all the good advice which ilona so kindly gives you from time to time you cant do better than model yourself on her she is a pattern wife and makes aladár perfectly happy i wonder he reiterated with something of a sneer if you will learn from her or if your mothers influence will remain with you for ever  then as with her accustomed gentleness she chose to remain silent rather than resent his sneer he added curtly  if you want to make me happy and comfortable you will follow ilonas advice in all things  i will do my best béla she said quietly  then for some reason which the young man himself could not perhaps have explained he once more started talking about andor  it was very hard on him he said with a shrug of his wide shoulders to die just when he was on the point of getting his discharge  and after an almost imperceptible moment of hesitation he added with studied indifference of course all that talk of his being still alive is sheer nonsense i have done everything that lay in my power to find out if there was the slightest foundation for the rumour but now ilike all sensible peopleam satisfied that andor is really dead  elsa was walking beside him her hand resting lightly on his arm as was fitting for a girl who was tokened and would be a bride within the week she walked with head bent her eyes fixed upon the ground she made no immediate reply to her fiances selfsatisfied peroration and her silence appeared to annoy him for he continued with some acerbity  dont you care to hear what i did on andors behalf  indeed i do béla she said gently it was good of you to worry about himand you so busy already  i did what i could he rejoined mollified old lakatos pál has hankered after him so though he cared little enough about andor at one time andor was his only brothers only child and i suppose pali bácsi3 was suddenly struck with the idea that he really had no one to leave his hoardings to he was always a fool and a lout if andor had lived it would have been all right i think pali bácsi was quite ready to do something really handsome for him now that andor is dead he has no one and when he dies his money all goes to the government it is a pity he added with a shrug of the shoulders if a peasant of marosfalva had it it would do good to the commune  footnote 3 see footnote on p 22  i am sure if andor had lived to enjoy it he would have spent it freely and done good with it to everyone around she said quietly  he would have spent it freely right enough he retorted dryly but whether he would have done good to everyone around with iti doubt me    to ignácz goldstein perhaps     béla you must not say that she broke in firmly you know that andor never was a drunkard  i never suggested that he was retorted béla whose square hard face had become a shade paler than before so there is no reason for my future wife to champion him quite so hotly as you always do  i only spoke the truth  if someone else spoke of me a hundred times more disparagingly than i ever do of andor would you defend me as warmly i wonder as you do him  dont let us quarrel about andor she rejoined gently it does not seem right now that he is dead     chapter v  love will follow   they had reached the small cottage where old kapus and his wife and elsa lived it stood at the furthest end of the village away from the main road and the cool meadows beside the maros away from the church and the barn and all the brightest spots of marosfalva built of laths and mud it had long ago quarrelled with the whitewash which had originally covered it and had forcibly ejected it showing deep gaps and fissures in its walls the pots and jars which hung from the overhanging thatch were all discoloured and broken and the hemp which hung in bundles beside them looked uneven and dark in colour obviously beaten with a slipshod careless hand  such a contrast to the house of hóhér aladárthe rich justice of the peace and of ilona his wife elsa knew and expected that the usual homily on the subject would not fail to be forthcoming as it did on every sunday afternoon she only wondered what particular form it would take today whether béla would sneer at her and her mother for the tumbledown look of the verandah for the bad state of the hemp or the coating of dirt upon the earthenware pots  but it was the hemp today  why dont you look after it elsa said béla roughly as he pointed to the tangled mass of stuff above him your mother ruins even the sparse crop which she has  i cant do everything said elsa in that same gentle even voice which held in its tones all the gamut of hopeless discouragement since father has been stricken he wants constant attention mother wont give it him so i have to be at his beck and call then there is the washing     i know i know broke in béla with a sneer you need not always remind me that my future wifethe bride of my lord the counts own bailiffdoes menial work for a village schoolmistress and a snuffy old priest  elsa made no reply she pushed open the door of the cottage and went in béla followed her muttering between his teeth  the interior of kapus benkós home was as squalid as forlorn looking as its approach everywhere the hand of the thriftless housewife was painfully apparent in the blackened crockery upon the hearth in the dull grimy look of the furnitureonce so highly polishedin the tattered tablecloth the stains upon the floor and the walls but above all was it apparent in the dowerchestthat inalienable pride of every thrifty hungarian housewifethe dowerchest which in ilonas cottage was such a marvel of polish outside and so glittering in its rich contents of exquisite linen but here it bore relentless if mute testimony to the shiftless untidy disorderly ways of the kapus household for instead of the neat piles of snowwhite linen it was filled with rubbishwith husks of maize and mouldy cabbagestalks thrown in higgledypiggledy with bundles of clothes and rags of every sort and kind  it stood close to the stove the smoke of which had long ago covered the wood with soot the lid was thrown open and hung crooked upon a broken hinge  when elsa entered the cottage with erös béla her mother was busy with some cooking near the hearth and smoke and the odour of gulyás meat stew filled the place close to the fire in an armchair of polished wood sat old kapus benkó now a hopeless cripple the fate which lies in wait in these hot countries for the dissolute and the drunkard had already overtaken him he had had a stroke a couple of years ago and then another last summer now he could not move hand or foot his tongue refused him service he could only see and hear and eat otherwise he was like a log carried from his palliasse on which he slept at night to the armchair in which he sat all day elsas strong young arms carried him thus backwards and forwards she ministered to him nursed him did what cheering she could to brighten his days that were an almost perpetual night  at sight of elsa his wrinkled face which was so like that of a corpse brightened visibly she ran to him and said something in his ear which caused his dulled eyes to gleam with momentary pleasure  what did you bring béla home with you for said the mother ungraciously speaking to her daughter and rudely ignoring the young man who had thrown his hat down and drawn one of the chairs close to the table at kapus irmas inhospitable words he merely laughed and shrugged his shoulders  well irma néni he said this is the last sunday anyhow that you will be troubled with my presence after wednesday as i shall have elsa in my own home i shall not need to come and visit here  no retorted irma with a snap of her lean jaws you will take good care to alienate her from her duty to her father and to her mother wont you  then in answer to a further sneer from him she added more viciously you will teach her to be purseproud like yourselfvain and disdainful of her old home  bélas one eyeunder the distorted browwandered with a sullen expression of contempt over every individual piece of furniture in the room  its not a home to be proud of anyway he said dryly is it irma néni  you chose your future wife out of it retorted irma and tis from here that you will have to fetch her on wednesday my friend  she was always ready to quarrel with béla whose sneering ways she resented all the more that she knew they were welldeserved but her last words had apparently poured oil over the already troubled waters of the young mans wrath for now his sullen expression vanished and a light of satisfaction and of pride lit up his ungainly face  and i will fetch my future wife in a style befitting her new position you may be sure of that he said and brought his clenched fist down upon the table with a crash so that pots and pans rattled upon the hearth and started the paralytic from his torpor  then he threw his head back and began to talk still more arrogantly and defiantly than he had done hitherto  fortyeight oxen he said shall fetch her in six carts aye even though she has not one stick of furniture wherewith to endow her future husband fortyeight oxen i tell you irma néni never has there been such a procession seen in marosfalva but erös béla is the richest man in the commune he added with an aggressive laugh and dont you forget it  but the allusion to elsas poverty and his own riches had exasperated the old woman  with all your riches she retorted in her turn with a sneer you had to court elsa for many years before she accepted you  and probably she would not have accepted me at all if you had not bullied and worried her and ordered her to say yes to me he rejoined dryly  children must obey their parents she said it is the law of god  a law which you for one apply to your own advantage eh irma néni  have you any cause for complaint  oh no elsas obedience has served me well and though i dare say he added suddenly casting a sullen look upon the young girl she has not much love for me now she will do her duty by me as my wife and love will follow in the natural course of things  elsa had taken no part in this wordy warfare between her mother and her future husband it seemed almost as if she had not heard a word of it no doubt her ears were trained by now no longer to heed these squabbles she had drawn a low stool close to the invalids chair and sitting near him with her hand resting on his knee she was whispering and talking animatedly to him telling him all the gossip of the village recounting to him every small event of the afternoon and of the morning pater bonifácius sermon the behaviour of the choir boys patkós emmas new kerchief when the stock of gossip gave out she began to sing to him in a low sweet voice one of those innumerable folksongs so dear to every hungarian peasants heart  irma intercepted the look which béla cast upon his fiancée she too turned and looked at her daughter and seeing her there sitting at the feet of that miserable wreck of humanity whom she called father ministering to him for all the world like the angels around the dying saints a swift look of pity softened for a moment the mothers hard and pinched face  you cannot expect the girl to have much love for you now she said once more turning a vicious glance upon her future soninlaw your mode of courtship was not very tender you will admit  i dont believe in all that silly lovemaking he rejoined roughly it is good enough for the loutish peasants of the alföld lowlands they are sentimental and stupid an educated man does not make use of a lot of twaddle when he woos the woman of his choice  all men act very much in the same way when they are in love said irma sententiously but i dont believe that you are really in love with elsa  he shrugged his shoulders and laughed a short sarcastic almost cruel laugh  perhaps not he said but i want her for my wife all the same  only because she is the noted beauty of the countryside and because half the village wanted her  precisely he said with a sneer there was a good deal of bidding for elsa eh irma néni so you elected to give her to the highest bidder  you had been courting her longer than anybody rejoined irma who this time chose to ignore his taunt  and i would have won her sooneron my owneven without your help if it had not been for that accursed andor  well he is dead now anyway all doubts i suppose are at rest on that point  there are a few fools still left in the village who maintain that he will turn up some day  we all hope he will because of lakatos pál the poor man is fretting himself into his grave since he has realized that when he dies his money and land must all go to the government  he can sell his land and distribute his money while he lives retorted béla but you wont catch him doing thatthe old miser  cant anything more be doneabout andor i mean  of course not he said impatiently everything that could be done has been done its no use going on having rows by post with the war office about the proofs of a mans death who has been food for worms these past two years  well you know béla people here are not satisfied about those proofs i for one never held with those who would not believe in andors death there are plenty of folk in the villageand pater bonifácius is one of themwho swear that he will come home one of these daysperhaps when pali bácsi is dead and then he would find himself the richest man in the commune she added not without a point of malice richer even than you my good béla  hold your tongue you old fool broke in béla savagely as once more the sinister leer which hovered round his sightless eye was turned toward elsa  didnt i say that i for one never believed that rubbish retorted irma sullenly and havent i preached to her about it these past two years but you neednt be afraid she added as she turned once more to her stewingpot she didnt hear what i said when she talks or sings to her father you might shoot off a cannonshe wouldnt hear it you may say what you like just now béla shell not listen  oho said béla even as a curious expression of obstinacy not unmixed with cruelty crept into his colourless face you seem to forget irma néni that the rest of elsas life will have to be spent in listening to me well soon see about that  elsa he called peremptorily  then as indeed the girl appeared not to hear but went on softly crooning and singing to the helpless invalid like a mother to its babe the young man worked himself up into a passion of fury the veins in his pale forehead and temples swelled up visibly the glitter in his one eye became more cruel and more menacing finally he brought his clenched fist once more crashing down upon the table even while he rose to his feet as if to give fuller meaning to his future marital authority  elsa he shouted once more hoarsely elsa do you hear what i say     chapter vi  i dont wish to marry not yet   the girl thus roughly apostrophized turned slowly round she seemed neither hurt nor even surprised at the young mans exhibition of temper in her blue eyes there was a strange lookone which had lately been habitual to her but which neither her mother nor béla were able to interpret it was a look which conveyed the thought of resignation or indifference or both but also one which was peculiarly lifeless as of a soul who had touched the cold hand of despair  far be it from me to seek complexity in so simple a soul as was that of this young hungarian peasant girl elsa kapus had no thought of selfanalysis complicated sex and soul problems did not exist for her she would never have dreamed of searching the deepdown emotions of her heart and of dragging them out for her mind to scrutinize the morbid modern craze for intricate and composite emotions was not likely to reach an outoftheway hungarian village that slept peacefully on the banks of the sluggish maros cradled in the immensity of the plain  elsa had loved lakatos andorthe handsome ardent young lover whose impetuous courtship of her five years ago had carried her on the wings of icarus to a region so full of brightness and of sunlight that it was no wonder that the wingswhich had appeared godliketurned out to be ephemeral and brittle after all and that she was soon precipitated back and down into the ordinary sea of everyday life  elsa had never heard of icarus but she had felt herself soaring upwards on heavenly wings when andorhis lips touching her neckhad whispered with passionate ardour elsa i love you  she had never heard of icarus fall but she had experienced her own from the giddy heights of heavenly happiness down to the depths of dull aching despair the fall had been very gradualthere had been nothing grand or heroic or soulstirring about it andor had gone away having told her that he loved her and adjured her to wait for him she had waited for three years patiently quietly obstinately despite the many and varied sieges laid to her heart and her imagination by the inflammable eligible youth of the countryside elsa kapusthe farfamed beauty of half the county counted her suitors by the score patiently quietly obstinately she kept every suitor at bayeven though many were rich and some in high positionseven though her mother with the same patience the same quietude and the same obstinacy worked hard to break her daughters will  but andor was coming back andor had adjured her to wait for him and elsa was still youngjust sixteen when andor went away she was in no hurry to get married  no one of course guessed the reason of her obstinate refusal of all the best matrimonial prizes in the county no one guessed her secretthe depth of her love for andorher promise to wait for himher mother guessed it least of all everyone put her stubbornness down to conceit and to ambition and no one thought any the worse of her on that account when she refused young barnathe mayors eldest son and nagy lajos the rich pig merchant from somsó people shrugged their shoulders and said that mayhap elsa wanted to marry a shopkeeper of arad or even a young noble lord irma néni said nothing for the first year and even for two she saw nagy lajos go away and young barna court another girl that was perhaps as it should be elsa was growing more beautiful every yearand there was a noble lord who owned a fine estate and a castle close by who had taken lately to riding over on sunday afternoons to marosfalva and paid marked attention to elsa  noble lords had been known to marry peasant girlsat least in books so irma néni had been told and of course one never knows gods ways were wonderful sometimes  but when two years had gone by when a rich shopkeeper from arad had come and courted and been refused and when the noble lord had suddenly ceased his sunday afternoon visits to marosfalva irma became more anxious she had a long and serious talk with her daughter which led to no good  to all her mothers wise counsels and sound arguments elsa had opposed the simple statement of facts  i do not wish to marry mother dear not just yet  this of course would never do irma realized that she had allowed her ambition for her daughter to run away with her commonsense elsa must have got some queer notion or other in her head that intimacy with the schoolmistresswho came from budapest and talked a vast amount of sentimental stuff which she had imbibed out of booksmust be stopped at once and elsa be taken in hand by her own mother  to aim high was quite one thing but to let every chance however splendid slip through ones fingers was the work of a fool  the work of taking elsa in hand was thus promptly undertaken fate favoured the mothers intentions old kapus was stricken with paralysis and elsa had from that hour forth to spend most of her time with her father in the house and immediately under her mothers eye  though young barna was married by now and the pig merchant the noble lord and the rich shopkeeper all gone to seek a sweetheart elsewhere there were still plenty of suitors dangling round the beauty of the countryside in fact her wellknown pride and aloofness had brought a surfeit of competitors in the lists foremost among these was erös béla who was not only young and in a high position as my lord the counts chief bailiff but was also reputed to be the richest man for miles around  erös béla had long ago made public his determination to win elsa for wife and he had carried his courtship unostentatiously but persistently all along despite the many rivals in the field elsa never disliked him she accepted his attentions just as she did those of everyone else periodically béla would make a formal proposal of marriage which irma néni in her own name and that of elsas paralytic father invariably accepted but to his sober and wellworded proposals elsa gave the same replies that she gave to her more impetuous adorers  i dont want to marry not yet  when the work of taking elsa in hand began in earnest irma used erös béla as her chief weapon of attack he was very rich young enough to marry my lord the count looked upon him as his right handmoreover béla had made irma néni a solemn promise that if elsa became his wife his father and motherinlaw should receive that fine house in the kender road to live in with a nice piece of garden three cows and five pigs and a little maidofallwork to wait upon them  backed with such a bargain bélas suit was bound to prosper  and yet for another whole year elsa was obstinate irma had to resort to sterner measures and in a country like hungary where much of the patriarchal feeling toward parents still exists a mothers stern measures become very drastic indeed a child is a child while she is under her parents roof if she be forty she still owes implicit obedience unbounded respect to them if she fail in these she becomes an unnatural creature denounced to her friends as such under a cloud of opprobrium before her tiny circumscribed world  kapus irma brought out the whole armoury of her parental authority her parental power and her methods could be severe when she chose i will not say that she illtreated the girl though it was more than once that elsas right cheek and ear were crimson when the left were quite pale and that often on the hot sundays in july and august when the girls go in lownecked corslets and shifts to church elsa wrapped a kerchief over her shouldersthe neighbours said in order to hide the corrections dealt by irma nénis vigorous hand but it was morally that her mothers authority weighed most heavily upon the girl her commands became more defined and presently more peremptory elsa was soon placed in the terrible alternative of either being faithless to andor or disobedient to her mother  and it is characteristic of that part of the world that of the two sins thus in prospect the latter seemed by far the more heinous  yet andor was due back at the end of the summer the fourteenth of september came and went and the new recruits went with itanother week and those who had completed their three years would be coming home andor would of course be among them there had come no adverse report about him and no news during those three years is always counted to be good news no letters or sign of life had come from him but then many of the lads never wrote home while they did their three years and andor had no one to write to he would not be allowed to write to elsa or rather elsa would never be allowed to receive letters from him and his uncle lakatos pál the old miser would only be furious with him for spending his few fillérs on notepaper and stamps but elsa had waited patiently during three years knowing that though she had no news of him he would not forget her she never mistrusted him she never doubted him  she waited for him and he did not return at first his nonappearance excited neither surprise nor comment in the village andor had no relations except his uncle lakatos pál who did not care one brass fillér about him there had been no one to count the years the months the days when he would return there was only elsa who cared and she dared not say anything at first for fear of making her mother angry  but at the turn of the year lakatos pál became ill and when he got worse and worse and the doctor seemed unable to do anything to make him well he began to talk of his nephew andor  that is to say he bewailed the fact that his only brothers only child was dead and that hea poor sick manhad no one to look after him  he first spoke of this to pater bonifácius who was greatly shocked and upset to hear such casual news of andors death and it was only bit by bit that he succeeded in dragging fuller particulars out of the sick man it seems that when the lads regiment was out in bosnia there was an outbreak of cholera among the troops andor was one of those who succumbed it had all occurred less than a month before his discharge was actually due in fact these discharges had already been distributed to those who were sick in the hope that the lads would elect to go home as soon as they could be moved and thus relieve the government of the burden and expense of their convalescence  but lakatos andor had died in the hospital of slovnitza an official letter announcing his demise was sent to lakatos pál his uncle and sole relative but lakatos only threw the letter into a drawer and said nothing about it to anybody  it was nobodys business he said the government would see to the lads burial no doubt but some busybodies at marosfalva might think that it was hislakatosduty to put up a stone or something to the memory of his nephew and that sort of nonsense was very expensive  so no one in marosfalva knew that andor had died of cholera in the hospital of slovnitza until lakatos pál became sick and in his loneliness spoke of the matter to pater bonifácius  then there was universal mourning in the village andor had always been very popular goodlooking as merry as a skylark and a splendid dancer he was always the life and soul of every entertainment girls who had flirted with him wept bitter tears the mothers who thought how rich andor would have been now that old lakatos was sure to die very soonsighed deep sighs of regret  many there were who never believed that andor was dead he was not the lad to die of cholera he might break his neck one dayriding or drivingfor he was always daring and recklessbut to lie sick of cholera and to die in a hospitalno no that did not seem like andor  presently it became known that the official letterannouncing the deathhad not been quite in order it was only a rumourbut the rumour quickly gained credence it fitted in with popular sentiment pater bonifácius himself who had seen the letter declared that the wording of it was very curt and vaguemuch more curt and vague than such letters usually were it seems that there were a great many cases of cholera in the isolation hospital at slovnitza and lists were sent up daily from there to budapest of new cases of severe cases of discharges and of deaths in one of these lists andors name certainly did appear among the dead and a brief note to that effect had been officially sent to lakatos but surely the news should have had confirmation  where was the lad buried  who was beside him when he died  where were the few trinkets which he possessed his mothers weddingring which he always wore on his little finger  pater bonifácius wrote to the war office at budapest asking for a reply to these three questions he received none then he persuaded barna jenöthe mayorto write an official document the war office up at budapest sent an equally official document saying that they had no knowledge on those three points lakatos andor was one of those whose names appeared on the list of deaths from cholera at slovnitza and that was quite sufficient proof to offer to any reasonable human being  pater bonifácius sighed in bitter disappointment lakatos pál continued to bemoan his loneliness until he succeeded in persuading himself that he had always loved andor as his own son and that the lads supposed death would presently cause his own  and the neighboursespecially the womenheld on to the belief that andor was not dead they declared that he would return one day to enjoy the goodwill of his rich uncle now to marry a girl of marosfalva and to look forward to a goodly legacy from pali bácsi by and by     chapter vii  they are jews and we are hungarians   but what of elsa during this time what of the sorrow the alternating hope and despair of those weary weary months she did not say much she hardly ever cried but even her motherhard and unemotional as she wasrespected the girls secret for awhile after the news was brought into the cottage that andor was really dead  erös béla had brought the news and elsa on hearing it thus blurted out in bélas rough cruel fashion had turned deathly pale ere she contrived to run out of the room and hide herself away in a corner where she had cried till she had made herself sick and faint  have you been blind all these years irma néni erös béla had said with his habitual sneer when irma threw up her bony hands in hopeless puzzlement at her daughters behaviour did you not know that elsa has been in love with andor all along  no said irma in her quiet matteroffact tone i did not know it did you  of course i did he replied dryly but i have also known for the past six months that andor was dead  you knew it exclaimed irma with obvious incredulity  i have told you so havent i he retorted and i am not in the habit of lying  but how did you come to know it  when he did not return last september i marvelled what had happened i wonder no one else did then when lakatos pál first became illlong even before he confided in pater bonifáciusi made inquiries at the war office and found out the truth  whatever made you do that asked irma with a shrug of the shoulders andor wasnt anything to you  perhaps not replied béla curtly but you see i was afraid that pali bácsi would die and that andor would come back and find himself a rich man i should have lost elsa then so i was in a hurry to know  irma once more shrugged her shoulders in her habitual careless shiftless wayshelving as it were the whole responsibility of her life her fate and her daughter upon some other power than her own will she cared nothing about these intrigues of bélas or of anyone else she only wanted elsa to make a rich marriage so that shethe mothermight have a happy comfortable above all leisurely old age  but she had enough common sense to see that elsa laboured under the weight of a very great sorrow and while the girl was in such a condition of grief it would be worse than useless to worry her with suggestions of matrimony girls had been known to do desperate things if they were overharassed and kapus irma was no fool she knew what she wanted and her instinct coupled with her greed and cupidity showed her the best way to get it  so she left elsa severely alone for a time left her to pursue her household duties to look after her father to wash and iron the finery of the more genteel inhabitants of marosfalvathe schoolmistress blouses pater bonifácius surplices erös béla continued in his unemotional attentions to herhe was more sure of success than ever his words of courtship were the drops of water that were ultimately destined to wear away a stone  elsa lulled into security by her mothers placidity and bélas apparent simple friendship hardly was conscious of the precise moment when the siege against her passive resistance was once more resumed it was all so gradual so kind so persuasive and she had so little to look forward to in the future what did it matter what became of herwhom she married or where her home would be she saw more of erös béla than she did of anyone else for erös béla was undoubtedly irmas most favoured competitor elsa knew that he was of violent temperament dictatorial and rough she knew that he was fond of drink and of the society of klara goldstein the jewess but she really did not care  she had kept her promise to andor she had waited for him until she knew that he never never could come back now she might as well obey her mother and put herself right with god since she cared so little what became of her  and the beauty of marosfalva was tokened to erös béla in the spring of the following year and presently it was given out that the wedding would take place on the feast of holy michael and all angels at the end of september congratulations poured in upon the happy pair rejoicings were held in every house of note in the village everyone was pleased at the marriage pleased that the noted beauty would still have her home in marosfalva pleased that erös bélas wealth would all remain in the place  and elsa received these congratulations and attended these rejoicings with unvarying equanimity and cheerfulness there was nothing morbid or selfcentred in the girls attitude people who did not knowand no one really didand who saw her at mass on sundays or walking arminarm with béla in the afternoons would say that she was perfectly happy not a radiant bride certainly not a typical hungarian menyecske whose laughter echoes from end to end of the village whose merry voice rings all the day and whose pretty bare feet trot briskly up and down from her cottage to the river or to the church or to a neighbours house but an equable contented bride a fitting wife for a person of such high consideration as was erös béla  her manner to him was always equally pleasant and though the young pair did not exchange very loving glancesat any rate not in publicyet they were never known to quarrel which was really quite remarkable seeing that bélas temper had not improved of late  he was giving way to drink more than he used to and there were some ugly rumours about my lord the counts dissatisfaction with his erstwhile highlyvalued bailiff many people said that béla would get his dismissal presently if he did not mend his ways but then he very likely wouldnt care if he did get dismissed he was a rich man and could give his full time to cultivating his own land  this afternoon while he was talking with irma and sullenly watching his future wife he appeared to be quite sober until a moment ago when unreasoning rage seized hold of him and he shouted to elsa in a rough and peremptory manner after that his face which usually was quite pallid became hotly flushed and his one seeing eye had a restless quivering look in it  nor did elsas placid gentleness help to cool his temper when he shouted to her she turned and faced him and said with a pleasantif somewhat vague smile  yes béla what is it you want  what is it i want he muttered as he sank back into his chair and resting his elbows on the table he buried his chin in his hands and looked across at the girl with a glowering and sullen look what is it i want he reiterated roughly i want to know what has been the matter with you these last two days  nothing has been the matter with me she replied quietly nothing unusual certainly why do you ask  because for the last two days you have been going about with a face on you fit for a funeral rather than for a wedding what is it lets have it  nothing béla what should it be  i tell you there is something he rejoined obstinately and whats more i can make a pretty shrewd guess what it is eh  i dont know what you mean she said simply  i mean that the noted beauty of marosfalva does me the honour of being jealous isnt that it now oh i know well enough you neednt be ashamed of it jealousy does your love for me credit and flatters me i assure you  i dont know what you mean béla she reiterated more firmly i am neither jealous nor ashamed  not ashamed he jeered oho look at your flaming cheeks irma néni havent you a mirror let her see how she is blushing  i dont see why she should be jealous interposed irma crossly nor why you should be for ever teasing her i am sure she has no cause to be ashamed of anything or of being jealous of anyone  but i tell you that she is jealous of klara goldstein he maintained  what nonsense protested the mother while the blush quickly fled from the young girls cheeks leaving them clear and bloodless  i tell you she is he persisted with wrathful doggedness she has been sullen and moody these last two days ever since i insisted that klara goldstein shall be asked tomorrow to the farewell banquet and the dance  well i didnt see myself why you wanted that jewess to come said irma dryly  thats nobodys business he retorted i pay for the entertainment dont i  you certainly do she rejoined calmly we couldnt possibly afford to give elsa her maidens farewell and if you didnt pay for the supper and the gipsies and the hire of the schoolroom why then you and elsa would have to be married without a proper sendoff thats all  and a nice thing it would have been whoever heard of a girl on this side of the maros being married without her farewell to maidenhood i am paying for the supper and for everything because i want my brides farewell to be finer and grander than anything that has ever been seen for many kilomètres round i have stinted nothingbegrudged nothing i have given an ox two pigs and a calf to be slaughtered for the occasion i have given chickens and sausages and some of the finest flour the countryside can produce as for the wine    well all i can say is that there is none better in my lords own cellar i have given all that willingly i did it because i liked it but he added and once again the look of selfsatisfaction and sufficiency gave way to his more habitual sinister expression if i pay for the feast i decide who shall be invited to eat it  irma apparently had nothing to say in response she shrugged her shoulders and continued to stir the stew in her pot elsa said nothing either obedient to the command of her future lord she had faced him and listened to him attentively and respectfully all the while that he spoke nor did her face betray anything of what went on within her soul anything of its revolt or of its wounded pride while the storm of wrath and of sneers thus passed unheeded over her head  but béla having worked himself up into a fit of obstinate rage was not content with elsas passive obedience there had from the first crept into his halfeducated but untutored and undisciplined mind the knowledge that though elsa was tokened to him though she was submissive and gentle and eventempered her heart did not belong to him he knew but little about love believed in it still less in that part of the world a good many men are still saturated with the oriental conception of a womans place in the world and even in the innermost recesses of their mind with the oriental disbelief in a womans soul but in common with all such men he had a burning desire to possess every aspiration and to know every thought of the woman whom he had chosen for his wife  therefore now when in response to his rage and to his bombast elsa had only silence for hima silence which he knew must hide her real thoughts he suddenly lost all sense of proportion and of prudence for the moment he felt as if he could hate this woman whom he had wooed and won despite her resistance and in the teeth of strenuous rivalry he was seized with a purely savage desire to wound her to see her cry to make her unhappyanything in fact to rouse her from this irritating apathy  i suppose he said at last making a great effort to recover his outward selfcontrol i suppose that you object to my asking klara goldstein to come to your farewell feast  thus directly appealed to by her lover elsa gave a direct reply  yes i do she said  may i ask why  a girls farewell on the eve of her weddingday she replied quietly is intended to be a farewell to her girl friends klara goldstein was never a friend of mine  she belongs to this village anyway doesnt she he queried still trying to speak calmly he had risen to his feet and stood with squared shoulders legs wide apart and hands buried in the pockets of his tightlyfitting trousers an ugly illtempered masterful man who showed in every line of his attitude that he meant to be supreme lord in his own household  klara goldstein belongs to this village he reiterated with forced suavity she is my friend is she not  she may be your friend béla rejoined elsa gently and she certainly belongs to this village but she is not one of us she is a jewess not a hungarian like we all are  what has her religion to do with it he retorted  it isnt her religion béla persisted the girl with obstinacy at least as firm as his own you know that quite well though it is an awful thing to think that they crucified our lord  well that is a good long while ago he sneered and in any case klara and ignácz goldstein had nothing to do with it  no i know therefore i said that religion had nothing to do with it i cant explain it exactly béla but dont we all feel alike about that hungarians are hungarians and jews are jews and theres no getting away from that they are different to us somehow i cant say how but they are different they dont speak as we do they dont think as we do their sunday is saturday and their new years day is in september jewesses cant dance the csárdás and jews have a contempt for our gipsy music and our songs they are jews and we are hungarians it is altogether different  he shrugged his shoulders unable apparently to gainsay this unanswerable argument after all he too was a hungarian and proud of that fact and like all hungarians at heart he had an unexplainable contempt for the jews but all the same he was not going to give in to a woman in any kind of disagreement least of all on a point on which he had set his heart so now he shifted his ground back to his original dictum  you may talk as much as you like elsa he said doggedly but klara goldstein is my friend and i will have her asked to the banquet first and the dance afterwards or ill not appear at it myself  thats clear i hope he added roughly as elsa in her habitual peaceloving way had made no comment on that final threat  it is quite clear béla she now said passively  of course the girl shall be asked béla here interposed irma néni who had no intention of quarrelling with her wealthy soninlaw ill see to it and dont you lose your temper about it here sit down again elsa bring your fathers chair round for supper béla do sit down and have a bite i declare you two might be married already so much quarrelling do you manage to get through  but béla as sulky now as a bear with a sore head refused to stay for supper  i cant bear sullen faces and dark looks he said savagely ill go where i can see pleasant smiles and have some fun i must say irma néni he added by way of a parting shot as he picked up his hat and made for the door that i do not admire the way you have brought up your daughter a womans place is not only to obey her husband but to look cheerful about it however he added with a dry laugh well soon put that right after tomorrow eh my dove  and with a perfunctory attempt at a more loverlike attitude he turned to elsa who already had jumped to her feet and with a pleasant smile was holding up her sweet face to her future lord for a kiss  she looked so exquisitely pretty then standing in the gloomy halflight of this squalid room with the slanting golden sunshine which peeped in through the tiny west window outlining her delicate silhouette and touching her smooth fair hair with gold  vanity selfsatisfaction and mayhap something a little more tender a little more selfless stirred in the young mans heart it was fine to think that this beautiful prizewhich so many had covetedwas his by right of conquest even the young lord whose castle was close by had told erös béla that he envied him his good luck whilst my lord the count and my lady the countess had of themselves offered to be present at the wedding and to be the principal witnesses on behalf of the most beautiful girl in the county  these pleasant thoughts softened bélas mood and he drew his fiancée quite tenderly to him he kissed her on the forehead and on the cheeks but she would not let him touch her lips he laughed at her shyness the happy triumphant laugh of the conqueror  then he nodded to irma and was gone  he is a very good fellow at heart said the mother philosophically you must try and humour him elsa he is very proud of you really and think what a beautiful house you will have and all those oxen and pigs and a carriage and four horses you must thank god on your knees for so much good fortune there are girls in this village who would give away their ears to be standing in your shoes  indeed mother dear i am very very grateful for all my good fortune said elsa cheerfully as with vigorous young arms she pulled the paralytics chair round to the table and then got him ready for his meal  after which there was a moments silence elsa and her mother each stood behind her own chair the young girls clear voice was raised to say a simple grace before a simple meal  the stew had not been put on the table since béla did not stay for supper it would do for tomorrows dinner and for tonight maize porridge and rye bread would be quite sufficient  elsa looked after her father and herself ate with a hearty youthful appetite her mother could not help but be satisfied that the child was happy  the philosophy of life had taught kapus irma a good many lessons foremost among these was the one which defined the exact relationship between the want of money and all other earthly ills certainly the want of money was the father of them all elsa in future would never feel it therefore all other earthly ills would fall away from her for lack of support  it was as well to think that the child realized this and was grateful for her own happiness     chapter viii  i put the bunda away somewhere   kapus irma went out after supper to hold a final consultation with the more influential matrons of marosfalva over the arrangements for tomorrows feast old kapus had been put to bed on his paillasse in the next room and elsa was all alone in the small livingroom she had washed up the crockery and swept up the hearth for the night cloth in hand she was giving the miserable bits of furniture something of a rubdown and general furbishingup a thing she could only do when her mother was away for irma hated her to do things which appeared like a comment on her own dirty slatternly ways  cleanliness order and a love of dainty tidiness in the home are marked characteristics of the true hungarian peasantry the cottages for the most part are miracles of brightness brightly polished floors brightly polished pewter brightly covered feather pillows kapus irma was a notable exception to the rule and elsa had often shed bitter tears of shame when one or other of her many admirers followed her into her home and saw the squalor which reigned in itthe dirt and untidiness she was most ashamed when béla was here for he made sneering remarks about it all and seemed to take it for granted that she was as untidy as slovenly as her mother he read her long lectures about his sisters fine qualities and about the manner in which he would expect his own wife to keep her future home and made it an excuse for some of his most dictatorial pronouncements and rough masterful ways  but tonight even this had not matteredthough he had spoken very cruelly about the hempnothing now mattered any more today she had been called for the third time in church tomorrow evening she would say goodbye to her maidenhood and take her place for the last time among her girlfriends after tomorrows feast she would be a matronher place would be a different one and on tuesday would come the wedding and she would be erös bélas wedded wife  so what did anything matter any more after tuesday she would not even be allowed to think of andor to dream that he had come back and that the past two dreadful years had only been an ugly nightmare once she was erös bélas wedded wife it would be no longer right to think of that last morning five years ago of that final csárdás and the words which andor had whispered above all it would no longer be right to remember that kisshis warm lips upon her bare shoulder and later on out under the acacia tree that last kiss upon her lips  she closed her eyes for a moment a sigh of infinite regret escaped through her parted lips it would have been so beautiful if only it could have come true if only something had been left to her of those enchanted hours something more tangible than just a memory  resolutely now she went back to her work for the past two years she had found that she could imagine herself to be quite moderately happy if only she had plenty to do and she did hope that béla would allow her to work in her new home and not to lead a life of idlenesswaited on by paid servants  she had thrown the door wide open and every now and then when she paused in her work she could go and stand for a moment under its narrow lintel and from this position looking out toward the west she could see the sunset far away beyond where the plain ended where began another world the plumed heads of the maize were tipped with gold and in the sky myriads and myriads of tiny clouds lay like a gigantic and fleecy comet stretching right over the dome of heaven above the plain to that distant horizon far far away  elsa loved to watch those myriads of clouds through the many changes which came over them while the sun sank so slowly so majestically down into the regions which lay beyond the plain at first they had been downy and white like the freshlyplucked feathers of a goose then some of them became of a soft amber colour like ripe maize then those far away appeared rosetinted then crimson then glowing like fire    and that glow spread and spread up from the distant horizon up and up till each tiny cloud was suffused with it and the whole dome of heaven became one fiery crimson fleecy canopy with peeps between of a pale turquoise green  it was beautiful elsa leaning against the framework of the door gazed into that gorgeous immensity till her eyes ached with the very magnificence of the sight it lasted but a few minutesa quarter of an hour perhapstill gradually the bloodred tints disappeared behind the tall maize they faded first then the crimson and the rose and the gold till one by one the army of little clouds lost their glowing robes and put on a grey hue dull and colourless like peoples lives when the sunshine of love has gone downout of them  with a little sigh elsa turned back into the small livingroom which looked densely black and full of gloom now by contrast with the splendour which she had just witnessed from the village street close by came the sound of her mothers sharp voice in excited conversation with a neighbour  it will be all right irma néni the neighbour said in response to some remark of the other woman klara goldstein does not expect our village girls to take much notice of her but i will say that the men are sharp enough dangling round her skirts  yes retorted irma and i wish to goodness béla had not set his heart on having her at the feast he is so obstinate once he has said a thing     bélas conduct in this matter is not to be commended my good irma said the neighbour sententiously everyone thinks that for a tokened man it is a scandal to be always hanging round that pert jewess why didnt he propose to her instead of to elsa if he liked her so much better  hush hush my good mariska please elsa might hear you  the two women went on talking in whispers elsa had heard of course what they said and since she was alone a hot blush of shame mounted to her cheeks it was horrid of people to talk in that way about her future husband and she marvelled how her own mother could lend herself to such gossip  irma came in a few minutes later she looked suspiciously at her daughter  why do you keep the door open she asked sharply were you expecting anybody to come in  only you mother and pater bonifácius is coming after vespers replied the girl  i stopped outside for a bit of gossip with mariska just now could you hear what she said  yes mother i did hear something of what mariska said  about béla  about himyes  hej child you must not take any notice of what folks sayit is only tittletattle you must not mind it  i dont mind it mother i am sure that it is only tittletattle  your father in bed asked irma abruptly changing the subject of conversation  yes  and you have been busying yourself i see continued the mother looking round her with obvious disapproval with matters that do not concern you i suppose béla has been persuading you that your mother is incapable of keeping her own house tidy so you must needs teach her how to do it  no mother nothing was further from my thoughts i had nothing to do after i had cleared and washed up and i wanted something to do  if you wanted something to do you might have got out your fathers bunda big sheepskin cloak worn by the peasantry and seen if the moth has got into it or not it is two years since he has had it on and he will want it tomorrow  tomorrow  why yes i really must tell you because of the bunda jankó and móritz and jenö and pál have offered to carry him to the feast in his chair just as he is well put his bunda round him and they will strap some poles to his chair so that they can carry him more easily they offered to do it it was to be a surprise for you for your farewell tomorrow but i had to tell you because of getting the bunda out and seeing whether it is too motheaten to wear  while irma went on talking in her querulous acid way elsas eyes had quickly filled with tears how good people were how thoughtful was it not kind of móritz and jenö and the others to have thought of giving her this great pleasure  to have her poor old father near her after all when she was saying farewell to all her maidenhoods friends and what a joy it would be to himone that would brighten him through many days to come  oh people were good it was monstrously ungrateful to be unhappy when one lived among these kind folk  where is the bunda mother she asked eagerly ill see to it at once and if the moths are in it why i must just patch the places up so that they dont show where is the bunda mother  irma thought a moment then she frowned and finally shrugged her shoulders  how do i know she said petulantly isnt it in your room  no mother i havent seen it since father wore it last  and that was two years agoalmost to a day i remember it quite well it was quite chilly and your father put on his bunda to go down the street as far as the jews house it was after sunset i remember he came home and went to bed the next morning he was stricken and i put the bunda away somewhere now wherever did i put it  she stood pondering for a moment  under his paillasse she murmured to herself no in the cupboard no  in the dowerchest mother suggested elsa who knew of old that that article of furniture was the receptacle for everything that hadnt a proper place  yes look at the bottom said irma placidly it might be there  it was getting dark now through the open door and the tiny hermetically closed windows the grey twilight peeped in shyly the more distant corner of the little livingroom that which embraced the hearth and the dowerchest was already wrapped in gloom  elsa bent over the wormeaten piece of furniture her hands plunged in the midst of maizehusks and dirty linen of cabbagestalks and sunflowerseeds till presently they encountered something soft and woolly  here is the bunda mother she said  ah well get it out now and lay it over a chair you can have a look at it tomorrowthere will be plenty of time before you need begin to dress said irma who held the theory that it was never any use doing today what could conveniently be put off until tomorrow  maynt i have a look at it now mother asked elsa as she struggled with the heavy sheepskin mantle and drew it out of the surrounding rubbish the light will hold out for another halfhour at least and tomorrow morning i shall have such a lot to do  you may do what you like while the light lasts my girl but i wont have you waste the candle over this stupid business candle is very dear and your father will never wear his bunda again after tomorrow  i wont waste the candle mother but pater bonifácius is coming in to see me after vespers  what does he want to come at an hour when all sensible folk are in bed queried irma petulantly  he couldnt come earlier mother dear you know how busy he is always on sundays    benediction then christenings then vespers    he said he would be here about eight oclock  eight oclock exclaimed the woman who ever heard of such a ridiculous hour and candles are so deartheres only a few centimètres of it in the house  ill only light the candle mother when the pater comes said elsa with imperturbable cheerfulness ill just sit by the open door now and put a stitch or two in fathers bunda while the light lasts and when i cant see any longer ill just sit quietly in the dark till the pater comes i shall be quite happy she added with a quaint little sigh i have such a lot to think about  so have i retorted irma and i shall go and do my thinking in bed i shall have to be up by six oclock in the morning i expect and anyhow i hate sitting up in the dark  she turned to go into the inner room but elsamoved by a sudden impulseran after her and put her arms round her mothers neck  wont you kiss me mother she said wistfully you wont do it many more times in my old home  a home you have often been ashamed of my child the mother said sullenly  but she kissed the girlif not with tenderness at any rate with a curious feeling of pity which she herself could not have defined  goodnight my girl she said with more gentleness than was her wont sleep well for the last time in your old bed i doubt if tomorrow youll get into it at all and dont let the pater stay too long and waste the candle  i promise mother said elsa with a smile goodnight     chapter ix  then as now may god protect you   the bunda was very heavy elsa dragged it over her knee and sat down on a low stool in the open doorway she had pulled the table a little closer and on it were her scissors needles and cotton as well as the box of matches and the candle which she would be allowed to light presently when pater bonifácius came  the moth certainly had caused many ravages in the sheepskin cloakthere were tiny holes everywhere and the fur when you touched it came out in handfuls but as the fur would be turned inwards that wouldnt matter so much the bunda was quite wearable there was just a bad tear in the leather close to the pocket which might show and which must be mended  elsa threaded her needle and began to hum her favourite song under her breath      nincsen annyi tenger csillag az égen     mint a hányszor vagy eszembe te nékem      there are not so many myriads of stars in the sky as     the number of times that my thoughts fly to thee  she was determined not to think any more of the past in a few hours now that chapter in her life would be closed and it was useless and wicked to be always thinking of the mighthavebeen rather did she set herself resolutely to think of the future of that part of it at any rate which was bright there would be her mother installed in that comfortable house on the kender road and with a nice bit of land and garden round in which to grow vegetables and keep some poultry there would be her three cows and the pigs which béla was giving her and which he would graze on his own land  above all there would be the comfortable bed and armchair for the sick man and the little maid to wait upon him  there was so much so much to be thankful for and since god chose to take andor away what else was there to live for save to see her mother and father contented  the light was going fast elsa had made a splendid job of that one pocket the other too wanted a stitch it was very badly tornif only the feeble light would hold out another ten minutes    that hole too would be securely mended  with the splendid disregard of youth for its most precious gift elsa strained her eyes to thread her needle once more  she tackled the second pocket of the shabby bunda there was a long tear at the side as if the wearers hand had missed the actual pocket and been thrust carelessly or roughly through the leather  elsa put her hand through the hole too to see the extent of the mischief yes that was it her father must more than once have missed the pocket and put his hand into the hole making it bigger and bigger why there was a whole lot of rubbish deep down inside the lining elsa drew out an empty tobaccopouch a bit of string a length of tinder and from the very bottom where it lay in a crinkled mass a ball of crumpled paper  this she smoothed out holding it over her knee it was a letterone which must have been delivered on the very day when her father last wore the bunda the envelope had not been broken old kapus hadnt had time to read his letter the last which he had received before living death encompassed him the tears gathered in elsas eyes at thought of her father handling this very letter with shaking yet still living hands now they were incapable even of gripping this tiny piece of paper  but thentwo years ago her mother said it was almost to a day when last he wore the bundathen he had received the letter from the postman and evidently thrust it into his pocket meaning to read it at some more convenient time  the peasants of that part of the world have never quite lost their distrust of railways of telegrams and even of lettersthey are halfafraid of them all afraid with that vague unreasoning fear which animals have for things they see yet cannot understand  elsa handled this unopened letter with something of that same fear she did not think at first of looking at the superscription who could have been writing to her father two years ago he had no rich friends who could afford to spend money on notepaper and stamps there was no news in the great outer world which someone could have wished to impart to him the light indeed was very dim before elsa sitting here with the old bunda on her knee thought of looking more closely at the envelope  she bent down and out toward the light trying to decipher the writing  the letter was addressed to her  oh it was quite clear  tekintetes kapus elsa kisasszonynak  it was quite quite clearly written the letter was addressed to her the postman had brought it here two years ago her father had taken it from him and thrust it into the pocket of his bunda meaning to give it presently to his daughter  but that evening perhaps he forgot it altogether he had been drinking rather heavily of late and the next day he was stricken down with paralysis his tongue refused him service and he no longer could tell his daughteras no doubt he wanted to dothat a letter had come for her and that it was in the pocket of his bunda  and the bunda was thrust away into the dowerchest with the husks of maize and the cabbagestalks and it had never been taken out until tonightthe eve of elsas weddingday  she tore open the envelope now with fingers that trembled slightly the light was very dim and where the glorious sunset had been such a little while ago there was only the dull grey canopy of an overcast sky but elsa could just make out the writing already her eye had wandered to the signature your everdevoted andor the message seemed to come to her as from the grave for she thought that these were probably andors last words to her penned just before he died in that awful hospital in bosnia       my sweet dove she read this is to tell you that i      am well although it has been a close fight between      life and death for me but i did so want to live my      sweetheart for i have you to look forward to in life      i have been at deaths door and i believe that the      doctor here before he went away one evening signed      the paper to say that i was dead but that same night i      took a turn for the better and it was wonderful how      soon i was up again ill tell you all about it some      day my love some day when i come to claim your      promise that you would wait for me because dear      heart while i have been ill i have been thinking very      seriously i have not a silver florin to bless myself      with how can i come and dare to ask you to be my wife      your father and mother would kick me out of their      house they would forbid me to see you they would part      you from me my dear beautiful angel and i should      feel that it was just ia goodfornothing penniless      lout daring to approach the queen of beauty the most      exquisite girl on gods earth i have thought it all      over dear heart and all will be well if you will be      true to meif you will wait for me another two years      oh i do not ask you to do it i am not worthy of your      love who am i that you should keep yourself for      mebut i will pray to god night and day that he may      not take away your love from me i am going to america      dear heart with an english gentleman who has been very      kind to me he was the english consul at cettinje and      when there were so many of ushungarian ladslying      sick of that awful cholera in the hospital at      slovnitza his wife a sweet kind lady used to come      and visit us and cheer us up she was very ugly and had      big teeth and no waist but she was an angel of      goodness she took some interest in me and once when i      was still very weak and ill i told her about you about      our love and what little hope i had of ever winning      you seeing that i was penniless she was greatly      interested and when i was finally allowed to leave the      hospital she told me to come and see her husband the      english consul well dear heart this kind gentleman      is sending me out to a farm which he possesses in a      place called australiai think that it is somewhere in      america but i am not sure when i get there i shall      receive more wage in one week than our alföld labourers      get in three months and it will all be good money of      which i can save every fillér because my food and      housing will be given to me free and the kind english      ladymay the virgin protect her despite her large      teeth and flat chestgave me a whole lot of clothes to      take with me so every fillér which i earn i can save      and i reckon that in two years i shall have saved two      thousand florins about £160 and then i shall come      home if i still find you free my dovewhich i pray      to god i may dowe can get married at once then well      rent the lepke farm from pali bácsi as i shall have      plenty of money for the necessary security and if we      cannot make that pay and become rich folk within three      years then i am not the man whom i believe myself to      be       but my darling love do not think for a moment that i      want to bind you to me against your will god only      knows how deeply i love you during the last three      years the thought of you has been the sunshine of my      days the light of my nights if when you have      received and pondered over this letter you send me a      reply to say that you still love me that you will be      true to me and will wait for my return then you will      change my world into a paradise no work will be too      hard no difficulty too great to surmount if it will      help me the sooner to come back to you but if on the      other hand you tell me or leave me to guess that i am      a fool for thinking that you would waste your beauty      and your sweetness on waiting for a goodfornothing      scamp like me why then i shall understand i shall      go out to americaor wherever that place called      australia may bebut maybe i shall never come back      but i should never curse you dear heart i should      never cease to love you i should quite understand       i have got one of the nurses at the hospital to write      this letter for me to put my rough words into good      hungarian and to write down my thoughts in a good      clear hand that is how it comes to be so well written      you know i was never much of a hand with a pen and      paper but i do love you my dove my god how i love      you       the nurse says that australia is not in america at      allthat it is a different place altogether well i      do not care where it is i am going there because there      i can earn one hundred florins a month and save enough      in two years to marry you and keep you in comfort but      i shall not see you my dove before i go if i saw you      again if i saw hungary again our village our alföld      heaven help me but i dont think i would have the      heart to go away again       farewell dear heart i go away full of hope we go      off next week in a big big ship from here i go full      of sadness but if you do want me to come back just      write me a little letter with the one word yes and      address it as above then will my sadness be changed to      heavenly joy and hope but if it is to be no then      tell me so quite truly and i will understand       then as now may god protect you my dove my heart       your everdevoted       andor  the letter fell out of elsas hands on to her knee she took no heed of it she was staring out into the immensity far away into the fastgathering gloom two years ago two years of sorrow and vain regrets which never need have been one word from her father or from the postman the feel of crisp paper in her fathers bunda when it was put away two years ago and the whole course of her life would have been changed  the village street behind her was silent now even the footsteps of belated folk hurrying to their homes sent up no echo from the soft sandy ground and before her the fastgathering night was slowly wrapping the plain in its peacegiving shroud inside the cottage all was still mother and father lay either asleep or awake thinking of the morrow  a great heavy sob shook the young girls vigorous young frame it seemed too wantonly cruel this decree of fate which had withheld from her the light of her life how easy it would have been to wait how swiftly these two years would have flown past her heart would have kept youngwaiting for andor and for happiness whereas now it was numb and unsentient save for a feeling of obedience and of filial duty of pity for her mother and father and of resignation to her future state  indeed fate was being wantonly cruel to her to the last in thus putting before her eyes a picture of the mighthavebeen just when it was too late in a few hours from now the great vow would be spoken the irrevocable knot tied which bound her to another man her troth was already plighted her confession made to pater bonifáciusin a few hours from now she would be bélas wife and if andor did come back now she must be as nothing to him he as a mere distant friend  but probably he never would come back he received no reply to his fond letter of farewell not one word from her to cheer him on his way no doubt by now he had made a home for himself in that far distant land another womana strangerrevelled in the sunshine of his love while elsa whose whole life had been wrapped up in him was left desolate  for a moment a wild spirit of revolt rose in her was it too late after all was any moment in life too late to snatch at fleeing happiness why shouldnt she run away tonightnowfind that unknown country that unknown spot where andor was surely god would give her strength god could not be so unjust and so cruel as men and fate had been  pater bonifácius turning from the street round the angle of the cottage found her in this mood squatting on the low stool her elbows on her knees her face buried in her hands he came up to her quite gently for though his was a simple soul it was full of tenderness and of compassion for the children of these plains whom god had committed into his charge  elsa my girl he asked softly what is it     chapter x  the best way of all   pater bonifácius had placed his kindly hand on the girls hunchedup shoulders and there was something in his touch which seemed to soothe the wild paroxysm of her grief she raised her tearstained face to his and without a wordfor her lips were shaking and she could not have spoken thenshe handed him andors letter  may i go in he asked and light the candle it is too dark now to read  she rose quickly and with an instinctive sense of respect for the parish priest she made hasty efforts to smooth her hair and to wipe her face with her apron then she turned into the room and though her hand still trembled slightly she contrived to light the candle  the old priest adjusted his hornrimmed spectacles on his nose and drew a chair close to the light  he sat down and read andors letter through very slowly when he had finished he handed it back to elsa  gods ways my child are mysterious he said with a short sigh it is not for us to question them  mysterious exclaimed the girl with passionate wrath i call them cruel and unjust pater what have i done that he should have done this to me andor loved me and i loved him he wrote me a letter full of love begging for a word from me to assure him that i would always love him and that i would wait for him why was that letter kept from me why was i not allowed to reply to it my father would not have kept the letter from me had he not been stricken down with paralysis on the very day when it came it is god who kept my happiness away from me it is god who has spoilt my life and condemned me to regrets and wretchedness when i had done nothing to deserve such a cruel fate  it is god interposed the priest gently who even at this moment forgives an erring child all the blasphemy which she utters  then as elsa dryeyed and with quivering lips still looked the personification of revolt he placed his warm gentle hands upon hers and drew her a little closer to him  are we then he asked softly such very important things in the scheme of gods entire creation that everything must be ordered so as to suit us best  i only wanted to be happy murmured elsa in a quivering voice  you only wanted to be happy in your own way my child rejoined the priest as he patted her hands tenderly but it does not happen to have been gods way now who shall say which is the best way of being happy who knows best you or god  if the postman had given me the letter and not to father she murmured dully if father had not been stricken down with illness the very next day if i had only had this letter two years ago instead of today     and the sentence was left unfinished broken by a bitter sigh of regret  if it all had been as you say my child said pater bonifácius kindly then you might perhaps have been happy according to your own light whereas now you are going to be happy in accordance with that of god  she shook her head and once more her eyes filled with tears  i shall never be happy again she whispered  oh yes you will my dear retorted the kindly old man whose rugged facecareworn and wrinkledwas lit up with a halfhumorous wholly indulgent smile it is wonderful what a capacity for happiness the good god has given to us all the only thing is that we cant always be happy in our own way but the other waysif they are gods waysare very much better believe me why he chose to part you from andor he added with touching simplicity why he chose to withhold that letter from you until tonight we shall probably never know but that it was his way for your future happiness of that i am convinced  there could have been no harm this time pater in andor and i being happy in our way there could be no wrong in two people caring for one another and wanting to live their lives together  ah that we shall never know my child the book of the mighthavebeen is a closed one for us only god has the power to turn over its pages  andor and i would have been so happy she reiterated with the obstinacy of a vain regret and life would have been an earthly paradise  and perhaps you would have forgotten heaven in that earthly paradise who knows your happiness might have drawn you away from god you might have spent your life in earthly joys you might have danced and sung and thought more and more of pleasure and less and less of god who knows whereas now you are just going to be happy in gods way you are going to do your duty by your mother and your father and above all by your husband you are going to fill your life by thoughts of god first and then of others instead of filling it with purely selfish joys you are going to walk up the road of life my child with duty to guide you over the roughnesses and hard stones that will bestrew your path and every roughness which is surmounted every hardship which is endured every sacrifice of self which is offered up to one who made the greatest possible sacrifice for us all will leave you happier than before    happier in gods way the best way of all  he talked on for a long while in this gentle heartfelt way and gradually as the old man spoke the bitterness and revolt died out of the simpleminded childs heart hers after all was a simple faithbut as firmly rooted within her as her belief in the sunshine the alternating days and nights the turns of the season and the kind priest who after lifes vicissitudes had found anchorage in this forlorn village in the midst of the plains knew exactly how to deal with these childlike souls like those who live their lives upon the sea the hungarian peasant sees only immensity around him and above him that wonderful dome which hides its ineffable mysteries behind glorious veils of sunset and sunrise of storm and of fantastic clouds the plain stretches its apparently limitless expanse to a distance which heits childhas never reached untutored and unlearned he does not know what lies beyond that lowlying horizon into whose arms the sun sinks at evening in a pool of fire  everything around him is so great so vast so wonderfulthe rising and setting of the sun the stars and moon at nights the gathering storms the rainfalls the sowing of the maize and the corn the travail of the earth and the growing and developing of the stately heads of maize from one tiny dried yellow grainthat he has no inclination for petty casuistry for arguments or philosophy gods work is all that he ever sees the book of life and death the only one he reads  and because of that simple faith that sublime ignorance elsa found comfort and peace in what pater bonifácius said i will not say that she ceased to regret nor that the grief of her heart was laid low but her heart was soothed and to her already heavy sorrow there was no longer laid the additional burden of a bitter resentment  then for awhile after he had spoken the priest was silent no one knew better than he did the exact value of silence whilst words had time to sink in so they both remained in the gloom side by sidehe the consoler and she the healed the flickering candle light played curious and fantastic tricks with their forms and faces lighting up now and then the wrinkled wizened face of the old man with the hornrimmed spectacles perched upon his nose and now and then the delicate profile of the girl the smooth fair tresses and round white neck  shall we not say a little prayer together whispered pater bonifácius at last just the prayer which our dear lord taught usour father which art in heaven     slowly the young girl sank on her knees beside the gentle comforter her fair head was bowed her face hidden in her hands word for word now she repeated after him the sublime invocation taught by divine lips  and when the final whispered amen ceased to echo in the low raftered room pater bonifácius laid his hand upon the childs head in a gesture of unspoken benediction     chapter xi  after that happiness will begin   pater bonifácius kindliness his gentle philosophy and unquestioning faith exercised a soothing influence over elsas spirits the one moment of rebellion against fate and against god before the arrival of the old priest had been the first and the last  there is a goodly vein of oriental fatalism still lurking in the hungarians god has willed it comes readily enough to their lips though this unsophisticated child of the plains suffered none the less than would her more highlycultured sisters in the west yet she was more resignedin her humble way more philosophicalaccepting the inevitable with an aching heart mayhap but with a firm determination to make the best of the few shreds of happiness which were left to her  elsa had promised before god and before the whole village that she would marry erös béla on the feast of st michael and all angels and after that single thought of rebellion she knew that on the following tuesday this would have to be just as surely as the day follows the night and the night the day  even that selfsame evening after the pater had gone and before she went to bed she made her final preparations for the next three days which were the turningpoints of her life tomorrow her farewell banquet a huge feast in the big schoolroom hired expressly for the occasion fifty people would sit down to that they were the most intimate friends of the contracting parties hers and bélas and her mothers it is the rule that the brides parents provide this entertainment but kapus benkó and his wife had not the means for it and erös béla insisting upon a sumptuous feast was ready enough to pay for this gratification of his own vanity  after the banquet dancing would begin and would be kept up half the night then the next morning was the weddingday the wedding mass in the morning then the breakfast more dancing more revelling more jollification also kept up throughout the night for it is only on the day following that the bridegroom goes to fetch his bride out of her home to conduct her to his own with all the pomp and circumstance which his wealth allows so many carts so many oxen so many friends in the carts and so many gipsies to make music while the procession slowly passes up the village street  all that was of course already arranged for the banquet for tomorrow was prepared the ox roasted whole the pigs and the capons stuffed erös béla had provided everything and provided most lavishly fifty persons would sit down to the farewell banquet and more like two hundred to the weddingbreakfast the village was agog with excitement gipsies from arad had been engaged my lord the count and the countess were coming to the wedding mass    how could one feeble weak ignorant girl set her will against this torrent  elsa conscious of her helplessness set to with aching heart but unwavering determination to put the past entirely behind her  what was the good of thinking since fate had already arranged everything  she went to bed directly after the pater went away because there was no more candle in the house and because her mother kept calling querulously to her and having stretched her young limbs out upon the hard paillasse she slept quite peacefully because she was young and healthy and did not suffer from nerves and because sorrow had made her very weary  and the next morning the dawn of the first of those allimportant three days found her busy alert quite calm outwardly even though her cheeks had lost something of their rosy hue and her blue eyes had a glitter in them which suggested unshed tears  there was a lot to do of course the invalid to get ready the mothers dressing to see to so that she should not look slovenly in her appearance and call forth some of those stinging remarks from béla which had the power to wound the susceptibilities of his fiancée  irma was captious and in a tearful humour bemoaning the fact that she was too poor to pay for her only daughters farewell repast  whoever heard of a bridegroom paying for his fiancées farewell she said you will despise your poor parents now elsa  it was certainly an unusual thing under the circumstances the maidens farewell to the friends of her girlhood to their parents and belongings is a great event in this part of the world in connection with the wedding festivities themselves of which it is the precursor the parents of the bride invariably provide the entertainment and do so in accordance with their means  but erös béla was a proud man in the county he would not hear of any festival attendant upon his marriage being less than gorgeous and dazzling before the eyes of the whole countryside he chose to pay the piper so that he might call the tune and though elsawounded in her own pridedid her best to protest she was overruled by her mother who was only too thankful to see this expensive burden taken from off her shoulders  kapus irma was a proud mother today for as elsa finally stood before her arrayed in all her finery for the coming feast she fully justified her right to be styled the beauty of the county  a picture she looked from the top of her small head with its smooth covering of fair hair yellow as the ripening corn to the tips of her small arched feet encased in the traditional boots of bright crimson leather  her fair hair was plaited closely from the crown of her head and tied up with strands of red white and green ribbons nor did the hard line of the hair drawn tightly away from the face mar the charm of its round girlishness it gave it its own peculiar charactersemioriental with just a remaining soupçon of that mysterious ancestry whose traditions are lost in the faroff mountains of thibet  the tightfitting black corslet spanned the girlish figure and made it look all the more slender as it seemed to rise out of the outstanding billows of numberless starched petticoats necklace and earrings made of beads of solid golda present from béla to his fiancéegave a touch of barbaric splendour to this dainty apparition whilst her bare shoulders and breast her sturdy young arms and shapely if toilworn hands made her look as luscious a morsel of fresh girlhood as ever gladdened the heart of man  irma surveyed her daughter from head to foot with growing satisfaction then with a gesture of unwonted impulse she took the young girl by the shoulders and drawing her closely to her own bony chest she imprinted two sounding kisses on the fresh pale cheeks  there she said lustily your mothers kiss ought to put some colour in those cheeks heigho child she added with a sigh as she wiped a solitary tear with the back of her hand i dont wonder you are pale and frightened it is a serious step for a girl to take i know how i felt when your father came and took me out of my mothers house but for you it is so easy you are leaving a poor miserable home for the finest house this side of the maros and a life of toil and trouble for one of ease today you are still a maid tomorrow you will be a married woman and the day after that your husband will fetch you with six carts and fortyeight oxen and a gipsy band and all his friends to escort you to your new home just as every married woman in the country is fetched from her parents home the day after she has spoken her marriage vows after that your happiness will begin you will soon forget the wretched life you have had to lead for years helping me to put maize into a helpless invalids mouth  i shall never forget my home dear mother said elsa earnestly and every fillér which i earned and which helped to make my poor father comfortable was a source of happiness to me  hm grunted the mother dryly you have not looked these past two years as if those sources of happiness agreed with you  i shall look quite happy in the future mother retorted elsa cheerily especially when i have seen you and father installed in that nice house in the kender road with your garden and your cows and your pigs and a maid to wait on you  yes said irma naïvely béla promised me all that if i gave you to him and i think that he is honest and will keep to his promise  then as elsa was silent she continued fussily  there now i think i had better go over to the schoolroom and see that everything is going on all right i dont altogether trust ilona and her parsimonious ways such airs she gives herself too i must go and show her that whatever béla may have told her i am the hostess at the banquet today and mean to have things done as i like and not as she may choose to direct    now mind you dont allow your father to disarrange his clothes móritz and the others will be here by about eleven and then you can arrange the bunda round him after they have fixed the carryingpoles to his chair we sit down to eat at twelve oclock and i will come back to fetch you a quarter of an hour before that so that you may walk down the street and enter the banqueting place in the company of your mother as it is fitting that you should do and dont let anyone see you before then for that is not proper when you fix the bunda round your fathers shoulders make all the men go out of the house before you enter the room do you understand  yes mother  you know how particular béla is that everything should be done in orderly and customary style dont you  yes mother replied elsa without the slightest touch of irony i know how much he always talks about propriety  though you are not his wife continued irma volubly and wont be until tomorrow you must begin today to obey him in all things and you must try and be civil to klara goldstein and not make béla angry by putting on grand stiff airs with the woman  i will do my best mother dear said elsa with a quick short sigh  goodbye then concluded irma as she finally turned toward the door dont crumple your petticoats when you sit down and dont go too near the hearth there is some grease upon it from this mornings breakfast dont let anyone see you and wait quietly for my return  having delivered herself of these admonitions which she felt were incumbent upon her in her interesting capacity as the mother of an important bride irma at last sailed out of the door elsaobedient to her mother and to convention did not remain standing beneath the lintel as she would have loved to do on this beautiful summer morning but drew back into the stuffy room lest prying eyes should catch sight of the heroine of the day before her state entry into the banqueting hall  with a weary little sigh she set about thinking what she could do to kill the next two hours before móritz and jenö and those other kind lads came to take her father away with the door shut the room was very dark only a small modicum of light penetrated through the solitary tiny window elsa drew a chair close beside it and brought out her mending basket and workbox but before settling down she went back into the sleepingroom to see that the invalid was not needing her  of course he always needed her and more especially today one of the last that she would spend under his roof he was not tearful about her departurehis senses were too blunt now to feel the grief of separationhe only felt pleasantly excited because he had been told that móritz and jenö and the others were coming over presently and that they meant to carry him in his chair just as he was so that he could be present at his daughters maidens farewell this had greatly elated him he was looking forward to the rich food and the luscious wine which his rich future soninlaw was providing for his guests  and now when elsa came to him dressed in all her pretty finery he loved to look on her and his dulled eyes glowed with an enthusiasm which had lain atrophied in him these past two years  he was like a child now with a pretty doll and elsa delighted at the pleasure which she was giving him turned about and around allowed him to examine her beautiful petticoats to look at her new red boots and to touch with his lifeless fingers the beads of solid gold which her fiancé had given her  suddenly while she was thus displaying her finery for the benefit of her paralytic father she heard the loud bang of the cottage door someone had entered someone with a heavy footstep which resounded through the thin partition between the two rooms  she thought it must be one of the young men perhaps with the poles for the carryingchair and she wondered vaguely why he had come so early  she explained to the invalid that an unexpected visitor had come and that she must go and see what he wanted and then half ashamed that someone should see her contrary to her mothers express orders and to all the proprieties she went to the door and opened it  the visitor had not closed the outer door when he had entered and thus a gleam of brilliant september daylight shot straight into the narrow room it revealed the tall figure of a man dressed in town clothes who stood there for all the world as if he had a perfect right to do so and who looked straight on elsa as she appeared before him in the narrow frame of the inner door  his face was in full light she recognized him in the instant  but she could not utter his name she could not speak her heart began to beat so fast that she felt that she must choke  the next moment his arms were round her he kicked the outer door to with his foot and then he dragged her further into the room he called her name and all the while he was laughinglaughing with the glee of a man who feels himself to be supremely happy     chapter xii  it is too late   and now there he was as of old sitting as was his wont on the corner of the table his two strong hands firmly grasping elsas wrists she held him a little at arms length frightened still at the suddenness of his apparition hereon this daythe day of her farewell feast  when first he drew her to him she had breathed his namesoftly panting with excitement andor  the blood had rushed to her cheeks and then flowed back to her heart leaving her pale as a lily she did not look at him any more after that first glance but held her head bent and her eyes fixed to the ground slowly the tears trickled down her cheeks one by one  but he did not take his glowing laughing eyes away from her though he too was speechless after that first cry of joy  elsa  he held her wrists and in a happy irresponsible way was swinging her arms out and in all the while that he was drinking in the joy of seeing her again  surely she was even more beautiful than she had ever been before he did not notice that she was dressed as for a feast he did not heed that she held her head down and that heavy tears fell from her eyes he had caught the one swift look from her blue eyes when she first recognized him he had seen the blush upon her cheeks then the look and the blush had told him all that he wanted to know for they had revealed her soul to him manlike he looked no further happiness is such a natural thing for wretched humanity to desire that it is so much easier to believe in it than in misery when it comes  at last he contrived to say a few words  elsa how are you my dove he said naïvely  i am quite well thank you andor she murmured through her tears  then she tried to draw her wrists out of his tenacious clutch  may i not kiss you elsa he asked with a light happy laughthe laugh of a man sure of himself and sure of the love which will yield him the kiss  if you like andor she replied  she could not have denied him the kiss not just then at any rate not even though every time that his warm lips found her eyes her cheeks her neck she felt such a pain in her heart that surely she thought that she must die of it  after that he let her wrists go and she went to sit on a low stool some little distance away from him her cheeks were glowing now and it was no use trying to disguise her tears andor saw them of course but he did not seem upset by them he knew that girls were so different to men so much more sensitive and tender and so now he was only chiding himself for his roughness  i ought to have prepared you for my coming elsa he said i am afraid it has upset you  no no andor its nothing she protested  i did want to surprise you he continued naïvely not that i ever really doubted you elsa even though you never wrote to me i thought letters do get astray sometimes and i was not going to let any accursed post spoil my happiness  no of course not andor  you did not write to me did you elsa he asked  no andor i did not write  but you had my letter    i mean the one which i wrote to you before i sailed for australia  the postman she murmured gave it to father when it came then the next day father was stricken with paralysis he never gave it to me only last night     my god he broke in excitedly and yet you remained true to me all this while even though you did not know if i was alive or dead holy mother of god what have i done to deserve such happiness  then as she did not speakfor indeed the words in her throat were choked by her tearshe continued talking volubly like a man who is intoxicated with the wine of joy  oh i never doubted you elsa but i had planned my homecoming to be a surprise to you it was not a question of keeping faith of course because you were never tokened to me therefore i just wanted to read in your dear eyes exactly what would come into them in the first moment of surprise    whether it would be joy or annoyance love or indifference and i was not deceived elsa for when you first saw me such a look came into your eyes as i would not exchange for all the angels glances in paradise  elsa sighed heavily she felt so oppressed that she thought her heart must burst andors happiness his confidence made the hideous truth itself so much more terrible to reveal and now he went on in the same merry voluble way  i went first to goldsteins this morning i thought klara would tell me some of the village gossip to while away the time before i dared present myself here i didnt want pali bácsi or anybody to see me before i had come to you i didnt want anybody to speak to me before i had kissed you the jews i didnt mind of course so i got klara to walk with me by a roundabout way through the fields as far as this house then i lay in wait for a while until i saw irma néni go out i wanted you all to myself at once    with no one by to intercept the look which you would give me when first you recognized me  and    did klara tell you anything she murmured under her breath  she told me of uncle palis illness he said more quietly and how he seemed to have fretted about me lately    and that everyone here thought that i was dead  yes what else  nothing else much he replied for you may be sure i would not do more than just mention your sweet name before that jewess  and    when you mentioned my name    did she say anything  no she laughed rather funnily i thought but of course i would not take any notice she had always been rather jealous of you and now that i am a rich man     yes andor  when i say a rich man he said with a careless shrug of his broad shoulders i only mean comparatively of course i have saved three thousand crownsabout £120not quite as much as i should have liked but things are dear out there and there was my passage home and clothes to pay for still three thousand crowns are enough to pay down as a guarantee for a really good farm and if klara goldstein spoke the truth and pali bácsi is really so well disposed toward me why i need not be altogether ashamed to present myself before your parents need i my dove  before my parents she murmured  why yes he said as he rose from the table now and came up quite close to her looking down with earnest lovefilled eyes on the stooping figure of this young girl who held all his earthly happiness in her keeping you knew what i meant elsa did you not when i came back to you the moment that i could after all these years it was only my own poverty which kept me from your side all this long while but you did not think that i had forgotten you did you elsayou could not think that how could a man forget you who has once held you in his arms and kissed those sweet lips of yours why there has not been a day or night that i did not think of you    night and day while i worked in that land which seemed so far away from home homesick i wasvery oftenand though we all earned good money out there the work was hard and heavy but i didnt mind that for i was making money and every florin which i put by was like a step which brought me nearer to you  andor  the poor girl was almost moaning now for every word which he spoke was like a knifethrust straight into her heart  being so far away from home he continued speaking slowly and very earnestly now in a voice that quivered and shook with the depth of the sentiment within him being so far away from home would have been like hell to me at times i dont know what there is elsa about this land of hungary how it holds and enchains us but at times i felt that i must lie down and die if i did not see our maizefields bordered with the tall sunflowers our distant lowlying horizon on which the rising and the setting sun paints such glowing colours this land of australia was beautiful too there were fine fields of corn and vast lands stretching out as far as the eye could reach but it was not hungary there were no white oxen with long slender horns toiling patiently up the dusty high roads the storks did not build their nests in the tall acacia trees nor did the arms of distant wells stretch up toward the sky it was not hungary elsa and it would have been hell but for thinking of you the life of an exile takes all the life out of one i have heard of some of our hungarian lads out in america who get so ill with homesickness that they either die or become vicious but then he added with a quick characteristic return to his habitual lighthearted gaiety it isnt everyone who is far from home who has such a bright star as i had to gaze at in my mind    when it came night time and the lights were put out     andor she pleaded  but he would not let her speak just then he had not yet told her all that there was to say and perhaps the innate goodheartedness in him suggested that she was discomposed that she would prefer to sit quietly and listen whilst she collected her thoughts and got over the surprise of his sudden arrival  do you know elsa he now said gaily i chalked up the daysmade marks i mean in a book which i bought in fiume the day before we sailed seven hundred and thirty daysfor i never meant to stay away more than two years and every evening in my bunk on board ship and afterwards in the farm where i lodged i scratched out one of the marks and seemed to feel myself getting a little bit nearer and then nearer to you by the saints my dove he added with a merry laugh but you should have seen me the time i got cheated out of one of those scratches i had forgotten that accursed twentyninth of february last year i dont think that i have ever sworn so wickedly in my life before i had to go to melbourne pretty soon i tell you and make confession of it to the kind pater there and then     he paused abruptly the laughter died upon his lips and the look of gaiety out of his eyes for elsa sat more huddled up in herself than before he could no longer see her face for that was hidden in her hands he only saw her bowed shoulders and that they were shaking as if the girl had yielded at last to a paroxysm of weeping  elsa he said quietly as a puzzled frown appeared between his brows elsa    you dont say anything    you    you     he passed his rough hand across his forehead on which rose heavy beads of perspiration for the first time in the midst of his joy and of his happiness a hideous doubt had begun to assail him  a hideous horrible poisongiving doubt  elsa he pleaded and his voice grew more intense as if behind it there was an undercurrent of broken sobs elsa what is the matter you are not going to turn your back on me are you look at me elsa look at me you wouldnt do it would you    you wouldnt do it    the lord forgive me but i love you elsa    i love you fit to kill  he was babbling like a child and now he fell on his knees beside that low stool on which she sat hunched up a miserable bundle of suffering womanhood he hid his face in her petticoatsthose beautiful starched petticoats that were not to be crumpledand all at once his manliness broke down in the face of this awful awful doubt and he sobbed as if his heart would break  andor andor she cried overwhelmed with pity for him pity for herself with the misery and the hopelessness of it all andor i beg of you pull yourself together someone might come    they must not see you like this  she put her hand upon his head and passed her cool white fingers through his hair the gentle motherly gesture soothed him her words brought him back to his senses gradually his sobs were stilled he made a great effort to become quite calm and with a handkerchief wiped the tears and perspiration from his face  then he rose and went back to the table and sat down on the corner of it as he always liked to do the workings of his face showed the effort which he made to keep his excitement and those awful fears in check  you are quite right elsa he said calmly someone might come and it would not be a very fine homecoming for lakatos andor would it to be found crying like an infant into a womans petticoats why what would they think that we had quarrelled perhaps on this my first day at home god forgive me i quite lost myself that time didnt i it was foolish he added with heartbroken anxiety wasnt it elsa  yes andor she said simply  it was foolish he reiterated still speaking calmly even though his voice was halfchoked with sobs it was foolish to think that you would turn your back on a fellow who had just lived these past five years for you  it isnt that andor she murmured  it isnt that he repeated dully and once more the frown of awful puzzlement appeared between his dark inquiring eyes then what is it no no elsa he added quickly seeing that she threw a quick look of pathetic anxiety upon him dont be afraid my dove i am not going to make a fool of myself again you    you are not prepared to marry me just now perhaps    not just yetis that it    you have been angry with me    i am not surprised at that    you never got my letter    you thought that i had forgotten you    and you want to get more used to me now that i am back    before we are properly tokened    is that it elsa    ill have to wait ehtill the spring perhaps    till we have known one another better again    then    perhaps     he was speaking jerkily and always with that burning anxiety lurking in the tone of his voice but now he suddenly cried out like a poor creature in pain vehemently appealingly longing for one word of comfort one brief respite from this intolerable misery  but you dont speak elsa    you dont speak    my god why dont you speak  and she replied slowly monotonously for now she seemed to have lost even the power of suffering pain it was all so hopeless so dreary so desolate  i can never marry you andor  he stared at her almost like one demented or as if he thought that she perhaps had lost her reason  i can never marry you she repeated firmly for i am tokened to erös béla my farewell banquet is today tomorrow is my wedding day the day after i go to my new home i can never marry you andor it is too late  she watched him while she spoke vaguely wondering within her poor broken heart when that cry of agony would escape his lips his face had become ghastly in hue his mouth was wide open as if ready for that cry his twitching fingers clutched at the neckband of his shirt  but the cry never came the wound was too deep and too deadly for outward expression he said nothing and gradually his mouth closed and his fingers ceased to twitch presently he rose went to the door and pulled it open he stood for a moment under the lintel his arm leaning against the frame of the door and the soft september breeze blew against his face and through his hair  from far away down the village street came the sound of laughter and of singing the people of marosfalva were very merry today for it was kapus elsas wedding time and erös béla was being lavish with food and wine and music nobody guessed that in this one cottage sorrow deep and lasting had made a solemn entry and never meant to quit these two loving hearts again     chapter xiii  he must make you happy   andor shut the door once more he did not want the people of the village to see him just now  he turned back quietly into the room and went to sit at his usual place across the corner of the table elsa mechanically absently as one whose mind and soul and heart are elsewhere was smoothing out the creases in her gown made wet by andors tears  how did it all come about elsa he asked  well you know she replied listlessly since klara goldstein told youthat everyone here believed that you were dead i did not believe it myself for a long time though i did think that if you had lived you would have written to me then as i had no news from you    no news    and mother always wished me to marry béla    why i thought that since you were dead nothing really mattered and i might as well do what my mother wished  my god he muttered under his breath  we were so poor at home she continued in that same listless apathetic voice for indeed she seemed to have lost all capacity even for suffering and father was so ill    he wanted comfort and good food and mother and i could earn so very little    béla promised mother that nice house in the kender road he promised to give her cows and pigs and chickens    what could i do it is sinful not to obey your parents    and it seemed so selfish of me to nurse thoughts of one whom i thought dead when i could give my own mother and father all the comforts they wanted just by doing what they wished    i had to think of father and mother andor    what could i do  that is so elsa he assented speaking very slowly and deliberately    that is so of course    i understand    i ought to have known    to have guessed something of the kind at any rate    my god he added with renewed vehemence but i do seem to have been an accursed foolthinking that everything would go on just the same while i was weaving my dreams out there on the other side of the globe    i ought to have guessed i suppose that they wouldnt leave you alone    you the prettiest girl in the county     i held out as long as i could    but i felt that if you were dead nothing really mattered  my poor little dove he whispered gently  gradually he felt a great calmness descending over him it was her helplessness that appealed to him the pathos of her quiet resignation he felt how mean and unmanly it would be to give way to that rebellious rage which was burning in his veins three years under the orders of ofttimes brutal petty officers had taught him a measure of selfrestraint the two further years of hard unceasing toil under foreign climes the patient amassing of florin upon florin to enable him to come back and claim the girl whom he loved had completed the work of changing an irresponsible untrammelled child of these hungarian plains into a strong wellbalanced wellcontrolled man of a wider world his first instinct when the terrible blow had been struck to all his hopes and all his happiness had been the wild unreasoning desire to strike back and to kill had he been left to himself just then and then found himself face to face with the man who had robbed him of elsa the semicivilization of the past five years would have fallen away from him he would once more have relapsed into the primeval unfettered state of his earlier manhood the crude passions of these sons of the soil are only feebly held in check by the laws of their land at times they break through their fetters and then they are a law unto themselves  but andor loved elsa with a gentler and purer love than usually dwells in the heart of a man of his stamp he had proved this during the past five years spent in daily hourly thoughts of her now that he found her in trouble he would not add to her burden by parading his own before her  manlike his first thought had been to kill his second to seize his love with both arms and to carry her away with him away from this village from this land if need be after all she was not yet a wife and the promise of marriage is not so sacred nor yet so binding as a marriage vow  he could carry her away leaving the scandalmongers to work their way with her and him he could carry her to that faroff land which he knew already where work was hard and money plentiful and no one would have the right to look down on her for what she had done but seeing her there looking so helpless and so pathetic he knew by that unerring intuition which only comes to a man at such times as this that such a dream could never be fulfilled the future was as it was as no doubt it had been preordained by god and by fate nothing that he could do or say now would have the power to alter it tradition filial duty and perhaps a certain amount of womanly weakness too were all ranged up against him but filial duty would fight harder than anything else and would remain the conqueror in the end  the relentless hand of the inevitable was already upon him and because of it because of that vein of oriental fatalism which survives in every hungarian peasant the tumult in his soul had already subsided and he was able to speak to elsa now with absolute gentleness  so today is your maidens farewell is it he asked after awhile  yes it must be getting late she said as she rose from the low stool and shook out her many starched skirts mother will be back directly to fetch me for the feast  it will be in the schoolroom i suppose he said indifferently  yes and some of the lads are coming over presently to fetch father they have arranged to carry him all the way isnt it good of them  to carry him all the way he asked puzzled  father has not moved for two years she said simply he was stricken with paralysis you know  ah yes klara told me something about that  so in order to give me the pleasure of having father near me at my farewell feast móritz and jenö and imre and jankó are going to fasten long poles to his chair and carry him to the schoolroom and back isnt it good of them and i think they mean to do the same thing tomorrow and carry him to church we are going to put his bunda round his shoulders he has not worn his bunda for two years    it was yesterday when i took it out in order to mend it that i found the letter which you wrote me from fiume it had slipped between the pocket and the lining and     and are you happy elsa he broke in abruptly  she hesitated almost imperceptibly for a moment then she said quietly  yes andor i am fairly happy  béla he asked again is he fond of you  i think so  you are not sure  oh yes she said more firmly i am quite sure  he hasnt taken to drinking has he    he was a little inclined that way at one time  oh she said with a shrug of her shoulders i dont think that he drinks more than other fellows of his age  she went over to the window and somewhat ostentatiously he thought began turning over the contents of her workbox there was something in her attitude now which worried him and she seemed more determined than ever not to look him straight in the face  elsa i shall think the worst if you tell me nothing he said firmly  there is nothing to tell andor  yes there is he persisted there is something about béla which makes you unhappy and which you wont tell me    now listen to me elsa for i mean every word which i am going to say    i can bring myself to the point of seeing you married to another man and happy in your new home even though my own heart will break in the process    but what i could never stand would be to see you married to another man and made unhappy by him    so if you wont tell me what is on your mind with regard to béla i will pick a quarrel with him this afternoon and kill him if i can  dont talk so wildly andor she said as she turned and faced him for she was a little frightened at his earnestness and knew that he had it in him to act just as he said he would the whole thing is only foolishness on my part i know  then there is something he persisted obstinately  well she said after a little more hesitation its only that he will go hanging about at the goldsteins all the time  oh its klara is it  i cant bear that girl said elsa with sudden vehemence  he looked at her keenly  you are jealous elsa he said is it because you love béla  i dont like his hanging round klara she replied evasively  he rose from the table drawing in his breath as he did so with a curious hissing sound perhaps the pain which he felt now was harder to bear even than that caused by the first crushing blow the inevitable had indeed placed its cruel hand upon his happiness not all the boundless wealth of his love of his will and of his daring could ever give elsa back to him again  i had better go now i suppose he said  mother will be here directly she replied wont you see her  not just yet i think i thought of asking pater bonifácius if he could give me a bed for a night pali bácsi might not be ready for me yet  but you will come to my farewell feast asked elsa with that unconscious cruelty of which good women are so often capable  if you wish it elsa he replied  i do wish it she said and everyone will be so happy to see you they would think it strange if you did not come for everyone will know by then that you have returned  then i will come he concluded  he went up to her and held out his hand she put her own upon it of course he did not ask for a kiss he had no longer a right to that somehow in the last few moments a barrier seemed to have sprung up between him and her which had obliterated all the past he was a stranger now to her and she to him that day five years ago was as if it had never been béla and her plighted troth to him stood now between andor and that past which he must forget  but as he stood now holding her hand he looked at her earnestly and her blue eyes dimmed but serene met his own gaze without flinching  the past elsa he said is done with henceforth we shall be nothing to one another you will forget me easily enough    i wish that i had never come back to disturb the peace which i see is rapidly spreading over your life my only wish now is that with you it should be peace my heart has already given you up to bélabut not unconditionally mind    he must make you happy    i tell you that he must he reiterated almost fiercely if he does not he will have to reckon with me heaven help him i say if he is ever unkind to you    i shall see it i shall know it    i shall not leave this village till i am assured that he means to be kindthat he is kind to you even though my heart should break in remaining a witness to your happiness  he stooped and with the innate chivalry peculiar to the hungarian peasantry he kissed the small cold hand which trembled in his grasp he kissed it as a noble lord would kiss the hand of a princess then without looking on her again he walked quietly out of the house and elsa was alone with yet another bittersweet memory to add to her store of regrets     chapter xiv  it is true   by the time that andor turned the corner of the house into the street he found that the news of his arrival had already spread through the village like wildfire klara goldsteins ready tongue had been at work this past hour she had quickly disseminated the news that the wanderer had come home she did not say that the malice and love of mischief in her had caused her to say nothing to andor about elsas coming wedding she merely told the first neighbour whom she came across that lakatos andor had come back just as she for one had always declared that he would  andors friends had assembled in the street in a trice here was too glorious an opportunity to shout and to sing and to make merry to be lightly missed and andor had always been popular before he was doubly so now that he had come back from america or wherever he may have been and had made a fortune there he shook one hundred and fifty hands before he could walk as far as the presbytery the gypsies who had just arrived by train from arad were not allowed to proceed straight to the schoolroom they were made to pause in the great open place before the church made to unpack their instruments then and there and to strike up the rákóczy march without more ado in honour of the finest son of marosfalva who had been thought dead by some and had returned safe and sound to his native corner of the earth  it was with much difficulty that at last andor succeeded in effecting his escape and running away from the series of ovations which greeted him when and wherever he was recognized the women embraced him without further ado the men worried him to tell them some of his adventures then and there above all everyone wanted to hear how very much more wretched uncomfortable and godforsaken the rest of the wide wide world was in comparison with hungary in general and the village of marosfalva in particular  the heartfelt if noisy greetings of his old friends had the effect of soothing andors aching heart the sight of his native village the scent of the air the dust of the road acted as a slight compensation for the heavy load of sorrow which otherwise would hopelessly have weighed him down  with a final wave of his hat he disappeared from the enraptured gaze of his friends into the cool quietude of the presbytery garden he stood still for a moment behind a huge clump of tall sunflowers and gaudy dahlias to recover his breath and rearrange his coat which had been mishandled quite a good deal by his friends in the excess of their joy  from the other side of the low gate came the buzz of animated talk his own name oftrepeated cries of surprise and of pleasure when the news reached some latecomers and through it all the soft pathetic murmur of the gipsies fiddles they had lapsed from the inspiriting strains of the rákóczy march to one of the dreamy magyar lovesongs which suited their own languid oriental temperament far better than the martial music  but here in the small presbytery garden the world seemed to have slipped back an hundred years or more perfect peace the drowsing of flies and wasps the call of thrushes the crackling of tiny twigs in the branches of the old acacia tree in the corner only the flies and the birds and the flowers seemed to live and the air was heavy with the pungent odour of the sunflowers  andor drew a long breath he seemed suddenly to wake from a long long dream it was just over five years ago that he had stood one morning just like this in this little garden the late roses had not then ceased to bloom it was the day before he had to leave marosfalva in order to become a soldier and he had come after mass to say a private goodbye to the kind priest  now it seemed as if those five years were just one long dreamthe soldiering the voyage across the sea the two years in a strange strange land all culminating in that awful cataclysm which had for ever robbed him of happiness  it seemed as if it could not all be true as if elsa was even now waiting for him to go out for a walk under the acacia trees as she had done on that morning five years ago even now he pulled the bell as he had done then and nowas thenpater bonifácius himself came to the door  his old housekeeper had already brought the news to the presbytery of andors homecoming and the old pater was overjoyed at seeing the ladnow become so strong and so manly he took andor to his heart chiefly because he would not have the lad see the tears which had so quickly come to his eyes  it is true then pater said andor when he had followed the old man into the little parlour all littered with papers and books it is true or you would not have cried when first you embraced me  what is true my son asked the pater  that elsa is to marry erös béla tomorrow  yes my son that is true said the priest simply  and thus andor knew that at any rate the hideous present was not a dream     chapter xv  that is fair i think   an hour later andor was in the street with the rest of the village folk watching elsa as she walked up toward the schoolroom in the company of her mother her fair hair shone like the gold beads round her neck and her starched petticoats swung out from her hips as she walked  she held her head a little downcast people thought this most becoming in a young bride but andor who stood in the forefront of the spectators as she passed saw that she held her head down because her cheeks were pale and her eyes swollen with tears  irma néni walked beside her daughter with the proud air of a queen and on ahead barna móritz the mayors second son fehér jenö whose father worked the watermill on the maros and two other sturdy fellows were carrying the brides paralysed father shoulder high in his chair  just as the little procession halted for a moment before entering the white washed schoolhouse erös béla the bridegroom and hero of the hour appeared coming from the opposite direction and with klara goldstein the jewess upon his arm  klaraarrayed in fashionable town garments with a huge hat covered in feathers a tight modern skirt that forced her to walk with mincing steps highheeled shoes openwork stockings and gloves reaching to the elbowwas indeed a curious apparition in amongst these peasant girls with their bare heads and high redleather boots and petticoats standing round them like balloons  andor frowned heavily when he caught sight of her he had seen that elsas pale cheeks had become almost livid in hue and that her parted lips trembled as if she were ready to cry  the looks that were cast by the village folk upon the jewess were none too kindly and there were audible mutterings of disapproval at erös bélas conduct but neither looks nor mutterings disconcerted klara goldstein in the least she knew well enough that envy of her fashionable attire bore a large share in the illwill which was displayed against her and the handsome jewess who so often had to bear the contempt and the sneers of these magyar peasants whom she despised was delighted that erös bélas admiration for her had induced him to give her an opportunity of queening it for once amongst them all  she felt that she shone in her splendour in comparison with the palefaced bride in all her village finery she carried a sunshade and a reticule her dark hair was arranged in frisettes under her broadbrimmed hat she knew that the men were casting admiring glances on her and in any case for the moment she was the centre of universal observation  whilst some of the young men were engaged in carrying old kapus into the house a proceeding which kept the festive throng waiting outside she tripped up daintily to elsa and said in soft cooing tones  it was kind of you my dear elsa to include me among your personal friends on such an important occasion as the young count was saying to me only last night you will give irma néni and little elsa vast pleasure by your presence at the childs maidens farewell and mind you wear that lovely hat which i admire so much so affable the young count is he not he told me that nothing would do but when i get married he must come himself to every feast in connection with my wedding  but once she had delivered these several little pointed shafts klara goldstein was far too clever to wait for a retort before elsa whose simple mind was not up to a stinging repartee could think of something indifferent or not too ungracious to say the handsome jewess had already spied andors face among the crowd  there is the hero of the hour béla she said turning to the bridegroom who had stood by surly and defiant these past five years have not changed him much eh    your future wifes old sweetheart she added with a malicious little laugh are you not pleased to see him  then as béla somewhat clumsily and with a pretence at cordiality which he was far from feeling went up to andor and held out his hand to him klara continued glibly  poor old andor he is a trifle glum now i never told him that his sweetheart was getting married tomorrow never mind my little andor she added turning her expressive dark eyes with a knowing look upon the young man there is more fish in the maros than has come out of it and i thought that you would prefer to get the truth direct from our pretty elsa  i think you did quite right klara said andor indifferently  but in the meanwhile béla had contrived to come up quite close to elsa and to whisper hurriedly in her ear  a bargains a bargain my doveyou behave amiably to klara goldstein and i will keep a civil tongue in my head for your old sweetheart    that is fair i think eh irma néni he added turning to the old woman  dont be foolish béla retorted kapus irma dryly why you should be for ever teasing elsa i cannot think you must know that all girls feel upset at these times and as like as not youll make her cry at her own feast and that would be a fine disgrace for us all  dont be afraid mother said elsa quietly i dont feel the least like crying  thats splendid exclaimed béla with ostentatious gaiety heres irma néni trying to teach me something about girls as if i didnt know about them all that there is to know eh andor you agree with me dont you he added turning to the other man we men know more about womens moods and little tempers than their own mothers do what now irma néni take your daughter into the house there is a clatter of dishes and bottles going on inside there which is very pleasant to the stomach miss klara will you honour me by accepting my arm friends come in all will you all those i mean whom my wife that is to be has invited to her last girlhoods entertainment irma néni do lead the way elsa looks quite pale for want of foodshe had her breakfast very early i suppose and got tired dressing for this great occasion andor you shall sit next to elsa if you like    you must have lots to tell her your adventures among the cannibals and the lions and tigers    eh    and irma néni shall sit next to you on the other side and dont let her have more wine than is good for her whew but it is hot already come along friends by thunder klara but that is a fine hat you have got on  he talked on very volubly and at the top of his voice making ostentatious efforts to appear jovial and amiable to everyone but erös béla was no fool he knew quite well that his attitude toward his bride and toward klara the jewess was causing many adverse comments to go round among his friends but he was in a mood not to care he was determined that everyone should know and see that he was the master here today just as he meant to be master in his house throughout the years to come like every selfenriched peasant he attached an enormous importance to wealth and was inclined to have a contempt for the less fortunate folk who had not risen out of their humble sphere as he had done  his wealth he thought had placed him above everyone else in marosfalva and above the unwritten laws of traditions and proprieties which are of more account in an hungarian village than all the codes framed by the parliament which sits in budapesth he was proud of his wealth proud of his education his booklearning and knowledge of the world and reckoned that these gave him the right to be a law unto himself his naturally domineering and masterful temperament completed his claim to be considered the head man of marosfalva  the hungarian peasants are ready enough to give deference where deference is exacted but having given it their cordial friendship dies away they acknowledged a social barrier more readily perhaps than any other peasantry in europe but having once acknowledged it they will not admit that either party can stand on both sides of it at one and the same time  so now though erös béla was flouting the local traditions and proprieties by his attentions to klara goldstein no one thought of openly opposing him everyone was ready enough to accept his actions as they would those of their social superiorsthe gentlemen of arad the pater my lord the count himself but they were not ready to accept his cordiality nor to extend to him their simpleminded and openhearted friendship  the presence of the jewess did not please themshe was a stranger and an alienshe looked like a creature from another world with her tight skirts highheeled shoes and huge feathered hat no one felt this more keenly than andor whose heart had warmed outdespite its painat sight of all his friends their national costumes their music their traditionsall of which had been out of his life for so long  he felt that klaras presence on this occasion was in itself an outrage upon elsa even without bélas conspicuously unworthy conduct elsa with her tightlyplaited hair her balloon skirts and bare neck and arms looked ashamed beside this fashionable apparition all made up of billowy lace and clinging materials  andor cursed beneath his breath and ground his heel into the dust in the impotency of his rage he tried to remember all that the pater had said to him half an hour ago about forbearance and about gods will  personally andor did not altogether believe that it was gods will that elsa should be married to a man who would neither cherish her nor appreciate her as she deserved to be and it was with a heart weighed down with foreboding as well as with sorrow that he followed the wedding party into the schoolhouse     chapter xvi  the waters of the maros flow sluggishly   but even the bridegrooms unconventional and reprehensible conduct had not the power to damp for long the spirits of the guests  by the time the soup had been eaten and the glasses filled with wine the noise in the schoolroom had already become deafening and no person of moderate vocal calibre could have heard himself speak the time had come for everyone to talk at the top of his or her voice for no one to listen and for laughterirresponsible immoderate laughterto ring from end to end of the room  the gipsies were scraping their fiddles blowing their clarionets and banging their czimbalom with all the vigour of which they were capable they at any rate were determined to be heard above the din the leader with his violin under his chin had already begun his round of the two huge tables pausing for awhile behind every chairjust long enough to play into the ear of every single guest his or her favourite song  for thus custom demands it  there are hundreds and hundreds of hungarian folksongs and to a strangers ear no doubt these have a great similarity among themselves but to a hungarian there is a world of difference in each for to him it is the words that have a meaning the songs are for the most part lovesongs and all are written in that quaint symbolic style full of poetic imagery which is peculiar to the magyar language  when we remember that in the terrible revolution of 48 when these same hungarian peasant lads who composed the bulk of kossuths followers fought against the austrian army and subsequently against the combined armies of russia and of austria when we remember that throughout that terrible campaign they were always accompanied by their gipsy bands we begin to realize how great a part national music plays in the national spirit of hungary the sweet sad folksongs rang in the fighting lads ears when they fell in their hundreds before the superior arms and numbers of their powerful neighbours they inspired them and urged them they helped them to win while they could and to yield only when overwhelming numbers finally crushed their powers of resistance gipsy musicians fell beside the young soldiers playing to them until the last the songs that spoke to them of their village their sweethearts and their home and the sweet sad strains rang in the ears of the lads when they closed their eyes in death  and now when andorface to face with the first great sorrow of his lifefelt as if his heart must break under it he loved to hear the gipsy musician softly caressing the strings of his violin as he played close to his ear the sweetest saddest melody among all the sweet sad melodies in the magyar tongue it begins thus      a maros vize folyik csendesen      the waters of the maros flow sluggishly  and it speaks of a brokenhearted lover whose sweetheart belongs to another andor had never cared for it before he used to think it too sad but now he understood it it was attuned to his mood and the soft sound of the instrument helped him to keep his evergrowing wrath in check even while he was watching elsas pale tearful face  she had made pathetic efforts to remain cheerful and not to listen to klaras strident voice and loud continuous laughter béla had practically confined his attentions to the jewess and elsa tried not to show how ashamed she was at being so openly neglected on this occasion she should have been the queen of the feast of course the bridegrooms thoughts should have been only for her everyones eyes should have been turned on her instead of which she seemed of less consequence almost than anyone else here if it had not been for andor who sat next to her and who saw to her having something to eat and drinkit was little enough god knowsshe might have sat here like a wooden doll  something of the respect which erös béla demanded as his own right encompassed her too already the cordiality of the past seemed to have vanished she was already something of a lady tens asszony honoured madam she would be styled by and by and this foreknowledge which she was gradually imbibing while everybody round her made merry caused her almost as much sadness as bélas indifference towards her it seemed as if all brightness was destined to go out of her life after today and it was with tearfilled eyes that she looked up now and again from her plate and gazed round upon the festive scene before her  the whitewashed schoolroom where on ordinary working days brown and grimy little faces were wont to pore laboriously over slates and books presented now a very lively appearance  two huge trestle tables ran down its length and thirty guests were seated on benches each side of these the girls in all their finery wanted a deal of sittingroom with their starched petticoats standing out over their hips and their bare arms and necks shone with the vigorous application of yellow soap and the smooth hair fair and dark had an additional lustre after the stiff brushing which it had to endure the matrons wore darker skirts and black silk handkerchiefs tied round their heads ending in a bow under the chin but everywhere ribbons fluttered and beads jingled and the men had spurs to their high boots which gave a pleasing clinking when they clapped their heels together overhead hung to the ceiling were festoons of bright pink paper roses and still brighter green glazed calico leaves the tables were spread with linen cloths and literally threatened to break down under the weight of pewter dishes filled with delicacies of every sort and kindhomekilled meat and homemade sausages homemade bread and homegrown wine the magyar peasant is an epicure his rich soil and excellent climate give him the best of food and though when times are hard he will live readily enough on maize bread and pumpkin he knows how to enjoy a good spread when rich friends provide it for him  and erös béla had done the feast in style nothing was stinted you just had to sit down and eat your fill of roast veal or roast pork of fattened capons from his farmyard or of fogas4 from the river or of the scores of dishes of all kinds of good things which stood temptingly about  footnote 4 a kind of pike peculiar to hungarian rivers  no wonder that spirits were now running high the gipsy band was quite splendid and presently barna móritz the second son of the mayora smart young man who would go farwas on his feet proposing the health of the bride  well of course one mugful was not enough to do honour to such a toast they had to be refilled and then filled up again wine was so plentiful and so goodnot heady but just a delicious white wine which tasted of nothing but the sweetscented grape soon the bridegroom rose to respond whereupon fehér jenö whose father rented the mill from my lord the count loudly desired that everyone should drink the health of happy lucky erös béla and then of course the latter had to respond again  elsa felt more and more every moment a stranger among them all fortunately the innate kindliness of these children of the soil prevented any chaffing remarks being made about the silence of the bride it is always an understood thing that brides are shy and nervous and though there had been known cases in marosfalva where a bride had been very lively and talkative at her maidens farewell it was on the whole considered more seemly to preserve a semitearful attitude seeing that a girl on the eve of her marriage is saying goodbye to her parents and to her home  the bridegrooms disgraceful conduct was tacitly ignored it could not be resented or even commented on without quarrelling with erös béla and that no one was prepared to do you could not eat a mans salt and drink his wine and then knock him on the head which it seemed more than one ladwho had fancied himself in love with beautiful kapus elsawas sorely inclined to do  kapus benkó in his invalids chair sat some distance away from his daughter the other side of klara goldstein elsa could not even exchange glances with him or see whether he had everything he wanted thus she seemed cut off from everyone she cared for only andor was near her and of andor she must not even think she tried not to meet his gaze tried hard not to feel a thrill of pleasure every time that she became actively conscious of his presence beside her  and yet it was good to feel that he was there she had a sense that she was being protected that things could not go very wrong while he was near     chapter xvii  i am here to see that you be kind to her   pater bonifácius came in at about four oclock to remind all these children of their duty to god  today was the vigil of st michael and all angels there would be vespers at halfpast four and the bride and bridegroom should certainly find the time to go to church for half an hour and thank the good god for all his gifts  the company soon made ready to go after that everyone there intended to go to church and in the meanwhile the gipsies would have the remnants of the feast after which they would instal themselves in the big barn and dancing could begin by about six  bride and bridegroom stood side by side close to the door as the guests filed out both singly and in pairs and as they did so they shook each one by the hand wished them good health after the repast and begged their company for the dancing presently and the wedding feast on the morrow once more the invalid father hoisted up on the shoulders of the same sturdy lads led the procession out of the schoolhouse then followed all the guests helterskelter young men and maids old men and matrons  the wide petticoats got in the way the men were over bold in squeezing the girls waists in the general scramble there was a deal of laughing and plenty of shouting as hot perspiring hands were held out one by one to elsa and to béla and voices hoarse with merriment proffered the traditional egésségire your very good health and then like so many birds let out of a cage streamed out of the narrow door into the sunlit street  andor had acquitted himself of the same duty and elsas cool little hand had rested for a few seconds longer than was necessary in his own brown one she had murmured the necessary words of invitation for the ceremonies on the morrow and he was still standing in the doorway when klara goldstein was about to take her leave  klara had stayed very ostentatiously to the last just as if she were the most intimate friend or an actual member of the family she had stood beside béla during the general exodus her small dark head crowned with the gorgeous picture hat held a little on one side her two gloved hands resting upon the handle of her parasol her foot in its dainty shoe impatiently tapping the ground  as the crowd passed by scrambling in their excitement starched petticoats crumpled many a white shirt stained with wine hot perspiring and panting a contemptuous smile lingered round her thin lips and from time to time she made a remark to bélaalways in german so that the village folk could not understand but andor who had learned more than his native hungarian during his wanderings abroad heard these sneering remarks and hated the girl for speaking them and béla for the loud laugh with which he greeted each sally  now she held out her small thin hand to elsa  your good health my dear elsa she said indifferently  after an obvious moment of hesitation elsa put her toilworn shapely little hand into the gloved one for an instant and quickly withdrew it again there was a second or two of silence klara did not move she was obviously waiting for the invitation which had been extended to everyone else  a little nervously she began toying with her parasol  the glass is going up you will have fine weather for your wedding tomorrow she said more pointedly  i hope so said elsa softly  another awkward pause andor who stood in the doorway watching the little scene saw that béla was digging his teeth into his underlip and that his one eye had a sinister gleam in it as it wandered from one girl to the other  may the devil    began klara roughly whose temper quickly got the better of her airs and graces what kind of flea has bitten your bride béla i should like to know  flea said béla with an oath which he did not even attempt to suppress flea no kind of a flea i hope    look here my dove he added turning to elsa suddenly you seem to be forgetting your dutieshave you gone to sleep these last five minutesor cant you see that klara is waiting  i can see that klara is waiting replied elsa calmly but i dont know what she can be waiting for  she was as white as the linen of her shift and little beads of sweat stood out at the roots of her hair andor whose love for her made him clearsighted and keen saw the look of obstinacy which had crept round her mouththe sudden obstinacy of the meek which nothing can move he alone could see what this sudden obstinacy meant to her whose natural instincts were those of duty and of obedience she suffered terribly at this moment both mentally and physically the moisture of her forehead showed that she suffered  but she had nerved herself up for this ordeal the crushed worm was turning on the cruel foot that had trodden it for so long she did not mean to give way even though she had fully weighed in the balance all that she would have to pay in the future for this one moment of rebellion  parents first and husbands afterwards are masterful tyrants in this part of the world the womans place is to obey the oriental conception of mans supremacy still reigns paramount especially in the country elsa knew all this and was ready for the chastisementeither moral mental or even physicalwhich would surely overtake her if not today then certainly after tomorrow  you dont know what klara is waiting for asked béla with an evil sneer why my dove you must be dreaming klara wont come to our church of course but she would like to come to the ball presently and tomorrow to our wedding feast  a second or perhaps less went by while elsa passed her tongue over her parched lips then she said slowly  since klara does not go to our church béla i dont think that she can possibly want to come to our wedding feast  béla swore a loud and angry oath and andor who was closely watching each player in this moving little drama saw that klaras olive skin had taken on a greenish hue and that her gloved hands fastened almost convulsively over the handle of her parasol  but i tell you    began béla who was now livid with rage and turned with a menacing gesture upon his fiancée i tell you that     already andor had interposed he too was pale and menacing but he did not raise his voice nor did he swear he only asked very quietly  what will you tell your fiancée man come what is it that you want to tell her on the eve of her wedding day  whats that to you retorted béla  in this land where tempers run high and blood courses hotly through the veins a quarrel swiftly begun like this more often than not ends in tragedy on andors face in his menacing eyes was writ the determination to kill if need be in that of béla there was the vicious snarl of an infuriated dog klara goldstein was far too shrewd and prudent to allow her name to be mixed up in this kind of quarrel her reputation in the village was not an altogether unblemished one by a scandal such as would result from a fight between these two men and for such a cause she might hopelessly jeopardize her chances in life even with her own people  her own common sense too of which she had a goodly share told her at the same time that the game was not worth the candle the satisfaction of being asked to the most important wedding in the village and there queening it with her fashionable clothes and with the bridegrooms undivided attention over a lot of stupid village folk would not really compensate her for the scandal that was evidently brewing in the minds of andor and of elsa  so she preferred for the nonce to play the part of outraged innocence a part which she further emphasized by the display of easygoing kindliness she placed one of her daintilygloved hands on bélas arm she threw him a look of understanding and of indulgence she cast a provoking glance on andor and one of goodhumoured contempt on elsa then she said lightly  never mind béla i can see that our little elsa is a trifle nervy today she does me more honour than i deserve by resenting your great kindness to me but bless you my good béla i dont mind i am used to jealousies the petty ones of my own sex are quite endurable it is when you men are jealous that we poor women often have to suffer leopold hirsch who is courting me you know is so madly jealous at times he scarce can bear anyone to look at me as if i could help not being plain eh  then she turned with a smile to elsa  i dont think my dear she said dryly that you are treating béla quite fairly he wont let you suffer from his jealousies why should you annoy him with yours  another glance through her long dark lashes on both the men and klara goldstein turned to go but before she could take a step toward the door bélas masterful hand was on her wrist  what are you doing he asked roughly  going my good béla she replied airily going what else can i do i am not wanted here now or later at your feast but there are plenty in this village and around it who will make me welcome and their company will be more pleasing to me i assure you than that of your friends we thought of having some tarok5 this evening leopold will be with us and the young count is coming he loves a gamble and is most amusing when he is in the mood so i am going where i shall be most welcome you see  footnote 5 a game of cardsthe source of much gambling in that part of europe  she tried to disengage her wrist but he was holding her with a tight nervous grip  you are not going to do anything of the sort he muttered hoarsely she is daft i tell you stay here cant you  not i she retorted with a laugh enough of your friends company my good béla is as good as a feast look at elsas face and andors he is ready to eat me and she to freeze the marrow in my bones so farewell my dear man if you want any more of my company she added pointedly you know where to get it  she had succeeded in freeing her wrist and the next moment was standing under the lintel of the door the afternoon sun shining full upon her clinging gown her waving feathers and the gewgaws which hung round her neck for a moment she stood still blinking in the glare her hands which trembled a little from the emotion of the past little scene fumbled with her parasol  béla turned like a snarling beast upon his fiancée  ask her to stop he cried savagely ask her to stop i tell you  keep your temper my good béla said klara over her shoulder to him with a laugh and dont trouble about me i am used to tantrums at home leo is a terror when he has a jealous fit but its nothing to me i assure you his rage leaves me quite cold  but this sort of nonsense does not leave me cold retorted béla who by now was in a passion of fury it makes my blood boil i tell you what ive said ive said and im not going to let any woman set her will up against mine least of all the woman who is going to be my wife whether you go or stay klara is your affair but elsa will damn well have to ask you to stay as i told her to do shell have to do as i tell her or     or what béla interposed andor quietly  béla threw him a dark and sullen look like an infuriated bull that pauses just before it is ready to charge  what is it to you he muttered savagely  only this my friend replied andor who seemed as calm as the other was heated with passion only this that i courted and loved elsa when she was younger and happier than she is now and i am not going to stand by and see her bullied and browbeaten by anyone understand  take care béla laughed klara maliciously your future wifes old sweetheart might win her from you yet  take care of what shouted béla in unbridled rage he faced andor and his one sinister eye shot a glance of deadly hatred upon him let me tell you this my friend lakatos andor i dont know where you have sprung from today or why you have chosen today to do it    and its nothing to me but understand that i dont like your presence here and that i did not invite you to come and that therefore you have no business to be here seeing that i pay for the feast and understand too that ill trouble my future wifes sweetheart to relieve her of his presence in future or therell be trouble and you may take that from me as my last word my friend understand  what an ass you are béla came as a parting shot from klara who had succeeded in opening her parasol and now stood out in the open her face and shoulders in shadow looking the picture of coolness and of goodtemper  andor she added with a pleasing smile to the young man you know your way to ignácz goldsteins father and i will be pleased to see you there at any time the young count will be there tonight and well have some tarok farewell béla she continued laughing merrily dont worry my good man its not worth losing your temper about trifles on the eve of your weddingday and bless your eyes i dont mind  then she swept a mock curtsy to elsa  farewell my pretty one good luck to you in your new life  she nodded and was gone her rippling laugh with its harsh ironical ring was heard echoing down the village street  call her back shouted béla savagely turning on his fiancée  she looked him straight in that one eye which was so full of menace and said with meek but firm obstinacy  i will not  call her back he exclaimed you     he was almost choking with rage and now he raised his clenched fist and brandished it in her face  call her back or ill     but already andor was upon him had seized him by collar and wrist he was as livid as the other man was crimson but his eyes glowed with a fury at least as passionate  and i tell you he said speaking almost in a whisper very slowly and very calmly but with such compelling power of determination that béla taken unawares halfchoked with the grip on his throat and in agonized pain with the rough turn on his wrist was forced to cower before him i tell you that if you dare touch her    look here my friend he continued more loudly just now you said that you didnt know where id sprung from today or why i chose today in which to do it well let me tell you then god in heaven sent me do you see he sent me to be here so as to see that no harm come to elsa through marrying a brute like you you have shown me the door and i dont want to eat your salt again and to take your hospitality for it would choke me i know    but let me tell you this much that if you bully elsa    if you dont make her happy    if you are not kind to her    ill make you regret it to your dying day  he had gradually relaxed his hold on bélas throat and wrist and now the latter was able to free himself altogether and to readjust his collar and the set of his coat for a moment it almost seemed as if he felt ashamed and repentant but his obstinate and domineering temper quickly got the better of this softened mood  youll make me regret it will you he retorted sullenly you think that you will be allowed to play the guardian angel here eh with all your fine talk of god in heaven which i am inclined to think even the pater would call blasphemy i know whats at the back of your mind my friend dont you make any mistake about that  you know whats at the back of my mind queried andor with a puzzled frown what do you mean  i mean said béla with a return to his former swagger that you have been saying to yourself this past halfhour oho but elsa is not married yet the vows are not yet spoken and until they are i still have my chance thats what you have been saying to yourself eh mr guardian angel  you dd liar  oh insulting me wont help you my friend and i am not going to let you provoke me into a fight and kill me perhaps for no doubt that is what you would like to do i am not going to give elsa up to you you need not think it and you cant take her from me you cant make her break her solemn promise to me without covering her with a disgrace from which she would never recover you know what happened when bakó mariska broke off her marriage on the eve of her weddingday just because lajos had got drunk once or twice though her mother whipped her for her obstinacy and her father broke his stick across her shoulders the whole countryside turned against her they all had to leave the village for no one would speak to mariska a scandal such as that the ignorant peasants round about here will never forgive mariska ultimately drowned herself in the maros when she no longer could stand the disgrace that pursued her everywhere when you thought that to make a girl break off her engagement the day before her wedding was such an easy matter you had not thought of all that had you my friend  and when you thought of frightening me by all that nonsensical talk retorted andor quietly you had not thought perhaps that there are other lands in the world besides hungary and that i am not quite such an ignorant peasant as those whom you choose to despise but you have been wasting your breath and your temper i am not here to try and persuade elsa into doing what she would think wrong but i am here to see that at least you be kind to her  pshaw ejaculated béla with a contemptuous snap of his fingers  oh you need not imagine that i wouldnt know how you treated her i would know soon enough i tell you he continued with slow and deliberate emphasis that what you do to her i shall know i shall know if you bully her i shall know if you make her unhappy i shall knowand god help you in that caseif you are not kind to her just think in future when you speak a rough word to her that lakatos andor will hear you and make you pay for every syllable think when you browbeat her that lakatos andor can see you for i will see you i tell you in spite of your turning me out of your house in spite of your fences and your walls so just you ask her pardon now for your roughness kiss her little hand and take her to vespers but take this from me my friend that if you ever dare raise your hand against your wife ill pay you out for it so help me god  he had sworn the last oath with solemn earnestness now he turned to elsa and took her cold little hand in his and kissed her trembling fingertips then without another look on the man whom he hated with such an overwhelming and deadly hatred he turned on his heel and fled precipitately from the room  béla stood sullen and silent for a moment after he had gone wrath was still heating his blood so that the veins in his forehead stood up like cords but he was not only wrathful he also felt humiliated and ashamed he had been cowed and overmastered in the presence of elsa his swagger and domineering ways had availed him nothing andor had threatened him and he had not had the pluck or the presence of mind to stand up to that meddling interfering peasant  now it was too late to do anything the thoughts of retaliation which would come to his mind later on had not yet had the time to mature all that he knew was that he hated andor and would get even with him some day for elsa he felt no hatred only a great wrath that she should have witnessed his humiliation and that her obstinacy should have triumphed against his will the same pride in her and the same loveless desire was still in him he did not hate her but he meant to make her suffer for what he had just gone through to him matrimony meant the complete subjection of the woman to the will of her lord for every rebellion for every struggle against that subjection she must be punished in accordance with the gravity of her fault  elsa had caused him to be humiliated and it was his firm resolve to humiliate her before many hours had gone by already a plan was forming in his brain the quietude of vespers would he thought help him to complete it  outside the lads and maids were loudly demanding the appearance of the bride and bridegroom the vesper bell had long ago ceased its compelling call erös béla offered his silent fiancée his arm she took it without hesitation and together they walked across the square to the church     chapter xviii  i must punish her   the little village inn kept by ignácz goldstein was not more squalid not more dark and stuffy than are the village inns of most countries in europe klara did her best to keep the place bright and clean which was no easy matter when the roads were muddy and men brought in most of the mud of those roads on their boots and deposited it on the freshlywashed floors  the taproom was low and narrow and dark round the once whitewashed walls there were rows of wooden benches with narrow trestle tables in front of them opposite the front door on a larger table were the bottles of wine and silvorium6 the jars of tobacco and black cigars which a beneficent government licensed ignácz goldstein the jew to sell to the peasantry  footnote 6 a highly alcoholic very raw ginlike spirit distilled from a special kind of plum  the little room obtained its daylight mainly from the streetdoor when it was open for the one tiny windowon the right as you enteredwas not constructed to open and its dulled glass masked more of daylight than it allowed to filtrate through  opposite the window a narrow door led into a couple of living rooms the first of which also had direct access to the street  the taproom itself was always crowded and always busy the benches round the walls were always occupied and klara and her father were never allowed to remain idle for long she dispensed the wine and the silvorium and made herself agreeable to the guests ignácz saw to the tobacco and the cigars village women in hungary never frequent the public inn when they do it is because they have sunk to the lowest depths of degradation a woman in drink is practically an unknown sight in the land  klara herself though her ways with the men were as free and easy as those of her type and class usually are would never have dreamed of drinking with any of them  this evening she was unusually busy while the wedding feast was going on lower down in the village a certain number of men who liked stronger fare than what is usually provided at a maidens farewell dance as well as those who had had no claim to be invited strolled into the taproom for a draught of silvorium a gossip with the jewess or a game of tarok if any were going  ignácz goldstein himself was fond of a game like most of his race his habits were strictly sober as he kept a cool head he usually won and his winnings at tarok made a substantial addition to the income which he made by selling spirits and tobacco leopold hirsch who kept the village grocery store was also an inveterate player and like goldstein a very steady winner but it was not the chance of a successful gamble which brought him so often to the taproom for years now he had dangled round klaras fashionable skirts and it seemed as if at last his constancy was to be rewarded while she was youngerand was still of surpassing beautyshe had had wilder flights of ambition than those which would lead her to rule over a village grocery store during those times she had allowed leopold hirsch to court her without giving him more than very cursory encouragement  as the years went on however and her various admirers from arad proved undesirous to go to the length of matrimony she felt more kindly disposed toward leo who periodically offered her his heart and hand and the joint ownership of the village grocery store she had looked into her little piece of mirror rather more closely of late than she had done hitherto and had discovered two or three ominous lines round her fine almondshaped eyes and noted that her nose showed of late a more marked tendency to make close acquaintance with her chin  then she began to ponder and to give the future more serious consideration than she had ever done before she ticked off on her long pointed fingers the last bevy of her admirers on whom she might reasonably count the son of the chemist over in arad the tenant of the kender road farm the proprietor of the station cabs and there were two or three others but they were certainly falling away and she had added no new ones to her list these past six months  erös bélas formally declared engagement to kapus elsa had been a very severe blow she had really reckoned on béla he was educated and unconventional and though he professed the usual antisemitic views peculiar to his kind klara did not believe that these were very genuine at any rate she had reckoned that her fine eyes and provocative ways would tilt successfully against the mans racial prejudices  erös béla was rich and certainly up to a point in love with her klara was congratulating herself on the way she was playing her matrimonial cards when all her hopes were so suddenly dashed to the ground  béla was going to marry that silly ignorant peasant girl and she klara would be left to marry leopold after all  her anger and humiliation had been very great and she had battled very persistently and very ably to regain the prize which she had lost she knew quite well that but for the fact that she belonged to the alien and despised race erös béla would have been only too happy to marry her his vanity alone had made him choose kapus elsa he wanted the noted beauty for himself because the noted beauty had been courted by so many people and where so many people had failed he was proud to succeed  nor would he have cared to have it said that he had married a jewess there is always a certain thought of disgrace attached to such a marriage whether it has been contracted by peer or peasant and erös bélas one dominating idea in life was to keep the respect and deference of his native village  but he had continued his attentions to klara and klara had kept a wonderful hold over his imagination and over his will she was the one woman who had ever had her will with himonly partially of course and not to the extent of forcing him into matrimonybut sufficiently to keep him also dangling round her skirts even though his whole allegiance should have belonged to elsa  the banquet this afternoon had been a veritable triumph whatever she had suffered through bélas final disloyalty to herself she knew that kapus elsa must have suffered all through the banquet the humiliation of seeing ones bridegroom openly flaunting his admiration for another woman must have been indeed very bitter to bear  not for a moment did klara goldstein doubt that the subsequent scene was an act of vengeance against herself on elsas part she judged other women by her own standard discounted other womens emotions thoughts feelings by her own she thought it quite natural that elsa should wish to be revenged just as she was quite sure that béla was already meditating some kind of retaliation for the shame which andor had put upon him and for elsas obstinacy and share in the matter  she had not spoken to anyone of the little scene which had occurred between the four walls of the little schoolroom on the contrary she had spoken loudly of both the bridegrooms and the brides cordiality to her during the banquet  elsa wanted me to go to the dancing this evening she said casually but i thought you would all miss me i didnt want this place to be dull just because half the village is enjoying itself somewhere else  it had been market day at arad and at about five oclock klara and her father became very busy cattledealers and pigmerchants travellers and pedlars dropped in for a glass of silvorium and a chat with the goodlooking jewess more than one bargain discussed on the marketplace of arad was concluded in the stuffy taproom of marosfalva  shall we be honoured by the young counts presence later on someone asked with a significant nod to klara  everyone laughed in sympathy the admiration of the noble young count for klara goldstein was wellknown there was nothing in it of course even klara vain and ambitious as she was knew that the bridge which divided the aristocrat from one of her kind and of her race was an impassable one but she liked the young counts attentionsshe liked the presents he brought her from time to time and relished the notoriety which this flirtation gave her  she also loved to tease poor leopold hirsch leo had been passionately in love with her for years what he must have endured in moral and mental torture during that time through his jealousy and often groundless suspicions no one who did not know him intimately could ever have guessed these tortures which klara wantonly inflicted upon the wretched young man had been a constant source of amusement to her even now she was delighted because as luck would have it he entered the taproom at the very moment when everyone was chaffing her about the young count  leopold hirsch cast a quick suspicious glance upon the girl and his dull olive skin assumed an almost greenish hue he was not of prepossessing appearance this he knew himself and the knowledge helped to keep his jealousy and his suspicion aflame  he was short and lean of stature and his head with its large bony features seemed too big for his narrow shoulders to carry his gingercoloured hair was lank and scanty he wore itafter the manner of those of his race in that part of the worldin corkscrew ringlets down each side of his narrow cadaverouslooking face  his eyes were pale and shifty but every now and then there shot into them a curious gleam of unbridled passionlove hate or revenge and then the whole face would light up and compel attention by the revelation of latent power  this had happened now when a fellow who sat in the corner by the window made some rough jest about the young count leopold made his way to klaras side his thin lips were tightly pressed together and he had buried his hands in the pockets of his illfitting trousers  if that accursed aristocrat comes hanging round here much more klara he muttered between set teeth ill kill him one of these days  what a fool you are leopold she said why yesterday it was erös béla you objected to  and i do still he retorted i heard of your conduct at the banquet today it is the talk of the village one by one these loutish peasants have come into my shop and told me the talecurse themof how the bridegroom had eyes and ears only for you you seem to forget klara he added while a thought of menace crept into his voice that you are tokened to me now so dont try and make a fool of me or     the lord bless you my good man she retorted with a laugh i wont try i promise you i wouldnt like to compete with the almighty who has done that for you already  klara    he exclaimed  oh be quiet now leo she said impatiently cant you see that my hands are as full as i can manage without my having to bother about you and your jealous tempers  she elbowed him aside and went to the counter to serve a customer who had just arrived and more than a quarter of an hour went by before leopold had the chance of another word with her  you might have a kind word for me tonight klara he said ruefully as soon as a brief lull in business enabled him to approach the girl  why specially tonight she asked indifferently  your father must go by the night train to kecskemét he said with seeming irrelevance there is that business about the plums  the plums she asked with a frown of puzzlement what plums  the fruit he bought near kecskemét they start gathering at sunrise tomorrow he must be there the first hour else hed get shamefully robbed he must travel by night  i knew nothing about it rejoined klara with an indifferent shrug of the shoulders father never tells me when he is going to be away from home  no retorted leopold with a sneer he knows better than to give all your gallants such a brilliant opportunity  dont be a fool leo she reiterated with a laugh  i dont give any of them an opportunity either resumed the young man while a curious look of almost animal ferocity crept into his pale face whenever your father has to be away from home during the night i take up my position outside this house and watch over you until daylight comes and people begin to come and go  very thoughtful of you my good leo she rejoined dryly but you need not give yourself the trouble i am well able to look after myself  if any man molested you continued leopold speaking very calmly i would kill him  who should molest me you silly fool and anyhow i wont have you spying upon me like that  you must not call it spying klara i love to stand outside this house in the peace and darkness of the night and to think of you quietly sleeping whilst i am keeping watch over you you wouldnt call a watchdog a spy would you  i know that tonight i shant sleep a wink she retorted crossly once father has gone i shall always be thinking of you out there in the dark watching this house it will make me nervous  tonight    he began and then abruptly checked himself once more that quick flash of passion shot through his pale deepset eyes it seemed as if he meant to tell her something which on second thoughts he decided to keep to himself her keen dark eyes searched his face for a moment or two she wondered what it was that lurked behind that high smooth forehead of his and within the depths of that curiously perverted brain  before she had time however to question him erös béla made noisy irruption into the room  he was greeted with a storm of cheers  hello béla  not the bridegroom surely  who would have thought of seeing you here  while leopold hirsch muttered audibly  what devils mischief has brought this fellow here today i wonder  béla seemed in boisterous goodhumourwith somewhat ostentatious hilarity he greeted all his friends and then ordered some of ignácz goldsteins best wine for everybody all round  bravo béla came from every side together with loud applause at this unexpected liberality  it is nice of you not to forget old friends klara whispered in his ear as soon as he succeeded in reaching her side  whew he ejaculated with a sneer you have no idea my good klara how ive been boring myself these past two hours those loutish peasants have no idea of enjoyment save their eternal gipsy music and their interminable csárdás  for a man of your education béla said klara with an insinuating smile it must be odiously dull you would far rather have had a game of cards wouldnt you now  i would far rather have had you at that infernal dance so as to have had somebody to talk to he retorted savagely  oh she said demurely that would never have done elsa must have such a lot to say to you herself it would not be seemly for me to stand in the way  elsa as you know has that silly csárdás on the brain she has been dancing ever since six oclock and has only given me about ten minutes of her company she seems to belong tonight to every young fool that can dance rather than to me  ah well when you are married you can stop all that my good béla you can forbid your wife to dance the csárdás you know i know many men who do it then elsa will learn to appreciate the pleasure of your conversation though she is no longer very young she is still very ignorant you will have to educate her    bring her up to your own level of intelligence and of learning in the meanwhile do sit down and drink with those who like yourself have come here for an hour or two to break the monotony of perpetual czigány music and dancing  she busied herself with drawing the corks of a number of bottles which she then transferred from the end of the room where she stood to the tables at which sat her customers she also brought out some fresh glasses béla watched her for a moment or two in silence unconscious of the fact that he too was being watched by a pair of pale eyes in which lurked a gleam of jealousy and of hate suddenly as klara brushed past him carrying bottles and glasses he took hold of her by the elbow and drew her close to him  these louts wont stay late tonight will they he whispered in her ear  no not late she replied they will go on to the barn in time for the supper you may be sure of that why do you ask  i will have the supper served at ten oclock he continued to whisper but ill not sit down to it not without you  dont be foolish béla she retorted but even as he spoke a little gleam of satisfaction of gratified vanity of anticipatory revenge shot through her velvety dark eyes  i warned elsa he continued sullenly i told her that if you were not at the feast i should not be there either she has disobeyed me i must punish her  so she rejoined with an acid smile it is only in order to punish elsa that you want to sup with me  dont be stupid klara he retorted ill come at ten oclock will you have some supper ready for me then i have two or three bottles of french champagne over at my houseill bring them along will you be ready for me  be silent béla she broke in hurriedly cant you see that that fool leo is watching us all the time  curse him what have i got to do with him muttered béla savagely you will be ready for me klara  no she said decisively better make your peace with elsa ill have none of her leavings ive had all i wanted out of you todaythe banquet first and now your coming here    itll be all over the village presentlyand thats all i care about have a drink now she added goodhumouredly and then go and make your peace with elsa    if you can  she turned abruptly away from him leaving him to murmur curses under his breath and went on attending to her customers nor did he get for the moment another opportunity of speaking with her for leopold hirsch hovered round her for some considerable time after that and presently with much noise and pomp and circumstance no less a personage than the noble young count himself graced the premises of ignácz goldstein the jew with his august presence     chapter xix  now go and fetch the key   he belonged to the ancient family of rákosy who had owned property on both banks of the maros for the past eight centuries and feri rákosy the twentiethcentury representative of his mediæval forbears was a goodlooking young fellow of the type so often met with among the upper classes in hungary quite something english in appearancewell setup welldressed wellgroomed from the top of his smooth brown hair to the tips of his immaculatelyshod feetin the eyes an expression of habitual boredom further accentuated by the slight affected stoop of the shoulders and a few premature lines round the nose and mouth and about his whole personality that air of highbreeding and of good pure blood which is one of the chief characteristics of the true hungarian aristocracy  he did little more than acknowledge the respectful salutations which greeted him from every corner of the little room as he entered but he nodded to erös béla and smiled all over his goodlooking face at klara who in her turn welcomed him with a profusion of smiles which brought a volley of muttered curses to leopold hirschs lips  while he held her one hand rather longer than was necessary she with the other took his hat from him and then laughing coquettishly she pointed to a parcel which was causing the pocket of his wellcut norfolk jacket to bulge immoderately  is that something for me she asked  of course it is he replied lightly i bought it at the fair in arad for you today  how thoughtful of you she said with a little sigh of pleasure  thoughtful he retorted laughing pleasantly my good klara if i hadnt thought of you i would have died of boredom this afternoon here give me a glass of your fathers best wine and ill tell you  he sat down with easy familiarity on the corner of the table which served as a counter klara after this had eyes and ears only for him how could it be otherwise seeing that it was not often a noble lord graced a village taproom with his presence conversations round the room were now carried on in whispers tarok cards were produced and here and there a game was in progress those who had drunk overmuch made themselves as inconspicuous as they could drawing themselves closely against the wall or frankly reclining across the table with arms outstretched and heads buried between them out of sight  an atmosphere of subdued animation and decorum reigned in the place not a few men oppressed by their sense of respect for my lord had effected a quiet exit through the door preferring the jovial atmosphere of the barn from whence came during certain hushed moments the sounds of music and of laughter  the young manwhose presence caused all this revulsion in the usually noisy atmosphere of the taproomtook no heed whatever of anything that went on around him he seemed unconscious alike of the deference of the peasants as of the dark menacing scowl with which leopold hirsch regarded him he certainly did not bestow a single glance on erös béla who at my lords appearance had retreated into the very darkest corner of the room béla did not care to encounter the young counts sneering remarks just nowand these would of a certainty have been levelled against the bridegroom who was sitting in a taproom when he should have been in attendance on his bride but indeed my lord never saw him  to this young scion of a noble race which had owned land and serfs for centuries past these peasants here were of no more account than his oxen or his sheepnor was the owner of a village shop of any more consequence in my lords eyes  he came here because there was a goodlooking jewess in the taproom whose conversation amused him and whose dark velvety eyes fringed with long lashes and mouth with full red lips stirred his jaded senses in a more pleasant and more decided way than did the eyes and lips of the demure wellbred young countesses and baronesses who formed his usual social circle  whether his flirtation with klara the jewess annoyed the girls jew lover or not did not matter to him one jot on the contrary the jealousy of that dirty lout hirsch enhanced his amusement to a considerable extent  therefore he did not take the trouble to lower his voice now when he talked to klara and it was quite openly that he put his arm round her waist while he held his glass to her lipsto sweeten your fathers vinegar he said with a laugh  you know my pretty klara he said gaily that i was half afraid i shouldnt see you today at all  no she asked coquettishly  no by gad my father was so softhearted to allow erös a day off for his wedding or something and so if you please i had to go to arad with him as he had to see about a sale of clover i thought we should never get back the roads were abominable  i hardly expected your lordship she said demurely  to punish her for that little lie he tweaked her small ear till it became a bright crimson  that is to punish you for telling such a lie he said gaily you know that i meant to come and say goodbye  your lordship goes tomorrow she asked with a sigh  to shoot bears my pretty klara he replied i dont want to go i would rather stay another week here for you to amuse me you know  i am proud    she whispered  so much do you amuse me that i have brought you a present just to show you that i thought of you today and because i want you not to forget me during the three months that i shall be gone  he drew the parcel out of his pocket and turning his back to the rest of the room he cut the string and undid the paper that wrapped it the contents of the parcel proved to be a morocco case which flew open at a touch and displayed a gold curb chain braceletthe dream of klara goldsteins desires  for me she said with a gasp of delight  for your pretty arm yes he replied shall i put it on  she cast a swift apprehensive glance round the room over his shoulder  no no not now she said quickly  why not  father mightnt like it id have to ask him  dn your father  and that fool leopold is so insanely jealous  dn him too said the young man quietly  whereupon he took the morocco case out of klaras hand shut it with a snap and put it back into his pocket  what are you doing cried klara in a fright  as you see pretty one i am putting the bracelet away for future use  but    she stammered  if i cant put the bracelet on your arm myself he said decisively you shant have it at all  but     that is my last word let us talk of something else  no no we wont talk of something else you said the bracelet was for me  she cast a languishing look on him through her long upper lashes she bared her wrist and held it out to him leopold and his jealousy might go hang for aught she cared for she meant to have the bracelet  the young man with a fatuous little laugh brought out the case once more with his own hands he now fastened the bracelet round klara goldsteins wrist thenas a matter of coursehe kissed her round brown arm just above the bracelet and also the red lips through which the words of thanks came quickly tumbling  klara did not dare to look across the room she felt though she did not see leopolds pale eyes watching this little scene with a glow in them of ferocious hate and of almost animal rage  i wont stay now klara said the young count dropping his voice suddenly to a whisper too many of these louts about when will you be free  oh not today she whispered in reply after the fair there are sure to be latecomers and you know erös béla has a ball on at the barn and supper afterwards     the very thing he broke in in an eager whisper while they are all at supper ill come in for a drink and a chat    ten oclock eh  oh no no she protested feebly my father wouldnt like it he     dn your father my dear as i remarked before and as a matter of fact your father is not going to be in the way at all he goes to kecskemét by the night train  how do you know that  my father told me quite casually that goldstein was seeing to some business for him at kecskemét tomorrow so it was not very difficult to guess that if your father was to be in kecskemét tomorrow in time to transact business he would have to travel up by the nine oclock train this evening in order to get there  then as she made no reply and a blush of pleasure gradually suffused her dark skin lending it additional charm and giving to her eyes added brilliancy he continued more peremptorily this time  at ten oclock thenill come back get rid of as many of these louts by then as you can  she was only too ready to yield not only was she hugely flattered by my lords attentions but she found him excessively attractive he could make himself very agreeable to a woman if he chose and evidently he chose to do so now moreover klara had found by previous experience that to yield to the young mans varied and varying caprices was always remunerative and there was that gold watch which he had once vaguely promised her and which she knew she could get out of him if she had the time and opportunity as she certainly would have tonight if he came  count feri seeing that she had all but yielded was preparing to go her hand was still in his and he was pressing her slender fingers in token of a pledge for this evening  at ten oclock he whispered again  no no she protested once more but this time he must have known that she only did it for forms sake and really meant to let him have his way the neighbours would see you enter and there might be a whole lot of people in the taproom at that hour one never knows they would know by then that my father had gone away and they would talk such scandal about me my reputation     no doubt he felt inclined to ejaculate in his usual manner dn your reputation but he thought better of it and merely said casually  i need not come in by the front door need i  the back door is always locked she remarked ingenuously my father invariably locks it himself the last thing at night  but since he is going to kecskemét    he suggested  when he has to be away from home for the night he locks the door from the inside and takes the key away with him  surely there is a duplicate key somewhere     i dont know she murmured  if you dont know who should he remarked with affected indifference well i shall have to make myself heard at the back doorthats all  how  wouldnt you hear me if i knocked  not if i were in the taproom and a lot of customers to attend to  well then i should hammer away until you did hear me  for that old gossip rézi to hear you she protested her cottage is not fifty paces away from our back door  then it will have to be the front door after all he rejoined philosophically  no nothe neighboursand perhaps the taproom full of people  but dn it klara he exclaimed impatiently i have made up my mind to come and spend my last evening with youand when i have made up my mind to a thing i am not likely to change it because of a lot of gossiping peasants because of old rézi or the whole lot of them so if you dont want me to come in by the front door which is open or to knock at the back door which is locked how am i going to get in  i dont know  well then youll have to find out my pretty one he said decisively for it has got to be done somehow or that gold watch we spoke of the other day will have to go to somebody else and you know when i say a thing i mean it eh  there is a duplicate key she whispered shyly    to the back door i mean  i thought there was he remarked dryly where is it  in the next room    it hangs on a nail by fathers bedside  go and get it then he said more impatiently  not now she urged leopold is looking straight at you and me  he shrugged his aristocratic shoulders  you are not afraid of that monkey he said with a laugh  well no not exactly afraid but he is so insanely jealous one never knows what kind of mischief hell get into he told me just now that whenever father is away from home he takes his stand outside this house from nightfall till morningwatching  a modern arguseh  a modern lunatic she retorted  well resumed the young man lightly lunatic or not he wont be able to keep an eye on you tonight even though your father will be away  how do you mean  hirsch is off to fiume in half an hour  to fiume  yes you know he has a brother coming home from america  i know that  his ship is due in at fiume the day after tomorrow leopold must start by the same train as your father tonight in order to catch the express for fiume at budapesth tomorrow  did he tell you all that  i have known all along that he meant to meet his brother at fiume and yesterday he said something about it again so you see my pretty one that we can have a comfortable little supper this evening without fear of interruption well have it at ten oclock when the supperparty is going on at the barn eh we shant be interrupted then so give me that duplicate key will you and i can slip in quietly through the back door without raising a bit of gossip or scandal hurry up now i shall have to be going  i cant now she protested leopold hasnt taken his eyes off me all this time  oh if that is all that is troubling you my dear said the young man coolly i can easily settle our friend leopold hirsch he called loudly  my lord queried the other with the quick obsequiousness habitual to the downtrodden race  my horse is kicking up such a row outside i wish youd just go and see if the boy is looking after him properly  of course it was impossible to do anything but obey my lord had commanded in the ordinary way the poor jew shopkeeper would have felt honoured to have been selected for individual recognition nor did he do more now than throw one of those swift looks of hisso full of hatred and of menaceupon klara and the young man but the latter having given his orders no longer condescended to take notice of the jew and had once more engaged the girl in animated conversation  had klara thought of looking up when leopold finally obeyed my lords commands and went to look after the horse she could not have failed to realize the danger which lurked in the young mans pale eyes then his face always pale and olivetinted was now the colour of ashes grey and livid and blotched with purple his lips looked white and quivering and his eyebrowsof a reddish tingemet above his nose in a deep dark scowl  but my lord had thrown out a casual hint about a gold watch and klara had no further thought for her jealous admirer  now go and fetch the key said count feri as soon as the door had closed on leopold  the hint of the gold watch had stirred klaras pulses a têteàtête with my lord was moreover greatly to her liking he could be very amusing when he chose and was always generous and klaras life was often dull and colourless a pleasant evening spent in his company would compensate her in a measure for her disappointment at not being asked to elsas ball and there was the gold watch to look forward to above all  taking an opportunity when her father was absorbed in his game of tarok she went into the next room and presently returned with a key in her hand which she surreptitiously gave to my lord  splendid exclaimed the young man gaily klara you are a gem and after supper you shall just ask me for anything you have a fancy for and ill give it to you now id better go goodbye little one ten oclock sharp eh  ten oclock she repeated under her breath  he strode to the door outside which he found leopold waiting for him  the horse was quite quiet my lord said the jew sullenly the boy had never left it for a moment  oh thats all right hirsch rejoined my lord indifferently i only wanted to know  of course he never thought of saying a word of thanks or of excuse to the other man what would you a jew bah not even worth a nod of the head  count feri rákosy had quickly mounted his pretty halfbred arab marea click of the tongue and she was off with him kicking up a cloud of dust in her wake  but leopold hirsch had remained for a moment standing on the doorstep of ignácz goldsteins house he watched horse and rider through that cloud of dust and along the straight and broad highway until both had become a mere speck upon the lowlying horizon  may you break your accursed neck he muttered fervently  then he went back to the taproom     chapter xx  you happen to be of my race and of my blood   he strode at once to klara who greeted him with an ironical little smile and a coquettish look out of her dark eyes  you never told me that you were going away tonight my dear leopold she said suavely  who told you that i was he retorted savagely  it seems to be pretty well known about the place you seemed to have been talking about it pretty freely that you were going to fiume to meet your brother when the ship he is on comes in  i meant to tell you just now only his lordships arrival interrupted me he said more quietly  and since then you have been busy making a fool of yourself before my lord eh she asked  bah  and compromising me into the bargain what but let me tell you this my good leopold before we go any further that i am not married to you yet and that i dont like your airs of proprietorship sabe  he could not say anything more just then for customers were departing and she had to attend to them he did not try to approach her while she was thus engaged but presently when her back was turned he contrived to work his way across to the door which gave on the inner room and to push it slightly open with his hand until he could peep through the aperture and take a quick survey of the room beyond  klara had not seen this manoeuvre of his although she had cast more than one rapid and furtive glance upon him while she attended to her customers she was thankful that he was going away for a few days in his present mood he was positively dangerous  she had lighted the oil lamp which hung from the centre of the low raftered ceiling the hour was getting late customers were all leaving now one by one  erös béla was one of the last to go  he had drunk rather more silvorium than was good for him he knew quite well that by absenting himself from the prenuptial festivals he had behaved in a disgraceful and unjustifiable manner which would surely be resented throughout the village and though he was quite sure that he did not care one brass fillér what all those ignorant peasants thought of him yet he felt it incumbent upon him to brace up his courage now before meeting the hostile fusillade of eyes which would be sure to greet him on his return to the barn  he meant to put in a short appearance there and then to finish his evening here in klaras company he felt that his dignity demanded that he should absent himself at any rate from the supper seeing that elsa had so grossly defied him  at ten oclock ill be back klara he whispered in the girls ear as he was about to take his departure along with some of his friends who also intended to go on to the dance in the barn  indeed you wont she retorted decisively i have no use for you my good béla you are almost a married man now remember she added with a laugh  ill bring those bottles of champagne he urged dont be hard on me klara ill give you a good time tonight and a nice present into the bargain  and ruin my reputation for ever eh by walking into the taproom when its full of people and carrying two bottles of champagne under your armor staying on ostentatiously after everyone has gone and for everyone to gossip no thank you ive already told you that i am not going to lend myself to your little games of vengeance it isnt me you want its petty revenge upon elsa to that i say no thank you my good man  klara he pleaded  no she said and unceremoniously turned her back on him  he went off sullen and morose and not a little chaffed for his moroseness by his friends  the taproom was almost deserted for the moment in one or two corners only a few stragglers lingered they were sprawling across the tables with arms outstretched ignácz goldsteins silvorium had proved too potent and too plentiful they lay there in a drunken sleeplogs that were of no account presently they would have to be thrown out but there was no hurry for thatthey were not in the way  ignácz goldstein had gone into the next room klara was busy tidying up the place leopold approached her with wellfeigned contrition and humility  i am sorry klara he said i seemed to have had the knack tonight of constantly annoying you so id best begone now perhaps  i bear no malice leo she said quietly  i thought id come back at about nine oclock he continued it is nearly eight now  she thinking that he had his own journey in mind remarked casually  youd best be here well before nine the train leaves at ninetwenty and father walks very slowly  i wont be late he said best give me the key of the back door ill let myself in that way  no occasion to do that she retorted the front door will be open you can come in that way like everybody else  its just a fancy he said quietly there might be a lot of people about just then i dont want to come through here i thought id just slip in the back way as i often do so give me the key klara will you  how can i give you the key of the back door she said equally quietly you know father always carries it in his coat pocket  but there is a second key he remarked which hangs on a nail by your fathers bedside in the next room give me that one klara  i shant she retorted i never heard such nonsense as if i could allow you to use the private door of this house just as it suits your fancy if you want to come in tonight and say goodbye you must come in by the front door  its just a whim of mine klara urged leopold now still speaking quietlyalmost under his breathbut there was an ominous tremor in his voice and sudden sharp gleams in his eyes which the girl had already noted and which caused the blood to rush back to her heart leaving her cheeks pale and her lips trembling  nonsense she contrived to say with an indifferent shrug of the shoulders  just a whim he reiterated so ill take the key by your leave  he turned to the door of the inner room and pushed it open just as he had done awhile ago and nowas thenhe cast a rapid glance round the room  klara through halfclosed lids watched his every movement  why he exclaimed turning back to her and with a look of wellfeigned surprise the key is not in its place  i know it isnt she retorted curtly  then where is it  i have put it away  when it was hanging on its usual nail when i first came here this afternoon i remember the door being open and my glancing into the room casually i am sure it was there then  it may have been but i put it away after that  why should you have done that  i dont know and anyhow its no business of yours is it  give me that backdoor key klara insisted the young man in a tone of savage command  no she replied slowly and decisively  there was silence in the little low raftered room after that a silence only broken by the buzzing of flies against the white globe of the lamp and by the snores of the sleepers who sprawled across the tables  leopold hirsch had drawn in his breath with a low hissing sound his face by the yellow light of the lamp looked ghastly in colour and his hands were twitching convulsively as the trembling fingers clenched and opened with a monotonous jerky movement of attempted selfcontrol  klara had not failed to notice these symptoms of an agony of mind which the young man was so vainly trying to hide from her for the moment she almost felt sorry for himsorry and slightly remorseful  after all leos frame of mind the agony which he endured came from the strength of his love for her neither erös béla nor the young count nor the many admirers who had hung round her in the past until such time as their fancy found more permanent anchorage elsewhere would have suffered tortures of soul and of heart because she had indulged in a mild flirtation with a rival erös béla would have stormed and cursed the young count would have laid his ridingwhip across the shoulders of his successful rival and there would have been an end of the matter leopold hirsch would go down to hell and endure the torments of the damned then return to heaven at a smile from her and go back to hell again and glory in his misery  but just now she was frightened of him he looked almost like a living corpse the skin on his face was drawn so tightly over the bones that it gave him the appearance of a skull with hollow eyes and wide grinning mouth  outside an owl hooted dismally klara gave a slight shiver of fear and looked furtively round her to see if any of the drunkards were awake then she recollected that her father was in the next room and presently from afar came shouts of laughter and the sound of music  she woke as from a nightmare gave her fine shoulders a little shake and looked boldly into her jealous lovers face  by the lord leo she said with a little forced laugh you have given me the creeps looking as you do how dare you frighten me like that with your clenched hands too as if you wanted to murder me there now dont be such a silly fool you have got a long journey before you its no use making yourself sick with jealousy just before you go  i am not going on a journey he said in a toneless even voice which seemed to come from a grave  not going she said with a frown of puzzlement you were going to fiume to meet your brother dont you remember the ship he is on is due in the day after tomorrow if you dont start tonight you wont be able to catch the express at budapesth tomorrow  i know all that he said in the same dull monotonous tone i am not going thats all  but     i have changed my mind your father is going away i must watch over you to see that no one molests you thieves might want to break in    one never knows    anyhow my brother can look after himself    i stay to look after you  for a moment or two she stood quite still her senses strained to grasp the meaning the purport of the present situationthis madman on the watch outsidethe young count key in hand swaggering up to the back door at ten oclock when most folk would be at supper in the barn her father gone the village street wrapped in darkness  leopold by a violent and sudden effort had regained mastery over the muscles of his face and hands these no longer twitched now and he answered her look of mute inquiry with one of wellfeigned quietude only his breath he could not control it passed through his throat with a stertorous sound and every now and then he had to pass his tongue over his dry cracked lips  thus they stood for a moment eye to eye and what she read in his glance caused a nameless fear to strike at her heart and to paralyse her will but the next instant she had recovered her presence of mind with quick febrile movements she had already taken off her apron and with her hands smoothed her unruly dark hair then she made for the door  less than a second and already he had guessed her purpose before she could reach the door he had his back against it and his nervy fingers had grasped her wrist  where are you going  out she said curtly  what for  thats none of your business  what for he reiterated hoarsely  let go my wrist she exclaimed you are hurting me  ill hurt you worse he cried in a broken voice if you cross this threshold tonight  but he released her wrist and she wrathful indignant terrified retreated to the other end of the room  go out by the back door he sneered if you want to go out you have the key havent you  my father    she began  yes he said go and tell your father that i leopold hirsch your affianced husband am browbeating youmaking a scene whatbecause you have made an assignation with my lord the young count hereat nightunder your fathers roofunder the roof of a child of israel you an assignation with a dirty christian    bah go and tell your father that and he will thrash you to within an inch of your life we are jews he and i and hold the honour of our women sacredmore sacred than their life  dont be a fool leopold she cried feeling that indeed between her father and this madman her life had ceased to be safe she looked round her helplessly three or four besotted fools lying helpless across the tables and all the village dancing and making merry some two hundred mètres away her fatherimplacable as she well knew where her conduct was concernedand this madman ready to kill to satisfy his lust of vengeance and of hateshe felt that indeed unless heaven performed a miracle here was the beginning of an awful an irredeemable tragedy  leopold dont be a fool she reiterated trying with all her might not to appear frightened or scared or confused i have promised kapus elsa to go to her dance for half an hour i had forgotten all about it i must go now  go and change your dress then he retorted with a sneer then you can go out by the back way you have put the key away somewhere havent you you know where it is  you are mad about doors tonight i tell you i am going out now by that front doorat once  and i tell you he said slowly and deliberately that if you cross the front door step i will call your father and tell him that you go and meet your lovera christian loverthe young countwho would as soon think of marrying you as he would a nigger or a kitchen slut before you will have reached the high road your father and i will be on your heels and either he or i will strangle you ere you come within sight of my lords castle  you are mad she cried or else an idiot  better look for that backdoor key he retorted  what has the backdoor key to do with it she asked sullenly  only this he replied that while that monkeyfaced dog of a christian was whispering to you just now i know that the key was hanging on its usual peg but i heard something about supper and about ten oclock may he break his neck i say and save me the job then he ordered me out of the room oh i guessed i am no fool you know when i came back i looked into your fathers roomthe key was gone and i knew and what i say is why cant he come in by the front door like a man if he has nothing to hide why must you let him come in like a thief by a backdoor if you have nothing to be ashamed of the taproom is open to anybody anybody can walk in and get a drink if they want to then why this whispering and this sneaking  he was working himself up to a greater and ever greater passion of fury he kept his voice low because he didnt want ignácz goldstein to hearnot just yet at any ratefor ignácz was a hard man and a stern father and god only knew what he might not do if he was roused leopold did not want klara hurtnot yet at any ratenot until he was quite sure that she meant to play him altogether false she was vain and frivolous overfond of dress and of queening it over the peasant girls of the village but there was no real harm in her she was immensely flattered by the young counts attentions and overready to accept his presents in exchange for kisses and whisperings behind closed doors but there was no real harm in herso at least leopold hirsch kept repeating to himself time and again whenever jealousy gnawed at his heart more roughly than he could endure  just now that torment was almost unbearable and the passion of fury into which he had worked himself blinded him momentarily to the dull aching pain klara as he spoke thus hoarsely and brought his contorted face closer and closer to hers had gradually shrunk more and more into the corner of the room and there she remained now flattened against the wall her wideopen terrorfilled eyes fixed staringly upon this raving madman  you asked just now he continued in the same hoarse guttural whisper which seemed literally to be racking and tearing his throat as it came what the backdoor key had to do with my not going to meet my brother at fiume well it has this much to do with it that you happen to be my tokened wife that you happen to be of my race and of my blood a sober cleanliving jewess please god and not one of those frivolous emptyheaded christian girlsyou are that now i know if you were not i would kill you first and myself afterwards therefore if tonight i catch a thiefany thief i dont care who he issneaking into this house by a back door when you happen to be here alone and seemingly unprotected if i catch any kind of thief or malefactor i say     he paused and she through teeth that chattered contrived to murmur  well what do you say why dont you go on  because you understand he said with calm as sudden and as terrible as his rage had been awhile ago i am not a christian you know nor yet a gentleman i cannot walk up either to my lords castle or to one of these christian magyar peasants and strike him in the face for trying to rob me of that which is more precious to me than life i am a jew    a lowborn miserable jew whose whole race origin and upbringing are despicable in the sight of the noble lords as well as of the hungarian peasantry just a wretched creature whom one orders to hold ones horse to brush ones boots to stand out of ones way anyhow but not to meet as man to man not to fight openly and frankly for the woman whom one loves well you happen to be a jewess too and tokened to a jew and if either my lord or one of these dd magyar peasants chooses to come sneaking round you like a thief in the night well     he paused and from the pocket of his shabby trousers he half drew out a long sheathed huntingknife and then quickly hid it again from her sight  klara smothered a desperate cry of terror leopold now turned his back on her he went up to the table and seizing a carafe of water he poured himself out a huge mugful and drank it down at a draught the edge of the mug rattled against his teeth his hand was trembling so that half the contents were poured down on his clothes he did not look again on klara but having put the mug down he passed his hand once or twice across his forehead as if to chase away some of those horrible thoughts which were still lurking in his brain  then he took his cigarettecase out of his pocket selected a cigarette struck a match and lit it still avoiding klaras fixed and staring gaze  ill go and smoke this outside he said quietly i can see both doors from the corner when you have found that backdoor key you may go to elsa kapus wedding feast but not before  he took a final look round the room and his eyes which had once more become dull and pale rested with an infinite look of contempt upon the two or three besotted drunkards who throughout this scene had done no more than open and blink a sleepy eye  shall i turn these louts out for you now he asked  no no she replied mechanically let them have their sleep when they wake theyll go away all right  just then the outer door was opened and lakatos andors broad figure appeared upon the threshold leopold hirsch gave him a nod and without another look on klara he strode out into the night     chapter xxi  jealous like a madman   i came to see if béla was still here said andor as soon as the door had closed on leopold hirsch one or two chaps whom i met awhile ago told me that he had not been seen in the barn this hour past and that there was a lot of talk about it i thought that if he were here i could persuade you     he paused and looked more keenly at the girl  what is it klara he asked you seem ill or upset     she closed her eyes once or twice like someone just waking out of a dream then she passed her hands over her forehead and over her hair she felt completely dazed and stupid as if she had received a stunning blow on the head and while andor talked she looked at him with staring eyes not understanding a word that he said  yesyes andor she said vaguely what can i do for you  nothing much my good klara he replied it was only about béla     yesabout béla she stammered wont    wont you sit down  thank you i will for a moment  she moved forward in order to get him a chair but she found that she could not stand the moment that she relinquished the prop of the wall her knees gave way under her and she lurched forward against the table she would have fallen had not andor caught her and guided her to a chair whereon she sank half fainting with eyes closed and cheeks and lips the colour of ashes  just for the moment the wild thought flew through his mind that she had been induced to drink by one of the men but a closer look on her wan pale face and into those dilated eyes of hers convinced him that the girl was in real and acute mental distress  he went up to the table and poured out a mug of wine which he held to her lips she drank eagerly looking up at him the while with a strangely pathetic eagerly appealing gaze  when he had taken the mug from her and replaced it on the table he drew a chair close to her and said as kindly as he could for he did not feel very welldisposed toward the girl who was the cause of much unhappiness to elsa  now klara you are going to tell me what is the matter with you  but already she had recovered herself a little and lakatos andors somewhat dictatorial tone grated upon her sensitive ear  theres nothing the matter with me she retorted with a return of her habitual flippancy what should be the matter  i dont know he said dryly and of course if you tell me that its a private affair of your own and none of my business why ill be quite satisfied and not ask any more questions but if its anything to do with béla     no of course not she broke in impatiently what should béla have to do with my affairs béla has been gone from here this hour past  and he is not coming back asked andor searchingly  i trust not she replied fervently and the young man noticed that the staring terrorfilled look once more crept into her eyes  very well then he said rising that is all i wanted to know i am sorry to have disturbed you goodnight klara  goodnight she murmured  he turned to go and already his hand was on the latch of the door when an involuntary cry like a desperate appeal escaped her lips  andor  what is it he said speaking over his shoulder  he didnt like the girl she had been offensive and insolent to elsa the cause of elsas tears but just now when he turned back in answer to that piteous call from her she looked so forlorn so pathetic so terrified that all the kindliness and chivalry which are inherent in the true magyar peasant rose up in his heart to plead on her behalf  you were quite right just now andor she murmured i am in troublein grave terrible trouble     is there anything i can do to help you he asked no no dont get up he added hurriedly for she had tried to rise and obviously was still unable to stand just stay where you are and ill come and sit near you is there anything i can do to help you  yes she whispered under her breath  what is it  i dont know what youll think of me  never mind what i think he said a little impatiently if theres anything i can do to help you in your trouble ill do it but of course i can do nothing unless you tell me all about it  she was trying to make up her mind to tell him but it was desperately difficult  she had always been so careful of her reputationso careful that not a breath of real scandal should fall on her she of the downtrodden race the jewess whom even the meanest of the peasant girls thought it her right to despise had been doubly careful not to give any loophole for gossip she flirted with all the men of courseopenly and sometimes injudiciously as in the case of erös béla on the eve of his weddingday but up to now she had never given any cause for scandal nor anyone the right to look down on her for any other reason but that of her race and blood which she could not help  it was hard therefore to have to own to something that distinctly savoured of intrigue and this to a man who she felt had no cause to be her friend but the situation was desperate there was that madman outside god only knew of what he would be capable if he found that his jealous suspicions had some measure of foundation and the young countready to walk presently without thought of coming danger into the very clutches of that lunatic  that of course was unthinkable there had been murder in leos pale eyes when he fingered that awfullooking knife the girl felt that such a risk could not be run even the good opinion of the entire village became as nothing in her mind  and of course there was the hope and chance that andor would be chivalrous enough to hold his tongue the young mans keen eyes had watched every phase of the conflict which was so distinctly reflected in the jewesss mobile face he waited patiently until he saw determination gradually asserting its sway over her hesitation the girl interested him and she was evidently in great trouble though he had no liking for her he was anxious to know what had disturbed her so terribly and genuinely intended to be of use to her he had no doubt that the trouble had something to do with leopold hirsch everyone knew the latters jealous disposition and andor had not been home half a day before he had heard plenty of gossip on the subject  well klara he asked quietly after awhile when he saw that she appeared to be more calm and more able to speak coherently you dont deny that you are in trouble    you have half made up your mind to tell me    well then out with it    what is it  only that leopold is a swine she blurted out roughly  why what has he done  jealous she said like a madman  oh  and im at my wits end andor she moaned appealingly i dont know what to do  hadnt you better tell me then  she threw back her head and looked him squarely in the face with a sudden determination to end the present agonizing suspense at all costs  it is about young count feri  my lord he exclaimedfor indeed up to this last moment he had been quite sure in his mind that her trouble had to do with erös béla and with her impudent flirtation of this afternoon  yes she said sullenly hes a little sweet on me you knowhe admires me and thinks me amusinghe likes to come here sometimes when he gets tired of starchy countesses and baronesses over at his castle he means no harm she added fiercely and if leo wasnt such a beast     he has found you out has he commented andor dryly  not exactly there was nothing to find out but count feri wanted to come and see me this evening to say goodbye as he is off tomorrow for some weeks to shoot bears he couldnt come till about ten oclock and didnt want to be seen walking into the taproom at that hour of the night there is the back door you know she continued talking a little excitedly and volubly which my father always keeps locked and the key in his pocket and count feri wanted me to give him the duplicate key so that he could slip in that way unobserved  hm mused andor what would your father have said to that  father is going to kecskemét presently by the nine oclock train  and leopold  leopold was going with him he was to have gone to fiume with the express tomorrow to meet his brother who is coming home from america  welland      well he has changed his mind he is not going to fiume he was watching me all the afternoon like a regular spy people had told him that at the banquet today erös béla had been very attentive so one of his jealous fits was on him  not without cause i imagine said andor with a sarcastic laugh  of course you would stick up for him she retorted men always band themselves together against an unfortunate girl but leo has behaved like a brute he watched me while my lord was talking to me and caught snatches of our conversation then my lord sent him out of the room to look after his horse whilst he pressed me to give him the key of the back door  i understand  how could i guess that leopold would be such a swine it seems that when he came back he peeped into fathers room and noticed at once that the key was gone he guessed of coursenow he has threatened to tell father if i attempt to go out of this house he wont let me out of his sight and yet i must go and give count feri a warning and get that key back from him if leo tells father father will half kill me and already leo has threatened to strangle me if he finds me on the high road on my way to the castle my lord suspects nothing of course    she added while tears of impotence and of terror choked the words in her throat hell come here presently and as like as not leopold will do for him  she burst into a passionate fit of weeping andor waited quietly until the first paroxysm of sobs had subsided and she could hear what he said then he remarked quite quietly  as like as not as you say  but i wont have him hurt she murmured through her tears leo would kill him for sure you dont know andor what leopold is like when the jealous rage is in him he is outside this house now watching and there he will stand and wait and watch and he will waylay count feri when he comes and stab him with a hideous knife which he always carries in his pocket oh its horrible she moaned horrible i dont know what to do what can i do andor tell me what can i do  what would you like to do he asked more gently for indeed the girls grief and terror were pitiable to behold  run over to the castle she replied and get the key back from count feri and tell him on no account to come tonight it is only a step i could be back here in half an hour and father is asleep in the next room i should be back before he need start for the station but leopold is watching outside he declared that he would strangle me or else tell father if i set foot outside this house he is a brute isnt he  well you see my dear klara i understand that you are tokened to leopold now and a man has a way of thinking that his affianced wife is his own and not for other men to hang round her and make a fool of him  curse him she muttered savagely ill never marry him after this  oh yes you will he retorted with a light laugh youll like him all the better presently for these outbursts of jealousy a woman often gets fondest of the man she fears the most but in the meanwhile you are at your wits ends eh my pretty klara you cant think of any way out of your present difficulty what and tonight at ten oclock there will be an awful scandal and worsemurder perhapsand where will you be after that eh my pretty klara even if your father does not break his stick over your shoulders youll have anyhow to leave this village for the village will be too hot to hold you and as your father does mighty good business at marosfalva he will not look too kindly on the daughter who by her scandalous conduct has driven him to seek a precarious fortune elsewhere the situation certainly is a desperate one for you my pretty one what  you need not tell me all that andor she said sullenly dont i know it  it seems to me he continued slowly and deliberately that there never was a woman before quite so desperately in need of a friend as you are eh klara  i have no friend she murmured  a friend i mean who would go and do your errand for you over at the castle whatand warn his young and noble lordship not to show his aristocratic face in marosfalva tonight  i havent such a friend andor unless you     well you dont want me to go out and kill leopold hirsch do you he said dryly  of course not  or engage him in a brawl while you run round to the castle  it would be no good hed only tell father she said while a shiver ran through her body and they would kill me on my return  exactly what you want is to stay here quite quietly just as if nothing had happened whilst the friend of whom i spoke just now went and got back that key which is causing so much trouble  yes yes thats what i want andor she cried eagerly and if you     stop a bit he broke in quietly i didnt say that i was that friend did i  then you are only tormenting me it isnt kind when im in such trouble  i didnt mean to torment you klara he said more softly i will even go so far as to say that i might be that useful friend you understand  yes youll make conditions for doing that friendly act for me i understand well enough she said still speaking with fierce sullenness what are your conditions she asked  look here klara he replied earnestly a bargain is a bargain isnt it i will get you out of this trouble and whats more ill hold my tongue about it but you leave erös béla alone    understand  what do you mean  oh you know well enough what i mean he said almost roughly now for the name of erös béla which he himself had brought into this matter had at once conjured up in his mind the painful visions of this afternoonelsas tears her humiliation and unhappinessand had once more hardened his heart against the woman who had been the cause of it all you know well enough what i mean erös béla is full of vanity your attentions today pleased him and he neglected elsa as he had no right to do now i dont say for a moment that you meant any harm it was only your vanity that was pleasantly tickled too but you made elsa unhappy and that is what i mean when i say that a bargain is a bargain if i get you out of your trouble tonight you must leave erös béla severely alone in the future  you are a fine one to preach she retorted with a harsh laugh as if you werent in love with elsa though elsa will be bélas wife tomorrow  my being in love with elsa has nothing to do with the matter nor am i preaching to you you want me to do you a service and ive told you my price you can accept it or not as you please  i cant help erös béla running after me came as a final sullen protest from the girl  then you will have to try and help it thats all he said emphatically if you want me to help you  she said nothing for a moment whilst her dark eyes searched his own trying to see how much determination lay behind that sternlooking face of his then she murmured gently  and if i promise    what you want me to promise andor    will you go and see count feri at once  a promise isnt enough he said  an oath then  yes an oath  and you will bring me back that abominable key and tell count feri just what has happened  if you will swear he insisted  yes yes i will swear she cried eagerly now for indeed a heavy load had been lifted off her heart and her natural buoyancy of temperament was already reasserting its sway over her terrors and agony of mind what do you want me to say  swear by almighty god he said earnestly to leave erös béla alone never to flirt with him or do anything to cause elsa the slightest unhappiness  i swear it by almighty god she said solemnly and you need not be afraid she added slowly i will not break my oath  no i am not afraid that you will for if you do    well we wont talk about that he continued more lightly i suppose there isnt much time to be lost  no no there isnt she urged and dont make straight for the main road go up the village first and then back through the fields leopold might suspect somethingone never knows  all right klara ill do my best we can but pray that i shall find my lord at home in which case i can be back in twenty minutes ill pick up a friend or even two when i return as then we can all walk into the taproom together it wont be so conspicuous as if i came in alone what is the time now he asked  she went to the partition door opened it and peeped into her fathers room  just ten minutes to nine she said father will have gone by the time you come back  thatll be as well wont it he concluded as he finally turned to go if you are not in the taproom when i come back what shall i do with the key  she pointed to a small brass tray which stood on the table in among the litter of bottles glasses mugs and tobaccojars  just on there she said then if i come into the room later i can see it there at a glance and oh what a relief it will be  the colour had come back to her cheeks indeed she felt marvellously cheerful now and reassured she knew that andor would fulfil his share of the bargain and the heavy cloud of trouble and of terror would be permanently lifted from her within the next halfhour  in her usual lighthearted frivolous way she blew a kiss to andor but the young man without looking again on her had already opened the door and the next moment he had gone out into the dark night on his errand of friendship     chapter xxii  i go where i shall be more welcome   in the meanwhile in the barn time had been flying along on the wings of enjoyment ever since six oclock when vespers were well over and the gipsies had struck up the first csárdás merry feet had been tripping it almost incessantly  it is amazing what a capacity the young hungarian peasantman or womanhas for footing the national dance with intervals of singing and of gossiping these young folk in the barn had been going on for over three hours  and they were not even beginning to get tired to the hungarian peasants be it remembered the csárdás is not merely a dance though they enjoy the movement of course the exhilaration and the excitement of the music just as all healthy young animals would enjoy gambolling on a meadow there is a deeper meaning to these children of the plains in the sweet sad strains of their songs and in the mazes and intricacies of their dance  they put their whole life their entire sentiment for country and sweetheart in the music and in the dance and the music and the dance give outward expression to their feelings speak in the language of poetry which they feel well enough but which their untutored tongue cannot frame  a hungarian peasant in sorrow or distress will probably like his western prototype seek to drown his grief in drink far be it from his chroniclers mind to suggest that his sentiments are more elevated than those of the peasantry of other nations or his morality more sound he will get drunk too like men of other nations but he will do it to the accompaniment of music the gipsy band must be there when he is in trouble or in joyone or two fiddles perhaps a clarionet always a czimbalomjust these few instruments to play his favourite songs they dont ease his sorrow but they help to soothe it by bringing tears to his eyes and softening the bitterness of his grief  and in joy he will invariably dance when he is in love he will dance for the csárdás helps him to explain to the girl whom he loves exactly what he feels for her and she understands one csárdás will reveal to a hungarian village maid the state of her lovers heart far more clearly than do all the whisperings behind hedges in more civilized lands  it was in the csárdás five years ago that elsa had learned from andor how much he loved her it was during the mazes of the dance that she was able to overcome her shyness and tell him mutely that she loved him in return  and now it was in the csárdás that she was bidding farewell today to her girlhood and to the companions of her youth to jenö and móritz who had loved her ardently and hopelessly these past two years and who must henceforth become to her mere friends it was in the turns and the twirls with the wild music marking step that she conveyed all that there was in her simple heart of regret for the past and cheerful anticipation for the future  elsa was a perfect dancer it was a joy to have her for a partner and she was indefatigable this afternoon it seemed as if living fire was in her blood her cheeks glowed her eyes shone like darkblue stars she gave herself neither rest nor respite determined to enjoy every minute of the day she had forcibly put behind her the sorrowful incidents of the afternoon she would not remember and she would not think  andor was not here and as the spirit of music and of dancing crept more and more into her brain she almost got to the stage of believing that his appearance today had only been a dream nor would she look to see if erös béla were here  she knew that he had gone off soon after dancing began he had slipped away quietly and at first no one had noticed his absence he had always professed a lofty contempt for gipsy music and for the csárdás a contempt which has of late come into fashion in hungary among the upper classes and has unfortunately been aped by those whose socalled education has only succeeded in obliterating the fine national spirit of the past without having the power to graft more modern western culture into this oriental race  erös béla belonged to this same supercilious set and had made many enemies by his sarcastic denunciations of things that were almost thought sacred in marosfalva it was therefore quite an understood thing that the moment a csárdás was struck up erös béla at once went to seek amusement elsewhere  of course today was a very different occasion to the more usual village entertainments today he should have thought of nothing but his fiancées pleasure she was overfond of dancing and looked a picture when she danced it was clearly a bridegrooms duty under these circumstances to stand by and watch his fiancée with all the admiration that should be filling his heart  after the wedding if he disapproved of the csárdás why of course he could forbid his wife to dance it and there would be an end of the matter today he was still the groom the servant of his fiancéetomorrow only would he become her master  but everyone was so intent upon enjoyment that a long time went by before gossip occupied itself exclusively with erös bélas absence from his prenuptial feast when once it began it raged with unusual bitterness the scandal during the banquet was being repeated now béla was obviously sitting in the taproom of the inn flirting with the jewess when he should have been in attendance on his bride  elsa could not help but hear the comments that were being made by all the mothers and fathers and older people who were not dancing and who therefore had plenty of leisure for talk all the proprieties were being outragedso it was declaredand elsa who might have married so well at one time was indeed now an object of pity  she hated to hear all this talk and felt hideously ashamed that people should be pitying her vainly did she try to get some measure of comfort from her mother kapus irma irritated by the looks of commiseration which were being levelled at her daughter dubbed the latter a fool for not having the sense to know how to keep her bridegroom by her side  it was past eight oclock before béla put in an appearance at all  a csárdás was in full swing the compact group of dancers was crowded round the musicians platform for the csárdás can only be properly danced under the very bowas it wereof the gipsy leader the barn looked gaily lighted up with oillamps swinging down from the rafters above and it had been most splendidly decorated for the occasion with festoons of paper flowers and tricolour flags petticoats and ribbons were flying little feet in red leather boots were kicking up clouds of dust  there was no moon tonight the sky was heavy with clouds so the village street had been very dark erös béla blinked as he entered the barn so dazzling did the picture present itself to his gaze  and there was such an atmosphere of merriment and of animation about the place that instinctively bélas thoughts flew back to the dismal and dingy little taproom whence he had just come with a few drunken fellows sprawling in corners and leopold hirschs ugly face leering out of the shadows  here everyone was gay and goodtempered the gipsies scraped their fiddles till one would have thought their arms would break the young people danced the men shouted and sang it was a pandemonium of giddiness and music and laughter  and béla as he blinked and looked upon the scene remembered that he had paid for it all he had paid for the hire of the barn the music and the lighting he had paid for the lavish supper which would be served presently and as he had had more silvorium to drink in the taproom than was altogether good for the clearness of his brain he fell to thinking that he ought now to be received and welcomed with all the deference which his lavishness deserved he thought that the young people should have left off dancing when he appeared and should have greeted him as they would undoubtedly have greeted my lord the count had the latter deigned to come  and what after all was my lord on such an occasion in comparison with the donor of the feast  even elsathough she must of course have seen himdid not stop in her senseless gyrations she was dancing with barna móritzthe mayors youngest son and a splendid dancerand the two young people went on twirling and twisting and flirting and laughing just as if hethe real hosthad not been there  enraged at all this indifference this want of recognition of his dignity he elbowed his way through the dense group of spectators which formed a phalanx round the dancers the wide and voluminous petticoats of the women formed a veritable hedge through which he had to scramble and to push as the people recognized him they gave him pleasant greetings for the hungarian peasant is by nature kindly and something of an opportunist there was no occasion to quarrel openly with erös béla who was rich and influential  but he paid no heed either to the greetings or to the whispered comments that followed in their wake he just felt that he was the master of this place and he meant everyone else to know and acknowledge this fact so he strode up to the czigány and ordered them peremptorily to draw this interminable csárdás to an end it had lasted quite long enough he said and the girls looked a sight with their crimson perspiring faces he was not going to have such vulgar goingson at any of his wedding feasts  the gipsy leader never thought of disobeying of course it was the tekintetes úr honoured gentleman who was paying them for their work and they had to do as they were told  despite loud protests from the dancers the csárdás was brought to a lovely and whirling close panting hot and beaming the dancers now mingled with the rest of the throng and a pandemonium of laughter and chatter soon filled the barn from end to end  elsa in accordance with the custom which holds sway even at village dances was even now turning to walk away with her partner whose duty it was to conduct her to her mothers side she felt wrathful with bélaas wrathful at least as so gentle a creature could be she was ashamed of his behaviour ashamed for herself as well as for him and she didnt want to speak with him just now  but he still feeling dictatorial and despotic had not yet finished asserting his authority he called to her loudly and peremptorily  elsa i want a word with you  ill come directly béla she replied speaking over her shoulder i want to speak to mother for a minute  you can speak to her later he rejoined roughly i want a word with you now  and without more ado he pushed his way up close to elsas side elbowing barna móritz with scant ceremony an angry word rose to the younger mans lips and a sudden quarrel was only averted by a pleading look from elsas blue eyes it would have been very unseemly of course to quarrel with ones host on such an occasion móritz swallowing his wrath withdrew without a word even though he cursed béla for a brute under his breath  béla took elsas arm and led her aside out of the crowd  you know he said roughly how i hate you to mix with that rowdy lot like you do and you know that i look on the csárdás as indecent and vulgar why do you do it  the rowdy lot as you call them béla she replied firmly are my friends and the csárdás is a dance which all true magyars dance from childhood  i dont choose to allow my wife to dance it he retorted  and after tomorrow i will obey you béla today i asked my mother if i might dance and she said yes  your mothers a fool he muttered  and remember that tonight i take leave of my girlhood she said gently determined not to quarrel my friends like to monopolize me    its only natural  well they are not my friends anyway and id rather you did not dance another csárdás tonight  i am sorry béla she said quietly but i have promised fehér károly and also jenö they would be disappointed if i broke my promise  then theyll have to be disappointed thats all  she made no reply but looking at her face which he saw in profile he could not fail to note that her lips were tightly set and that there was an unwonted look of determination round her mouth he drew in his breath for he was quite ready for a second conflict of will today nor this time was the issue for a moment in doubt in his mind women were made to obeytheir parents first and then their husbands in this case béla knew well enough that his authority was fully backed by that of elsas motherthe invalid father of course didnt count but kapus irma wanted that house on the kender road she wanted the servant and the oxen the chickens and the pigs she wanted all the ease and the luxury which her rich soninlaw would give her  no there was no fear that elsa would break her tokened word in this semioriental land where semioriental thought prevails girls do not do that sort of thingif they do it is to their own hurt and elsa was not of the stuff of which rebellious or perjured women are made  therefore béla now had neither fear nor compunction in asserting that authority which would be his to the full tomorrow he felt that there was a vein of rebellion in elsas character and this he meant to drain and to staunch till it had withered to nothingness it would never do for himof all mento have a rebellious or argumentative wife  well then thats settled he said with absolute finality you can go and talk to your precious friends as much as you like so long as you behave yourself as a tokened bride should but i will not have you dance that abominable csárdás again tonight  and have you behaved today béla she retorted quite gently as a tokened bridegroom should  thats nothing to do with it he replied with a harsh laugh i am a man and you are a girl and even the most ignorant hungarian peasant will tell you that there is a vast difference there but i am not going to argue about it with you my dear i merely forbid you to dance a dance which i consider indecent thats all  and i am sorry béla she said speaking at least as firmly as he did but i have given my promise and even you would not wish me to break my word  you mean to disobey me then he asked  certainly not after tomorrow today i have my mothers permission and i am going to dance one csárdás now with fehér károly and one after supper again with jenö  they had both unconsciously raised their voices during these last few words and thus aroused the attention of some of the folk who had stood by to listen of course everyone knew of bélas aversion to the csárdás and curiosity prompted gaffers and gossips to try and hear what would be the end of this argument between the pretty bridewho certainly looked rather wilful and obstinate nowand her future lord and master  well said little elsa came now in ringing accents from the foremost group in the little crowd we must see you dance the csárdás once or twice more before that ogre has the authority to shut you up in his castle  moreover your promise has been made to me asserted fehér károly lustily and i certainly shall not release you from it  nor i added jenö  dont you listen to béla my little elsa said one of the older women you are still a free girl today you just do as you liketomorrow will be time enough to do as he tells you  but this opinion the married men present were not prepared to endorse and one or two minor arguments and lectures ensued anent a womans duty of obedience  béla had said nothing while these chaffing remarks were being passed over his head and now that public attention was momentarily diverted from him he took elsas hand and passed it under his arm  you had better go to your mother now hadnt you he said with what seemed like perfect calm you said just now that you wished to speak to her  elsa allowed him to lead her away she tried vainly to guess what was going on in his mind she knew of course that he must be very angry erös béla beaten in an argument was at no time a very pleasant customer and now he surely was raging inwardly for he had set his heart on exerting his authority over this matter of the csárdás and had signally failed  but she could not see how he felt for he kept his face averted from her inquiring gaze  kapus irma greeted her future soninlaw with obvious acerbity  i hear you have been teasing elsa again she said crossly why cant you let her enjoy herself just for tonight without interfering with her  oh i am not going to interfere with her he replied with a sneer you have given her such perfect lessons of disobedience and obstinacy that it will take me all my time in the future to drill her into proper wifely shape but tonight i am not going to interfere with her she has told me plainly that she means to do just as she likes and that you have given her leave to defy me public opinion it seems is all in her favour too so i have just brought your dutiful daughter back to you and now i am free to make myself scarce  to make yourself scarce exclaimed irma what do you mean  just what i say i am not going to stay here where i am jeered at by a lot of loutish common peasants who seem to have forgotten that i am paying for their enjoyment and for all the food and drink which they will consume presently however thats neither here nor there everyone seems to look upon this entertainment as elsas feast and upon elsa as the hostess and the queen i am so obviously in the way and of no consequence i go where i shall be more welcome  he had dropped elsas arm and was turning to go but irma had caught hold of his coat  where are you going she gasped  thats nothing to do with you is it irma néni he replied dryly  indeed it is she retorted why you cant go away like thatnot before supperyou cant for elsas sakewhat would everybody say  i dont care one brass fillér what anybody says irma néni and you know it as for elsa why should i consider her she has plenty of friends to stand by her it seems in her disobedience to my wishes she has openly defied me and made me look a fool i am not going to stand that so i go elsewhereor i might do or say something which i might be sorry for later onsee  he tried to speak quietly and not to raise his voice but it was also obvious that selfcontrol was costing him a mightily vigorous effort for the veins in his temples were standing up like cords and his one eye literally shone with a sinister and almost cruel glow  kapus irma turned to her daughter  elsa she said fretfully dont be such a goose i wont have you quarrelling with béla like this just before your wedding just you kiss him now and tell him you didnt mean to vex him we cant have everybody gossiping about this affair my goodness as if a csárdás or two mattered     but here bélas harsh laugh broke in on her mutterings  dont waste your breath irma néni he said roughly even if elsa were to come and beg my pardon now i would not remain here i dont care for such tardy perfunctory obedience and this she will learn by and by for tonight if you and she feel ashamed and uncomfortable well so much the better village gossip doesnt affect me in the least i do as i like and let all the chattering women go to hl goodnight irma nénigoodnight elsa i hope you will be in a better frame of mind tomorrow  and before kapus irma could detain him or utter another protest he was gone and she turned savagely on her daughter  elsa she said you are never going to let us all be shamed like this run after him at once and bring him back  he wouldnt come back mother if i begged him ever so    said elsa drearily and besideswhere should i find him  on his way to ignácz goldsteins of course if you run you can easily overtake him  i cant mother protested elsa how can i  youll just do as i tell you my girl said irma firmly and with a snap of her lean jaws by the holy virgin child are you going to disobey your mother now god will punish you you know if you go on like that go at once as i tell you run out by this door here no one will see you you will overtake béla before he is halfway down the street and then you must just bring him back thats all  long habits of obedience were so ingrained in the girl that at this momentthough she felt quite sure that all her attempts would be in vain and though she felt bitterly humiliated at having to make such attemptsshe never thought of openly defying her mother indeed she quite believed that god would punish her if she rebelled so constantly for this had been drilled into her since her earliest childhoods days  fortunately for the moment everyones attention was concentrated on a table of liquid refreshments in a remote corner of the barn and elsa and her mother were practically isolated here and the last little scene had gone by unobserved  irma picked a shawl from off her own shoulders and put it round her daughter then she gave her a final significant push elsa with her teardimmed eyes could scarcely find the little side door which was fashioned in the wooden wall itself and gave direct access into the street  god would punish her if she defied her mother well gods wrath must be harder to bear than the bitter humiliation to which her mother had so airily condemned her to beg bélas forgiveness to assure him of her obedience to stand shamed before him and before all her friends surely god couldnt want her to do all that  but already she had crossed the threshold and was out in the dark silent street she ran on mechanically in the direction of the inn her mothers commands seemed to be moving her along for certainly her own will had nothing to do with it her cheeks were aflame and her eyes burned with all the tears which she would not shed but she herself felt cold and numb as she ran on blindly stupidly to where she had just seen a tiny speck of light  the night was dark but exquisitely calmperfectly still yet full of those mysterious whisperings which come from the bosom of the plain the flutter of birds wings snug in their nights lodgings amongst the drooping branches of pollarded willows the quiver of the plumed heads of maize touched by some fairy garment as it brushed by the call of the cricket from among the tall sunflowers and the quiver of the glowworm on the huge pumpkin leaves  elsa knew all these soft whisperings she was a child of this immense and majestic plain and all the furtive little beasts that dwelt within its maze were bosom friends of hers  at other times when her mind and heart had been at peace she loved these dark calm nights when heavy clouds hid the light of the moon and sounds grew louder and more distinct as the darkness grew more tense neither fluttering of unseen wings nor quiver of stealthy footsteps had the power to startle her they were all her friends these tiny dwellers of the plain these midnight marauders of whom townsfolk are always so afraid  at first when she perceived the tiny speck of light on ahead she thought that it must be a glowworm settled on the leaves of the dahlias outside the schoolhouse for glowworms had been overabundant this late summer but soon she saw that the burning speck was moving along on ahead in the same direction as she herself was goingon the way to ignácz goldsteins  béla had lighted a cigar when he left the barn nursing his resentment he had walked along rapidly toward the inn his head whirling with thoughts of the many things which he meant to do in order to be revenged on elsa this night  of course a long visit to klara fully entered into those schemes and now he paused just at the foot of the verandah steps breathing in the soft evening air with fully dilated nostrils and lungs so that his nerves might regain some semblance of that outward calm which his dignity demanded  and thus standing still he heard through the silence the patter of small highheeled boots upon the hard road he guessed at once that elsa had been sent along by her mother to bring him back and a comforting glow of inward satisfaction went right through his veins as after a slight moment of hesitation he made up his mind to await elsas coming here to listen to her apologies to read her the lecture which she fully deserved but nevertheless to continue the plan of conduct which he had mapped out for himself     chapter xxiii  on the eve of ones wedding day too   he could not see elsa till she was quite close to him and even then he could only vaguely distinguish the quaint contour of her widesleeved shift and of her voluminous petticoats  but his cigar had gone out and when elsa stood quite close to him and softly murmured his name he struck a match very deliberately and held it to the cigar so that it lighted up his face for a few seconds he wanted her to see how indifferent was the expression in his eye and that there was not the slightest trace of a welcoming smile lurking round his lips  therefore he held the lighted match close to his face much longer than was necessary he only dropped it when it began to scorch his fingers then he blew a big cloud of smoke out of his cigar straight into her face and only after that did he say speaking very roughly  what do you want  mother sent me béla she said timidly as she placed a trembling little hand on his coatsleeve i wouldnt have come only she ordered me and i couldnt disobey her so i     couldnt disobey your mother eh he sneered you couldnt defy her as you did me what  i didnt mean to defy you béla she said striving with all her might to keep back the rebellious words which surged out of her overburdened heart to her quivering lips i couldnt be unkind to jenö and károly and all my old friends just this last evening when i am still a girl amongst them  you preferred being obstinate and wilful toward me i suppose  dont let us quarrel béla she pleaded  i am not quarrelling he retorted i came to the barn just now looking forward to the pleasure of having you to myself for a little bit there was a lot i wanted to say to youjust quietly in a corner by our two selves and how did i find you hot and panting after an hours gyrations hardly able to stand and certainly not able to speak and at my simple request that you should give up a dance of which i wholeheartedly disapprove you turned on me with impudence and obstinacy i suppose you felt yourself backed up by your former sweetheart and thought you could just treat me like the dirt under your feet  he certainly had proved himself a good advocate in his own cause the case thus put succinctly and clearly before her appeared very black to elsa against herself ever ready for selfdeprecation she began to think that indeed she had behaved in a very ugly unwomanly and aggressive manner and her meekness cost her no effort now when she said gently  i am sorry béla i seem to have been all queer the whole of today it is a very upsetting time for any girl you must remember but pater bonifácius said that if any sin lay on my conscience since my last confession i could always find him in church at seven oclock tomorrow morning before our wedding mass so as to be quite clear of sin before holy communion  thats all right then he said with a hard laugh you had better find him in church tomorrow morning and tell him that you have been wilful and perverse and disobedient hell give you absolution no doubt so now youd better go back to your dancing your many friends will be pining for you  wont you    wont you come back with me béla she pleaded  no i wont i have told your mother plainly enough that i wasnt coming back so why she should have sent you snivelling after me i cant think  i think that even if mother hadnt sent me i should have come ultimately i am not quite sure but i think i should have come i know that i have done wrong but we are all of us obstinate and mistaken at times arent we béla it is rather hard to be so severely punished she added with a wistful little sigh on the eve of ones wedding day too which should be one of the happiest days in a girls life  severely punished he sneered bah as if you wanted me over there youve got all your precious friends  but i do want you béla all the time that you were not in the barn this afternoon i    i felt lonesome  then why didnt you send for your old sweetheart he would have cheered you up  dont say that béla she said earnestly and once more her little hand grasped his coatsleeve you dont know how it hurts i dont want to think of andor i only want to think of you and if you would try and be a little patient i am sure that we would understand one another better very soon  i hope so my dear he rejoined dryly for your sakeas i am not a patient man let me tell you that come give me a kiss and run back to your mother i cant bear to have a woman snivelling near me like that  he drew her toward him with that rough perfunctory gesture which betokened the master rather than the lover then with one hand he raised her chin up and brought her face quite close to his even then he could not see her clearly because of the heavy clouds in the sky but the air seemed suddenly to have become absolutely still not a breath of wind stirred the leaves of the acacia trees and all those soft sighings and mysterious whisperings which make the plain always appear so full of life were for the moment hushed only from far away came the murmur of the sluggish waters of the maros and from its shores the call of a heron to its mate elsa made vigorous efforts to swallow her tears the exquisite quietude of nature that call of the heron the scent of dying flowers which lingered in the autumn air made her feel more strongly than she had ever felt before how beautiful life might have been  pater bonifácius words rang in her ears you are going to be happy in gods way my child which may not be your way but must be an infinitely better one  well for the moment elsa didnt see how this was going to be done she did not see how she could ever be happy beside this tyrannical arrogant man who would be and meant to be her master rather than her mate  even now the searching look wherewith his one eye with its sinister expression tried to read her very soul had in it more of pride of possession more of the appraiser of goods than the ardour of a bridegroom béla cursed the darkness which prevented his reading now every line of that pure young face which was held up to his he longed with all the passionate masterfulness of his temperament to know exactly how much awe how much deference how much regard she felt for him of love he did not think nor did he care if it never came but this beautiful prize which had been coveted by so many was his at last and he meant to mould it and wield it in accordance with his pleasure  but in spite of his callousness and his selfishness the intense womanliness of the girl stirred the softer emotions of his heart there was so much freshness in her so much beauty and so much girlishness that just for one brief second a wave almost of tenderness swept over his senses  he kissed the pure young lips and drank in greedily their exquisite sweetness then he said somewhat less harshly  you are too pretty my dove to put on those modern airs of emancipated womanhood if you only knew how much better you please me like this than when you try to argue with me you would always use your power over me you little goose  she made no reply for despite the warm woollen shawl round her shoulders she had suddenly felt cold and a curious shiver had gone right through her body even whilst her future lord did kiss her but no doubt it was because just then an owl had hooted in the poplar trees far away  you are coming back then béla she asked after a few seconds of silence and with enforced cheerfulness  ill think about it he said condescendingly  but     there now dont begin again he broke in impatiently havent i said that ill think about it you run back to your mother now i may come lateror i may not but if you bother me much more i certainly wont if i come i come of my own free will theres no woman living who has ever persuaded me to do anything against my will  and without vouchsafing her another word or look without deigning to see her safely on her way back to the barn he turned leisurely on his heel and mounting the steps of the verandah before him he presently pushed open the taproom door and disappeared within     chapter xxiv  if you loved me   elsa stood for a moment quite still there in the dark with the silence of the night and all its sweet sounds encompassing her and the scent of withered flowers and slowlydying leaves mounting to her quivering nostrils  what did it all mean what did life mean and what was the meaning of god she the ignorant unsophisticated peasant girl knew nothing save what pater bonifácius had taught her and that was little enoughthough the little was hard enough to learn  resignation to gods will obedience to parents first and to husband afterwards renunciation of all that made the days appear like a continual holiday and filled the nights with exquisite dreams  but if life only meant that only meant duty and obedience and resignation then why had god made such a beautiful world why had he made the sky and the birds and the flowers the nodding plumes of maize and the tiny fleecy clouds which people the firmament at sunset  was it worth while to deck this world in such array if the eyes of men were always to be filled with tears and their backs bent to their everrecurring tasks  a heavy sigh escaped from the girls overburdened heart the riddle of the universe was too hard an one for her simple mind to solve perhaps it was best after all not to think of these things which she was too ignorant to understand she looked at the door of the tavern through which béla had gone he had left it wide open and she caught a glimpse of him now as he sat at one of the tables and leaning his elbow on it rested his chin in his hand  then with another little sigh she was just turning to go when the sound of her name spoken in a whisper and quite close to her sent her pulses quivering and made her heart beat furiously  elsa wait a moment  is that you andor she whispered  yes i came up just now and heard your voice and bélas i waited on the offchance of getting a word with you  i mustnt stop andor mother will be wondering  no she wont he retorted with undisguised bitterness the mother who sent you on this abominable and humiliating errand wont worry much after you  no one seems to worry much about me do they andor she said a little wistfully  he drew a little closer to her so close that he could feel her shoulder under the shawl quivering against his arm her many petticoats brushed about his shins and he could hear her quick warm breath as it came and went he bent his head quite close to her as he had done that day five years ago in the mazes of the csárdás and nowas thenhis lips almost touched her soft young neck  then why should you worry about them elsa he whispered slowly in her ear why shouldnt you let them all be  let them all be she said but everyone will be wondering if i dont go backat least for supper  i dont mean about the dance and the supper elsa he continued still speaking in a whisper and striving to subdue the hoarseness in his voice which was engendered by the passion which burned in his veins i dont only mean tonight i mean    for good     for good she repeated slowly  let me take you away elsa he entreated away from here leave all these rough indifferent and selfish folk come out with me to australia and let all these people be  at first of course she didnt understand him but gradually his meaning became clear and she gave one long horrified gasp  andor how can you  it has been borne upon me elsa these hours past that i am a coward and a villain to let you go on with this miserable life nay its worse than that for your future life with that bully that brute will be far more wretched than you have any idea now he doesnt care for you elsanot reallynot as i care for you not as youthe sweetest gentlest purest woman in the worldshould be cared for and cherished he doesnt love you elsa he doesnt even really want younot as i want youi who would give my life every drop of my blood to have you for myself alone  gradually as he spoke his arms had clasped round her his passionate whispers came in short gasps to her ear gently now she disengaged herself  but i am tokened to béla andor she said gently tomorrow is my wedding day i have made my confession pater bonifácius has prepared me for holy communion my word is pledged to béla  he doesnt love you elsa and he is not your husband yet your pledged word does not bind you before god today you are still free you are free until you have sworn before the altar of god elsa béla doesnt want you he doesnt love you and i love you and want you with my whole heart and soul  dont speak like that andor dont she almost pleaded you must know how wrong it is for you to speak and for me to listen  but i must speak elsa he urged and you have got to listen we could get away now elsa tonight by the ninetwenty train over at the barn no one would know that you had gone until it got too late to run after you never mind about your clothes i have plenty of money in my pocket and tomorrow when we get to budapesth we can get what you want by the next day we should be in fiume and then we would embark on the first ship that is outward bound i know just how to manage elsa you would have nothing to do nothing to think of but just give yourself over into my keeping you are a free woman elsa bound to no one and the first opportunity we had we would get married out there in australia i can get plenty of work and good pay we shouldnt be rich elsanot as rich as you would be if you married erös béla but by god i swear that we would be happy for every minute of my life would be devoted to your happiness  all the while that he spoke she had made persistent efforts to disengage herself from his grasp she felt that she must get away from him away from his insinuating voice from the ardour of those whispered words which seemed to burn into her very soul the very night seemed to be in league with him the darkness and the silence and all those soft sounds of gentlymurmuring river and calls of birds and beasts and the fragrance of dying flowers which numbed the senses and obliterated the thought of god of duty and of parents  no no andor she murmured feebly you have no right to speak like that i am tokened to béla i have sworn that i would be his wife my hand was in his and the pater blessed us and it was after holy communion and when christ himself was in my heart and there is mother too and father the house which béla promised them the oxen and the pigs a maid to look after father mother would curse me if i cheated her of all that now  when we are settled in australia he pleaded earnestly we will write to your parents and send them money to come out and join us  father is paralysed how could he come and mother would curse me and a mothers curse andor is registered by god  elsa if you loved me you would leave father and mother and come with me  then perhaps i do not love you andor she said slowly for i could not bear my mothers curse i could not break the pledge which i swore after holy communion i could not commit so great a sin andor not even for your sake for if i did remorse would break my heart and all your love for me would not compensate me for the sin  and before he could say another word before his arms could once more close round her or his trembling hands clutch at her fluttering petticoats she was gonevanished out of his grasp and into the darkness and only the patter of her little feet broke the silence of the night     chapter xxv  in any case elsa is not for you   andor with a sigh of heartbroken disappointment now turned to go into the inn he had the key in his hand which my lord the young count had given him with a careless laugh and a condescending nod of acknowledgment for the service thus rendered to him and to klara  the door of the taproom was still wide open a narrow wedgeshaped light filtrated through on to the beams and floor of the verandah making the surrounding blackness seem yet more impenetrable  andor entered the taproom and walked straight up to the centre table and he placed the key upon the small tray which klara had pointed out to him then he turned and looked around him klara was not there and the room was quite deserted apparently the sleepers of awhile ago had been roused from their slumbers and had departed one by one for a moment andor paused wondering if he should tell klara that he had been successful in his errand he could hear the murmur of the girls voice in the next room talking to her father  no on the whole he preferred not to meet her again he didnt like the woman and still felt very wrathful against her for the impudent part she had played at the feast this afternoon  he had just made up his mind to go back to the presbytery where the kind pater had willingly given him a bed when erös bélas broad squat figure appeared in the open doorway he had a lighted cigar between his teeth and his hands were buried in the pockets of his trousers he held his head on one side and his single eye leered across the room at the other man  when he encountered andors quick savage glance he gave a loud harsh laugh  she gave it you straight enough didnt she he said as he swaggered into the room  you were listening asked andor curtly  yes i was replied béla i was in here and i heard your voice so i stole out on to the verandah you were not ten paces away i could hear every word you said  well  well what sneered the other  what conclusion did you arrive at  what conclusion retorted béla with a laugh why my good man i came to the conclusion that in spite of all your fine talk about god and so on and all your fine airs of a gentleman from australia you are nothing but a lowdown cur who comes sneaking round trying to steal a fellows sweetheart from him  i suppose you are right there béla said andor with a quick impatient sigh and with quite unwonted meekness i suppose i am as you say nothing but a lowdown cur  yes my friend thats just it assented the other dryly but shes let you know pretty straight hasnt she that she wouldnt listen to your talk elsa will stick by me and by her promise to me you may bet your shirt on that she is too shrewd to think of exchanging the security of today for any of your vague promises she is afraid of her mother and of me and of gods curses and so on and she does not care enough about you to offend the lot of us and thats about how it stands  you are right there béla that is about how it stands  and so my fine gentleman concluded béla with a sneer you cannot get rid of me unless you are ready to cut my throat and to hang for it afterwards in any case you see elsa is not for you  andor said nothing for the moment it seemed as if vaguely in his mind some strong purpose had already taken birth and was struggling to subjugate his will his bronzed face marked clearly the workings of his thoughts at first there had been a dulled sombre look in his dark deepset eyes then gradually a flame seemed to flicker in them feebly at first then dying down for awhile then rising again more triumphant more glowing than before even as the firm lines around the tightlyclosed lips became more set and more expressive of a strong resolve  ignácz goldsteins querulous voice was heard in the other room giving fussy directions to his daughter about the collecting and packing up of his things anon he opened the door and peered out into the taproom he had heard the confused murmur of footsteps and of voices and possible customers must not be neglected even at an anxious moment of departure  seeing béla and andor there he asked if anything was wanted  no no said béla impatiently nothing more tonight andor and i are going directly  the narrow hatchetface once more disappeared behind the door klaras voice was heard to ask  who is in the taproom father  andor and béla replied the old man but never you mind about the taproom just see that you dont forget my red handkerchief and my fur cap for the journey and my bottle of     his mumblings became inaudible and after awhile béla reiterated with an airy laugh  no my friend elsa is not for you  then it was that andors confused thoughts shaped themselves into a resolve  not unless you will give her up béla he said slowly you yourself i meannowat this eleventh hour  i queried the other harshlynot understanding give her up  yes tell her that you have thought the whole matter over that you have realized that nothing but unhappiness can come from your union together she would feel a little humiliated at first perhaps but she would come to me if you would let her go i can deal with irma néni after that if you will release elsa yourself of her promise she would come to me i know  béla looked for awhile in silence at the earnest face of the other man then he burst into a loud mocking laugh  you are mad he said or else drunk  i am neither rejoined the other calmly it is all perfectly feasible if only you will release elsa you have so often asserted that you dont care one brass fillér for the opinion of village folk  and i dont  then it cannot matter to you if some blame is cast on you for breaking off with elsa on the eve of your wedding people must see how unsuited you are to each other and how unhappy your marriage must eventually turn out you have no feeling about promises you have no parents who might curse you if you break them break your promise to elsa now béla and you will be doing the finest action of your life break your promise to her man and let her come to me  béla was still staring at andor as if indeed he thought the other mad but now an evil leer gradually spread over his face and his one eye closed until it looked like a mere slit through which he now darted on andor a look of triumph and of hate  break my promise to elsa he said slowly and deliberately i wouldnt do it my good man if you offered me all the gold in your precious america  but you dont love her béla urged andor with ardent earnestness you dont really want her  no i dont said the other roughly but i dont want you to have her either  what can it matter to you there are plenty of pretty girls this side of the maros who would be only too glad to step into elsas shoes  i dont care about any pretty girls on this side of the maros nor on the other either for that matter i wont give elsa up to you my friend and she wont break her promise to me because she fears god and her mothers curse see  shes far too good for you cried andor with sudden vehemence for he had already realized that he must give up all hope now and the other mans manner his coarseness and callousness had irritated him beyond the bounds of endurance he hated this cruel selfish brute who held power over elsa with all the hatred of which his hot magyar blood was capable a red mist seemed at times now to rise before his eyes the kind of mist that obscures a mans brain and makes him do deeds which are recorded in hell  shes far too good for you he reiterated hoarsely even as his powerful fists clenched themselves in a violent effort to keep up some semblance of selfcontrol the thought of elsa still floated across his mental vision of elsa whose pure white hand seemed to dissipate that ugly red mist with all the hideous thoughts which it brought in its trail you ought to treat her well man he cried in the agony of his soul youve got to treat her well  the other looked him up and down like a man does an enemy whom he believes to be powerless to do him any harm then he said with a sneer through which however now there was apparent an undercurrent of boiling wrath  ill treat her just as i choose and you my friend had best in the future try to attend to your own business  but andor obsessed by the one idea feeling his own helplessness in the matter would not let the matter drop  how you can look at another woman he said sombrely while elsa is near you i cannot imagine  he looked round him vaguely as if he wanted all the dumb inanimate things around him to bear witness to this monstrous idea elsa flouted for another woman elsa the most beautiful woman on gods earth the purest the bestflouted and for whom for whatother girlswomenwho were not worthy to walk in the same street as elsa the thought made andor giddy his glance became more wandering less comprehending    that awful red mist was once more blurring his vision  and as he looked round himununderstanding and wretchedhis glance fell upon the key which he himself had placed upon the brass tray a few moments ago and the key brought back to his mind the recollection of klara the jewess her domination over béla her triumph over elsa and also the terrible plight in which she had found herself when she had begged andor for friendly help and given him in exchange the solemn promise which he had exacted from her  this recollection eased somewhat the heavy burden of his anxiety and there was quite a look of triumph in his eyes when he once more turned to béla  well he said theres one thing certain and that is that elsa wont have to suffer again from the insolence of that jewess i have cut the ground from under your feet in that direction my friend  indeed retorted béla airily how did you manage to do that  i rendered her a service this afternoonshe was in serious trouble and asked me to help her  ohand may i ask the nature of the troubleand of the service sneered the other  never mind about the nature of the service i did help klara in her trouble and in return she has given me a solemn promise to have nothing whatever more to do with you  oh did she cried béla whose savage temper held in check for awhile had at last risen to its habitual stage of unbridled fury all the hot blood had rushed to his head making his face crimson and his eye glowing and unsteady and his hand shook visibly as he leaned against the table so that the mugs and bottles rattled as did the key upon the metal tray he too felt that hideous red mist enveloping him and blurring his sight he hated andor with all his might and would have strangled him if he had felt that he had the physical power to do it as well as the moral strength his voice came hoarse and hissing through his throat as he murmured through tightly clenched teeth  she did did she and you made her give you that promise which is not going to bind her let me tell you that but let me also tell you in the meanwhile my fine gentleman from america that your dd interference will do no good to your former sweetheart who is already as good as my wifeand will be my wife tomorrow klara goldstein is my friend let me tell you that and     he paused a moment    something had arrested the words in his throat as so often occurs in the mysterious workings of fate a small apparently wholly insignificant event suddenly caused the full tide of his destiny to turnand not only of his own destiny but that of many others  an eventa tiny facttrivial enough for the moment the touch of his hand against the key upon the brass tray  mechanically he picked up the key his mind was not yet working quite clearly but the shifty glance of his one eye rested upon the key and contemplated it for awhile  well he murmured vaguely at last how strange  what is strange queried the othernot understanding  that this key should so to speak fall like this into my hand  that isnt strange at all said andor with a shrug of the shoulders for now he thought that béla was drunk so curious was the look in his eye considering that i put that key there myself half an hour agoit is the key of the back door of this house  i know it is rejoined béla slowly i have had it in my possession before now    when ignácz goldstein has been away from home and it was not thought prudent for me to enter this house by the front door    late at nightyou understand  then as andor once more shrugged his shoulders in contempt but vouchsafed no further comment he continued still more slowly and deliberately  isnt it strange that just as you were trying to interfere in my affairs this key should so to speak fall into my hand fate plays some funny little pranks sometimes eh mr guardian angel  what has fate got to do with it queried andor roughly  you dont see it  no  then perhaps you were not aware of the fact said béla blandly as he toyed with the key that papa goldstein is going off to kecskemét tonight  yes replied andor slowly i did know that but     but you didnt know perhaps that pretty klara likes a little jollification and a bit of fun sometimes and that papa goldstein is a very strict parent and mightily particular about the proprieties it is a way those cursed jews have you know  yes said andor again i did know that too  he was speaking in a curious dazed kind of way now he suddenly felt as if the whole world had ceased to be and as if he was wandering quite alone in a land of dreams before him far away was that red misty veil and on ahead he could dimly see béla with a hideous grin on his face brandishing that key whilst somehow or other the face of leopold hirsch distorted with passion and with jealousy appeared to beckon to him from behind that distant crimson veil  well you see continued béla in the same suave and unctuous tones which he had suddenly assumed since pretty klara is fond of jollification and a bit of fun and her father is overparticular why thats where this nice little key comes in for presently papa will be gone and the house worthily and properly shut up and the keys in papa goldsteins pocket who will be speeding off to kecskemét but with the help of this little key which is a duplicate one iwho am a great friend of pretty klaracan just slip into the house quietly for a comfortable little supper and just a bit of fun and no one need be any the wiser for i shall make no noise and the back door of this house is well screened from prying eyes have you any further suggestion to make my fine gentleman from america  only this man said andor sombrely that it is you who are mador drunk  oh not mad what harm is there in it you chose to interfere between klara and me and i only want to show you that i am the master of my own affairs  but itll get known old rézis cottage is not far and she is a terrible gossip back door or no back door someone will see you sneaking in or out  and if they dohave you any objection my dear friend  itll be all over the villageelsa will hear of it  and if she does retorted béla with a sudden return to his savage mood she will have to put up with it thats all she has already learned today that i do as i choose to do and that she must do as i tell her but a further confirmation of this excellent lesson will not come amissat the eleventh hour my dear friend  you wouldnt do such a thing béla you wouldnt put such an insult on elsa you wouldnt     i wouldnt what my fine gentleman who tried to sneak another fellows sweetheart sneered béla as he drew a step or two nearer to andor i wouldnt what come here and have supper with klara while elsas precious friends are eating the fare ive provided for them and abusing me behind my back yes i would and ill stay just as long as i like and let anyone see me who likes    and elsa may go to the devil with jealousy for aught i care  he was quite close to andor now but being half a head shorter he had to look up in order to see the other eye to eye thus for a moment the two men were silent measuring one another like two primitive creatures of these plains who have been accustomed for generations past to satisfy all quarrels with the shedding of blood and in truth never had man so desperate a longing to kill as andor had at this moment the red mist enveloped him entirely now he could see nothing round him but the hideous face of this coarse brute with its one leering eye and cruel sensuous lips  the vision of elsa had quite faded from before his gaze her snowwhite hands no longer tried to dissipate that hideous bloodred veil only from behind erös bélas shoulder he saw peering at him through the mist the pale eyes of leopold hirsch but on them he would not look for he felt that that way lay madness  what the next moment would have brought the fates who weave the destinies of mankind could alone have told béla unconscious or indifferent to the menace which was glowing in lakatos andors eyes never departed for a moment from his attitude of swaggering insolence and even now with an ostentatious gesture he thrust the key into his waistcoat pocket  andor gave a hoarse and quicklysmothered cry like that of a beast about to spring  you cur he muttered through his teeth you dd cur  his hands were raised ready to fasten themselves on the other mans throat when the door of the inner room was suddenly thrown open and ignácz goldsteins querulous voice broke the spell that hung over the two men  now then my friends now then he said fussily as he shuffled into the room it is time that this respectable house should be shut up for the night i am just off to catch the slow train to kecskemétafter you my friends after you please  he made a gesture toward the open door and then went up to the table and poured himself out a final stirrupcup he was wrapped from head to foot in a threadbare cloth coat lined with shaggy fur a furedged bonnet was on his head and he carried a stout stick to which was attached a large bundle done up in a red cotton handkerchief this now he slung over his shoulder  klara my girl he called  yes father came klaras voice from the inner room  i didnt see the backdoor keythe duplicate one i meanhanging in its usual place  no father i know she replied its all right i have it in my pocket ill hang it up on the peg in a minute  right girl he said as he smacked his lips after the long draft of wine you are quite sure leopold changed his mind about coming with me  quite sure father  i wonder then he didnt wait to say goodbye to me  perhaps hell meet you at the station  perhaps he will now then gentlemen added the old jew as he once more turned to the two men  indeed andor felt that the spell had been lifted from him he was quite calm now and that feeling of being in dreamland had descended still more forcibly upon his mind  you have nothing more to say to me have you my good andor said béla with a final look of insolent swagger directed at his rival  no replied andor slowly and deliberately nothing  then goodnight my friend concluded the other with a sarcastic laugh why not go to the barn and dance with elsa and sup at my expense like the others do youll be made royally welcome there i assure you  thank you i am going home  well as you like i shall just look in there myself now for half an hourbut i am engaged later on for supper elsewhere you know  so i understand  gentlemen my dear friends i shall miss my train pleaded old ignácz goldstein querulously  he manoeuvred the two men toward the door and then prepared to follow them  klara he called again  coming father she replied  she came running out of the room and as she reached the door she called to andor  andor you have not said goodnight she said significantly  never mind about that now said ignácz goldstein fretfully i shall miss my train  he kissed his daughter perfunctorily then said  theres no one in the taproom now is there i didnt notice  no she replied no one just now  then id keep the door shut if i were you id rather those fellows back from arad didnt come in tonight the open door would attract thema closed one might have the effect of speeding them on their way  very well father she said indifferently ill keep the door closed  and mind you push all the bolts home to both the doors he added sternly a girl alone in a house cannot be too careful  all right father she rejoined impatiently ill see to everything havent i been alone like this before  the other two men were going down the verandah steps goldstein went out too now and slammed the door behind him  and klara found herself alone in the house     chapter xxvi  what had andor done   she waited for a moment with her ear glued to the front door until the last echo of the mens footsteps had completely died away in the distance then she ran to the table the tray was there but no key upon it with feverish jerky movements she began to hunt for it pushing aside bottles and mugs opening drawers searching wildly with dilated eyes all round the room  the key was here somewhere    surely surely andor had not played her false    he would not play her false    he was not that sort    surely surely he was not that sort he had come back from his errandof course she had seen him just now and    and he had said nothing certainly but     well he cant have gone far and her father wouldnt hear if she called she ran back to the door and fumbled at the latch for her hands trembled so that she bruised them against the iron there at last it was done she opened the door and peered out into the night everything was still not a footstep echoed from down the street she took one step out on to the verandah    then she heard a rustle from behind the pollarded acacia tree and a rustle amongst its leaves someone was thereon the watchleopold  she smothered a scream of terror and in a moment had fled back into the room and slammed and bolted the door behind her now she stood with her back against it arms outstretched fingers twitching convulsively against the wood she was shivering as with cold though the heat in the room was close and heavy with fumes of wine and tobacco her teeth were chattering a cold perspiration had damped the roots of her hair  she had wanted to call andor back just to ask him definitely if he had been successful in his errand and what he had done with the key perhaps he meant to tell her perhaps he had merely forgotten to put the key on the tray and still had it in his waistcoat pocket she had been a fool not to come out and speak to him when she heard his voice in the taproom awhile ago she had wanted to but her father monopolized her about his things for the journey he had been exceptionally querulous tonight and was always ready to be suspicious also béla had been in the taproom with andor and she wouldnt have liked to speak of the key before béla what she had been absolutely sure of however until now was that andor would not have come back and then gone away like this if he had not succeeded in his errand and got her the key from count feri  but the key was not there there was no getting away from that and she had wanted to call andor back and to ask him about itand had found leopold hirsch standing out there in the dark    watching  she had not seen himbut she had felt his presenceand she was quite sure that she had heard the hissing sound of his indrawn breath and the movement which he had made to spring on herand strangle her as he had threatened to doif she went out by the front door  mechanically she passed her hand across her throat terrorappalling deadly terror of her lifehad her in its grasp she tottered across the room and sank into a chair she wanted time to think  what had andor done what a fool she had been not to ask him the straight question while she had the chance she had been afraid of little thingsher fathers temper erös bélas sneerswhen now there was death and murder to fear  what had andor done  had he played her false played this dirty trick on her out of revenge he certainlynow she came to think of ithad avoided meeting her glance when he went away just now  had he played her false  the more she thought on it the more the idea got roothold in her brain in order to be revenged for the humiliation which she had helped to put upon elsa andor had chosen this means for bringing her to everlasting shame and sorrowthe young count murdered outside her door in the act of sneaking into the house by a back way at dead of night while ignácz goldstein was from home leopold hirschher tokened fiancéa murderer condemned to hang for a brutal crime she disgraced for ever cursed if not killed by her father who did not trifle in the matter of his daughters good name    all that was andors projected revenge for what she had done to elsa  the thought of it was too horrible it beat into her brain until she felt that her head must burst as under the blows of a sledgehammer or else that she must go mad  she pushed back the matted hair from her temples and looked round the tiny dark lonely room in abject terror from far away came the shrill whistle of the engine which bore her father away to kecskemét it must be nearly halfpast nine then and close on half an hour since she had been left here alone with her terrors yet another halfhour and     no no this she felt that she could not endurenot another halfhour of this awful deathdealing suspense anything would be better than thatdeath at leopolds handsa quick gasp a final agonyyes that would be briefer and betterand perhaps leos heart would misgive himperhaps    but in any case anything must be better than this suspense  she struggled to her feet her knees shook under her for the moment she could not have moved if her very life had depended on it so she stood still propped against the table her hands clutching convulsively at its edge for support and her eyes dilated and staring still searching round the room wildly for the key  at last she felt that she could walk she tottered back across the room back to the door and her twitching fingers were once more fumbling with the bolts  the house was so still and the air was so oppressive when she paused in her fumblingsince her fingers refused her serviceshe could almost hear that movement again behind the acacia tree outside and that rustling among the leaves  she gave a wild gasp of terror and ran back to the chairlike a frightened feline creature swift and silentand sank into it still gasping her whole body shaken now as with fever her teeth chattering her limbs numb  death had been so near she had felt an icy breath across her throat she was frightenedhideously abjectly miserably frightened death lurked for her there outside in the dark from behind the acacia tree death in the guise of a jealous madman whose hate had been whetted by an hours lonely watch in the darklonely but for his thoughts  tears of selfpity as well as of fear rose to the unfortunate girls eyes convulsive sobs shook her shoulders and tore at her heart till she felt that she must choke she threw out her arms across the table and buried her face in them and lay there sobbing and moaning in her terror and in her misery  how long she remained thus crying and half inert with mental anguish and pain she could not afterwards have told nor did she know what it was that roused her from this torpor and caused her suddenly to sit up in her chair upright wideawake her every sense on the alert  surely she could not have heard the fall of footsteps at the back of the house there was the whole width of the inner room and two closed doors between her and the yard at the back and the ground there was soft and muddy no footstep however firm could raise echoes there  and yet she had heard of that she felt quite sure heard with that sixth sense of which she in her ignorance knew nothing but which nevertheless now had roused her from that comalike state into which terror had thrown her and set every one of her nerves tingling once more and pulsating with life and the power to feel  for the moment all her faculties seemed merged into that of hearing with that same sixth sense she heard the stealthy footsteps coming nearer and nearer they had not approached from the village but from the fields at the back and along the little path which led through the unfenced yard straight to the back door  these footstepswhich seemed like the footsteps of ghosts so intangible were theywere now so near that to klaras supersensitive mind they appeared to be less than ten paces from the back door  then she heard another footstepshe heard it quite distinctly even though walls and doors were between her and themshe heard the movement from behind the acacia treethe one that stands at the corner of the house in full view of both the doorsshe heard the rustle among its lowhanging branches and that hissing sound as of an indrawn breath  she shot up from her chair like an automatonrigid and upright her mouth opened as for a wild shriek but all power of sound was choked in her throat she ran into the inner room like one possessed her mouth still wide open for the frantic shriek which would not come for that agonizing call for help  she fell up against the back door her hands tore at the lock at the woodwork at the plaster around she bruised her hands and cut her fingers to the bone but still that call would not come to her throatnot even now when she heard on the other side of the door less than five paces from where she lay frantic with horror a groan a smothered cry a thudthen swiftly hurrying footsteps flying away in the night  then nothing more for she was lying now in a huddled mass half unconscious on the floor     chapter xxvii  the shadow that fell from the tall sunflowers   how klara goldstein spent that terrible night she never fully realized after half an hour or so she dragged herself up from the floor full consciousness had returned to her and with it the power to feel to understand and to fear  a hideous awful terror was upon her which seemed to freeze her through and through a cold sweat broke out all over her body and she was trembling from head to foot she crawled as far as the narrow little bed which was in a corner of the room and just managed to throw herself upon it on her back and there to remain inert perished with cold racked with shivers her eyes staring upwards into the darkness her ears strained to listen to every sound that came from the other side of the door  but gradually as she lay her senses became more alive the power to think coherently to reason with her fears asserted itself more and more over those insane terrors which had paralysed her will and her heart she did begin to thinknot only of herself and of her miserable position but of the man who lay outsidedying or dead  yes that soon became the most insistent thought  leopold hirsch having done the awful deed had fled of course but his victim might not be dead he might be only wounded and dying for want of succour klaraclosing her eyescould almost picture him groaning and perhaps trying to drag himself up in a vain endeavour to get help  then she rosewretched broken terrifiedbut nevertheless resolved to put all selfish fears aside and to ascertain the full extent of the tragedy which had been enacted outside her door she lit the stormlantern then with it in her hand she went through the taproom and opened the front door  she knew well the risks which she was running going out like this into the night and alone any passerby might see herask questions suspect her of connivance when she told what it was that she had come out to seek in the darkness behind her own back door but to this knowledge and this small additional fear she resolutely closed her mind drawing the door to behind her she stepped out on to the verandah and thence down the few steps into the road below  a slight breeze had sprung up within the last halfhour and had succeeded in chasing away the heavy banks of cloud which had hung over the sky earlier in the evening  even as klara paused at the foot of the verandah steps in order to steady herself on her feet the last filmy veil that hid the face of the moon glided ethereally by the moon was on the wane golden and mysterious and now as she appeared high in the heaven surrounded by a halo of prismatic light she threw a cold radiance on everything around picking out every tree and cottage with unfailing sharpness and casting black impenetrable shadows which made the light by contrast appear yet more vivid and more clear  all around leaves and branches rustled with a soft swishing sound like the whisperings of ghosts and from the plains beyond came that longdrawnout murmur of myriads of plumecrowned maize as they bent in recurring unison to the caress of the wind  klaras eyes peered anxiously round quickly she extinguished her lantern and then remained for a while clinging to the wooden balusters of the verandah eyes and ears on the alert like a hunted beast two belated csikós7 from a neighbouring village were passing down the main road singing at the top of their voices their spurred boots clinking as they walked klara did not move till the murmur of the voices and the clinking of metal had died away and no other sound of human creature moving or breathing close by broke the slumbering echoes of the village  footnote 7 herdsmen in charge of foals  only in the barn far away people were singing and laughing and making merry klara could hear the gipsy band the scraping of the fiddles and banging of the czimbalom followed now and then by one of those outbursts of jollity of clapping of mugs on wooden tables of banging of feet and shouts of laughter which characterize all festive gatherings in hungary  cautiously now klara began to creep along the low wall which supported the balustrade her feet made no noise in the soft sandy earth her skirts clung closely to her limbs at every minute sound she started and paused clinging yet closer to the shadow which enveloped her  now she came to the corner there just in front of her was the pollarded acacia behind which the murderer had cowered for an houron the watch the slowly withering leaves trembled in the breeze and their soughing sounded eerie in the night like the sighs of a departing soul  further on some twenty paces away was old rézis cottage all was dark and still in and around it klara had just a sufficient power of consciousness left to note this fact with an involuntary little sigh of relief the murderer had done his work quickly and silently his victim had uttered no cry that would rouse the old gossip from her sleep  when klara at last rounded the second corner of the house and came in full view of the unfenced yard in the rear she saw that it was flooded with moonlight for a moment she closed her eyes for already she had perceived that a dark and compact mass lay on the ground within a few feet of the back door she wanted strength of purpose and a mighty appeal to her will before she would dare to look again when she reopened her eyes she saw that the mass lay absolutely still she crept forward with trembling limbs and knees that threatened to give way under her at every moment  now she no longer thought of herself there was but little fear of anyone passing by this way and seeing her as she gradually crawled nearer and nearer to that inert mass which lay there on the ground so rigid and silent beyond the yard there were only maizefields and a tall row of sunflowers closed the place in as with a wall and not a sound came from old rézis cottage  klara was quite close to that dark and inert thing at last she put out her hand and touched it the man was lying on his face just as he had fallen no doubt with a superhuman effort she gathered up all her strength and lifted those hunchedup shoulders from the ground then she gave a smothered cry the pallid face of erös béla was staring sightlessly up at the moon  indeed for the moment the poor girl felt as if she must go mad as if for ever and ever after thiswaking or sleepingshe would see those glassy eyes the drooping jaw that horrible stain which darkened the throat and breast for a few seconds which to her seemed an eternity she remained here crouching beside the dead body of this unfortunate man trying in vain in her confused mind to conjecture what had brought béla here instead of the young count within the reach of leopolds maniacal jealousy and revenge  but her brain was too numbed for reasoning and for coherent thought she had but to accept the facts as they were that erös béla lay heredead that leopold had murdered him and that she must save herself at all costs from being implicated in this awful awful crime  at last she contrived to gather up a sufficiency of strengthboth mental and physicalto turn her back upon this terrible scene she had struggled up to her feet and was turning to go when her foot knocked against something hard and asquite mechanicallyher eyes searched the ground to see what this something was she saw that it was the key of the back door which had evidently escaped from the dead mans hand as he fell  to stoop for it and pick it upto run for the back door which was so close byto unlock and open it and then to slip through it into the house was but the work of a few secondsand now here she was once again in her room like the hunted beast back in its lairpanting quivering ready to fallbut safe at all events  no one had seen her of that she felt sure and now she knewor thought she knewexactly what had happened lakatos andor had been to the castle he had seen my lord and got the key away from him he wanted to ingratiate himself with my lord and to be able to boast in the future that he had saved my lords life but evidently he did mean to have his revenge not only on herselfklarabut also on erös béla for the humiliation which they had put upon elsa it was a cruel and a dastardly trick of revenge and in her heart klara had vague hopes already of getting even with andor one day but that would come by and byat some future timewhen all this terrible tragedy would have been forgotten  for the present she must once more think of herself the key was now a precious possession she went to hang it up on its accustomed peg even leopoldif he stayed in the village to brazen the whole thing outcould not prove anything with regard to that key erös béla might have been a casual passerby strolling about among the maizefields not necessarily intent on visiting klara at dead of night the key was now safely on its peg who would dare swear that erös béla or anyone else ever had it in his possession  in fact the secret rested between five people of which sheklarawas one and the dead man another well the latter could tell no tales and she of course would say nothing already she had determinedeven though her mind was still confused and her faculties still numbthat ignorance would be the safest stronghold behind which she could entrench herself  there remained leo himself the young count and of course andor which of these three would she have the greatest cause to fear  there was leo mad with jealousy the young count indifferent and andor with curious and tortuous motives in his heart which surely he would not wish to disclose  she had a sufficiency of presence of mind to go out and fetch the stormlantern from where she had left it at the foot of the verandah steps a passerby who saw her in the act wished her a merry goodnight to which she responded in a steady voice then she carefully locked the front door and finally undressed and went to bed there was no knowing whether some belated wayfarer might not presently come on the dead man lying there in the yard and having roused the neighbours the latter might think of calling on ignácz goldstein for spirit or what not it was not generally known that ignácz goldstein was from home and if people thumped loudly and long at her door she must appear as if she had just been roused from peaceful sleep  she felt much more calm and fully alive above all to her own danger that kind of superstitious unreasoning terror which had assailed her awhile ago had almost entirely left her she seemed more composed more sure of herself now that she had been out in the yard and seen the whole mise en scène of the tragedy which before that she had only vaguely imagined  but what she felt that she could not do was to lie here alone in the dark with only the silvery light of the moon creeping in weirdly through the dulled panes of the tiny window so she picked up her black skirt and stuffed it into the narrow window embrasure until not a ray of light from within could be seen to peep through on the other side she had placed the stormlantern in the corner and this she left alight it threw a feeble yellowish glimmer round the room after a few moments when her eyes were accustomed to this semigloom she found that she could see every familiar object quite distinctly even the shadows did not seem impenetrable nor could ghosts lurk in the unseen portions of the tiny room  of course there was no hope of sleepklara knew well the moment that she looked on the dead mans face that she would always see it before herto the end of her days she saw it now quite distinctlyespecially when she closed her eyes the moonlit yard the shadow that fell from the tall sunflowers and the huddled dark mass on the ground with the turnedup face and the sightless eyes but she was not afraid she only felt bitterly resentful against andor who she firmly believed had played her an odious trick  she almost felt sorry for leopold who had only sinned because of his great love for her     chapter xxviii  we shall hear of another tragedy by and by   and so in marosfalva there was no wedding on the festival day of s michael and all angels instead of that on the day following there was a solemn mass for the dead in the small village church which was full to overflowing on that great occasion  erös béla had been foundout in the openmurdered by an unknown hand fehér károly and his brother who lived down the fekete road had taken a cut across the last maizefieldthe one situated immediately behind the inn kept by ignácz goldstein and they had come across bélas body lying in the yard with face upturned and eyes staring up sightlessly at the brilliant blue sky overhead  it was then close on eight oclock in the morning the dancing in the barn had been kept up till then even though the two most important personages of the festive gathering were not there to join in the fun  the bridegroom had not been seen since his brief appearance an hour or two before supper and elsa had only just sat through the meal trying to seem cheerful but obviously hardly able to restrain her tears after supper when her partner sought her for the csárdás she was nowhere to be found kapus irmaappealed tosaid that the girl was fussy and full of nervesfor all the world like a born lady she certainly wasnt very well had complained of headache and been allowed by her mother to go home quietly and turn into bed  she has another two jolly days to look forward to irma néni had added complacently perhaps it is as well that she should get some rest tonight  ah well it was a queer wedding and no mistake the queerest that had ever been in marosfalva within memory of man a bride more prone to tears than to laughter a bridegroom surly discontented and paying marked attentions to the lowdown jewess over at the inn under his future wifes very nose  it was quite one thing for a man to assert his own independence and to show his bride at the outset on whose feet the highestheeled boots would be but quite another to flout the customs of the countryside and all its proprieties  when after supper good and abundant wine had loosened all tongues adverse comments on the absent bridegroom flowed pretty freely this should have been the merriest time of the eveningthe merriest time in fact of all the three festive daysthe time when one was allowed to chaff the bride and to make her blush to slap the lucky bridegroom on the back and generally to allow full play to that exuberance of spirits which is always bubbling up to the surface out of a magyar peasants heart  no doubt that bélas conduct had upset elsa and generally cast a gloom over the festive evening but the young people were not on that account going to be done out of their dancing the older ones might sit round and gossip and throw up their hands and sigh but that was no reason why the gipsies should play a melancholy dirge  a csárdás it must be and of the liveliest and after that another and yet another would it not be an awful pity to waste erös bélas money even though he was not here to enjoy its fruits so dancing was kept up till close on eight oclock in the morningtill the sun was high up in the heavens and the bell of the village church tolled for early mass until then the gipsies scraped their fiddles and banged their czimbalom almost uninterruptedly hundreds of sad and gay folksongs were sung in chorus in the intervals of dancing the national dance cotton petticoats of many hues fluttered leather bootsboth red and blackclinked and stamped until the morning  then it was that the merry company at last broke up and that fehér károly and his brother took the short cut behind the inn and found the bridegroomat whose expense they had just danced and feastedlying stark and stiff under the clear september sun  they informed the mayor who at once put himself in communication with the gendarmerie of arad but long before the police came the news of the terrible discovery was all over the village and there was no thought of sleep or rest after that  worried to death perspiring and puzzled the police officers hastily sent down from arad had vainly tried to make head or tail of the mass of conflicting accounts which were poured into their ears in a continuous stream of loudvoiced chatter for hours at a stretch and god only knows what judicial blunders might have been committed before the culprit was finally brought to punishment if the latter had not once for all himself delivered over the key of the mystery  leopold hirsch had hanged himself to one of the beams in his own back shop his assistant found him theredeadlater in the day  asby previous arrangementthe whole village was likely to be at elsa kapus wedding there would not have been much use in keeping the shop open so the assistant had been given a holiday but he came to the shop toward midday when the whole village was full of the terrible news and half the population out in the street gossiping and commenting on itmarvelling why his employer had not yet been seen outside his doors  the discoverywhich the assistant at once communicated to the policesolved the riddle of erös bélas death with a sigh of relief the police officers adjourned from the mayors parlour where they had been holding their preliminary inquiries to the castle where it was their duty to report the occurrence to my lord the count  at the castle of course everyone was greatly surprised the noble countess raised her aristocratic eyebrows and declared her abhorrence of hearing of these horrors the count took the opportunity of cursing the peasantry for a quarrelsome worrying lot and offered the police officers a snack and a glass of wine he was hardly sorry for the loss of his bailiff as erös béla had been rather tiresome of latebumptious and none too soberand his lordship anyhow had resolved to dispense with his services after he was married so the death really caused him very little inconvenience  young count feri knew nothing of course he was not likely to allow himself or his name to be mixed up with a village scandal he shuddered once or twice when the thought flashed through his mind how narrowly he had escaped erös bélas fate and to his credit be it said he had every intention of showing lakatos andorwho undoubtedly had saved his life by giving him timely warninga substantial meed of gratitude  of klara goldstein little or nothing was seen or heard the police officers had certainly gone to the inn in the course of the morning and had stayed there close on half an hour but as no one had been allowed to go into the taproom during that time the occurrences there remained a matter of conjecture after the officers went away klara locked the front door after them and remained practically shut up in the house only going in the evening as far as the post but refusing to speak to anyone and going past with head erect and a proud careless air which deceived no one  shell sing her tune in a minor key by and by when ignácz goldstein comes home said the gossips complacently  those jews are mighty hard on their daughters commented the older folk if any scandal falls upon them ignácz is a hard man and overready with his stick  i shouldnt be surprised was the universal conclusion if we should hear of another tragedy by and by  in any case klara cant stay in the village decided the bevy of young girls who talked the matter over among themselves and were none too sorry that the smart handsome jewesswho had such a way with the menshould be comfortably out of the way  but everyone went to the mass for the dead on the day following that which should have been such a merry wedding feast and everyone joined in the requiem and prayed fervently for the repose of the soul of the murdered man  he lay in state in the centre of the aisle with four tall candles at each corner of the draped catafalque a few bunches of white and purple asters clumsily tied together by inexperienced hands were laid upon the coffin  pater bonifácius preached a beautiful sermon about the swift and unexpected approach of death when he is least expected he also said some very nice things about the dead man and there was hardly a dry eye in the church while he spoke  in the remote corner of a pew squeezed between a pillar and her mother elsa knelt and prayed those who watched herand there were manydeclared that not only did she never stop crying for a moment during mass but that her eyes were swollen and her cheeks puffy from having cried all the night and all the day before  after mass she must have slipped out by the little door which gave on the presbytery garden it was quite close to the pillar against which she had been leaning and no doubt the pater had given her permission to go out that way from the presbytery garden she could skirt the fields and round the top of the village and thus get home and give all her friends the slip  this no doubt she had done for no one saw her the whole of that day nor the next which was the day of the funeral and an occasion of wonderful pomp and ceremony bélas brother had arrived in the meanwhile from arad where he was the manager of an important grain store and he it was who gave all directions and all the money necessary that his brother should have obsequies befitting his rank and wealth  the church was beautifully decorated there were huge bunches of white flowers upon the altar and eight village lads carried the dead man to his last restingplace and no less than thirty masses were ordered to be said within the next year for the repose of the soul of one who in life had enjoyed so much prosperity and consideration  and in the tiny graveyard situated among the maizefields to the north of marosfalva and which is the local jewish burial ground the suicide was quietly laid to rest there was no religious service for there was no minister of his religion present an undertaker came down from arad and saw to it all there was no concourse of people no singing no flowers ignácz goldsteinhome the day before from kecskemétalone followed the plain deal coffin on its lonely journey from the village to the field  it was the shop assistant who had seen to it all he had gone up to arad and seen a married sister of his late masterssara rosen whose husband kept a secondhand clothes shop there and who gave full instructions to an undertaker whilst declaring herself unableowing to delicate healthto attend the funeral herself  the undertaker had provided a cart and a couple of oxen and two men to lift the coffin in and out they came late on the thursday evening at about eight oclock and drew up at the back of the late leopold hirschs shop no one was about and the night was dark  slowly the cart creaking on its wheels and axles wound its way through some maize stubble up a soft sandy road to the enclosed little bit of ground which the local jews have reserved for themselves  and the mysterious veil which divides the present from the past fell quickly over this act of the village tragedy as it had done with pomp and circumstance after the banquet which followed the laying to rest of the murdered man     chapter xxix  some day   a week went by after the funeral before elsa saw andor again she had not purposely avoided him any more than she had avoided everyone else but unlike most girls of her class and of her nationality she had felt a great desire to be alone during the most acute period of this lifes crisis through which she was passing just now  at first on that nevertobeforgotten morning when she woke to her weddingdayher white veil and wreath of artificial white roses lying conspicuously on the top of the chest of drawers so that her eyes were bound to alight on them the moment they openedand saw her mother standing beside her bed dishevelled pale and obviously labouring under some terrible excitement she had been conscious as of an awful blow on the head a physical sensation of numbness and of pain  even before she had had time to formulate a question she knew that some terrible calamity had occurred in jerky phrases broken by moans and interjections the mother had blurted out the news erös béla was deadhe had been found just nowmurdered outside klara goldsteins doorthere would be no weddingelsa was a widow before she had been a bride half the village was inclined to believe that ignácz goldstein had done the deed in a moment of angry passion finding béla sneaking round his daughters door when he himself was going away from homeothers boldly accused andor  elsa had said nothing at the time that same imagined blow on the head had also deprived her of the power of speech fortunately irma talked so loudly and so long that she paid no attention to her daughters silence and presently ran out into the village to gather more news  and elsa remained alone in the house save for the helpless invalid in the next room she washed and dressed herself quickly and mechanically then sat down on her favourite low chair close beside her crippled fathers knee cowering there like some little field mouse attentive alert rigidly still for very fear of what was to come  irma did not come back for two or three hours when she did it was to bring the exciting news that leopold hirsch had been found hanging to a beam in his back shop with the knife wherewith he had killed erös béla lying conspicuously on a table close by  elsa felt as if the weight of the world had been lifted from off her brain all through these hours the thought of andor having committed such an abominable crime never once entered her mind but nevertheless when her mother told the news about leopold hirsch and that the police officers had already left the village she was conscious of an overwhelming sense of relief  fortunately her mother was busy all day gossiping with her cronies and elsa was allowed the luxury of sitting alone most of the day silent and absorbed doing the usual work of the house in the morning and in the afternoon busying herself with carefully putting away the wedding dress the veil the wreath which would not be wanted now  late in the evening when there was a chance of finding the street deserted she ran out as far as the presbytery fortunately the night was dark a thin drizzle was falling and it spread a misty veil all down the village street elsa had tied one of her mothers darkcoloured handkerchiefs over her head and put her darkestcoloured petticoat on the top of all the others she had also wrapped her mothers dark shawl round her shoulders and thus muffled up she was able to flit unperceived down the street a swift little dark figure undistinguishable from the surrounding darkness of the night  fortunately the pater was at home and ready to see her she heaved a sigh of relief as she entered the bare narrow little hall which led on the right to the paters parlour  she had been able to tell pater bonifácius exactly what was troubling herthat sense of peace almost of relief which had descended into her soul when she heard that she never never need be erös bélas wife since this morning when first she had heard the terrible news she had not thought of his deaththat awful fate which had so unexpectedly overtaken himshe had only thought of her own freedom the peace which henceforth would be hers  that was very wrong of coursea grievous sin no doubt the pater would call it she shed many tears of contrition listened eagerly to a kind homily from the old priest on the subject of unnecessary and unprofitable searchings of conscience and went away satisfied  strangely enough after this confession she felt far more sorry for poor béla than she had done before and she cried her eyes out both before and after the funeral because do what she would she always saw him before her as he was that last day of his lifequarrelsome dictatorial tyrannicaland she remembered how she had almost hated him for his bullying ways and compared him in her mind with andors kindness and chivalry  and now she cried with remorse because she had hated him during the last hours of his life she cried because he had gone to his death unloved and lay now in his coffin unregretted she cried because her heart was full and heavy and because in the past weekbefore her wedding dayshe had swallowed so many unshed tears  and while she felt miserable and not a little forlorn she didnt want to see anybody least of all andor whenever she thought of andor the same remorse about béla gnawed again at her heart for when she thought of him she not only felt at peace but it seemed as if a ray of happiness illumined the past darkness of her life  once or twice during the last day or two when she had sat stitching she caught herself singing softly to herself and once she knew for certain that she had smiled  then the day came when andor called at the house irma fortunately was out having coffee and gossip with a friend no doubt he had watched until he was sure that she was well out of the way then he knocked at the door and entered  elsa was sitting as usual on the low chair close by the sick man she looked up when he entered and all at once the blood rushed to her pale cheeks  may i come in he asked diffidently  if you like andor she replied  he threw down his hat and then came to sit on the corner of the table in his favorite attitude and as close to elsa as he dared the eyes of the paralytic had faintly lit up at his approach  are you quite well elsa he asked after a long pause during which the girl thought that she could hear the beating of her own heart  yes quite well thank you andor she replied softly  no one has seen you in the village this past week he remarked  no she said i am not very fond of gossip and there was a deal too much of it in marosfalva this past week to please me  you are right there elsa he rejoined but there were others in the village you know those who did not gossipbut whose heart would have been gladdened by a sight of you  yes andor she murmured  we may take it that the young man found these laconic answers distinctly encouraging for presently he said abruptly  perhaps elsa it isnt right for me to begin talking to you    about certain matters     what matters andor she asked ingenuously  matters which have lain next to my heart elsa for more years now than i would care to count  perhaps it is a little too soon andoryet she whispered under her breath  oh she could have whipped herself for that warm blush which now covered not only her cheeks but her neck and bosom and for that glow of happiness which had rushed straight at her heart at his words but he had already seen the blush and caught that expression of happiness in her blue eyes which suddenly made her look as she did of oldfive years agobefore that wan pathetic expression of resignation had altered her sweet face so completely  i dont want to worry you elsa he said simply  you couldnt worry me andor she said you have always been the best friend i had in the world  that is because i have loved you more dearly than anyone ever loved you on this earth he said earnestly  god bless you for that andor  he leaned forward nearer to her now his gaze had become more fixed more compelling since he had seen that look on her face and that blush he was sure of his ground he knew that given time and peace the wheel of fate which had already taken an upward turn for him would soon carry him to the summit of his desiresthe woman whom he loved was no longer unattainable and she had remained faithful throughout all this time  do you think elsa he asked more insistently now and sinking his voice to that whisper which reaches a womans ear far more truly than the loudest beating of drum do you think that now that you are free you could bring yourself to    to care    to     you were very fond of me once elsa he pleaded  i am fond of you now andor she whispered in response no no she added hurriedly for already he had made a movement towards her and the next moment would have been down on his knees with his arms around her but for the gentlyrestraining touch of her hand it is too soon to talk about that  yestoo soon he assented with enforced calm even though his heart was beating furiously it is too soon i know and i wont worry you elsai said i wouldnt and i wont    i am not a cur to come and force myself on you when you are not ready to listen to me and we wont talk about it all    not just yet     his throat felt very dry and his tongue felt several sizes too large for his mouth it was mightily difficult to keep calm and to speak soberly when ones inclination was firstly to dance a wardance of triumph and of joy and then to take that dear sweet angel of a woman in ones arms and to kiss her till she was ready to faint  when do you think i might speak to you again elsa he said with a certain pathetic hesitancy about     about what andor she asked  about our getting marriedlater on  not just yet she murmured but     no no of course i understand there are the proprieties and all that    you were tokened to that blackguard and    oh all right i am not going to say anything against him he added quickly as he saw that words of protest and reproach were already hovering on her lips i wont say anything about him at all except that he is dead now and buried thank the good god    and you    you still care for me elsa he continued whilst a wave of tenderness seemed to sweep all other thoughts away no no dont say anythingnot nowit is too soon of courseand ive just got to wait till the time comes as best i can but you mustnt mind my talking on at random like this    for i tell you i am nearly crazy with joyand i suppose that you would think it very wrong to rejoice like this over another mans death  his talk was a little wild and ramblingit was obvious that he was half distracted with the prospect of happiness to come she sat quite still listening silently with eyes fixed to the ground only now and then she would look upnot at andor but at the paralytic who was gazing on her with the sad eyes of uncomprehension then she would nod and smile at him and coo in her own motherly way and he would close his eyessatisfied  and andor who had paused for that brief moment in his voluble talk went rambling on  you know he said that its perfectly wonderful    this room i mean    when i look round me i can hardly credit my eyes    just a week ago    you remember    i sat just there    at the opposite corner of the table and you had your low chair against the wall just here    and    and you told me that you were tokened to erös béla and that your wedding would be on the morrow    well that was little more than a week ago    before your farewell feast    and i thought then that never never could i be happy again because you told me that never never could we be anything to each other except a kind of friendly strangers    i remember then how a sort of veil seemed to come down in front of my eyes    a dark red veil    things didnt look black to me you know elsa    but red    so now i am quite content just to bide my timei am quite content that you should say nothing to menothing good i mean    itll take some time before the thought of so much happiness has got proper roothold of my brain  poor andor she sighed and turned a gaze full of love upon the sick man her heart was brimming over with it and so the paralytic got the expression of it in its fullest measure since andor was not entitled to it yet  but just tell me for certain elsa    so that i shouldnt have to torment myself in the meanwhile    just tell me for certain that one day    in the fardistant future if you like but one day    say that you will marry me  some day andor i will marry you if god wills she said simply  oh but of course he will he rejoined airily and we will be married in the springor the early summer when the maize is just beginning to ripen    and well rent the mill from pali bácsishall we elsa  if you like andor  if i like he exclaimed if i like the dear god love me but i think that if i stay here much longer i shall go off my head    elsa you dont know how much i love you and what i would not do for your sake    i feel a different man even for the joy of sitting here and talking to you and no one having the right to interfere    and i would make you happy elsa that i swear by the living god i would make you happy and i would work to keep you in comfort all the days of my life you shall be just as fine as erös béla would have made youand besides that there would be a smile on your sweet face at every hour of the day    your hands would be as white as those of my lady the countess herself for i would have a servant to wait on you and your father would come and live with us and we would make him happy and comfortable too and your mother    well your mother would be happy too and therefore not quite so cantankerous as she sometimes is  to andor there was nothing ahead but a life full of sunshine he never looked back on the past few days and on the burden of sin which they bore béla had been a brute of the most coarse and abominable type by his monstrous conduct on the eve of his wedding day he had walked to his deathof his own accord andor had not sent him oh he was quite quite sure that he had not sent béla to his death he had merely forborn to warn himand surely there could be no sin in that  he might have told béla that leopold hirschhalf mad with jealousywas outside on the watch with a huntingknife in his pocket and murder in his soul andor might have told béla this and he had remained silent was that a sin considering what a brute the man was how his action that night was a deadly insult put upon elsa and how he would in the future have bullied and browbeaten elsa and made her life a miserya veritable hell upon earth  andor had thought the problem out he had weighed it in his mind and he was satisfied that he had not really committed a sin of course he ought before now to have laid the whole case before pater bonifácius and the pater would have told him just what gods view would be of the whole affair  the fact that andor had not thought of going to confession showed that he was not quite sure what godas represented by pater bonifáciuswould think of it all but he meant to go by and by and conclude a permanent and fulsome peace treaty with his conscience  in the meanwhile even though the burden of remorse should at times in the future weigh upon his soul and perhaps spoil a little of his happiness well he would have to put up with it and that was allelsa was happyone sight of her radiant little face was enough for any fool to see that an infinite sense of relief had descended into her soul elsa was happyfreed from the brute who would have made her wretched for the rest of her life and surely the good god who could read the secret motives which lay in a fellows heart would not be hard on andor for what he had doneor left undonefor elsas sake     chapter xxx  kyrie eleison   but the daily routine of everyday life went on at marosfalva just as it had done before the double tragedy of st michaels een had darkened the pages of its simple history  the maize had all been gathered inploughing had begunmy lord and his guests were shooting in the stubble the first torrential rain had fallen and the waters of the maros had begun to swell  gossip about erös bélas terrible end and leopold hirschs suicide had not by any means been exhausted but it was supplemented now by talk of lakatos páls wealth the old man had been ailing for some time his nephew andors return had certainly cheered him up for a while but soon after that he seemed to collapse very suddenly in health like old folk do in this part of the worldstricken down by one or other of the several diseases which are engendered by the violent extremes of heat and colddiseases of the liver for the most partthe beginning of a slowlyoncoming end  he had always been reputed to be a miser and those who were in the know now averred that andor had found several thousand florins tucked away in old bits of sacking and hidden under his uncles straw paillasse pali bácsi was also possessed of considerable propertysome land a farm and the mill there was no doubt now that andor would be a very rich man one of these days  mothers with marriageable daughters sighed nevertheless in vain andor was not for any of them andor had eyes only for elsa he had become an important man in the village now that his uncle was so ill and he was left to administer the old mans property and he took his duties very earnestly in the intervals of courting kapus elsa  as to this no one had cause to make any objection they had loved one another and been true to one another for five years it was clearly the will of the good god that they should come together at last  and now october was drawing to its closetoday was the fourth sunday in the month and one of the numerous feasts of our blessed lady one on which solemn benediction is appointed to be sung in the early afternoon and benediction is followed by a procession to the shrine of the virgin which stands on the roadside on the way to saborsó some two kilomètres distant from marosfalva it is a great festival and one to which the peasantry of the countryside look forward with great glee for they love the procession and have a great faith in the efficacy of prayer said at the shrine  fortunately the day turned out to be one of the most glorious sunshiny days which midautumn can yield and the little church in the afternoon was crowded in every corner the older womentheir heads covered with darkcoloured handkerchiefs occupied the left side of the aisle the men crowded in on the right and at the back under the organ loft round about the chancel rail and steps the bevy of girls in gayest sunday dresses looked like a garden of giant animated flowers when the sexton went the round with the collectingbag tied to the end of a long pole he had the greatest difficulty in making his way through the maze of manyhued petticoats which as the girls knelt stood all round them like huge bells with their slim shoulders and small heads above looking for all the world like the handles  the children were all placed in the chancel to right and left of the altar solemn and wellbehaved with one eye on the schoolmistress and the other on the pater  after the service the order of procession was formed inside the church the children in the forefront with banner carried by the head of the schoola sturdy maiden on the fringe of her teens very proud to carry the blessed virgins banner she squared her shoulders well for the banner was heavy and the line of her young hipswell accentuated by the numerous petticoats which a proud mother had tied round her waistgave a certain dignity to her carriage and natural grace to her movements  behind the children came the young girlsthose of a marriageable age whom a pious custom dedicates most specially to the service of our lady their banner was of blue silk and most of them were dressed in blue whilst blue ribbons fluttered round their heads as they walked  then came pater bonifácius under a velvetcovered dais which was carried by four village lads he wore his vestments and carried a holy relic in his hands the choirboys swinging their metal censers were in front of him in wellworn red cassocks and surplices beautifully ironed and starched for the occasion  in the rear the crowd rapidly closed in the younger men had a banner to themselves and there were the young matrons the mothers the fathers the old and the lonely  the sexton threw open the doors and slowly the little procession filed out outside a brilliant sunshine struck full on the whitewashed walls of the little schoolhouse opposite it was so dazzling that it made everybody blink as they stepped out from the semidark church into this magnificent flood of light  in the street round the church a pathetic group awaited the appearance of the procession those that were too old to walk two kilomètres to the shrine those who were lame and those who were sick simply and with uninquiring minds they knelt or stood in the roadway content to watch the banners as they swung gaily to the rhythmic movements of the bearers content to see the holy relics in the paters hand content to feel that subtle wave of religious sentiment pass over them which made them at peace with their little world and brought the existence of god nearer to their comprehension  slowly the procession wound its way down the village street pater bonifácius had intoned the opening orisons of the litany  kyrie eleison  and men and women chanted the response in that quaintly harsh tone which the magyar language assumes when it is sung the brilliant sunlight played on the smooth hair of the girls the golds the browns and the blacks and threw sharp glints on the fluttering ribbons of many colours which a light autumn breeze was causing to dance gaily and restlessly the whole village was hushed save for the litany the clinking of the metal chains as the choirboys swung the censers and the froufrou of hundreds of starched petticoatssuperposed brushing one against the other with a ceaseless movement which produced a riot of brilliant colouring  soon the main road was reached and now the vast immensity of the plain lay in front and all roundall the more vast and immense now it seemed since not even the nodding plumes of maize or tall stately sunflowers veiled the mystery of that lowlying horizon far away  nothing around now save that group of willow trees by the bank of the turbulent marosnothing except the stubblestumps of maize and pumpkin and hemp and rigid lines of brokendown stems of sunflowers with drooping dead leaves and brown life still oozing out of the torn stems  and in the immensity the sweet manytoned sounds of summerthe call of birds the quiver of growing things the trembling of ripening cornhas yielded to the sad tune of autumna tune made up of the hushed sighs of dying nature as she sinks slowly and peacefully into her coming winters sleep the swallows and the storks have gone away long ago they know that in this land of excessive heat and winter rigours frost and snow tread hard on the heels of a warm autumnal day only a flight of rooks breaks the even line of the sky their cawing alone makes at times a weird accompaniment to the chanting of the litany and the marosno longer sluggishnow sends her swollen waters with a dull rumbling sound westward to the arms of the mother stream  silence and emptiness  nothing except the sky with its unending panorama of evervarying clouds and its infinite boundless mysterious horizon which enfolds the world of the plains in a limitless embrace nothing except the stubble and the sky and far very far away a lonely cottage with its surrounding group of low mophead acacias and the gaunt straight arm of a well pointing upwards to the sun  and through the silent vast immensity the little procession of village folk with banners flying and quaint harsh voices singing the litany winds its way along the flat sandy road like a brightlycoloured ribbon thrown there by a giant hand and made to flutter and to move by a giants breath  presently the shrine came in sight just a dark speck at first in the midst of the great loneliness then more and more distinctthere on the roadsideall by itself without a tree near itlonely in the bosom of the plain  the procession came to a halt in front of it and two hundred pairs of eyes brimful with simple faith and simple trust gazed in reverence on the naïve wax figure behind the grating within its throne of rough stone and whitewash it was dressed in blue calico spangled with tinsel and had a crown on its head made of gilt paper and a veil of coarse tarlatan two china pots containing artificial flowers were placed on either side of the little image  it was all very crude very rough very naïve but a fervent unsophisticated imagination had endowed it with a beauty all the more real perhaps because it only existed in the hearts of a handful of ignorant children of the soil it made something seem real to them which otherwise might have been difficult to grasp and now when pater bonifácius in his gentle cracked voice intoned the invocations of the litany the salus infirmorum and refugium peccatorum and above all the consolatrix afflictorum the response ora pro nobis came from two hundred trusting heartspraying if not for themselves then for those who were dear to them the infirm the sinner the afflicted  and among those two hundred hearts none felt the need for prayer more than andor and elsa they had left affliction behind them they stood upon the threshold of a new lifewhere happiness alone beckoned to them and sorrow and parting lay vanquished behind the gates of the past but in spite or perhaps because of this happiness which beckoned so near now there was a tinge of sadness in their hearts that sadness which always comes with joy once extreme youth has gone by    the sadness which hovers over finite things the sense of future which so quickly becomes the past  from where andor stood holding the dais above pater bonifácius head he could see elsas smooth fair head among the crowd of other girls she had tied her hair in at the nape of the neck with a bit of blue ribbon leaving it to fall lower down in two thick plaits well below her waist she looked like a huge blue gentian kissed by the sun for her top petticoat was of blue cotton and her golden head seemed like the sweetscented stamen  andor thought that he could hear her voice above that of everyone else and when pater bonifácius intoned the regina angelorum he thought that indeed the heavenly queen had no fairer subject up there than elsa  when the little procession was once more ready to return to the village the bearers of the dais were relieved by four other lads and andor found the means during the slight hubbub which occurred while the procession was being formed of working his way close to elsas side  it was not an unusual thing for young men and girls who had much to say to one another to fall away from the procession on its way home and to wander back arm in arm through the maizefields or over the stubble even as their shadows lengthened out upon the ground  andors hand had caught hold of elsas elbow and with insistent pressure he kept her out of the group of her companions gradually the procession was formed and slowly it began to move the banners fluttered once more in the breeze once more the monotonous chant broke the silence of the plain  but elsa and andor had remained behind close beside the shrine she had yielded to his insistence knowing what it was that he meant to say to her while they walked together toward the sunset she knew what he wanted to say and what he expected her to promise and he knew that at last she was ready to listen and that she would no longer hold her heart in check but let it flow over with all the love which it contained and that she was ready at last to hold up to him that cup of happiness for which he craved  one or two couples had also remained behind but they had already wandered off toward the bank of the maros elsa had knelt down before the crude image of the consoler of the afflicted her rosary was wound round her fingers she prayed in her simple soul fervently unquestioningly for happiness and for peace  then when the little procession in the distance became wrapped in the golden haze which hung over the plain and the chanting of the litany came but as a murmur on the wings of the autumn breeze she took andors arm and together they walked slowly back toward home  the peace which rests over the plain enveloped them both from the sky above the last vestige of cloud had been driven away by the breeze and far away on that distant horizon where lay the land of the unknown the sun was slowly sinking to rest  like a huge drooping rose it seemedits rays like petals falling away from it one by one mute yet quivering was the plain around pulsating with life yet silent in its autumnal agony from far away came the sweet sound of the evening angelus rung from the village churchdistant and soft like a sound from heaven or like an echo of some beautiful dream  and these two were alone with the sunset and with the stubblealone in this vastness which is so like the seaalonetwo tiny moving black specks with a background of radiance and a golden haze to envelop them in this immensity it seemed so much more easy to speak of lovefor love could fill the plain and find room for its own immensity in this vastness which knows no trammels to andor and elsa it seemed as if at last the plain had revealed its secret to them had lifted for them that veil of mystery which wraps her up all round where earth and sky meet in the golden distance beyond  they knew suddenly just what lay behind the veil they knew if it were lifted what it was that they would seethe land of gold was the land of love where men and women wandered hand in hand where sorrow was a dwarf and grief a cripple since lovethe almighty king of the unknown landhad wounded them and vanquished them both  and they too now wandered toward that land even though it still seemed very far away to the accompaniment of the angelus bell they wandered with the distant echo of the chanted litany still ringing in their ear the plain encompassed her children with her allembracing peace and she gave them this one supreme moment of happiness today while the setting sun clothed the horizon with gold     chapter xxxi  what about me   and time slipped by with murmurings of words that have no meaning save for one pair of ears andor talked fondly and foolishly and elsa mostly was silent she had loved this walk over the stubble and the plain had been in perfect peace save for the rumbling of the maros insistent and menacing which had struck a chill to the girls heart like a presage of evil  she tried to swallow her fears chiding herself for feeling them doing her best to close her ears to those rumbling turbulent waters that seemed to threaten as they tumbled along on their way  gradually as they neared the village that curious feeling of impending evil became more strong she could not help speaking of it to andor but he only laughed in that delightfully happyalmost defiantly happyway of his and for a moment or two she was satisfied  but when at about half a kilomètre from home she caught sight of klara goldstein walking away from the village straight toward her and andor it seemed as if her fears had suddenly assumed a more tangible shape  klara looked old and thin she thought pathetic too in her plain black dressshe who used to be so fond of pretty clothes elsa gave her a hearty greeting as soon as she was near enough to her and extended a cordial hand she had no cause to feel welldisposed toward the jewess but there was something so forlornlooking about the girl now and such a look of sullen despair in her dark eyes that elsas gentle nature was at once ready to forgive and to cheer  it is a long time since i have seen you klara she said pleasantly  no wonder said the other girl with a shrug of her thin shoulders father wont let me out of his sight  she had nodded to andor but by tacit consent they had not shaken hands klara now put her hands on her hips and like a young animal let free after days of captivity she drew in deep breaths of sweetscented air  ah she said with a sigh it is good to be out again being a prisoner doesnt suit me i can tell you that  your dear father seems to be very severe with you klara said elsa compassionately  yes curse him retorted the jewess fiercely as a savage cruel look flashed through her sunken eyes he nearly killed me when he came home from kecskemét that timebeat me like a dogand now     poor klara  i shouldnt have minded the beating so much among our people parents have the right to be severe and it is better to take a beating from your father than to be punished by the rabbi  your dear father will forgive you in time suggested elsa gently  she felt miserably uncomfortable and would have given worlds to be rid of klara she couldnt think why the girl had stopped to talk to her and andor in fact she was more than sure that klara had come out this evening on purpose to talk to her and to andor for now she stood deliberately in front of them both with arms crossed in front of her and defiant eyes fixed now upon one and now upon the other andor too was beginning to look cross and sullen this meeting coming on the top of that lovely walk seemed like a black shadow cast over the radiance of their happiness and this thin tall girl all in black with black hair fluttering round her pale face seemed like a big black bird of evil presage her skirts flapped round her knees like wings and her voice sounded cold and harsh like the croaking of a raven  but elsas kindly disposition did not allow her to be too obviously unkind to the jewess perhaps after all the girl meant no harm and had only run out now like a released colt glad to feel freedom in the air around her and the vastness lying stretched out before her to infinity beyond perhaps she had only sought the company of the firstcomers in order to get a small measure of sympathy but now though elsas gentle words should have softened her mood she retorted with renewed fierceness  curse him i dont want his forgiveness and if ever he wants mineon his deathbedhe wont get iteven if he should die in torment for want of a kind word from me  klara you mustnt say that cried elsa horrified at what she considered almost blasphemy your father is your father rememberand even if he has been harsh to you     klara interrupted her with a loud and strident laugh  if he has been harsh to me she exclaimed didnt i tell you that he thrashed me like a dog so that i was sick for days but i wouldnt mind that so much bruises mend sooner or later but its that abominable marriage which will make me curse him to my dying day  marriage    what marriage     with a man i had never seen in my life until it was all settled just a man who is so ugly and so badtempered and so repugnant to every girl whom he knows that nobody would have himbut just a man who wanted a wife the rabbi at arad knew about him and he spoke about him to fatherit seems that he is quite richand father has given me to him and i am to be married within a fortnight curse them curse them all i say oh i wish i had the pluck to run away or to kill myself or do somethingbut i am such an abominable cowardand i shall loathe to live in arad in a tiny secondhand clothes shop with that hideous monster for a husbandpointed at by everyone as the girl with a disgraceful story to her credit and sold to a creature whom no one else would havein order to cover up a scandal  elsa was silent her heart now was full of pity for the girl who indeed was being punished far more severely than she deserved it was clear that klara was terribly resentful at her fate and there was a look of vengeful rebellion in the glance which she threw on elsa and andor now  overhead there was flapping of wingsa flight of rooks cut through the air and there were magpies in their trail  three for a wedding said andor with a forced laugh trying to break the spell whichmuch against his willseemed to have been suddenly cast over his happy spirits  one for sorrow more like retorted klara  no no come he rejoined you must not look at it like that there is always some happiness to be got out of married life you are not very happy in your old homeyou will like to have one of your owna wedding is only the prelude to better things  that depends on the wedding my friend she sneered this one will be a finish not a preludethe naughty child well whipped sent out of mischiefs way  i am sorry klara that you feel it so strongly he said more kindly  yes she retorted i dare say my good man you are sorry enough for me now but you might have thought of all that you know before you played me that dirty trick  what do you mean he broke in quickly  just what i say she replied and no more a dirty abominable trick i call it and i cannot even show you up before the villagei could not even speak of you to the police officers oh yes she continued more and more vehemently as a flood of wrath and of resentment and a burning desire for getting even with fate seemed literally to sweep her off her mental balance and cause her to lose complete control of her tongue oh yes my fine gentleman you can go and court elsa now and whisper sweet lovewords in her earsyou two turtledoves are the edification of the entire village nowand presently you will get married and live happy ever afterwards but what i want to ask you my friend she added and she took a step or two nearer to him until her hot and angry breath struck him in the face and he was forced to draw himself back away from that seething cauldron of resentment and of vengeance which was raging before him now what i want to ask you is have you ever thought of me  thought of you klara he said quietly even as he felt more than saw that elsa too had drawn back a littlea step or two further away from klara but a step or two also further away from him thought of you he reiterated seeing that klara did not reply immediately and that just for one brief momentit was a mere flasha look of irresolution had crept into her eyes why should i be thinking about you  why indeed she said with a wrathful sneer what hurt had i done to you andor that is what i want to know i was always friendly to you i had never done you any wrongnor did i do elsa any wrongany wrong i mean that mattered she continued talking more loudly and more volubly because andor was making desperate efforts to stop and interrupt her béla would only have run after another woman if i had turned my back on him and then when you asked me to leave him alone i promised didnt i what you asked me to do i promised    and i meant to keep my promise to you and you knew it    and yet you rounded on me like that     silence klara he cried at the top of his voice as he shook the girl roughly by the shoulder  but she paid no heed to himshe was determined to be heard determined to have her say all the bitterness in her had been bottled up for weeks she meant to meet andor face to face before she was packed off as the submissive wife of a hated husbandthe naughty child whipped and sent out of the wayshe meant to throw all the pentup bitterness within her straight into his faceand meant to do it when elsa was nigh for days and days she had watched for an opportunity but her father had kept her a prisoner in the house besides which she had no great desire to affront the sneering looks of village gossips but this evening was her opportunity for this she had waited and now she meant to take it and no power on earth force or violence would prevent her from pouring out the full phial of her venomous wrath  i will not be silent she shrieked i will not you did round on me like a curyou sneakyou doublefaced devil     will you be silent he hissed through his teeth his face deadly pale now with a passion of wrath at least as fierce as hers  but now elsas quiet voice interposed between these two tempestuous souls  no she said firmly klara shall not be silent andor let go her arm and let her speak i want to hear what she has to say  she is trying to come between you and me elsa said andor who was trying to keep his violent rage in check she tried to come between you and béla and chose an ugly method to get at what she wanted she hates you    why i dont know but she does hate you and she always tries to do you harm dont listen to her i tell you why just look at her now    the girl is half mad  mad broke in klara as with a jerky movement of her shoulders she disengaged herself from andors rough grasp i dare say i am mad and so would you be she added turning suddenly to elsa so would you be if all in one night you were to lose everything you cared for in the worldyour freedomthe consideration of your friendsthe man who some day would have made you a good husbandeverything everythingand all because of that sneaking doublefaced coward  if you dont hold your tongue    cried andor menacingly  you will kill me wont you she sneered one murder more or less on your conscience wont hurt you any more will it my friend you will kill me eh then youll have two of us to your reckoning by and by me and béla  béla the cry which sounded like a protesthot indignant defensivecame from elsa she was paler than either of the others and her glowing inquiring eyes were fixed upon klara with the look of an untamed creature ready to defend and to protect the thing that it holds dear  dont listen to her elsa pleaded andor in a voice rendered hoarse with an overwhelming apprehension  he felt as if his happiness his life the whole of this living breathing world were slipping away from himas if he had suddenly woke up from a beautiful peaceful dream and found himself on the edge of a precipice and unable in this sudden rude awakening to keep a foothold upon the shifting sands there was a mist before his eyesa mist which seemed to envelop elsa more and more making her slim exquisite figure appear more dim blurring the outline of her goldcrowned head getting more and more dense until even her blue eyes had disappeared away from himawaysnatched from his graspwafted away by that mist to the distant land beyond the lowlying horizon  something in the agony of his appeal something in the pathos of elsas defiant attitude must have struck a more gentle cord in the jewess heart the tears gathered in her eyestears of selfpity at the misery which she seemed to be strewing all round her with a free hand  i dont think that i really meant to tell you elsa she said more quietly not lately at any rate oh i dare say at first i did mean to hurt youbut a month has gone by and i was beginning to forget people used to say of me that i was a good sortit was the hurt that he did me that seems to have made a devil of me    and thenjust now when i saw the other folk coming home in the procession and noticed that you and andor werent among them i guessed that you would be walking back together arminarmand that the whole world would be smiling on you both while i was eating out my heart in misery  she was speaking with apparent calm now in a dull and monotonous voice her eyes fixed upon the distant line of the horizon where the glowing sun had at last sunk to rest the brilliant orange and bloodred of the sky had yielded to a colder crimson tintit too was now slowly turning to grey  elsa stood silent listening and andor no longer tried to force klara to silence what was the good fate had spoken through her lipsgods wrath perhaps had willed it so for the first time in all these weeks he realized that perhaps he had committed a deadly sin and that he had had no right to reckon on happiness coming to him because of it he stood there dazed letting the jewess have her way what did it matter how much more she said perhaps on the whole it was best that elsa should learn the whole truth now  and klara continued to speak in listless apathetic tones letting her tongue run on as if she had lost control over what she said and as if a higher fate was forcing her to speak against her will  i suppose she said thoughtfully that some kind of devil did get into my bones then i wandered out into the stubble and i saw you together coming from the distance the sunlight was full upon you and long before you saw me i saw your faces quite distinctly there was so much joy so much happiness in you both that i seemed to see it shining out of your eyes and i was so broken and so wretched that i couldnt bear to see andor so happy with the girl who rightly belonged to bélathe wretched man whom he himself had sent to his death  whom he himself had sent to his death broke in elsa quietly what do you mean klara  i mean that it was young count feri who was to have come to see me that night father being away he wanted to come and have a little chat and a bit of supper with me there was no harm in that was there he didnt care to be seen walking in at the front dooras theres always such a lot of gossip in this villageso he asked me for the backdoor key and i gave it to him  well  leopold missed the key later on and guessed i had given it to count feri he was mad with jealousy and threatened to kill anyone who dared come sneaking in round the back way he wouldnt let me out of his sightand threatened to strangle me if i attempted to go and get the key back from count feri i was nearly crazy with fear wouldnt you have been she added defiantly if you had a madman to deal with and no one near to protect you  perhaps replied elsa under her breath  then andor came into the taproom with soft words and insinuating promises he got me to tell him what had happened i didnt want to at firsti mistrusted him because of what had happened at the banqueti knew that he hated me because of you  it is not true broke in andor involuntarily  let her tell her story her own way rejoined elsa with the same strange quiet which seemed now to envelop her soul  theres nothing more to tell retorted klara nothing at any rate that you havent guessed already i told andor all about count feri and the key and how terrified i was that leopold would do some deadly mischief he offered to go to the castle and get the key away from the young count  well  well andor was in love with you wasnt he she continued speaking once more with vehemence he wanted you didnt he and he hated béla having you he hated me too of course so he got the key away from count feri and later on after you had followed béla almost to the taproom and you had some words with him just outside    you remember  yes  andor had the key in his pocket thenand he gave it to béla     there was silence for awhile nowthat silence which falls upon the plain during the first hour after sunsetand which falls upon human creatures when destiny has spoken her last word in the village far away the worshippers had gone back into the church all sound of chanting and praying had died away behind its walls there was no flight of birds overhead nor call of waterfowl from the bank of the stream the autumn breeze had gone to rest with the sun the leaves of acacias and willows lay still and even the turbulent waters of the maros seemed momentarily hushed  is that true andor  it was elsas voice that spoke but the voice sounded muffled and dull as if it came from far away or from out the depths of the earth then as andor made no reply but gazed on elsa in mute and passionate appeal like a man who is drowning would gaze on the shore which he cannot reach klara said slowly  oh its true enough you cannot deny it can you andor you wanted your revenge on me and you wanted to be rid of bélayou wanted elsa for yourself but you didnt care one brass fillér what would become of me after that you left me without a thought lonely and unprotected knowing that a madman was prowling outside ready to kill me or any man who came along you gave béla that key didnt you    and told him nothing about leopoldand you didnt care what became of me so long as you got rid of béla and could have elsa for yourself  and now you have had your say klara said andor breaking with a mighty effort the spell of silence which had held him all this while you have made all the mischief that you wanted to make suppose you leave us alone now    elsa and me    alone with the misery which you have created for us  then as for a moment she didnt move but looked on him through narrowed lids and with a sneer half of pity and half of triumph he continued with a sudden outburst of fierceness  well you have had your say    why dont you go  klara shrugged her shoulders and said more lightly  oh very well my friend ill go    goodbye elsa she added with sudden earnestness i dont suppose that you want to shake hands with meand i dare say its no use asking you to think kindly of mebut i wish you would try and believe that i am sorry i lost myself as i did i dont think that i ever would have told you if i hadnt seen him looking so happy and so complacent after the horrible dirty trick which he played me people used to say that i had a good heart but by the almighty i declare that i seem to have lost my head lately thats what i say elsa its all very well but what about me what had i doneand now look at my life but dont you fret about him or any other man take my word for it men are not worth it  and having said that she turned on her heel and slowly walked away leaving behind her an ocean of desolation she walked awaywith a slow swinging stride one hand on her hip her head thrown back  for a long time her darklyclad figure was silhouetted against the evening sky a speck of blackness upon the immensity around elsa watched her go watched that tiny black speck which like the locust which at times devastates the plains had left behind it an irreparable trail of misery     chapter xxxii  the land beyond the sunset   and now the shadows of evening were slowly invading the plains the autumn wind lulled for a time to rest with the setting of the sun had sprung up in angry gusts lashing up clouds from the southwest and sending them to tear along and efface the last vestige of the evening crimson glow  elsa and andor had both remained quite still after klara left them yet elsalike all simple creatures who feel acutelywas longing to run and let the far horizon the distant unknown land wrap and enfold her while she thought things out for herself for indeed this real worldthe world of men and women of passions and hatred and lovewas nothing but a huge and cruel puzzle she longed for solitudethe solitude which the plains can offer in such absolute completenessbecause her heart was heavy and she felt that if she were all alone she might ease the weight on her heart in a comforting flow of tears  but this would not have been kind to andor she could not leave him now when he looked so broken down with sorrow and misery and doubt so after a little while when she felt that if she spoke her voice would be quite steady she said gently  it is not all true is it andor  she could notshe would not believe it all truenot in the way that klara had put it before her with all its horrible details of callousness and cowardice for more years than she could remember she had loved and trusted andorshe had known his simple loyal nature his kind and gentle waysa few spiteful words from a jealous woman were not likely to tear down in a moment the solid edifice of her affection and her confidence true his silence had told her something that was a bitter truth his passionate rage against klara had been like a cruel stab right into her heartbut even then she wanted the confirmation which could only come from his own lipsand for this she waited when she asked him quite simply altogether trustingly  it is not true is it  nor did it occur to andor to lie to her about it all the thought of denial never for one moment entered his head the fatalism peculiar to this oriental race made the man scorn to shield himself behind a lie béla was now for ever silent the young count would scorn to speak his own protestations in the ear of this loving simpleminded girl against the accusations of a woman of the despised racejealous bitter avowedly halfcrazyneeded only to be uttered in order to be wholeheartedly believed but even the temptation to pursue such a course never assailed his soul with the limitless sky above him the vast immensity of the plains stretching out unbroken far away with the land under his feet and the scent of the maizestubble in his nostrils he was too proud of himself as a man to stoop to such a lie  so when elsa spoke to him and asked him that one straight and firm question he raised his head and looked straight into her teardimmed eyes  what elsa he asked quietly  that you let béla go to his deathjust like thatas klara said    that is not all true is it  and as she returned his lookfearlessly and trustfullyshe knew that the question which she had thus put to him was really an affirmation of what she felt must be the truth but already andor had raised his voice in hot and passionate protest  he was a brute to you elsa he affirmed with all the strength of his manhood the power of his love which in spite of all would not believe in its own misery he would have made you wretchedly unhappy    he     you did do it then she broke in quietly  i did it because of you elsa he cried and his own firm voice was now halfchoked with sobs he made you unhappy even though you were not yet bound to him by marriage once you were his wife he would have made you miserable    he would have bullied you    beaten you perhaps i heard him out under the verandah speaking to you like the sneering brute that he was    and then he kissed you    and i    but even then i didnt give him the key    klara lied when she said that i didnt urge him to take it eveni did not speak about the key it was lying on the table where i had put ithe took it upi did not give it him  but you let him take it you knew that he meant to visit klara and that leopold was on the watch outside yet you let him go     i let him go    i was nearly mad then with rage at the way he had treated you all day    his taking that key was a last insult put upon you on the eve of your wedding day    the thought of it got into my blood like fire when i saw his cruel leer and heard his sneers    later on i thought better of it    calmer thoughts had got into my brain    reason sober sense    i had gone back to the presbytery and meant to go to bedi went out i swear it by god that i went out prepared to warn him to help him if i could the whole village was deserted it was the hour of supper at the barn i heard the church clock strike the halfhour after ten i worked my way round to the back of goldsteins house and in the yard i saw béla lyingdead  and you might have raised a finger to save him at first    and you didnt do it  not at first    and after that it was too late     you have done a big big wrong andor she said slowly  wrong he cried whilst once more the old spirit of defiance fired himthe burning love in him the wrath at seeing her unhappy wrong because i did not prevent one miserable brute being put out of the way of doing further harm by the living god elsa i do not believe that it was wrong i didnt send him to his death i did not see or speak to leopold hirsch i merely let fate or god himself work his way with him i did not say a word to him that might have induced him to take that key he picked it up from the table and every evil thought came into his head then and there he didnt even care about klara and a silly swaggering flirtation with her he only wanted to insult you to shame you to show you that he was the masterand meant to have his way in all things    and this he did becausebar his pride in your beautyhe really hated you and meant to treat you ill he meant to harm you elsamy own dear dove    my angel from heaven    for whom i would have died and would die today if my death could bring you happiness    i let him go and leopold hirsch killed him    if he had lived he would have made your life one long misery    was it my fault that leopold hirsch killed himkilled him at the moment when he was trying to do you as great harm as he could by god elsa i swear that i dont believe it was my fault    it was the will of godgod would not punish me for not interfering with his will    why it wouldnt be justice elsa    it wouldnt be justice  his voice broke in one agonized sob he had put all his heart all his feelings into that passionate appeal he did not believe that he had done wrong he had not on his soul the sense of the brand of cain rough untutored a son of the soil he saw no harm in sweeping out of the way a noisome creature who spreads evil and misery and elsas was also a simple and untutored soul even though in her calmer temperament the wilder passions of men had found no echo true and steadfast in love her mind was too simple to grasp at sophistry to argue about right or wrong her feelings were her guide and even while andorburning with love and impatienceargued and clung desperately to his own point of view she felt only the desire to comfort and to succourabove all to loveshe was just a girlandors sweetheart and not his judge god alone was that god would punish if he so desiredindeed he had punished already for never had such sorrow descended in andors heart before of that she felt quite sure  he became quite calm after awhile even his passion seemed to have died down under the weight of this immense sorrow  and the peace which comes from the plains when they are wrapped in the darkness of the night descended on the humble peasantgirls soul she saw things as they really were not as mens turbulent desires would have them beabove all not as a womans idealism would picture them  she no longer had the desire to run awayand if the distant unknown land was to wrap and enfold her out of the ken of this real cruel world then it should enfold her and andor together and her love would wrap him and comfort him too  so nowwhen he had finished speaking when his fervent appeal to god and to her had died down on his quivering lipsshe came close up to him and placed her small cool hand upon his arm  andor she said gently and her voice shook and was almost undistinguishable from the sweet soft sounds that filled the limitless plain i am only an ignorant peasantgirlyou and i are only like children of course beside the clever people who can argue about such things but this i do know that there is no sin in the world so great but it can be blotted out and forgiven you may have done a big big wrong andoror perhaps you are not much to blame    i dont know how that is    pater bonifácius will tell you no doubt when next you make your confession to him    but i am too ignorant to understand    the plains have taught me all i know    and    and    i shall always love you andor    and not judge what you have done    god will do that    i can only love you    that is all  her voice died away in the soughing of the wind for a moment or two he stood beside hernot daring to speakor to moveor to take that cool little white hand in his and kiss itfor now she seemed to him more pure than she had ever beenalmost holylike a sainthallowed by the perfect selflessness of her love  and as he stood beside herwith head bent and throat choked with sobs of infinite happinessthe darkness of the night fell wholly upon the plain nothing around but just this darkness filled with all the sounds of hidden pulsating life overhead the clouds chased one another ceaselessly and restlessly and from far away the dull murmur of the water came as a faint and rumbling echo  andor could no longer see elsa now not even her silhouette but her hand was still on his arm and he felt the nearness of her presence and knew that henceforth throughout the years that were to come a happiness such as he had never even dared to dream of would be his and hers too until the day when they would leave the beautiful mysterious plains for that hidden land beyond the glowing horizon beyond the rosy dawn and the crimson sunset  andor slowly fell on his knees and pressed his burning lips on the small white hand just then in the east there was a rent in the clouds a lining of silver appeared behind the darkness the rent became wider and ever wider the silver turned to lemongold and slowly majestically the waning moonhoneycoloured and brilliantemerged triumphantly queening it over the plain  the silvery radiance lit up the vast silent expanse of nothingness the huge dome of the sky the limitless area of stubble and stumps of hemp and dead sunflowers and where the mysteries of the earth merged in those of the skyit touched with its subtle radiance that unknown land on the horizon far away which no child of the plain has ever reached as yet  and from the distant village came softly sounding the tinkle of the church bell tolling for evening prayer  hand in hand andor and elsa wandered back to the villagetogetherhand in hand with memoryhand in hand in neverfading love and understanding and simple trusthand in hand upon the bosom of the illimitable plain
