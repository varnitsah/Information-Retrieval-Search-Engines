89866725	the tale of mrs tiggywinkle  by beatrix potter  author of the tale of peter rabbit c  1905    for  the real little lucie of newlands     once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie who lived at a farm called littletown  she was a good little girlonly she was always losing her pocket handkerchiefs  one day little lucie came into the farmyard crying oh she did cry so  ive lost my pockethandkin  three handkins and a pinny  have you seen them tabby kitten  the kitten went on washing her white paws so lucie asked a speckled hen  sally hennypenny have you found three pockethandkins  but the speckled hen ran into a barn clucking  i go barefoot  barefoot barefoot  and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig  cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye and he flew over a stile and away  lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind littletowna hill that goes upupinto the clouds as though it had no top  and a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass  lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her she ran along a steep pathwayup and upuntil littletown was right away down belowshe could have dropped a pebble down the chimney  presently she came to a spring bubbling out from the hillside  some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the waterbut the water was already running over for the can was no bigger than an eggcup  and where the sand upon the path was wetthere were footmarks of a very small person  lucie ran on and on  the path ended under a big rock  the grass was short and green and there were clothesprops cut from bracken stems with lines of plaited rushes and a heap of tiny clothes  pinsbut no pockethandkerchiefs  but there was something elsea  door  straight into the hill and inside it some one was singing  lilywhite and clean oh with little frills between oh smooth and hotred rusty spot never here be seen oh  lucie knockedonce twice and interrupted the song  a little frightened voice called out whos that  lucie opened the door and what do you think there was inside the hilla nice clean kitchen with a flagged  floor and wooden beamsjust like any other farm kitchen only the ceiling was so low that lucies head nearly touched it and the pots and pans were small and so was everything there  there was a nice hot singey smell and at the table with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring  anxiously at lucie  her print gown was tucked up and she was wearing a large apron  over her striped petticoat  her little black nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle and her eyes went twinkle twinkle and underneath her capwhere lucie had yellow curlsthat little person had prickles  who are you

their jackets takeoff asked lucie  oh yes if you pleasem look at the sheepmark on the shoulder  and heres one marked for gatesgarth and three that come from littletown theyre always marked at washing said mrs tiggywinkle  and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes small brown coats of mice and one velvety black moleskin waist coat and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin and a very much shrunk jacket belonging to peter rabbit and a petticoat not marked that had gone lost in the washing and at last the basket was empty  then mrs tiggywinkle made teaa cup for herself and a cup for lucie they sat before a fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another  mrs tiggywinkles hand holding the teacup was very very brown and very very wrinkly with the soap suds and all through her gown and her cap there were hairpins sticking wrong end out so that lucie didnt like to sit to near her  when they had finished tea they tied up the clothes in bundles and lucies pockethandkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny and fastened with a silver safetypin  and then they made up the fire with turf and came out and locked the door and hid the key under the doorsill  then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs tiggywinkle and the bundles of clothes  all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them the very first that they met was peter rabbit and benjamin bunny  and she gave them their nice clean clothes and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs tiggywinkle  so that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile there was nothing left to carry except lucies one little bundle  lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand and then she turned to say goodnight and to thank the washerwoman but what a very odd thing mrs tiggywinkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill she was running running running up the hilland where was her white frilled cap and her shawl and her gownand her petticoat  and how small she had grownand how brown and covered with prickles why mrs tiggywinkle was nothing but a hedgehog                     now some people say that little lucie had been asleep upon the stile but then how could she have found three clean pockethandkins and a pinny pinned with a silver safety pin and besidesi have seen that door into the back of the hill called cat bellsand besides i am very well acquainted with dear mrs tiggywinkle
