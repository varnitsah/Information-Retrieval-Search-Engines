eightyseven saloon passengers on board the steamship lusitania mingled perhaps with a few expressions of a more violent character after several hours of doubt the final verdict had at last been pronounced they had missed the tide and no attempt was to be made to land passengers that night already the engines had ceased to throb the period of unnatural quietness had commenced slowly and without noticeable motion the great liner swung round a little in the river  a small tug which had been hovering about for some time came screaming alongside there was a hiss from its wavesplashed deck and a rocket with a blue light flashed up into the sky a man who had formed one of the long line of passengers leaning over the rail watching the tug since it had come into sight now turned away and walked briskly to the steps leading to the bridge as it happened the captain himself was in the act of descending the passenger accosted him and held out what seemed to be a letter  captain goodfellow he said i should be glad if you would glance at the contents of that note  the captain who had just finished a long discussion with the pilot and was not in the best of humor looked a little surprised  what now he asked  if you please was the quiet answer the matter is urgent  who are you the captain asked  my name is hamilton fynes the other answered i am a saloon passenger on board your ship although my name does not appear in the list that note has been in my pocket since we left new york to deliver to you in the event of a certain contingency happening  the contingency being the captain asked tearing open the envelope and moving a little nearer the electric light which shone out from the smoking room  that the lusitania did not land her passengers this evening  the captain read the note examined the signature carefully and whistled softly to himself  you know what is inside this he asked looking into his companions face with some curiosity  certainly was the brief reply  your name is mr hamilton fynes the mr hamilton fynes mentioned in this letter  that is so the passenger admitted  the captain nodded  well he said you had better get down on the lower deck port side by the bye have you any friends with you  i am quite alone he answered  so much the better the captain declared dont tell any one that you are going ashore if you can help it  i certainly will not sir the other answered thank you very much  of course you know that you cant take your luggage with you the captain remarked  that is of no consequence at all sir mr hamilton fynes answered i will leave instructions for my trunk to be sent on after me i have all that i require for the moment in this suitcase  the captain blew his whistle mr hamilton fynes made his way quietly to the lower deck which was almost deserted in a very few minutes he was joined by half a dozen sailors dragging a rope ladder the little tug came screaming around and before any of the passengers on the deck above had any idea of what was happening mr hamilton fynes was on board the anna maria and on his way down the river seated in a small uncomfortable cabin lit by a single oil lamp  no one spoke more than a casual word to him from the moment he stepped to the deck until the short journey was at an end he was shown at once into the cabin the door of which he closed without a moments delay a very brief examination of the interior convinced him that he was indeed alone thereupon he seated himself with his back to the wall and his face to the door and finding an english newspaper on the table read it until they reached the docks arrived there he exchanged a civil goodnight with the captain and handed a sovereign to the seaman who held his bag while he disembarked  for several minutes after he had stepped on to the wooden platform mr hamilton fynes showed no particular impatience to continue his journey he stood in the shadow of one of the sheds looking about him with quick furtive glances as though anxious to assure himself that there was no one around who was taking a noticeable interest in his movements having satisfied himself at length upon this point he made his way to the london and north western railway station and knocked at the door of the stationmasters office the stationmaster was busy and although mr hamilton fynes had the appearance of a perfectly respectable transatlantic man of business there was nothing about his personality remarkably strikingnothing at any rate to inspire an unusual amount of respect  you wished to see me sir the official asked merely glancing up from the desk at which he was sitting with a pile of papers before him  mr hamilton fynes leaned over the wooden counter which separated him from the interior of the office before he spoke he glanced around as though to make sure that he had not forgotten to close the door  i require a special train to london as quickly as possible he announced i should be glad if you could let me have one within half an hour at any rate  the stationmaster rose to his feet  quite impossible sir he declared a little brusquely absolutely out of the question  may i ask why it is out of the question mr hamilton fynes inquired  in the first place the stationmaster answered a special train to london would cost you a hundred and eighty pounds and in the second place even if you were willing to pay that sum it would be at least two hours before i could start you off we could not possibly disorganize the whole of our fast traffic the ordinary mail train leaves here at midnight with sleepingcars  mr hamilton fynes held out a letter which he had produced from his breast pocket and which was in appearance very similar to the one which he had presented a short time ago to the captain of the lusitania  perhaps you will kindly read this he said i am perfectly willing to pay the hundred and eighty pounds  the stationmaster tore open the envelope and read the few lines contained therein his manner underwent at once a complete change very much as the manner of the captain of the lusitania had done he took the letter over to his greenshaded writing lamp and examined the signature carefully when he returned he looked at mr hamilton fynes curiously there was however something more than curiosity in his glance there was also respect  i will give this matter my personal attention at once mr fynes he said lifting the flap of the counter and coming out do you care to come inside and wait in my private office  thank you mr hamilton fynes answered i will walk up and down the platform  there is a refreshment room just on the left the stationmaster remarked ringing violently at a telephone i dare say we shall get you off in less than half an hour we will do our best at any rate its an awkward time just now to command an absolutely clear line but if we can once get you past crewe youll be all right shall we fetch you from the refreshment room when we are ready  if you please the intending passenger answered  mr hamilton fynes discovered that place of entertainment without difficulty ordered for himself a cup of coffee and a sandwich and drew a chair close up to the small open fire taking care however to sit almost facing the only entrance to the room he laid his hat upon the counter close to which he had taken up his position and smoothed back with his left hand his somewhat thick black hair he was a man apparently of middle age of middle height cleanshaven with good but undistinguished features dark eyes very clear and very bright which showed indeed but little need of the pincenez which hung by a thin black cord from his neck his hat low in the crown and of soft gray felt would alone have betrayed his nationality his clothes however were also american in cut his boots were narrow and of unmistakable shape he ate his sandwich with suspicion and after his first sip of coffee ordered a whiskey and soda afterwards he sat leaning back in his chair glancing every now and then at the clock but otherwise manifesting no signs of impatience in less than half an hour an inspector cap in hand entered the room and announced that everything was ready mr hamilton fynes put on his hat picked up his suitcase and followed him on to the platform a long saloon carriage with a guards brake behind and an engine in front was waiting there  weve done our best sir the stationmaster remarked with a note of selfcongratulation in his tone its exactly twentytwo minutes since you came into the office and there she is finest engine weve got on the line and the best driver youve a clear road ahead too wish you a pleasant journey sir  you are very good sir mr hamilton fynes declared i am sure that my friends on the other side will appreciate your attention by what time do you suppose that we shall reach london  the stationmaster glanced at the clock  it is now eight oclock sir he announced if my orders down the line are properly attended to you should be there by twenty minutes to twelve  mr hamilton fynes nodded gravely and took his seat in the car he had previously walked its entire length and back again  the train consists only of this carriage he asked there is no other passenger for instance travelling in the guards brake  certainly not sir the stationmaster declared such a thing would be entirely against the regulations there are five of you all told on boarddriver stoker guard saloon attendant and yourself  mr hamilton fynes nodded and appeared satisfied  no more luggage sir the guard asked  i was obliged to leave what i had excepting this suitcase upon the steamer mr hamilton fynes explained i could not very well expect them to get my trunk up from the hold it will follow me to the hotel tomorrow  you will find that the attendant has light refreshments on board sir if you should be wanting anything the stationmaster announced well start you off now then goodnight sir  mr fynes nodded genially  goodnight stationmaster he said many thanks to you    chapter ii the end of the journey  southward with low funnel belching forth fire and smoke into the blackness of the night the huge engine with its solitary saloon carriage and guards brake thundered its way through the night towards the great metropolis across the desolate plain stripped bare of all vegetation and made hideous forever by the growth of a mighty industry where the furnace fires reddened the sky and only the unbroken line of ceaseless lights showed where town dwindled into village and suburbs led back again into town an ugly thickly populated neighborhood whose area of twinkling lights seemed to reach almost to the murky skies hideous indeed by day not altogether devoid now of a certain weird attractiveness by reason of lowhung stars on through many tunnels into the black country itself where the furnace fires burned oftener but the signs of habitation were fewer down the great iron way the huge locomotive rushed onward leaping and bounding across the maze of metals tearing past the dazzling signal lights through crowded stations where its passing was like the roar of some earthshaking monster the stationmaster at crewe unhooked his telephone receiver and rang up liverpool  what about this special he demanded  passenger brought off from the lusitania in a private tug orders are to let her through all the way to london  i know all about that the stationmaster grumbled i have three locals on my hands alreadybeen held up for half an hour old glynn the directors in one of them too might be general manager to hear him swear  is she signalled yet liverpool asked  just gone through at sixty miles an hour was the reply she made our old wooden sheds shake i can tell you whos driving her  jim poynton liverpool answered the guvnor took him off the mail specially  whats the fellows name on board anyhow crewe asked is it a millionaire from the other side trying to make records or a member of our bloated aristocracy  the names fynes or something like it was the reply he didnt look much like a millionaire came into the office carrying a small handbag and asked for a special to london guvnor told him it would take two hours and cost a hundred and eighty pounds told him hed better wait for the mail he produced a note from some one or other and you should have seen the old man bustle round we started him off in twenty minutes  the stationmaster at crewe was interested he knew very well that it is not the easiest thing in the world to bring influence to bear upon a great railway company  seems as though he was some one out of the common anyway he remarked the guvnor didnt let on who the note was from i suppose  not he liverpool answered the first thing he did when he came back into the office was to tear it into small pieces and throw them on the fire young jenkins did ask him a question and he shut him up pretty quick  well i suppose we shall read all about it in the papers tomorrow crewe remarked there isnt much that these reporters dont get hold of he must be some one out of the commonsome one with a pull i meanor the captain of the lusitania would never have let him off before the other passengers when are the rest of them coming through  three specials leave here at nine oclock tomorrow morning was the reply good night  the stationmaster at crewe hung up his receiver and went about his duties twenty miles southward by now the special was still tearing its way into the darkness its solitary passenger had suddenly developed a fit of restlessness he left his seat and walked once or twice up and down the saloon then he opened the rear door crossed the little open space between and looked into the guards brake the guard was sitting upon a stool reading a newspaper he was quite alone and so absorbed that he did not notice the intruder mr hamilton fynes quietly retreated closing the door behind him he made his way once more through the saloon passed the attendant who was fast asleep in his pantry and was met by a locked door he let down the window and looked out he was within a few feet of the engine which was obviously attached direct to the saloon mr hamilton fynes resumed his seat having disturbed nobody he produced some papers from his breast pocket and spread them out on the table before him one a sealed envelope he immediately returned slipping it down into a carefully prepared place between the lining and the material of his coat of the others he commenced to make a close and minute investigation it was a curious fact however that notwithstanding his recent searching examination he looked once more nervously around the saloon before he settled down to his task for some reason or other there was not the slightest doubt that for the present at any rate mr hamilton fynes was exceedingly anxious to keep his own company as he drew nearer to his journeys end indeed his manner seemed to lose something of that composure of which during the earlier part of the evening he had certainly been possessed scarcely a minute passed that he did not lean sideways from his seat and look up and down the saloon he sat like a man who is perpetually on the qui vive a furtive light shone in his eyes he was manifestly uncomfortable yet how could a man be safer from espionage than he  rugby telephoned to liverpool and received very much the same answer as crewe euston followed suit  whos this youre sending up tonight the stationmaster asked specials at willington now come through without a stop is some one trying to make a record round the world  liverpool was a little tired of answering questions and more than a little tired of this mysterious client the stationmaster at euston however was a person to be treated with respect  his name is mr hamilton fynes sir was the reply that is all we know about him they have been ringing us up all down the line ever since the special left  hamilton fynes euston repeated dont know the name where did he come from  off the lusitania sir  but we had a message three hours ago that the lusitania was not landing her passengers until tomorrow morning euston protested  they let our man off in a tug sir was the reply  it went down the river to fetch him the guvnor didnt want to give him a special at this time of night but he just handed him a note and we made things hum up here he was on his way in half an hour we have had to upset the whole of the night traffic to let him through without a stop  such a client was at any rate worth meeting the stationmaster brushed his coat put on his silk hat and stepped out on to the platform    chapter iii an incident and an accident  smoothly the huge engine came gliding into the stationa dumb silent creature now drawing slowly to a standstill as though exhausted after its great effort through the windows of the saloon the stationmaster could see the train attendant bending over this mysterious passenger who did not seem as yet to have made any preparations for leaving his place mr hamilton fynes was seated at a table covered with papers but he was leaning back as though he had been or was still asleep the stationmaster stepped forward and as he did so the attendant came hurrying out to the platform and pushing back the porters called to him by name  mr rice he said if you please sir will you come this way  the stationmaster acceded at once to the mans request and entered the saloon the attendant clutched at his arm nervously he was a pale anaemiclooking little person at any time but his face just now was positively ghastly  what on earth is the matter with you the stationmaster asked brusquely  theres something wrong with my passenger sir the man declared in a shaking voice i cant make him answer me he wont look up and i donti dont think hes asleep an hour ago i took him some whiskey he told me not to disturb him againhe had some papers to go through  the stationmaster leaned over the table the eyes of the man who sat there were perfectly wideopen but there was something unnatural in their fixed staresomething unnatural too in the drawn grayness of his face  this is euston sir the stationmaster beganthe terminus  then he broke off in the middle of his sentence a cold shiver was creeping through his veins he too began to stare he felt the color leaving his own cheeks with an effort he turned to the attendant  pull down the blinds he ordered in a voice which he should never have recognized as his own quick now turn out those porters and tell the inspector to stop anyone from coming into the car  the attendant who was shaking like a leaf obeyed the stationmaster turned away and drew a long breath he himself was conscious of a sense of nausea a giddiness which was almost overmastering this was a terrible thing to face without a seconds warning he had not the slightest doubt but that the man who was seated at the table was dead  at such an hour there were only a few people upon the platform and two stalwart station policemen easily kept back the loiterers whose curiosity had been excited by the arrival of the special a third took up his position with his back to the entrance of the saloon and allowed no one to enter it till the return of the stationmaster who had gone for a doctor the little crowd was completely mystified no one had the slightest idea of what had happened the attendant was besieged by questions but he was sitting on the step of the car in the shadow of a policeman with his head buried in his hands and he did not once look up some of the more adventurous tried to peer through the windows at the lower end of the saloon others rushed off to interview the guard in a very few minutes however the stationmaster reappeared upon the scene accompanied by the doctor the little crowd stood on one side and the two men stepped into the car  the doctor proceeded at once with his examination mr hamilton fynes this mysterious person who had succeeded indeed in making a record journey was leaning back in the corner of his seat his arms folded his head drooping a little but his eyes still fixed in that unseeing stare his body yielded itself unnaturally to the touch for the main truth the doctor needed scarcely a glance at him  is he dead the stationmaster asked  stonedead was the brief answer  good god the stationmaster muttered good god  the doctor had thrown his handkerchief over the dead mans face he was standing now looking at him thoughtfully  did he die in his sleep i wonder the stationmaster asked it must have been horribly sudden was it heart disease  the doctor did not reply for a moment he seemed to be thinking out some problem  the body had better be removed to the station mortuary he said at last then if i were you i should have the saloon shunted on to a siding and left absolutely untouched you had better place two of your station police in charge while you telephone to scotland yard  to scotland yard the stationmaster exclaimed  the doctor nodded he looked around as though to be sure that none of that anxious crowd outside could overhear  theres no question of heart disease here he explained the man has been murdered  the stationmaster was horrifiedhorrified and blankly incredulous  murdered he repeated why its impossible there was no one else on the train except the attendantnot a single other person all my advices said one passenger only  the doctor touched the mans coat with his finger and the stationmaster saw what he had not seen beforesaw what made him turn away a little sick he was a strong man but he was not used to this sort of thing and he had barely recovered yet from the first shock of finding himself face to face with a dead man outside the crowd upon the platform was growing larger white faces were being pressed against the windows at the lower end of the saloon  there is no question about the man having been murdered the doctor said and even his voice shook a little his own hand could never have driven that knife home i can tell you even how it was done the man who stabbed him was in the compartment behind there leaned over and drove this thing down just missing the shoulder there was no struggle or fight of any sort it was a diabolical deed  diabolical indeed the stationmaster echoed hoarsely  you had better give orders for us to be shunted down on to a siding just as we are the doctor continued and send one of your men to telephone to scotland yard perhaps it would be as well too not to touch those papers until some one comes see that the attendant does not go home or the guard they will probably be wanted to answer questions  the stationmaster stepped out to the platform summoned an inspector and gave a few brief orders slowly the saloon was backed out of the station again on to a neglected siding a sort of backwater for spare carriages and empty trucksan ignominious resting place indeed after its splendid journey through the night the doors at both ends were closed and two policemen placed on duty to guard them the doctor and the stationmaster seated themselves out of sight of their gruesome companion and the stationmaster told all that he knew about the despatch of the special and the man who had ordered it the attendant who still moved about like a man in a dream brought them some brandy and soda and served them with shaking hand they all three talked together in whispers the attendant telling them the few incidents of the journey down which except for the dead mans nervous desire for solitude seemed to possess very little significance then at last there was a sharp tap at the window a tall quietly dressed man with reddish skin and clear gray eyes was helped up into the car he saluted the doctor mechanically his eyes were already travelling around the saloon  inspector jacks from scotland yard sir he announced i have another man outside if you dont mind well have him in  by all means the stationmaster answered i am afraid that you will find this rather a serious affair we have left everything untouched so far as we could  the second detective was assisted to clamber up into the car it seemed however as though the whole force of scotland yard could scarcely do much towards elucidating an affair which with every question which was asked and answered grew more mysterious the papers upon the table before the dead man were simply circulars and prospectuses of no possible importance his suitcase contained merely a few toilet necessaries and some clean linen there was not a scrap of paper or even an envelope of any sort in his pockets in a small leather case they found a thousand dollars in american notes five tenpound bank of england notes and a single visiting card on which was engraved the name of mr hamilton fynes in his trousers pocket was a handful of gold he had no other personal belongings of any sort the space between the lining of his coat and the material itself was duly noticed but it was empty his watch was a cheap one his linen unmarked and his clothes bore only the name of a great new york retail establishment he had certainly entered the train alone and both the guard and attendant were ready to declare positively that no person could have been concealed in it the enginedriver on his part was equally ready to swear that not once from the moment when they had steamed out of liverpool station until they had arrived within twenty miles of london had they travelled at less than forty miles an hour at willington he had found a signal against him which had brought him nearly to a standstill and under the regulations he had passed through the station at ten miles an hour these were the only occasions however on which he had slackened speed at all the train attendant who was a nervous man began to shiver again and imagine unmentionable things the guard who had never left his own brake went home and dreamed that his effigy had been added to the collection of madame tussaud the reporters were the only people who were really happy with the exception perhaps of inspector jacks who had a weakness for a difficult case  fifteen miles north of london a man lay by the roadside in the shadow of a plantation of pine trees through which he had staggered only a few minutes ago his clothes were covered with dust he had lost his cap and his trousers were cut about the knee as though from a fall he was of somewhat less than medium height dark slender with delicate features and hair almost coal black his face as he moved slowly from side to side upon the grass was livid with pain every now and then he raised himself and listened the long belt of main road which passed within a few feet of him seemed almost deserted once a cart came lumbering by and the man who lay there watching drew closely back into the shadows a youth on a bicycle passed singing to himself a boy and girl strolled by arm in arm happy apparently in their profound silence only a couple of fields away shone the red and green lights of the railway track every few minutes the goodstrains went rumbling over the metals the man on the ground heard them with a shiver resolutely he kept his face turned in the opposite direction the night mail went thundering northward and he clutched even at the nettles which grew amongst the grass where he was crouching as though filled with a sudden terror then there was silence once moresilence which became deeper as the hour approached midnight passersby were fewer the birds and animals came out from their hiding places a rabbit scurried across the road a rat darted down the tiny stream now and then birds moved in the undergrowth and the man who was struggling all the time with a deadly faintness felt the silence grow more and more oppressive he began even to wonder where he was he closed his eyes was that really the tinkling of a guitar the perfume of almond and cherry blossom floating to him down the warm wind he began to lose himself in dreams until he realized that actual unconsciousness was close upon him then he set his teeth tight and clenched his hands away in the distance a faint longexpected sound came travelling to his ears at last then his long wait was over two fiery eyes were stealing along the lonely road the throb of an engine was plainly audible he staggered up swaying a little on his feet and holding out his hands the motor car came to a standstill before him and the man who was driving it sprang to the ground words passed between them rapidlyquestions and answersthe questions of an affectionate servant and the answers of a man fighting a grim battle for consciousness but these two spoke in a language of their own a language which no one who passed along that road was likely to understand  with a groan of relief the man who had been picked up sank back amongst the cushioned seats carefully almost tenderly aided by the chauffeur eagerly he thrust his hand into one of the leather pockets and drew out a flask of brandy the rush of cold air as the car swung round and started off was like new life to him he closed his eyes when he opened them again they had come to a standstill underneath a red lamp  the doctors he muttered to himself and staggering out rang the bell  dr spencer whiles had had a somewhat dreary day and was thoroughly enjoying a late rubber of bridge with three of his most agreeable neighbors a summons into the consulting room however was so unexpected a thing that he did not hesitate for a moment to obey it without even waiting to complete a deal when he entered the apartment he saw a slim but determinedlooking young man whose clothes were covered with dust and who although he sat with folded arms and grim face was very nearly in a state of collapse  you seem to have met with an accident the doctor remarked how did it happen  i have been run over by a motor car his patient said speaking slowly and with something singularly agreeable in his voice notwithstanding its slight accent of pain can you patch me up till i get to london  the doctor looked him over  what were you doing in the road he asked  i was riding a bicycle the other answered i dare say it was my own fault i was certainly on the wrong side of the road you can see what has happened to me i am bruised and cut my side is painful and also my knee a car is waiting outside now to take me to my home but i thought that i had better stop and see you  the doctor was a humane man with a miserable practice and he forgot all about his bridge party for half an hour he worked over his patient at the end of that time he gave him a brandy and soda and placed a box of cigarettes before him  youll do all right now he said thats a nasty cut on your leg but youve no broken bones  i feel absolutely well again thank you very much the young man said i will smoke a cigarette if i may the brandy i thank you no  just as you like the doctor answered i wont say that you are not better without it help yourself to the cigarettes are you going back to london in the motor car then  yes the patient answered it is waiting outside for me now and i must not keep the man any longer will you let me know if you please how much i owe you  the doctor hesitated fees were a rare thing with him and the evidences of his patients means were somewhat doubtful the young man put his hand into his pocket  i am afraid he said that i am not a very presentablelooking object but i am glad to assure you that i am not a poor man i am able to pay your charges and to still feel that the obligation is very much on my side  the doctor summoned up his courage  we will say a guinea then he remarked with studied indifference  you must allow me to make it a little more than that the patient answered your treatment was worth it i feel perfectly recovered already good night sir  the doctors eyes sparkled as he glanced at the gold which his visitor had laid upon the table  you are very good im sure he murmured i hope you will have a comfortable journey with a nerve like yours youll be all right in a day or so  he let his patient out and watched him depart with some curiosity watched until the great motorcar had swung round the corner of the street and started on its journey to london  no bicycle there he remarked to himself as he closed the door i wonder what they did with it    chapter iv miss penelope morse  it was already a little past the customary luncheon hour at the carlton and the restaurant was well filled the orchestra had played their first selection and the stream of incoming guests had begun to slacken a young lady who had been sitting in the palm court for at least half an hour rose to her feet and glancing casually at her watch made her way into the hotel she entered the office and addressed the chief reception clerk  can you tell me she asked if mr hamilton fynes is staying here he should have arrived by the lusitania last night or early this morning  it is not the business of a hotel reception clerk to appear surprised at anything nevertheless the man looked at her for a moment with a curious expression in his eyes  mr hamilton fynes he repeated did you say that you were expecting him by the lusitania madam  yes the young lady answered he asked me to lunch with him here today can you tell me whether he has arrived yet if he is in his room i should be glad if you would send up to him  there were several people in the office who were in a position to overhear their conversation with a word of apology the man came round from his place behind the mahogany counter he stood by the side of the young lady and he seemed to be suffering from some embarrassment  will you pardon my asking madam if you have seen the newspapers this morning he inquired  without a doubt her first thought was that the question savored of impertinence she looked at him with slightly upraised eyebrows she was slim of medium complexion with dark brown hair parted in the middle and waving a little about her temples she was irreproachably dressed from the tips of her patent shoes to the black feathers in her paris hat  the newspapers she repeated why no i dont think that i have seen them this morning what have they to do with mr hamilton fynes  the clerk pointed to the open door of a small private office  if you will step this way for one moment madam he begged  she tapped the floor with her foot and looked at him curiously certainly the people around seemed to be taking some interest in their conversation  why should i she asked cannot you answer my question here  if madam will be so good he persisted  she shrugged her shoulders and followed him something in the mans earnest tone and almost pleading look convinced her at least of his good intentions besides the interest which her question had undoubtedly aroused amongst the bystanders was to say the least of it embarrassing he pulled the door to after them  madam he said there was a mr hamilton fynes who came over by the lusitania and who had certainly engaged rooms in this hotel but he unfortunately it seems met with an accident on his way from liverpool  her manner changed at once she began to understand what it all meant her lips parted her eyes were wide open  an accident she faltered  he gently rolled a chair up to her she sank obediently into it  madam he said it was a very bad accident indeed i trust that mr hamilton fynes was not a very intimate friend or a relative of yours it would perhaps be better for you to read the account for yourself  he placed a newspaper in her hands she read the first few lines and suddenly turned upon him she was white to the lips now and there was real terror in her tone yet if he had been in a position to have analyzed the emotion she displayed he might have remarked that there was none of the surprise the blank unbelieving amazement which might have been expected from one hearing for the first time of such a calamity  murdered she exclaimed is this true  it appears to be perfectly true madam i regret to say the clerk answered even the earlier editions were able to supply the mans name and i am afraid that there is no doubt about his identity the captain of the lusitania confirmed it and many of the passengers who saw him leave the ship last night have been interviewed  murdered she repeated to herself with trembling lips it seems such a horrible death have they any idea who did it she asked has any one been arrested  at present no madam the clerk answered the affair as you will see if you read further is an exceedingly mysterious one  she rocked a little in her chair but she showed no signs of fainting she picked up the paper and found the place once more there were two columns filled with particulars of the tragedy  where can i be alone and read this she asked  here if you please madam the clerk answered i must go back to my desk there are many arrivals just now will you allow me to send you somethinga little brandy perhaps  nothing thank you she answered i wish only to be alone while i read this  he left her with a little sympathetic murmur and closed the door behind him the girl raised her veil now and spread the newspaper out on the table before her there was an account of the tragedy there were interviews with some of the passengers a message from the captain in all it seemed that wonderfully little was known of mr hamilton fynes he had spoken to scarcely a soul on board and had remained for the greater part of the time in his stateroom the captain had not even been aware of his existence till the moment when mr hamilton fynes had sought him out and handed him an order signed by the head of his company instructing him to obey in any respect the wishes of this hitherto unknown passenger the tug which had been hired to meet him had gone down the river so it was not possible for the moment to say by whom it had been chartered the stationmaster at liverpool knew nothing except that the letter presented to him by the dead man was a personal one from a great railway magnate whose wishes it was impossible to disregard there had not been a soul apparently upon the steamer who had known anything worth mentioning of mr hamilton fynes or his business no one in london had made inquiries for him or claimed his few effects half a dozen cables to america remained unanswered  that papers had been stolen from himpapers or moneywas evident from the place of concealment in his coat where the lining had been torn away but there was not the slightest evidence as to the nature of these documents or the history of the murdered man all that could be done was to await the news from the other side which was momentarily expected  the girl went through it all line by line almost word by word whatever there might have been of relationship or friendship between her and the dead man the news of his terrible end left her shaken indeed but dryeyed she was apparently more terrified than grieved and now that the first shock had passed away her mind seemed occupied with thoughts which may indeed have had some connection with this tragedy but were scarcely wholly concerned with it she sat for a long while with her hands still resting upon the table but her eyes fixed out of the window then at last she rose and made her way outside her friend the reception clerk was engaged in conversation with one or two men a conversation of which she was obviously the subject as she opened the door one of them broke off in the midst of what he was saying and would have accosted her the clerk however interposed and drew her a step or two back into the room  madam he said one of these gentlemen is from scotland yard and the others are reporters they are all eager to know anything about mr hamilton fynes i expect they will want to ask you some questions  the girl opened her lips and closed them again  i regret to say that i have nothing whatever to tell them she declared will you kindly let them know that  the clerk shook his head  i am afraid you will find them quite persistent madam he said  i cannot tell them things which i do not know myself she answered frowning  naturally the clerk admitted yet these gentlemen from scotland yard have special privileges of course and there remains the fact that you were engaged to lunch with mr fynes here  if it will help me to get rid of them she said i will speak to the representative of scotland yard i will have nothing whatever to say to the reporters  the clerk turned round and beckoned to the foremost figure in the little group inspector jacks tall lanternjawed dressed with the quiet precision of a welltodoman of affairs and with no possible suggestion of his calling in his manner or attire was by her side almost at once  madam he said i understand that mr hamilton fynes was a friend of yours  an acquaintance she corrected him  and your name he asked  i am miss morse she repliedmiss penelope morse  you were to have lunched here with mr hamilton fynes the detective continued when may i ask did the invitation reach you  yesterday she told him by marconigram from queenstown  you can tell us a few things about the deceased without doubt mr jacks saidhis profession for instance or his social standing perhaps you know the reason for his coming to europe  the girl shook her head  mr fynes and i were not intimately acquainted she answered we met in paris some years ago and when he was last in london during the autumn i lunched with him twice  you had no letter from him then previous to the marconigram the inspector asked  i have scarcely ever received a letter from him in my life she answered he was as bad a correspondent as i am myself  you know nothing then of the object of his present visit to england  nothing whatever she answered  when he was over here before the inspector asked do you know what his business was then  not in the least she replied  you can tell us his address in the states inspector jacks suggested  she shook her head  i cannot she answered as i told you just now i have never had a letter from him in my life we exchanged a few notes perhaps when we were in paris about trivial matters but nothing more than that  he must at some time in paris for instance or when you lunched with him last year have said something about his profession or how he spent his time  he never alluded to it in any way the girl answered i have not the slightest idea how he passed his time  the inspector was a little nonplussed he did not for a moment believe that the girl was telling the truth  perhaps he said tentatively you do not care to have your name come before the public in connection with a case so notorious as this  naturally the girl answered that however would not prevent my telling you anything that i knew you seem to find it hard to believe but i can assure you that i know nothing mr fynes was almost a stranger to me  the detective was thoughtful  so you really cannot help us at all madam he said at length  i am afraid not she answered  perhaps he suggested after you have thought the matter over something may occur to you can i trouble you for your address  i am staying at devenham house for the moment she answered  he wrote it down in his notebook  i shall perhaps do myself the honor of waiting upon you a little later on he said you may be able after reflection to recall some small details at any rate which will be interesting to us at present we are absurdly ignorant as to the mans affairs  she turned away from him to the clerk and pointed to another door  can i go out without seeing those others she asked i really have nothing to say to them and this has been quite a shock to me  by all means madam the clerk answered if you will allow me i will escort you to the entrance  two of the more enterprising of the journalists caught them up upon the pavement miss penelope morse however had little to say to them  you must not ask me any more questions about mr hamilton fynes she declared my acquaintance with him was of the slightest it is true that i came here to lunch today without knowing what had happened it has been a shock to me and i do not wish to talk about it and i will not talk about it for the present  she was deaf to their further questions the hotel clerk handed her into a taximeter cab and gave the address to the driver then he went back to his office where inspector jacks was still sitting  this mr hamilton fynes he remarked seems to have been what you might call a secretive sort of person nobody appears to know anything about him i remember when he was staying here before that he had no callers and seemed to spend most of his time sitting in the palm court  the inspector nodded  he was certainly a man who knew how to keep his own counsel he admitted most americans are ready enough to talk about themselves and their affairs even to comparative strangers  the hotel clerk nodded  makes it difficult for you he remarked  it makes the case very interesting the inspector declared especially when we find him engaged to lunch with a young lady of such remarkable discretion as miss penelope morse  you know her the clerk asked a little eagerly  the inspector was engaged apparently in studying the pattern of the carpet  not exactly he answered no i have no absolute knowledge of miss penelope morse by the bye that was rather an interesting address that she gave  devenham house the hotel clerk remarked do you know who lives there  the inspector nodded  the duke of devenham he answered a very interesting young lady i should think that i wonder what she and mr hamilton fynes would have talked about if they had lunched here today  the hotel clerk looked dubious he did not grasp the significance of the question    chapter v an affair of state  miss penelope morse was perfectly well aware that the taxicab in which she left the carlton hotel was closely followed by two others through the tube which she found by her side she altered her first instructions to the driver and told him to proceed as fast as possible to harrods stores then raising the flap at the rear of the cab she watched the progress of the chase along pall mall the taxi in which she was seated gained considerably but in the park and along the bird cage walk both the other taxies risking the police regulations drew almost alongside once past hyde park corner however her cab again drew ahead and when she was deposited in front of harrods stores her pursuers were out of sight she paid the driver quickly a little over double his fare  if any one asks you questions she said say that you had instructions to wait here for me go on to the rank for a quarter of an hour then you can drive away  you wont be coming back then miss the man asked  i shall not she answered but i want those men who are following me to think that i am they may as well lose a little time for their rudeness  the chauffeur touched his hat and obeyed his instructions miss penelope morse plunged into the mazes of the stores with the air of one to whom the place is familiar she did not pause however at any of the counters in something less than two minutes she had left it again by a back entrance stepped into another taxicab which was just setting down a passenger and was well on her way back towards pall mall her ruse appeared to have been perfectly successful at any rate she saw nothing more of the occupants of the two taxicabs  she stopped in front of one of the big clubs and scribbling a line on her card gave it to the door keeper  will you find out if this gentleman is in she said if he is will you kindly ask him to step out and speak to me  she returned to the cab and waited in less than five minutes a tall broadshouldered young man cleanshaven and moving like an athlete came briskly down the steps he carried a soft hat in his hand and directly he spoke his transatlantic origin was apparent  penelope he exclaimed why what on earth  my dear dicky she interrupted laughing at his expression you need not look so displeased with me of course i know that i ought not to have come and sent a message into your club i will admit at once that it was very forward of me perhaps when i have told you why i did so you wont look so shocked  im glad to see you anyway he declared theres no bad news i hope  nothing that concerns us particularly she answered i simply want to have a little talk with you come in here with me please at once we can ride for a short distance anywhere  but i am just in the middle of a rubber of bridge he objected  it cant be helped she declared to tell you the truth the matter i want to talk to you about is of more importance than any game of cards dont be foolish dicky you have your hat in your hand step in here by my side at once  he looked a little bewildered but he obeyed her as most people did when she was in earnest she gave the driver an address somewhere in the city as soon as they were off she turned towards him  dicky she said do you read the newspapers  well i cant say that i do regularly he answered i read the new york herald but these london journals are a bit difficult arent they one has to dig the news outsort of treasurehunt all the time  you have read this murder case at any rate she asked about the man who was killed in a special train between liverpool and london  of course he answered with a sudden awakening of interest what about it  a good deal she answered slowly in the first place the man who was murderedmr hamilton fynescomes from the village where i was brought up in massachusetts and i know more about him i dare say than any one else in this country what i know isnt very much perhaps but its interesting i was to have lunched with him at the carlton today in fact i went there expecting to do so for i am like youi scarcely ever look inside these english newspapers well i went to the carlton and waited and he did not come at last i went into the office and asked whether he had arrived directly i mentioned his name it was as though i had thrown a bomb shell into the place the clerk called me on one side took me into a private office and showed me a newspaper as soon as i had read the account i was interviewed by an inspector from scotland yard ever since then i have been followed about by reporters  the young man whistled softly  say penelope he exclaimed who was this fellow anyhow and what were you doing lunching with him  that doesnt matter she answered you dont tell me all your secrets mr dicky vanderpole and it isnt necessary for me to tell you all mine even if we are both foreigners in a strange country the poor fellow isnt going to lunch with any one else in this world i suppose you are thinking what an indiscreet person i am as usual  the young man considered the matter for a moment  no he said i didnt understand that he was the sort of person you would have been likely to have taken lunch with but that isnt my affair have you seen the second edition  the girl shook her head  havent i told you that i never read the papers i only saw what they showed me in at the carlton  the press association have cabled to america but no one seems to be able to make out exactly who the fellow is his letter to the captain of the steamer was from the chairman of the company and his introduction to the manager of the london and north western railway company was from the greatest railway man in the world mr hamilton fynes must have been a person who had a pretty considerable pull over there curiously enough though only the name of the man was mentioned in them nothing about his business or what he was doing over on this side he was simply alluded to as mr hamilton fynesthe gentleman bearing this communication i expect after all that you know more about him than any one  she shook her head  what i know she said or at least most of it i am going to tell you a few years ago he was a clerk in a government office in washington he was steady in those days and was supposed to have a head he used to write me occasionally one day he turned up in london quite unexpectedly he said that he had come on business and whatever his business was it took him to st petersburg and berlin and then back to berlin again i saw quite a good deal of him that trip  the dickens you did he muttered  miss penelope morse laughed softly  come dicky she said dont pretend to be jealous youre an outrageous flirt i know but you and i are never likely to get sentimental about one another  why not he grumbled weve always been pretty good pals havent we  naturally she answered or i shouldnt be here do you want to hear anything more about mr hamilton fynes  of course i do he declared  well be quiet then and dont interrupt she said i knew london well and he didnt that is why as i told you before we saw quite a great deal of one another he was always very reticent about his affairs and especially about the business which had taken him on the continent just before he left however he gave mewell a hint  what was it the young man asked eagerly  she hesitated  he didnt put it into so many words she said and i am not sure even now that i ought to tell you dicky still you are a fellow countryman and a budding diplomatist i suppose if i can give you a lift i ought to  the taxi was on the embankment now and they sped along for some time in silence mr richard vanderpole was more than a little puzzled  of course penelope he said i dont expect you to tell me anything which you feel that you oughtnt to there is one thing however which i must ask you  she nodded  well  i should like to know what the mischief my being in the diplomatic service has to do with it  if i explained that she answered i should be telling you everything i havent quite made up my mind to do that yet  tell me this he asked would that hint which he dropped when he was here last help you to solve the mystery of his murder  it might she admitted  then i think he said apart from any other reason you ought to tell somebody the police at present dont seem to have the ghost of a clue  they are not likely to find one she answered unless i help them  say penelope he exclaimed you are not in earnest  i am she assured him it is exactly as i say i believe i am one of the few people who could put the police upon the right track  is there any reason why you shouldnt he asked  thats just what i cant make up my mind about she told him however i have brought you out with me expecting to hear something and i am going to tell you this that last time he came to englandthe time he went to st petersburg and twice to berlinhe came on government business  the young man looked for a moment incredulous  are you sure of that pen he asked it doesnt sound like our people you know does it  i am quite sure she declared confidently you are a very youthful diplomat dicky but even you have probably heard of governments who employ private messengers to carry despatches which for various reasons they dont care to put through their embassies  why thats so of course over on this side he agreed these european nations are up to all manner of tricks but i tell you frankly pen i never heard of anything of the sort being done from washington  perhaps not she answered composedly you see things have developed with us during the last twentyfive years the old america had only one foreign policy and that was to hold inviolate the monroe doctrine european or asiatic complications scarcely even interested her those times have passed dicky cuba and the philippines were the start of other things we are being drawn into the maelstrom in another ten years we shall be there whether we want to be or not  the young man was deeply interested  well he admitted theres a good deal in what you say penelope you talk about it all as though you were a diplomat yourself  perhaps i am she answered calmly a stray young woman like myself must have something to occupy her thoughts you know  he laughed  thats not bad he asserted for a girl whom the new york herald declared a few weeks ago to be one of the most brilliant young women in english society  she shrugged her shoulders scornfully  thats just the sort of thing the new york herald would say she remarked you see i have to get a reputation for being smart and saying bright things or nobody would ask me anywhere penniless american young women are not too popular over here  marry me then he suggested amiably i shall have plenty of money some day  ill see about it when youre grown up she answered just at present i think wed better return to the subject of hamilton fynes  mr richard vanderpole sighed but seemed not disinclined to follow her suggestion  harvey is a silent man as you know he said thoughtfully and he keeps everything of importance to himself at the same time these little matters get about in the shop of course and i have never heard of any despatches being brought across from washington except in the usual way presuming that you are right he added after a moments pause and that this fellow hamilton fynes really had something for us that would account for his being able to get off the boat and securing his special train so easily no one can imagine where he got the pull  it accounts also penelope remarked for his murder  her companion started  you havent any idea he began  nothing so definite as an idea she interrupted i am not going so far as to say that i simply know that when a man is practically the secret agent of his government and is probably carrying despatches of an important nature that an accident such as he has met with in a country which is greatly interested in the contents of those despatches is a somewhat serious thing  the young man nodded  say he admitted youre dead right the pacific cruise and our relations with japan seem to have rubbed our friends over here altogether the wrong way we have irritations enough already to smooth over without anything of this sort on the carpet  i am going to tell you now she continued leaning a little towards him the real reason why i fetched you out of the club this afternoon and have brought you for this little expedition the last time i lunched with mr hamilton fynes was just after his return from berlin he intrusted me then with a very important mission he gave me a letter to deliver to mr blaine harvey  but i dont understand he protested why should he give you the letter when he was in london himself  i asked him that question myself naturally she answered he told me that it was an understood thing that when he was over here on business he was not even to cross the threshold of the embassy or hold any direct communication with any person connected with it everything had to be done through a third party and generally in duplicate there was another man for instance who had a copy of the same letter but i never came across him or even knew his name  gee whiz the young man exclaimed youre telling me things and no mistake why this fellow fynes made a secret service messenger of you  penelope nodded  it was all very simple she said the first mrs harvey who was alive then was my greatest friend and i was in and out of the place all the time now perhaps you can understand the significance of that marconigram from hamilton fynes asking me to lunch with him at the carlton today  mr richard vanderpole was sitting bolt upright gazing steadily ahead  i wonder he said slowly what has become of the letter which he was going to give you  one thing is certain she declared it is in the hands of those whose interests would have been affected by its delivery  how much of this am i to tell the chief the young man asked  every word penelope answered you see i am trying to give you a start in your career what bothers me is an entirely different question  what is it he asked  she laid her hand upon his arm  how much of it i shall tell to a certain gentleman who calls himself inspector jacks    chapter vi mr coulson interviewed  the lusitania boat specials ran into euston station soon after three oclock in the afternoon a small company of reporters and several other men whose profession was not disclosed from their appearance were on the spot to interview certain of the passengers a young fellow from the office of the evening comet was perhaps the most successful as from the lengthy description which had been telegraphed to him from liverpool he was fortunate enough to accost the only person who had been seen speaking to the murdered man upon the voyage  this is mr coulson i believe the young man said with conviction addressing a somewhat stout grayheaded american with white moustache a homburg hat and clothes of distinctly transatlantic cut  that gentlemen regarded his interlocutor with some surprise but without unfriendliness  that happens to be my name sir he replied you have the advantage of me though you are not from my old friends spencer  miles are you  spencer  miles the young man repeated thoughtfully  woollen firm in london wall mr coulson added i know they wanted to see me directly i arrived and they did say something about sending to the station  the young man shook his head and assumed at the same time his most engaging manner  why no sir he admitted i have no connection with that firm at all the fact is i am on the staff of an evening paper a friend of mine in liverpoola mutual friend i believe i may say he explainedwired me your description i understand that you were acquainted with mr hamilton fynes  mr coulson set down his suitcase for a moment to light a cigar  well if i did know the poor fellow just to nod to he said i dont see thats any reason why i should talk about him to you newspaper fellows youd better get hold of his relations if you can find them  but my dear mr coulson the young man said we havent any idea where they are to be found and in the meantime you cant imagine what reports are in circulation  guess i can figure them out pretty well mr coulson remarked with a smile weve got an evening press of our own in new york  the reporter nodded  well he said theyd be able to stretch themselves out a bit on a case like this you see he continued confidentially we are up against something almost unique here is an astounding and absolutely inexplicable murder committed in a most dastardly fashion by a person who appears to have vanished from the face of the earth not a single thing is known about the victim except his name we do not know whether he came to england on business or pleasure he may in short have been any one from a millionaire to a newspaper man judging from his special train the reporter concluded with a smile and the money which was found upon him i imagine that he was certainly not the latter  mr coulson went on his way toward the exit from the station puffing contentedly at his big cigar  well he said to his companion who showed not the slightest disposition to leave his side it dont seem to me that theres much worth repeating about poor fynesmuch that i knew at any rate still if you like to get in a cab with me and ride as far as the savoy ill tell you what i can  you are a brick sir the young man declared havent you any luggage though  i checked what i had through from liverpool to the hotel mr coulson answered i cant stand being fussed around by all these porters and having to go and take pot luck amongst a pile of other peoples baggage well just take one of these twowheeled sardine tins that you people call hansoms and get round to the hotel as quick as we can there are a few pals of mine generally lunch in the cafe there and they maynt all have cleared out if we look alive  they started a moment or two later mr coulson leaned forward and folding his arms upon the apron of the cab looked about him with interest  say he remarked removing his cigar to the corner of his mouth in order to facilitate conversation this old city of yours dont change any  not up in this part perhaps the reporter agreed weve some fine new buildings down toward the strand  mr coulson nodded  well he said i guess you dont want to be making conversation you want to know about hamilton fynes i was just acquainted with him and thats a fact but i reckon youll have to find some one who knows a good deal more than i do before youll get the stuff you want for your paper  the slightest particulars are of interest to us just now the reporter reminded him  mr coulson nodded  hamilton fynes he said so far as i knew him was a quiet inoffensive sort of creature who has been drawing a regular salary from the state for the last fifteen years and saving half of it he has been coming over to europe now and then and though he was a good steady chap enough he liked his fling when he was over here and between you and me he was the greatest crank i ever struck i met him in london a matter of three years ago and he wanted to go to paris there were two cars running at the regular time meeting the boat at dover do you think he would have anything to do with them not he he hired a special train and went down like a prince  what did he do that for the reporter asked  why because he was a crank sir mr coulson answered confidentially there was no other reason at all take this last voyage on the lusitania now he spoke to me the first day out because he couldnt help it but for pretty well the rest of the journey he either kept down in his stateroom or when he came up on deck he avoided me and everybody else when he did talk his talk was foolish he was a good chap at his work i believe but he was a crank seemed to me sometimes as though that humdrum life of his had about turned his brain the last day out he was fidgeting all the time kept looking at his watch studying the chart and asking the sailors questions said he wanted to get up in time to take a girl to lunch on thursday it was just for that reason that he scuttled off the boat without a word to any of us and rushed up to london  but he had letters mr coulson the reporter reminded him from some one in washington to the captain of the steamer and to the stationmaster of the london and north western railway it seems rather odd that he should have provided himself with these doesnt it  they were easy enough to get mr coulson answered he wasnt a worrying sort of chap fynes wasnt he did his work year in and year out and asked no favors the consequence was that when he asked a queer one he got it all right its easier to get a pull over there than it is here you know  this is all very interesting the reporter said and i am sure im very much obliged to you mr coulson now can you tell me of anything in the mans life or way of living likely to provoke enmity on the part of any one this murder was such a coldblooded affair  there im stuck mr coulson admitted theres only one thing i can tell you and that is that i believe he had a lot more money on him than the amount mentioned in your newspapers this morning my own opinion is that he was murdered for what hed got a smart thief would say that a fellow who takes a special tug off the steamer and a special train to town was a man worth robbing how the thing was done i dont knowthats for your police to find outbut i reckon that whoever killed him did it for his cash  the reporter sighed he was after all a little disappointed mr coulson was obviously a man of common sense his words were clearly pronounced and his reasoning sound they had reached the courtyard of the hotel now and the reporter began to express his gratitude  my first drink on english soil mr coulson said as he handed his suitcase to the hallporter is always  its on me the young man declared quickly i owe you a good deal more than drinks mr coulson  well come along anyway the latter remarked i guess my room is all right porterturning to the man who stood by his side bag in hand i am mr james b coulson of new york and i wrote on ahead ill come round to the office and register presently  they made their way to the american bar the newspaper man and his new friend drank together and skillfully prompted by the former the conversation drifted back to the subject of hamilton fynes there was nothing else to be learned however in the way of facts mr coulson admitted that he had been a little nettled by his friends odd manner during the voyage and the strange way he had of keeping to himself  but after all he wound up fynes was a crank when alls said and done we are all cranks more or lessall got our weak spot i mean it was secretiveness with our unfortunate friend he liked to play at being a big personage in a mysterious sort of way and the poor chaps paid for it he added with a sigh  the reporter left his newmade friend a short time afterwards and took a hansom to his office his newspaper at once issued a special edition giving an interview between their representative and mr james b coulson a personal friend of the murdered man it was after all something of a scoop for not one of the other passengers had been found who was in a position to say anything at all about him the immediate effect of the interview however was to procure for mr coulson a somewhat bewildering succession of callers the first to arrive was a gentleman who introduced himself as mr jacks and whose card sent back at first was retendered in a sealed envelope with scotland yard scrawled across the back of it mr coulson who was in the act of changing his clothes interviewed mr jacks in his chamber  mr coulson the inspector said i am visiting you on behalf of scotland yard we understand that you had some acquaintance with mr hamilton fynes and we hope that you will answer a few questions for us  mr coulson sat down upon a trunk with his hairbrushes in his hand  well he declared you detectives do get to know things dont you  nothing so remarkable in that mr coulson inspector jacks remarked pleasantly a newspaper man had been before me i see  mr coulson nodded  thats so he admitted seems to me i may have been a bit indiscreet in talking so much to that young reporter i have just read his account of my interview and hes got it pat word by word now mr jacks if youll just invest a halfpenny in that newspaper you dont need to ask me any questions that young man had a kind of pleasant way with him and i told him all i knew  just so mr coulson the inspector answered at the same time nothing that you told him throws any light at all upon the circumstances which led to the poor fellows death  that mr coulson declared is not my fault what i dont know i cant tell you  you were acquainted with mr fynes some years ago the inspector asked can you tell me what business he was in then  same as now for anything i know mr coulson answered he was a clerk in one of the government offices at washington  government offices inspector jacks repeated have you any idea what department  mr coulson was not sure  it may have been the excise office he remarked thoughtfully i did hear but i never took any particular notice  did you ever form any idea as to the nature of his work inspector jacks asked  bless you no mr coulson replied brushing his hair vigorously it never entered into my head to ask him and i never heard him mention it i only know that he was a quietliving decent sort of a chap but as i put it to our young friend the newspaper man he was a crank  the inspector was disappointed he began to feel that he was wasting his time  did you know anything of the object of his journey to europe he asked  nary a thing mr coulson declared he only came on deck once or twice and he had scarcely a civil word even for me why i tell you sir mr coulson continued if he saw me coming along on the promenade hed turn round and go the other way for fear id ask him to come and have a drink a crank sir you write it down at that and you wont be far out  he certainly seems to have been a queer lot the inspector declared by the bye he continued you said something i believe about his having had more money with him than was found upon his person  thats so mr coulson admitted i know he deposited a pocketbook with the purser and i happened to be standing by when he received it back i noticed that he had three or four thousanddollar bills and there didnt seem to be anything of the sort upon him when he was found  the inspector made a note of this  you believe yourself then mr coulson he said closing his pocketbook that the murder was committed for the purpose of robbery  seems to me its common sense mr coulson replied a man who goes and takes a special train to london from the docks of a city like liverpoola city filled with the scum of the world mind youkind of gives himself away as a man worth robbing doesnt he  the inspector nodded  thats sensible talk mr coulson he acknowledged you never heard i suppose of his having had a quarrel with any one  never in my life mr coulson declared he wasnt the sort to make enemies any more than he was the sort to make friends  the inspector took up his hat his manner now was no longer inquisitorial with the closing of his notebook a new geniality had taken the place of his official stiffness  you are making a long stay here mr coulson he asked  a week or so maybe that gentleman answered i am in the machinery patent linemachinery for the manufacture of woollen goods mostlyand i have a few appointments in london afterwards i am going on to paris you can hear of me at any time either here or at the grand hotel paris but theres nothing further to be got out of me as regards mr hamilton fynes  the inspector was of the same opinion and took his departure mr coulson waited for some little time still sitting on his trunk and clasping his hairbrushes then he moved over to the table on which stood the telephone instrument and asked for a number the reply came in a minute or two in the form of a question  its mr james b coulson from new york landed this afternoon from the lusitania mr coulson said i am at the savoy hotel speaking from my roomnumber 443  there was a brief silencethen a reply  you had better be in the bar smokingroom at seven oclock if nothing happens dont leave the hotel this evening  mr coulson replaced the receiver and rang off a pageboy knocked at the door  young lady downstairs wishes to see you sir he announced  mr coulson took up the card from the tray  miss penelope morse he said softly to himself seems to me im rather popular this evening say ill be down right away my boy  very good sir the page answered theres a gentleman with her sir his cards underneath the ladys  mr coulson examined the tray once more a gentlemans visiting card informed him that his other caller was sir charles somerfield bart  bart mr coulson remarked thoughtfully im not quite catching on to that but i suppose he goes in with the young lady  theyre both together sir the boy announced  mr coulson completed his toilet and hurried downstairs    chapter vii a fatal despatch  mr coulson found his two visitors in the lounge of the hotel he had removed all traces of his journey and was attired in a tuxedo dinner coat a softfronted shirt and a neatly arranged black tie he wore broadtoed patent boots and double lines of braid down the outsides of his trousers the page boy who was on the lookout for him conducted him to the corner where miss penelope morse and her companion were sitting talking together the latter rose at his approach and mr coulson summed him up quicklya wellbred pleasantmannered exceedingly athletic young englishman who was probably not such a fool as he lookedthat is from mr coulsons standpoint who was not used to the single eyeglass and somewhat drawling enunciation  mr coulson isnt it the young man asked accepting the others outstretched hand we are awfully sorry to disturb you so soon after your arrival too but the fact is that this young lady miss penelope morsemr coulson bowedwas exceedingly anxious to make your acquaintance you americans are such birds of passage that she was afraid you might have moved on if she didnt look you up at once  penelope herself intervened  im afraid youre going to think me a terrible nuisance mr coulson she exclaimed mr coulson although he did not call himself a ladys man was nevertheless human enough to appreciate the fact that the young ladys face was piquant and her smile delightful she was dressed with quiet but elegant simplicity the perfume of the violets at her waistband seemed to remind him of his return to civilization  well ill take my risks of that miss morse he declared if youll only let me know what i can do for you  its about poor mr hamilton fynes she explained i took up the evening paper only half an hour ago and read your interview with the reporter i simply couldnt help stopping to ask whether you could give me any further particulars about that horrible affair i didnt dare to come here all alone so i asked sir charles to come along with me  mr coulson being invited to do so seated himself on the lounge by the young ladys side he leaned a little forward with a hand on either knee  i dont exactly know what i can tell you he remarked i take it then that you were well acquainted with mr fynes  i used to know him quite well penelope answered and naturally i am very much upset when i read in the paper an account of your interview with the reporter i could see at once that you were not telling him everything why should you indeed a man does not want every detail of his life set out in the newspapers just because he has become connected with a terrible tragedy  youre a very sensible young lady miss morse if you will allow me to say so mr coulson declared you were expecting to see something of mr fynes over here then  i had an appointment to lunch with him today she answered he sent me a marconigram before he arrived at queenstown  is that so mr coulson exclaimed well well  i actually went to the restaurant penelope continued without knowing anything of this i cant understand it at all even now mr fynes always seemed to me such a harmless sort of person so unlikely to have enemies or anything of that sort dont you think so mr coulson  well that gentleman answered to tell you the honest truth miss morse im afraid i am going to disappoint you a little i wasnt over well acquainted with mr fynes although a good many people seemed to fancy that we were kind of bosom friends that newspaper man for instance met me at the station and stuck to me like a leech drove down here with me and was willing to stand all the liquor i could drink then there was a gentleman from scotland yard who was in such a hurry that he came to see me in my bedroom he had a sort of an idea that i had been brought up from infancy with hamilton fynes and could answer a sheaf of questions a yard long as soon as i got rid of him up comes that page boy and brings your card  it does seem too bad mr coulson penelope declared raising her wonderful eyes to his and smiling sympathetically you have really brought it upon yourself though to some extent havent you by answering so many questions for this comet man  those newspaper fellows mr coulson remarked are wonders before that youngster had finished with me i began to feel that poor old fynes and i had been like brothers all our lives as a matter of fact miss morse i expect you knew him at least as well as i did  she nodded her head thoughtfully  hamilton fynes came from the village in massachusetts where i was brought up ive known him all my life  mr coulson seemed a little startled  i didnt understand he said thoughtfully that fynes had any very intimate friends over this side  penelope shook her head  i dont mean to imply that we have been intimate lately she said i came to europe nine years ago and since then of course i have not seen him often perhaps it was the fact that he should have thought of me and that i was actually expecting to have lunch with him today which made me feel this thing so acutely  why thats quite natural mr coulson declared leaning back a little and crossing his legs somehow we seem to read about these things in the papers and they dont amount to such a lot but when you know the man and were expecting to see him as you were why then it comes right home to you theres something about a murder mr coulson concluded which kind of takes hold of you if youve ever even shaken hands with either of the parties concerned in it  did you see much of the poor fellow during the voyage sir charles asked  no nor any one else mr coulson replied i dont think he was seasick but he was miserably unsociable and he seldom left his cabin i doubt whether there were half a dozen people on board who would have recognized him afterwards as a fellowpassenger  he seems to have been a secretive sort of person sir charles remarked  he was that mr coulson admitted never seemed to care to talk about himself or his own business not that he had much to talk about he added reflectively dull sort of life his so many hours of work so many hours of play so many dollars a month and after its all over so many dollars pension wouldnt suit all of us sir charles eh  i fancy not somerfield admitted perhaps he kicked over the traces a bit when he was over this side you americans generally seem to find your way aboutin paris especially  mr coulson shook his head doubtfully  there wasnt much kicking over the traces with poor old fynes he said he hadnt got it in him  somerfield scratched his chin thoughtfully and looked at penelope  scarcely seems possible does it he remarked that a man leading such a quiet sort of life should make enemies  i dont believe he had any mr coulson asserted  he didnt seem nervous on the way over did he penelope askedas though he were afraid of something happening  mr coulson shook his head  no more than usual he answered i guess your police over here arent quite so smart as ours or theyd have been on the track of this thing before now but you can take it from me that when the truth comes out youll find that our poor friend has paid the penalty of going about the world like a crank  a what somerfield asked doubtfully  a crank mr coulson repeated vigorously it wasnt much i knew of hamilton fynes but i knew that much he was one of those nervous standoff sort of persons who hated to have people talk to him and yet was always doing things to make them talk about him i was over in europe with him not so long ago and he went on in the same way took a special train to dover when there wasnt any earthly reason for it travelled with a valet and a courier when he had no clothes for the valet to look after and spoke every european language better than his courier this time the poor fellows paid for his bit of vanity naturally any one would think he was a millionaire travelling like that i guess they boarded the train somehow or lay hidden in it when it started and relieved him of a good bit of his savings  but his money was found upon him somerfield objected  some of it mr coulson answeredsome of it thats just about the only thing that i do know of my own i happened to see him take his pocketbook back from the purser and i guess hed got a sight more money there than was found upon him i told the smoothspoken gentleman from scotland yard somr inspector jacks he called himselfwhen he came to see me an hour or so ago  penelope sighed gently she found it hard to make up her mind concerning this quondam acquaintance of her deceased friend  did you see much of mr fynes on the other side mr coulson she asked him  not i mr coulson answered he wasnt particularly anxious to make acquaintances over here but he was even worse at home the way he went on youd think hed never had any friends and never wanted any i met him once in the streets of washington last year and had a cocktail with him at the atlantic house i had to almost drag him in there i was pretty well a stranger in washington but he didnt do a thing for me never asked me to look him up or introduced me to his club he just drank his cocktail mumbled something about being in a hurry and made off  i tell you sir mr coulson continued turning to somerfield that man hadnt a thing to say for himself i guess his work had something to do with it you must get kind of out of touch with things shut up in an office from nine oclock in the morning till five in the afternoon just saving up he was for his trip to europe then we happened on the same steamer but bless you he scarcely even shook hands when he saw me he wouldnt play bridge didnt care about chess hadnt even a chair on the deck and never came in to meals  penelope nodded her head thoughtfully  you are destroying all my illusions mr coulson she said do you know that i was building up quite a romance about poor mr fynes life it seemed to me that he must have enemies that there must have been something in his life or his manner of living which accounted for such a terrible crime  why sure not mr coulson declared heartily it was a cleverly worked job but there was no mystery about it some chap went for him because he got riding about like a millionaire a more unromantic figure than hamilton fynes never breathed call him a crank and youve finished with him  penelope sighed once more and looked at the tips of her patent shoes  it has been so kind of you she murmured to talk to us and yet do you know i am a little disappointed i was hoping that you might have been able to tell us something more about the poor fellow  he was no talker mr coulson declared it was little enough he had to say to me and less to any one else  it seems strange she remarked innocently that he should have been so shy he didnt strike me that way when i knew him at home in massachusetts you know he travelled about so much in later years too didnt he  penelopes eyes were suddenly upraised for the first time mr coulsons ready answers failed him not a muscle of his face moved under the girls scrutiny but he hesitated for a short time before he answered her  not that i know of he said at length no i shouldnt have called him much of a traveller  penelope rose to her feet and held out her hand  it has been very nice indeed of you to see us mr coulson she said especially after all these other people have been bothering you of course i am sorry that you havent anything more to tell us than we knew already still i felt that i couldnt rest until we had been  its a sad affair anyhow mr coulson declared walking with them to the door dont you get worrying your head young lady though with any notion of his having had enemies or anything of that sort the poor fellow was no hero of romance i dont fancy even your halfpenny papers could drag any out of his life it was just a commonplace robbery with a bad ending for poor fynes good evening miss good night sir glad to have met you sir charles  mr coulsons two visitors left and got into a small electric brougham which was waiting for them mr coulson himself watched them drive off and glanced at the clock it was already a quarter past six he went into the cafe and ordered a light dinner which he consumed with much obvious enjoyment then he lit a cigar and went into the smoking room selecting a pile of newspapers he drew up an easy chair to the fire and made himself comfortable  seems to me i may have a longish wait he said to himself  as a matter of fact he was disappointed at precisely seven oclock mr richard vanderpole strolled into the room and after a casual glance around approached his chair and touched him on the shoulder in his evening clothes the newcomer was no longer obtrusively american he was dressed in severely english fashion from the cut of his white waistcoat to the admirable poise of his white tie he smiled as he patted coulson upon the shoulder  this is mr coulson im sure he declaredmr james b coulson from new york  youre dead right mr coulson admitted laying down his newspaper and favoring his visitor with a quick upward glance  this is great the young man continued just off the boat eh well i am glad to see youvery glad indeed to make your acquaintance i should say  mr coulson replied in similar terms a waiter who was passing through the room hesitated for it was a greeting which generally ended in a summons for him  what shall it be the newcomer asked  ive just taken dinner mr coulson said coffee and cognacll do me all right  and a martini cocktail for me the young man ordered i am dining down in the restaurant with some friends later on come over to this corner mr coulson why youre looking firstrate great boat the lusitania isnt she what sort of a trip did you have  so they talked till the drinks had been brought and paid for till another little party had quitted the room and they sat in their lonely corner secure from observation or from any possibility of eavesdropping then mr richard vanderpole leaned forward in his chair and dropped his voice  coulson he said the chief is anxious we dont understand this affair do you know anything  not a dd thing coulson answered  were you shadowed on the boat the young man asked  not to my knowledge coulson answered fynes was in his stateroom six hours before we started i cant make head nor tail of it  he had the papers of course  sewn in the lining of his coat coulson muttered you read about that in tonights papers the lining was torn and the space empty he had them all right when he left the steamer  the young man looked around the room was still empty  im fresh in this he said i got some information this afternoon and the chief sent me over to see you on account of it we had better not discuss possibilities i suppose the things too big the chiefs almost off his head is there any chance do you think coulson that this was an ordinary robbery i am not sure that the special train wasnt a mistake  none whatever coulson declared  how do you know his companion asked quickly  well ive lied to those reporters and chaps coulson admittedlied with a purpose of course as you people can understand the money found upon fynes was every penny he had when he left liverpool  the young man set his teeth  its something to know this at any rate he declared you did right coulson to put up that bluff now about the duplicates  they are in my suitcase coulson answered and according to the way things are going i shant be over sorry to get rid of them will you take them with you  why sure vanderpole answered thats what im here for  you had better wait right here then coulson said ill fetch them  he made his way up to his room undid his dressing bag which was fastened only with an ordinary lock and from between two shirts drew out a small folded packet no bigger than an ordinary letter it was a curious circumstance that he used only one hand for the search and with the other gripped the butt of a small revolver there was no one around however nor was he disturbed in any way in a few minutes he returned to the bar smoking room where the young man was still waiting and handed him the letter  tell me the latter asked have you been shadowed at all  not that i know of coulson answered  men with quick instincts vanderpole continued can always tell when they are being watched have you felt anything of the sort  coulson hesitated for one moment  no he said i had a caller whose manner i did not quite understand she seemed to have something at the back of her head about me  she was it a woman the young man asked quickly  coulson nodded  a young lady he saidmiss penelope morse she called herself  mr richard vanderpole stood quite still for a moment  ah he said softly she might have been interested  does the chief want me at all coulson asked  no vanderpole answered go about your business as usual leave here for paris say in ten days there will probably be a letter for you at the grand hotel by that time  they walked together toward the main exit the young mans face had lost some of its grimness once more his features wore that look of pleasant and genial goodfellowship which seems characteristic of his race after business hours  say mr coulson he declared as they passed across the hall you and i must have a night together this isnt new york by any manner of means or paris but theres some fun to be had here in a quiet way ill phone you tomorrow or the day after  sure mr coulson declared id like it above all things  i must find a taxicab the young man remarked ive a busy hour before me ive got to go down and see the chief who is dining somewhere in kensington and get back again to dine here at half past seven in the restaurant  i guess youll have to look sharp then mr coulson remarked do you see the time  vanderpole glanced at the clock and whistled softly to himself  tell you what he exclaimed ill write a note to one of the friends ive got to meet and leave it here boy he added turning to a page boy get me a taxi as quick as you can  the boy ran out into the strand and vanderpole sitting down at the table wrote a few lines which he sealed and addressed and handed to one of the reception clerks then he shook hands with coulson and threw himself into a corner of the cab which was waiting  drive down the brompton road he said to the man ill direct you later  it was a quarter past seven when he left the hotel at half past a policeman held up his hand and stopped the taxi to the drivers great astonishment as he was driving slowly across melbourne square kensington  whats the matter the man asked you cant say i was exceeding my speed limit  the policeman scarcely noticed him his head was already through the cab window  where did you take your fare up he asked quickly  savoy hotel the man answered whats wrong with him  the policeman opened the door of the cab and stepped in  never you mind about that he said drive to the south kensington police station as quick as you can    chapter viii an interrupted theatre party  seated upon a roomy lounge in the foyer of the savoy were three women who attracted more than an average amount of attention from the passersby in the middle was the duchess of devenham erect stately and with a figure which was still irreproachable notwithstanding her white hair on one side sat her daughter lady grace redford tall fair and comely on the other miss penelope morse the two girls were amusing themselves watching the people their chaperon had her eye upon the clock  to dine at halfpast seven the duchess remarked as she looked around the entresol of the great restaurant through her lorgnettes is certainly a little trying for ones temper and for ones digestion but so long as those men accepted i certainly think they ought to have been here they know that the play begins at a quarter to nine  it isnt like dicky vanderpole in the least penelope said since he began to tread the devious paths of diplomacy he has brought exactness in the small things of life down to a fine art  he isnt half so much fun as he used to be lady grace declared  fun penelope exclaimed sometimes i think that i never knew a more trying person  i have never known the prince unpunctual the duchess murmured i consider him absolutely the bestmannered young man i know  lady grace smiled and glanced at penelope  i dont think youll get penelope to agree with you mother she said  why not my dear the duchess asked i heard that you were quite rude to him the other evening we others all find him so charming  penelopes lip curled slightly  he has so many admirers she remarked that i dare say he will not notice my absence from the ranks perhaps i am a little prejudiced at home you know we have rather strong opinions about this fusion of races  the duchess raised her eyebrows  but a prince of japan my dear penelope she said a cousin of the emperor and a member of an aristocracy which was old before we were thought of surely you cannot class prince maiyo amongst those to whom any of your country people could take exception  penelope shrugged her shoulders slightly  perhaps she said my feeling is the result of hearing you all praise him so much and so often besides apart from that you must remember that i am a patriotic daughter of the stars and stripes and there isnt much friendship lost between washington and tokio just now  the duchess turned away to greet a man who had paused before their couch on his way into the restaurant  my dear general she said it seems to me that one meets every one here why was not restaurant dining the vogue when i was a girl  general sherrif smiled he was tall and thin with grizzled hair and worn features notwithstanding his civilians clothes there was no possibility of mistaking him anywhere or under any circumstances for anything but a soldier  it is a delightful custom he admitted it keeps one always on the qui vive one never knows whom one may see incidentally i find it interferes very much with my digestion  digestion the duchess murmured but then you soldiers lead such irregular lives  not always from choice the general reminded her the russojapanese war finished me off they kept us far enough away from the fighting when they could but by jove they did make us move  we are waiting now for prince maiyo the duchess remarked you know him  know him the general answered duchess if ever i have to write my memoirs and particularly my reminiscences of this war i fancy you would find the name of your friend appear there pretty frequently there wasnt a more brilliant feat of arms in the whole campaign than his flanking movement at mukden i met most of the japanese leaders and i have always said that i consider him the most wonderful of them all  the duchess turned to penelope  do you hear that she asked  penelope smiled  the fates are against me she declared if i may not like i shall at least be driven to admire  to talk of bravery when one speaks of that war the general remarked seems invidious for it is my belief that throughout the whole of the japanese army such a thing as fear did not exist they simply did not know what the word meant but i shall never forget that the only piece of handtohand fighting i saw during the whole time was a cavalry charge led by prince maiyo against an immensely superior force of russians duchess the general declared those japanese on their queer little horses went through the enemy like wind through a cornfield that young man must have borne a charmed life i saw him riding and cheering his men on when he must have had at least half a dozen wounds in his body you will pardon me duchess i see that my party are waiting  the general hurried away the duchess shut up her lorgnettes with a snap and held out her hand to a newcomer who had come from behind the palms  my dear prince she exclaimed this is charming of you some one told me that you were not wellour wretched climate of courseand i was so afraid every moment that we should receive your excuses  the newcomer who was bowing over her hand was of medium height or a trifle less dark and dressed with the quiet exactness of an english gentleman only a slight narrowness of the eyes and a greater alertness of movement seemed to distinguish him in any way as regards nationality from the men by whom he was surrounded his voice when he spoke contained no trace of accent it was soft and singularly pleasant it had too one somewhat rare qualitya delightful ring of truth perhaps that was one of the reasons why prince maiyo was just then amongst certain circles one of the most popular persons in society  my dear duchess he said my indisposition was nothing and as for your climate i am beginning to delight in itone never knows what to expect or when one may catch a glimpse of the sun it is only the grayness which is always the same  and even that the duchess remarked smiling has been yellow for the last few days prince you know my daughter grace and i am sure that you have met miss penelope morse we are waiting for two other men sir charles somerfield and mr vanderpole  the prince bowed and began to talk to his hostess daughtera tall fair girl as yet only in her second season  here comes sir charles at any rate the duchess exclaimed really i think we shall have to go in we can leave a message for dicky they all know him at this place i am afraid he is one of those shocking young men who entertain the theatrical profession here to supper  a footman at that moment brought a note to the duchess which she tore open  this is from dicky she exclaimed glancing it through quicklysavoy notepaper too so i suppose he has been here he says that he may be a few minutes late and that we are not to wait he will pick us up either here or at the theatre prince shall we let these young people follow us i havent heard your excuses yet do you know that you were a quarter of an hour late  he bent towards her with troubled face  dear duchess he said believe me i am conscious of my fault an unexpected matter which required my personal attention presented itself at the last moment i think i can assure you that nothing of its sort was ever accomplished so quickly it would only weary you if i tried to explain  please dont the duchess begged so long as you are here at last and after all you see you are not the worst sinner mr vanderpole has not yet arrived  the prince walked on for a few steps in silence  mr vanderpole is a great friend of yours duchess he asked  the duchess shook her head  i do not know him very well she said i asked him for penelope  the prince looked puzzled  but i thought he said that miss morse and sir charles  the duchess interrupted him with a smile  sir charles is very much in earnest she whispered but very very slow dicky is just the sort of man to spur him on he admires penelope and does not mind showing it she is such a dear girl that i should love to have her comfortably settled over here  she is very intelligent the prince said she is a young lady indeed for whom i have a great admiration i am only sorry he concluded that i do not seem able to interest her  you must not believe that the duchess said penelope is a little brusque sometimes but it is only her manner  they made their way through the foyer to the round table which had been reserved for them in the centre of the restaurant  i suppose i ought to apologize for giving you dinner at such an hour the duchess remarked but it is our theatrical managers who are to blame why they cannot understand that the best play in the world is not worth more than two hours of our undivided attention and begin everything at nine or a quarterpast i cannot imagine  the prince smiled  dear duchess he said i think that you are a nation of sybarites everything in the world must run for you so smoothly or you are not content for my part i like to dine at this hour  but then you take no luncheon prince lady grace reminded him  i never lunch out the prince answered but i have always what is sufficient for me  tell me the duchess asked is it true that you are thinking of settling down amongst us your picture is in the new illustrated paper this week you know with a little sketch of your career we are given to understand that you may possibly make your home in this country  the prince smiled and in his smile there seemed to be a certain mysticism one could not tell indeed whether it came from some pleasant thought flitting through his brain or whether it was that the idea itself was so strange to him  i have no plans duchess he said your country is very delightful and the hospitality of the friends i have made over here is too wonderful a thing to be described but one never knows  lady grace bent towards sir charles who was sitting by her side  i can never understand the prince she murmured always he seems as though he took life so earnestly he has a look upon his face which i never see in the faces of any of you other young men  he is a bit on the serious side sir charles admitted  it isnt only that she continued he reminds me of that man whom we all used to go and hear preach at the oratory he was the same in the pulpit and when one saw him in the street his eyes seemed to see through one he seemed to be living in a world of his own  he was a religious johnny of course sir charles remarked they do walk about with their heads in the air  lady grace smiled  perhaps it is religion with the prince she saidreligion of a sort  i tell you what i do think sir charles murmured i think his pretence at having a good time over here is all a bluff he doesnt really cotton to us you know dont see how he could hes never touched a polo stick in his life knows nothing about cricket is indifferent to games and doesnt even understand the meaning of the word sportsman theres no place in this country for a man like that  lady grace nodded  i think she said that his visit to europe and his stay amongst us is after all in the nature of a pilgrimage i suppose he wants to carry back some of our civilization to his own people  penelope who overheard laughed softly and leaned across the table  i fancy she murmured that the person you are speaking of would not look at it in quite the same light  has any one seen the evening paper the duchess asked it is there any more news about that extraordinary murder  nothing fresh in the early editions sir charles answered  i think the duchess declared that it is perfectly scandalous our police system must be in a disgraceful state tell me princecould anything like that happen in your country  without doubt the prince answered life moves very much in the east as with you here only with us he added a little thoughtfully there is a difference a difference of which one is reminded at a time like this when one reads your newspapers and hears the conversation of ones friends  tell us what you mean penelope asked quickly  he looked at her as one might have looked at a childkindly even tolerantly he was scarcely so tall as she was and penelopes attitude towards him was marked all the time with a certain frigidity yet he spoke to her with the quiet courteous confidence of the philosopher who unbends to talk to a child  in this country he said you place so high a value upon the gift of life nothing moves you so greatly as the killing of one man by another or the death of a person whom you know  there is no tragedy in the world so great penelope declared  the prince shrugged his shoulders very slightly  my dear miss morse he said it is so that you think about life and death here yet you call yourselves a christian countryyou have a very beautiful faith with us perhaps there is a little more philosophy and something a little less definite in the trend of our religion yet we do not dress death in black clothes or fly from his outstretched hand we fear him no more that we do the night it is a thing that comesa thing that must be  he spoke so softly and yet with so much conviction that it seemed hard to answer him penelope however was conscious of an almost feverish desire either to contradict him or to prolong the conversation by some means or other  your point of view she said is well enough prince for those who fall in battle fighting for their country or for a great cause dont you think though that the horror of death is a more real thing in a case like this where a man is killed in cold blood for the sake of robbery or perhaps revenge  one cannot tell the prince answered thoughtfully the battlefields of life are there for every one to cross this mysterious gentleman who seems to have met with his death so unexpectedlyhe too may have been the victim of a cause knowing his dangers facing them as a man should face them  the duchess sighed  i am quite sure prince she said that you are a romanticist but apart from the sentimental side of it do things like this happen in your country  why not the prince answered it is as i have been saying for a worthy cause or a cause which he believed to be worthy there is no man of my country worthy of the name who would not accept death with the same resignation that he lays his head upon the pillow and waits for sleep  sir charles raised his glass and bowed across the table  to our great allies he said smiling  the prince drank his glass of water thoughtfully he drank wine only on very rare occasions and then under compulsion he turned to the duchess  a few days ago he said i heard myself described as being much too serious a person tonight i am afraid that i am living up to my reputation our conversation seems to have drifted into somewhat gloomy channels we must ask miss morse i think to help us to forget they say he continued that it is the young ladies of your country who hold open the gates of paradise for their menkind  he was looking into her eyes his tone was half bantering half serious from across the table penelope knew that somerfield was watching her closely somehow or other she was irritated and nervous and she answered vaguely sir charles intervened with a story about some of their acquaintances and the conversation drifted into more ordinary channels  some day i suppose the duchess remarked as the service of dinner drew toward a close you will have restaurants like this in tokio  the prince assented  yes he said without enthusiasm they will come our heritage from the west is a sure thing not in my days perhaps or in the days of those that follow me but they will come  i think that it is absolutely wicked of dicky the duchess declared as they rose from the table i shall never rely upon him again  after all perhaps it isnt his fault penelope said breathing a little sigh of relief as she rose to her feet mr harvey is not always considerate and i know that several of the staff are away on leave  thats right my dear the duchess said smiling stick up for your countrymen i suppose hell find us sometime during the evening we can all go to the theatre together the omnibus is outside  the little party passed through the foyer and into the hall of the hotel where they waited while the duchess carriage was called mr coulson was there in an easy chair smoking a cigar and watching the people coming and going he studied the passersby with ah air of impersonal but pleased interest penelope and lady grace were certainly admirable foils the latter was fair with beautiful complexiona trifle sunburnt blue eyes goodhumored mouth and features excellent in their way but a little lacking in expression her figure was good her movements slow but not ungraceful her dress of white ivory satin a little extravagant for the occasion she looked exactly what she wasa wellbred welldisposed healthy young englishwoman of aristocratic parentage penelope on the other hand more simply dressed save for the string of pearls which hung from her neck had the look of a creature from another world she had plenty of animation a certain nervous energy seemed to keep her all the time restless she talked ceaselessly sometimes to the prince more often to sir charles her graygreen eyes were bright her cheeks delicately flushed she spoke and looked and moved as one on fire with the joy of life the prince noticing that lady grace had been left to herself for the last few moments moved a little towards her and commenced a courteous conversation sir charles took the opportunity to bend over his companion  penelope he said you are queer tonight tell me what it is you dont really dislike the prince do you  why of course not she answered looking back into the restaurant and listening as though interested in the music he is odd though isnt he he is so serious and in a way so convincing he is like a being transplanted into an absolutely alien soil one would like to laugh at him and one cant  he is rather an anomaly sir charles said humming lightly to himself i suppose compared with us matteroffact people he must seem to your sex quite a romantic figure  he makes no particular appeal to me at all penelope declared  somerfield was suddenly thoughtful  sometimes penelope he said i dont quite understand you especially when we speak about the prince i have come to the conclusion that you either like him very much or you dislike him very much or you have some thoughts about him which you tell to no one  she lifted her skirts the carriage had been called  i like your last suggestion she declared you may believe that that is true  on their way out the prince was accosted by some friends and remained talking for several moments when he entered the omnibus there seemed to penelope who found herself constantly watching him closely a certain added gravity in his demeanor the drive to the theatre was a short one and conversation consisted only of a few disjointed remarks in the lobby the prince laid his hand upon somerfields arm  sir charles he said if i were you i would keep that evening paper in your pocket dont let the ladies see it  somerfield looked at him in surprise  what do you mean he asked  to me personally it is of no consequence the prince answered but your womenfolk feel these things so keenly and mr vanderpole is of the same nationality is he not as miss morse if you take my advice you will be sure that they do not see the paper until after they get home this evening  has anything happened to dicky somerfield asked quickly  the princes face was impassive he seemed not to have heard penelope had turned to wait for them  the duchess thinks that we had better all go into the box she said we have two stalls as well but as dicky is not here there is really room for five will you get some programmes sir charles  somerfield stopped for a minute under pretence of seeking some change and tore open his paper the prince led penelope down the carpeted way  i heard what you and sir charles were saying she declared quietly please tell me what it is that has happened to dicky  the princes face was grave  i am sorry he replied i did not know that our voices would travel so far  it was not yours she said it was sir charles tell me quickly what it is that has happened  mr vanderpole the prince answered has met with an accidenta somewhat serious one i fear perhaps he added it would be as well after all to break this to the duchess i was forgetting the prejudices of your country she will doubtless wish that our party should be broken up  penelope was suddenly very white he whispered in her ear  be brave he said it is your part  she stood still for a moment and then moved on his words had had a curious effect upon her the buzzing in her ears had ceased there was something to be doneshe must do it she passed into the box the door of which the attendant was holding open  duchess she said i am so sorry but i am afraid that something has happened to dicky if you do not mind i am going to ask sir charles to take me home  but my dear child the duchess exclaimed  miss morse is quite right the prince said quietly i think it would be better for her to leave at once if you will allow me i will explain to you later  she left the box without another word and took somerfields arm  we two are to go she murmured the prince will explain to the duchess  the prince closed the box door behind them he placed a chair for the duchess so that she was not in view of the house  a very sad thing has happened he said quietly mr vanderpole met with an accident in a taxicab this evening from the latest reports it seems that he is dead    chapter ix inspector jacks scores  there followed a few days of pleasurable interest to all englishmen who travelled in the tube and read their halfpenny papers a great and enlightened press had already solved the problem of creating the sensational without the aid of facts this sudden deluge therefore of undoubtedly tragical happenings became almost an embarrassment to them black headlines notes of exclamation the use of superlative adjectives scarcely met the case the murder of mr hamilton fynes was strange enough here was an unknown man holding a small position in his own countrya man apparently without friends or social position he travelled over from america merely a unit amongst the host of other passengers yet his first action on arriving at liverpool was to make use of privileges which belonged to an altogether different class of person and culminated in his arrival at euston in a special train with a dagger driven through his heart here was material enough for a least a fortnight of sensations and countersensations of rumored arrests and strange theories yet within the space of twentyfour hours the affair of mr hamilton fynes had become a small thing had shrunk almost into insignificance by the side of the other still more dramatic still more wonderful happening somewhere between the savoy hotel and melbourne square kensington a young american gentleman of great strength of undoubted position the nephew of a minister and himself secretary to the ambassador of his country in london had met with his death in a still more mysterious still more amazing fashion he had left the hotel in an ordinary taxicab which had stopped on the way to pick up no other passenger he had left the savoy alone and he was discovered in melbourne square alone yet somewhere between these two points notwithstanding the fact that the aggressor must have entered the cab either with or without his consent mr richard vanderpole without a struggle without any cry sufficiently loud to reach the driver or attract the attention of any passerby had been strangled to death by a person who had disappeared as though from the face of the earth the facts seemed almost unbelievable and yet they were facts the driver of the taxi knew only that three times during the course of his drive he had been caught in a block and had had to wait for a few secondsonce at the entrance to trafalgar square again at the junction of haymarket and pall mall and for a third time opposite the hyde park hotel at neither of these halting places had he heard any one enter or leave the taxi he had heard no summons from his fare even though a tube which was in perfect working order was fixed close to the back of his head he had known nothing in fact until a policeman had stopped him having caught a glimpse of the ghastly face inside there was no evidence which served to throw a single gleam of light upon the affair mr vanderpole had called at the savoy hotel upon a travelling american who had written to the embassy asking for some advice as to introducing american patents into great britain and france he left there to meet his chief who was dining down in kensington with the intention of returning at once to join the duchess of devenhams theatre party he was in no manner of trouble it was not suggested that any one had any cause for enmity against him yet this attack upon him must have been carefully planned and carried out by a person of great strength and wonderful nerve the newspaperreading public in london love their thrills and they had one here which needed no artificial embellishments from the pens of those trained in an atmosphere of imagination the simple truth was in itself horrifying there was scarcely a man or woman who drove in a taxicab about the west end of london during the next few days without a little thrill of emotion  the murder of mr richard vanderpole took place on a thursday night on monday morning a gentleman of middle age fashionably but quietly dressed wearing a flower in his buttonhole patent boots and a silk hat which he had carefully deposited upon the floor was sitting closeted with miss penelope morse it was obvious that that young lady did not altogether appreciate the honor done to her by a visit from so distinguished a person as inspector jacks  i am sorry he said that you should find my visit in the least offensive miss morse i have approached you so far as possible as an ordinary visitor and no one connected with your household can have any idea as to my identity or the nature of my business i have done this out of consideration to your feelings at the same time i have my duty to perform and it must be done  what i cannot understand penelope said coldly is why you should bother me about your duty when i saw you at the carlton hotel i told you exactly how much i knew of mr hamilton fynes  my dear young lady inspector jacks said i will not ask for your sympathy for i am afraid i should ask in vain but we are just now we people at scotland yard up against one of the most extraordinary problems which have ever been put before us we have had two murders occurring in two days which have this much at least in commonthat they have been the work of so accomplished a criminal that at the present moment although i should not like to tell every one as much we have not in either case the ghost of a clue  that sounds very stupid of you penelope remarked but i still ask  dont ask for a minute or two the inspector interrupted i think i remarked just now that these two crimes had one thing in common and that was the fact that they had both been perpetrated by a criminal of unusual accomplishments they also have one other point of similitude  what is that penelope asked  the victim in both cases was an american the inspector said  penelope sat very still she felt the steely eyes of the man who had chosen his seat so carefully fixed upon her face  you do not connect the two affairs in any way she asked  that is what we are asking ourselves mr jacks continued in the absence of any definite clue coincidences such as this are always interesting in this case as it happens we can take them even a little further we find that you for instance miss penelope morse a young american lady celebrated for her wit and accomplishments and well known in london society were to have lunched with mr hamilton fynes on the day when he made his tragical arrival in london we find too curiously enough that you were one of the party with whom mr richard vanderpole was to have dined and gone to the theatre on the night of his decease  penelope shivered and half closed her eyes  dont you think she said that the shock of this coincidence as you call it has been quite sufficient without having you come here to remind me of it  madam mr jacks said i have not come here to gratify any personal curiosity i have come here in the cause of justice you should find me a welcome visitor for both these men who have lost their lives were friends of yours  i should be very sorry indeed penelope answered to stand in the way of justice no one can hope more fervently than i do that the perpetrator of these deeds will be found and punished but what i cannot understand is your coming here and reopening the subject with me i tell you again that i have no possible information for you  perhaps not the inspector declared but on the other hand there are certain questions which you can answer meanswer them i mean not grudgingly and as though in duty boundanswer them intelligently and with some apprehension of the things which lie behind  and what is the thing that lies behind them she asked  a theory madam the inspector answeredno more but in this case unfortunately we have not passed the stage of theories my theory at the present moment is that the murderer of these two men was the same person  you have evidence to that effect she said suddenly surprised to find that her voice had sunk to a whisper  very little mr jacks admitted but you see in the case of theories one must build them brick by brick then if after all as we reach the end the foundation was false well we must watch them collapse and start again  supposing we leave these generalities penelope remarked and get on with those questions which you wish to ask me my aunt as you may have heard is an invalid and although she seldom leaves her room this is one of the afternoons when she sometimes sits here for a short time i should not care to have her find you  the inspector leaned back in his chair it was a very pleasant drawing room looking out upon the park a little french clock a masterpiece of workmanship was ticking gayly upon the mantelpiece two toy pomeranians were half hidden in the great rug the walls were of light blue soft yet full of color and the carpet of some plain material was of the same shade the perfume of flowersthe faint sweetness of mimosa and the sicklier fragrance of hyacinthsseemed almost overwhelming for the fire was warm and the windows closed by the side of penelopes chair were a new novel and a couple of illustrated papers and mr jacks noticed that although a paper cutter was lying by their side the leaves of all were uncut  these questions he said may seem to you irrelevant yet please answer them if you can mr hamilton fynes for instancewas he to your knowledge acquainted with mr richard vanderpole  i have never heard them speak of one another penelope answered i should think it very unlikely  you have no knowledge of any common pursuit or interest in life which the two men may have shared the inspector asked a hobby for instancea collection of postage stamps china any common aim of any sort  she shook her head  i knew little of mr fynes tastes dickyi mean mr vanderpolehad none at all except an enthusiasm for his profession and a love of polo  his profession the inspector repeated mr vanderpole was attached to the american embassy was he not  i believe so penelope answered  mr hamilton fynes the inspector continued might almost have been said to have followed the same occupation  surely not penelope objected i always understood that mr fynes was employed in a government office at washingtonsomething to do with the customs i thought or forest duties  mr jacks nodded thoughtfully  i am not aware as yet he said of the precise nature of mr fynes occupation i only knew that it was in some shape or form government work  you know as much about it she answered as i do  we have sent the inspector continued smoothly a special man out to washington to make all inquiries that are possible on the spot and incidentally to go through the effects of the deceased with a view to tracing any complications in which he may have been involved in this country  penelope opened her lips but closed them again  i am not however the inspector continued very sanguine of success in the case of mr vanderpole for instance there could have been nothing of the sort he was too young altogether too much of a boy to have had enemies so bitterly disposed towards him there is another explanation somewhere i feel convinced at the root of the matter  you do not believe then asked penelope that robbery was really the motive  not ordinary robbery mr jacks answered a man who was capable of these two crimes is capable of easier and greater things i mean he explained that he could have attempted enterprises of a far more remunerative character with a prospect of complete success  will you forgive me she said if i ask you to go on with your questions providing you have any more to ask me notwithstanding the excellence of your disguise she remarked with a faint curl of the lips i might find it somewhat difficult to explain your presence if my aunt or any visitors should come in  i am sorry miss morse the inspector said quietly to find you so unsympathetic had i found you differently disposed i was going to ask you to put yourself in my place i was going to ask you to look at these two tragedies from my point of view and from your own at the same time and i was going to ask you whether any possible motive suggested itself to you any possible person or cause which might be benefited by the removal of these two men  if you think mr jacks penelope said that i am keeping anything from you you are very much mistaken such sympathy as i have would certainly be with those who are attempting to bring to justice the perpetrator of such unmentionable crimes what i object to is the unpleasantness of being associated with your inquiries when i am absolutely unable to give you the least help or to supply you with any information which is not equally attainable to you  as for instance the inspector asked  you are a detective penelope said coldly you do not need me to point out certain things to you mr hamilton fynes was robbed and murderedan american citizen on his way to london mr richard vanderpole is also murdered after a call upon mr james b coulson the only acquaintance whom mr fynes is known to have possessed in this country did mr fynes share secrets with mr coulson if so did mr coulson pass them on to mr vanderpole and for that reason did mr vanderpole meet with the same death at the same hands as had befallen mr fynes  inspector jacks moved his head thoughtfully  it is admirably put he assented and to continue  it is not my place to make suggestions to you penelope said if you are able to connect mr fynes with the american government you arrive at the possibility of these murders having been committed for some political end i presume you read your newspapers  inspector jacks smiled picked up his hat and bowed while penelope with a sigh of relief moved over to the bell  my dear young lady he said you do not understand how important even the point of view of another person is to a man who is struggling to build up a theory whether you have helped me as much as you could he added looking her in the face you only can tell but you have certainly helped me a little  the footman had entered the inspector turned to follow him penelope remained as she had been standing the hand which had touched the bell fallen to her side her eyes fixed upon him with a new light stirring their quiet depths  one moment morton she said wait outside mr jacks she added as the door closed what do you mean what can i have told you how can i have helped you  the inspector stood very still for a brief space of time very still and very silent his face too was quite expressionless yet his tone when he spoke seemed to have taken to itself a note of sternness  if you had chosen he said slowly to have become my ally in this matter to have ranged yourself altogether on the side of the law my answer would have been ready enough what you have told me however you have told me against your will and not in actual words you have told me in such a way too he added that it is impossible for me to doubt your intention to mislead me i am forced to conclude that we stand on opposite sides of the way i shall not trouble you any more miss morse  he turned to the door penelope remained motionless for several moments listening to his retreating footsteps    chapter x mr coulson outmatched  mr james b coulson settled down to live what was to all appearance a very inoffensive and ordinary life he rose a little earlier than was customary for an englishman of business of his own standing but he made up for this by a somewhat prolonged visit to the barber a breakfast which bespoke an unimpaired digestion and a cigar of more than ordinary length over his newspaper at about eleven oclock he went down to the city and returned sometimes to luncheon sometimes at varying hours never later however than four or five oclock from that time until seven he was generally to be found in the american bar meeting old friends or making new ones  on the sixth day of his stay at the savoy hotel the waiter who looked after the bar smoking room accosted him as he entered at his usual time a little after half past four  theres a gentleman here mr coulson been asking after you he announced i told him that you generally came in about this time youll find him sitting over there  mr coulson glanced in the direction indicated it was mr jacks who awaited him in the cushioned easy chair for a single moment perhaps his lips tightened and the light of battle flashed in his face then he crossed the room apparently himself againan undistinguished perfectly natural figure  its mr jacks isnt it he asked holding out his hand i thought i recognized you  the inspector rose to his feet  i am sorry to trouble you again mr coulson he said but if you could spare me just a minute or two i should be very much obliged  mr coulson laughed pleasantly  you can have all you want of me from now till midnight he declared my business doesnt take very long and i can only see the people i want to see in the middle of the day after that i dont mind telling you that i find time hangs a bit on my hands try one of these he added producing a cigar case  the inspector thanked him and helped himself mr coulson summoned the waiter  highball for me he directed whats yours mr jacks  thank you very much the inspector said i will take a little scotch whiskey and soda  the two men sat down the corner was a retired one and there was no one within earshot  say are you still on this hamilton fynes business mr coulson asked  partly the inspector replied  you know im not making reflections mr coulson said sticking his cigar in a corner of his mouth and leaning back in a comfortable attitude but it does seem to me that you are none too rapid on this side in clearing up these matters why a little affair of that sort wouldnt take the police twenty minutes in new york we have a big city full of alien quarters full of hiding places and chock full of criminals but our police catch em all the same theres no one going to commit murder in the streets of new york without finding himself in the tombs before hes a week older no offence mr jacks  i am not taking any mr coulson the inspector answered i must admit that theres a great deal of truth in what you say it is rather a reflection upon us that we have not as yet even made an arrest but i think you will also admit that the circumstances of those murders were exceedingly curious  mr coulson knocked the ash from his cigar  well as to that he said and if we are to judge only by what we read in the papers they are curious without a doubt but i am not supposing for one moment that you fellows at scotland yard dont know more than youve let on to the newspapers you keep your discoveries out of the press over here and a good job too but you wouldnt persuade me that you havent some very distinct theory as to how that crime was worked and the sort of person who did it eh mr jacks  we are perhaps not quite so ignorant as we seem the inspector answered and of course you are right when you say that we have a few more facts to go by than have appeared in the newspapers still the affair is an extremely puzzling oneas puzzling in its way mr jacks continued as the murder on the very next evening of this young american gentleman  mr coulson nodded sympathetically the drinks were brought and he raised his glass to his guest  heres luck he saidluck to you with your game of human chess and luck to me with my woollen machinery patents you were speaking of that second murder he remarked setting down his glass i havent noticed the papers much this morning has any arrest been made yet  not yet the inspector admitted to tell you the truth we find it almost as puzzling an affair as the one in which mr hamilton fynes was concerned  mr coulson nodded he seemed content at this stage in their conversation to assume the role of listener  you read the particulars of the murder of mr vanderpole i suppose the inspector asked  every word mr coulson answered most interesting thing ive seen in an english newspaper since i landed didnt sound like london somehow gray old lawabiding place my partner always calls it  i am going to be quite frank with you mr coulson the inspector continued i am going to tell you exactly why i have come to see you again tonight  why thats good mr coulson declared i like to know everything a mans got in his mind  i have come to you the inspector said because by a somewhat curious coincidence i find that besides your slight acquaintance with and knowledge of mr hamilton fynes you were also acquainted with this mr richard vanderpolethat you were he continued knocking the ash off his cigar and speaking a little more slowly the last person except the driver of the taxicab to have seen him alive  mr coulson turned slowly around and faced his companion  now how the devil do you know that he asked  the inspector smiled tolerantly  well he said that is very simple the taxicab started from here mr vanderpole had been visiting some one in the hotel there was not the slightest difficulty in ascertaining that the person for whom he asked and with whom he spent some twenty minutes in this very room was mr james b coulson of new york  seated on this very couch sir mr coulson declared striking the arm of it with the flat of his handseated within a few feet of where you yourself are at this present moment  the inspector nodded  naturally he continued when i became aware of so singular an occurrence i felt that i must lose no time in coming and having a few more words with you  mr coulson became meditative  upon my word when you come to think of it he said it is a coincidence sure two men murdered within twentyfour hours and i seem to have been the last person who knew them to speak to either tell you what mr jacks if this goes on i shall get a bit scared i think i shall let the london business alone and go on over to paris  the inspector smiled  i fancy your nerves he remarked are quite strong enough to bear the strain however i am sure you will not mind telling me exactly why mr richard vanderpole secretary to the american embassy here should have come to see you on thursday night  why thats easy mr coulson replied you may have heard of my firm the coulson  bruce company of jersey city im at the head of a syndicate thats controlling some very valuable patents which we want to exploit on this side and in paris now my people dont exactly know how we stand under this new patent bill of mr lloyd georges accordingly they wrote across to mr blaineharvey putting the matter to him and asking him to give me his opinion the moment i arrived on this side you see it was no use our entering into contracts if we had to build the plant and make the stuff over here we didnt stand any earthly show of making it pay that way well mr harvey cabled out that i was just to let him know the moment i landed and before i opened up any business sure enough i called him up on the telephone an hour or so after i got here and this young man came round i can tell you he was all right tooa fine upstanding young fellow and as bright as they make em he brought a written opinion with him as to how the law would affect our proceedings ive got it in my room if youd care to see it  mr jacks listened to his companions words with unchanged face  if it isnt troubling you he said it would be of some interest to me  mr coulson rose to his feet  you sit right here he declared ill be back in less than five minutes  mr coulson was as good as his word in less than the time mentioned he was seated again by his companions side with a square sheet of foolscap spread out upon the round table the inspector ran it through hurriedly the paper was stamped american embassy and it was the digest of several opinions as to the effect of the new patent law upon the import of articles manufactured under processes controlled by the coulson  bruce syndicate at the end there were a few lines in the ambassadors own handwriting summing up the situation mr coulson produced another packet of letters and documents  if youve an hour or so to spare mr jacks he said id like to go right into this with you if it would interest you any its my business over here so naturally i am glad enough of an opportunity to talk it over  mr jacks passed back the paper promptly  i am extremely obliged to you he said i am sure i should find it most interesting another time i should be very glad indeed to look through those specifications but just now i have this affair of my own rather on my mind about this mr richard vanderpole mr coulson then he added do i understand that this young man came to you as a complete stranger  absolutely mr coulson answered i never saw him before in my life as decent a young chap as ever i met with all the same he went on and comes of a good american stock too they tell me theres going to be an inquest and that i shall be summoned but i know nothing more than what ive told you if i did youd be welcome to it  mr jacks leaned back in his chair certainly the situation increased in perplexity the man by his side was talking now of the adaptation of one of his patents to some existing machinery and jacks watched him covertly he considered himself to some extent a physiognomist he told himself it was not possible that this man was playing a part mr james b coulson sat there the absolute incarnation of the genial man of affairs interested in his business interested in the great subject of dollargetting content with himself and his positiona person apparently of little imagination for the shock of this matter concerning which they had been talking had already passed away he was doing his best to explain with a pencil on the back of an illustrated paper some new system of woolbleaching  mr coulson the inspector said suddenly do you know a young lady named miss penelope morse  it was here perhaps that mr coulson sank a little from the heights of complete success he repeated the name and obviously took time to think before he answered  miss penelope morse the inspector continued she is a young american lady who lives with an invalid aunt in park lane and who is taken everywhere by the duchess of devenham another aunt i believe  i suppose i may say that i am acquainted with her mr coulson admitted she came here the other evening with a young mansir charles somerfield  ah the inspector murmured  shed read that interview of mine with the comet man mr coulson said and she fancied that perhaps i could tell her something about hamilton fynes  first time youd met her i suppose the inspector remarked  sure mr coulson answered as a matter of fact i know very few of my compatriots over here i am an american citizen myself and i havent too much sympathy with any one man or woman who doesnt find america good enough for them to live in  the inspector nodded  quite so he agreed so you hadnt anything to tell this young lady  not a thing that she hadnt read in the comet mr coulson replied what brought her into your mind anyway  nothing particular the inspector answered carelessly well mr coulson i wont take up any more of your time i am convinced that you have told me all that you know and i am afraid that i shall have to look elsewhere to find the loose end of this little tangle  stay and have another drink mr coulson begged ive nothing to do there are one or two boys coming in later wholl like to meet you  the inspector shook his head  i must be off he said i want to get into my office before six oclock i dare say i shall be running across you again before you go back  he shook hands and turned away then mr coulson made what was perhaps his second slight mistake  say mr jacks he exclaimed what made you mention that young ladys name anyway im curious to know  the inspector looked thoughtfully at the end of the fresh cigar which he had just lit  well he said i dont know that there was anything definite in my mind only it seems a little strange that you and miss penelope morse should both have been acquainted with the murdered man and that you should have come across one another  sort of bond between us eh mr coulson replied she seemed a very charming young lady cut above fynes i should think  the detective smiled  all your american young ladies who come over here are charming he said goodbye mr coulson and many thanks  the inspector passed out and the man whom he had come to visit after a moments hesitation resumed his seat  these arent american methods he muttered to himself i dont understand them that man jacks is either a simpleton or he is too cunning for me  he crossed to a writing table and scribbled an unnecessary note addressing it to a firm in the city then he rang for a messenger boy and handed it to him for delivery a few minutes afterwards he strolled out into the hall the boy was in the act of handing the note to one of the head porters who carefully copied the address mr coulson returned to the smoking room whistling softly to himself    chapter xi a commission  mr robert blaineharvey american ambassador and plenipotentiary extraordinary to england was a man of great culture surprising personal gifts and with a diplomatic instinct which amounted almost to genius and yet there were times when he was puzzled for at least half an hour he had been sitting in his great library looking across the park and trying to make up his mind on a very important matter it seemed to him that he was face to face with what amounted almost to a crisis in his career his two years at the court of st james had been pleasant and uneventful enough the small questions which had presented themselves for adjustment between the two countries were after all of no particular importance and were easily arranged the days seemed to have gone by for that overstrained sensitiveness which was continually giving rise to senseless bickerings when every trilling breeze seemed to fan the smouldering fires of jealousy the two great englishspeaking nations appeared finally to have realized the absolute folly of continual disputes between countries whose destiny and ideals were so completely in accord and whose interests were in the main identical a period of absolute friendliness had ensued and now there had come this little cloud it was small enough at present but mr harvey was not the one to overlook its sinister possibilities two citizens of his country had been barbarously murdered within the space of a few hours one in the heart of the most thickly populated capital in the world and there was a certain significance attached to this fact which the ambassador himself and those others at washington perfectly well realized he glanced once more at the most recent letter on the top of this pile of correspondence and away again out into the park it was a difficult matter this his friends at washington did not cultivate the art of obscurity in the words which they used and it had been suggested to him in black and white that the murder of these two men under the particular circumstances existing was a matter concerning which he should speak very plainly indeed to certain august personages mr harvey who was a born diplomatist understood the difficulties of such a proceeding a good deal more than those who had propounded it  there was a knock at the door and a footman entered ushering in a visitor  the young lady whom you were expecting sir he announced discreetly  mr harvey rose at once to his feet  my dear penelope he said shaking hands with her this is charming of you  penelope smiled  it seems quite like old times to feel myself at home here once more she declared  mr harvey did not pursue the subject he was perfectly well aware that penelope who had been his first wifes greatest friend had never altogether forgiven him for his somewhat brief period of mourning he drew an easy chair up to the side of his desk and placed a footstool for her  i should not have sent for you he said but i am really and honestly in a dilemma do you know that apart from endless cables washington has favored me with one hundred and forty pages of foolscap all about the events of the week before last  penelope shivered a little  poor dicky she murmured looking away into the fire and to think that it was i who sent him to his death  mr harvey shook his head  no he said i do not think that you need reproach yourself with that as a matter of fact i think that i should have sent dicky in any case he is not so well known as the others or rather he wasnt associated so closely with the embassy and he was constantly at the savoy on his own account if i had believed that there was any danger in the enterprise he continued i should still have sent him he was as strong as a young hercules the hand which twisted that noose around his neck must have been the hand of a magician with fingers of steel  penelope shivered again her face showed signs of distress  i do not think she said that i am a nervous person but i cannot bear to think of it even now  naturally mr harvey answered we were all fond of dicky and such a thing has never happened so far as i am aware in any european country my own private secretary murdered in broad daylight and with apparent impunity  murderedand robbed she whispered looking up at him with a white face  the frown on the ambassadors forehead darkened  not only that he declared but the secrets of which he was robbed have gone to the one country interested in the knowledge of them  you are sure of that she asked hoarsely  i am sure of it mr harvey answered  penelope drew a little breath between her teeth her thoughts flashed back to a recent dinner party the prince was once more at her side almost she could hear his voicelow clear and yet with that note of inexpressible convincing finality she heard him speak of his country reverently almost prayerfully of the sacrifices which true patriotism must always demand what had been in his mind she wondered at the back of his inscrutable eyes gazing even at that moment past the banks of flowers across the crowded room with all its splendor of light and color through the wallswhither she brushed the thought away it was absurd incredible she was allowing herself to be led away by her old distrust of this man  i remarked just now mr harvey continued that such a thing had never happened so far as i was aware in any european country my own words seem to suggest something to me these methods are not european they savor more of the east  i think you had better go on she said quietly there is something in your mind i can see that you have told me so much that you had better tell me the rest  the contents of those despatches mr harvey continued intrusted in duplicate as you have doubtless surmised to fynes and to coulson contained an assurance that the sending of our fleet to the pacific was in fact as well as in appearance an errand of peace it was a demonstration pure and simple behind it there may have lain indeed a masterful purpose the determination of a great country to affirm her strenuous existence in a manner most likely to impress the nations unused to seeing her in such a role it became necessary in view of certain suspicions for me to be able to prove to the government here the absolutely pacific nature of our great enterprise those despatches contained such proof and now listen penelope before the murder of poor dicky vanderpole we know for a fact that a great nation who chooses to consider herself our enemy in eastern waters was straining every nerve to prepare for war today those preparations have slackened a great loan has been withdrawn in paris an invitation cabled to our fleet to visit yokohama these things have a plain reading  plain indeed penelope assented and she spoke in a low tone because there was fear in her heart why have you told me about them they throw a new light upon everythingan awful light  i have known you the ambassador said quietly since you were a baby every member of your family has been a friend of mine you come of a silent race i know very well that you are a person of discretion there are certain small ways in which a government can occasionally be served by the help of some one outside its diplomatic service altogether some one who could not possibly be connected with it you know this very well penelope because you have already been of service to us on more than one occasion  it was a long time ago she murmured  not so very long he reminded her but for the first of these tragedies fynes despatches would have reached me through you i am going to ask your help even once more  in the somewhat cold spring sunlight which came streaming through the large window penelope seemed a little pallid as though indeed the fatigue of the season even in this its earlier stages were leaving its mark upon her there were violet rims under her eyes a certain alertness seemed to have deserted her usually piquant face she sat listening with the air of one half afraid who has no hope of hearing pleasant things  it has been remarked mr harvey continued or rather i may say that i myself have noticed that you are on exceedingly friendly terms with a very distinguished nobleman who is at present visiting this countryi mean of course prince maiyo  her eyebrows were slowly elevated was that really the impression people had her lips just moved  well she asked  i have met prince maiyo myself mr harvey continued and i have found him a charming representative of his race i am not going to say a word against him if he were an american we should be proud of him if he belonged to any other country we should accept him at once for what he appears to be unfortunately however he belongs to a country which we have some reason to mistrust he belongs to a country in whose national character we have not absolute confidence for that reason my dear penelope we mistrust prince maiyo  i do not know him so well as you seem to imagine penelope said slowly we are not even friends in the ordinary acceptation of the word i am to some extent prejudiced against him yet i do not believe that he is capable of a dishonorable action  nor do i the ambassador declared smoothly yet in every country almost in every man the exact standard of dishonor varies a man will lie for a womans sake and even in the law courts certainly at his clubs and amongst his friends it will be accounted to his righteousness a patriot will lie and intrigue for his countrys sake now i believe that to prince maiyo japan stands far above the whole world of womankind i believe that for her sake he would go to very great lengths indeed  go on please penelope murmured  the prince is over here on some sort of an errand which it isnt our business to understand mr harvey said i have heard it rumored that it is a special mission entirely concerned with the renewal of the treaty between england and japan however that may be i have sat here and i have thought and i have come to this conclusion ridiculous though it may seem to you at first i believe that somewhere behind the hand which killed and robbed hamilton fynes and poor dicky stood the benevolent shadow of our friend prince maiyo  you have no proof she asked breathlessly  no proof at all the ambassador admitted i am scarcely in a position to search for any the conclusion i have come to has been simply arrived at through putting a few facts together and considering them in the light of certain events in the first place we cannot doubt that the secret of those despatches reached at once the very people whom we should have preferred to remain in ignorance of them havent i told you of the sudden cessation of the war alarm in japan when once she was assured by means which she could not mistrust that it was not the intention of the american nation to make war upon her the subtlety of those murders and the knowledge by which they were inspired must have come from some one in an altogether unique position you may be sure that no one connected with the japanese embassy here would be permitted for one single second to take part in any such illegal act they know better than that these wily orientals they will play the game from grosvenor place right enough but prince maiyo is here and stands apart from any accredited institution although he has the confidence of his ambassador and can command the entire devotion of his own secret service i have not come to this conclusion hastily i have thought it out step by step and in my own mind i am now absolutely convinced that both these murders were inspired by prince maiyo  even if this were so penelope said what can i do why have you sent for me the prince and i are not on especially friendly terms it is only just lately that we have been decently civil to one another  the ambassador looked at her with some surprise  my dear penelope he said i have seen you together the last three or four evenings the prince looks at no one else while you are there he talks to you i know more freely than to any other woman  it is by chance penelope protested i have tried to avoid him  then i cannot congratulate you upon your success mr harvey said grimly  things have changed a little between us perhaps penelope said what is it that you really want  i want to know this the ambassador said slowly i want to know how japan became assured that america had no intention of going to war with her in other words i want to know whether those papers which were stolen from fynes and poor dicky found their way to the japanese embassy or into the hands of prince maiyo himself  anything else she asked with a faint note of sarcasm in her tone  yes mr harvey replied there is something else i should like to know what attitude prince maiyo takes towards the proposed renewal of the treaty between his country and great britain  she shook her head  even if we were friends she said the very closest of friends he would never tell me he is far too clever  do not be too sure mr harvey said sometimes a man especially an oriental who does not understand the significance of your sex in these matters can be drawn on to speak more freely to a woman than he would ever dream of doing to his best friend he would not tell you in as many words of course on the other hand he might show you what was in his mind  he is going back very shortly penelope remarked  mr harvey nodded  that is why i sent for you to come immediately you will see him tonight at devenham house  with all the rest of the world she answered but a man is not likely to talk confidentially under such conditions  mr harvey rose to his feet  it is only a chance of course he admitted but remember that you know more than any other person in this country except myself it would be impossible for the prince to give you credit for such knowledge a casual remark a word perhaps may be sufficient  penelope held out her hand the servant for whom the ambassador had rung was already in the room  i will try she promised ask mrs harvey to excuse my going up to see her this afternoon i have another call to make and i want to rest before the function tonight  the ambassador bowed and escorted her to the door  i have confidence in you penelope he said you will try your best  oh yes she answered with a queer little laugh i shall do that but i dont think that even you quite understand prince maiyo    chapter xii penelope intervenes  the perfume of countless roses the music of the finest band in europe floated through the famous white ballroom of devenham house electric lights sparkled from the ceiling through the pillared way the ceaseless splashing of water from the fountains in the winter garden seemed like a soft undernote to the murmur of voices the musical peals of laughter the swirl of skirts and the rhythm of flying feet  penelope stood upon the edge of the ballroom her hand resting still upon her partners arm she wore a dress of dull rosecolor a soft clinging silk which floated about her as she danced a creation of paquins daring but delightful her eyes were very full and soft she was looking her best and knew it nevertheless she was just at the moment a little distrait she was watching the brilliant scene with a certain air of abstraction as though her interest in it was after all an impersonal thing  jolly well every one looks tonight her partner who was sir charles remarked all the women seem to be wearing smart frocks and some of those foreign uniforms are gorgeous  even the prince penelope said thoughtfully must find some reflection of the philosophy of his own country in such a scene as this for the last fortnight we have been surfeited with horrors we have had to go through all sorts of nameless things she added shivering slightly and tonight we dance at devenham house we dance and drink champagne and marvel at the flowers as though we had not a care in the world as though life moved always to music  sir charles frowned a little  the prince again he said half protesting he seems to be a great deal in your thoughts lately penelope  why not she answered it is something to meet a person whom one is able to dislike nowadays the whole world is so amiable  i wonder how much you really do dislike him he said  she looked at him with a mysterious smile  sometimes she murmured softly i wonder that myself  leaving the prince out of the question he continued what you say is true enough only a few days ago you had to attend that awful inquest and the last time i saw dear old dicky vanderpole he was looking forward to this very dance  it seems callous of us to have come penelope declared and yet if we hadnt what difference would it have made every one else would have been here our absence would never have been noticed and we should have sat at home and had the blues but all the same life is cruel  cant say i find much to grumble at myself sir charles said cheerfully im frightfully sorry about poor old dicky of course and every other decent fellow who doesnt get his show but after all its no good being morbid sackcloth and ashes benefit no one shall we have another turn  not yet penelope replied wait till the crowd thins a little tell me what you have been doing today  pretty strenuous time sir charles remarked up at nine played golf at ranelagh all morning lunched down there back to my rooms and changed called on my tailor went round to the club had one game of billiards and four rubbers of bridge  is that all penelope asked  the faint sarcasm which lurked beneath her question passed unnoticed sir charles smiled goodhumoredly  not quite he answered i dined at the carlton with bellairs and some men from woolwich and we had a box at the empire to see the new ballet jolly good it was too will you come one night if i get up a party  oh perhaps she answered come and dance  they passed into the great ballroom the finest in london brilliant with its magnificent decorations of real flowers its crowd of uniformed men and beautiful women its soft yet everpresent throbbing of wonderful music at the further end of the room on a slightly raised dais still receiving her guests stood the duchess of devenham penelope gave a little start as they saw who was bowing over her hand  the prince she exclaimed  sir charles whispered something a little under his breath  i wonder she remarked with apparent irrelevance whether he dances  shall i go and find out for you sir charles asked  she had suddenly grown absent she had the air of scarcely hearing what he said  let us stop she said i am out of breath  he led her toward the winter garden they sat by a fountain listening to the cool play of the water  penelope somerfield said a little awkwardly i dont want to presume you know nor to have you think that i am foolishly jealous but you have changed towards me the last few weeks havent you  the last few weeks she answered have been enough to change me toward any one all the same i wasnt conscious of anything particular so far as you are concerned  i always thought he continued after a moments hesitation that there was so much prejudice in your country againstagainst all asiatic races  she looked at him steadfastly for a minute  so there is she answered what of it  nothing except that it is a prejudice which you do not seem to share he remarked  in a way i do share it she declared but there are exceptions sometimes very wonderful exceptions  prince maiyo for instance he said bitterly yet a fortnight ago i could have sworn that you hated him  i think that i do hate him penelope affirmed i try to i want to i honestly believe that he deserves my hatred i have more reason for feeling this way than you know of sir charles  if he has dared somerfield began  he has dared nothing that he ought not to penelope interrupted his manners are altogether too perfect it is the chill faultlessness of the man which is so depressing cant you understand she added speaking in a tone of greater intensity that that is why i hate him hush  she gripped his sleeve warningly there was suddenly the murmur of voices and the trailing of skirts a little party seemed to have invaded the winter gardena little party of the principal guests the duchess herself came first and her fingers were resting upon the arm of prince maiyo she stopped to speak to penelope and turned afterwards to somerfield prince maiyo held out his hand for penelopes programme  you will spare me some dances he pleaded i come late but it is not my fault  she yielded the programme to him without a word  those with an x she said are free one has to protect oneself  he smiled as he wrote his own name unrebuked in four places  our first dance then is number 10 he said it is the next but one i shall find you here perhaps  here or amongst the chaperons she answered as they passed on  you admire miss morse the duchess asked him  greatly the prince answered she is natural she has grace and she has what i do not find so much in this countrywould you say charm  it is an excellent word the duchess answered i am inclined to agree with you her aunt with whom she lives is a confirmed invalid so she is a good deal with me her mother was my halfsister  the prince bowed  she will marry i suppose he said  naturally the duchess answered sir charles poor fellow is a hopeless victim i should not be surprised if she married him some day or other  the prince looked behind for a moment then he stopped to admire a magnificent orchid  it will be great good fortune for sir charles somerfield he said  somerfield scarcely waited until the little party were out of sight  penelope he exclaimed youve given that man four dances  i am afraid she answered that i should have given him eight if he had asked for them  he rose to his feet  will you allow me to take you back to your aunt he asked  no she answered my aunt is quite happy without me and i should prefer to remain here  he sat down fuming  penelope what do you mean by it he demanded  and what do you mean by asking me what i mean by it she replied you havent any especial right that i know of  i wish to heaven i had he answered with a noticeable break in his voice  there was a short silence she turned away she felt that she was suddenly surrounded by a cloud of passion  penelope he pleaded  she stopped him  you must not say another word she declared i mean ityou must not  i have waited for some time he reminded her  all the more reason why you should wait until the right time she insisted be patient for a little longer do just now i feel that i need a friend more than i have ever needed one before dont let me lose the one i value most in a few weeks time you shall say whatever you like and at any rate i will listen to you will you be content with that  yes he answered  she laid her fingers upon his arm  i am dancing this with captain wilmot she said will you come and bring me back here afterwards unless you are engaged  the prince found her alone in the winter garden for somerfield when he had seen him coming had stolen away he came towards her quickly with the smooth yet impetuous step which singled him out at once as unenglish he had the whole room to cross to come to her and she watched him all the way the corners of his lips were already curved in a slight smile his eyes were bright as one who looks upon something which he greatly desires slender though his figure was his frame was splendidly knit and he carried himself as one of the aristocrats of the world as he approached she scanned his face curiously she became critical anxiously but ineffectively there was not a feature in his face with which a physiognomist could have found fault  dear young lady he said bowing low i come to you very humbly for i am afraid that i am a deceiver i shall rob you of your pleasure i fear i have put my name down for four dances and alas i do not dance  she made room for him by her side  and i she said am weary of dancing one does nothing else night after night we will talk  talk or be silent he answered softly myself i believe that you are in need of silence to be silent together is a proof of great friendship is it not  she nodded  it seems to me that i have been through so much the last fortnight she said  you have suffered where you should not have suffered he assented gravely i do not like your laws at all at what they called the inquest your presence was surely not necessary you were a woman and had no place there you had he added calmly so little to tell  nothing she murmured  life to me just now he continued is so much a matter of comparison it is for that indeed that i am here you see i have lived nearly all my life in my own country and only a very short time in europe then my mother was an english lady and my father a japanese nobleman always i seem to be pulled two different ways to be struggling to see things from two different points of view but there is one subject in which i think i am wholly with my own country  and that she asked  i do not think he said that the rougher and more strenuous paths of life were meant to be trodden by your sex please do not misunderstand me he went on earnestly i am not thinking of the paths of literature and of art for there the perceptions of your sex are so marvellously acute that you indeed may often lead where we must follow i am speaking of the more material things of life  she was suddenly conscious of a shiver which seemed to spread from her heart throughout her limbs she sat quite still gripping her little lace handkerchief in her fingers  i mean he continued the paths which a man must tread who seeks to serve his country or his householdthe everyday life in which sometimes intrigue or force is necessary do you agree with me miss morse  i suppose so she faltered  that is why he added it was painful to me to see you stand there before those men answering their questionsmen whose walk in life was different of an order removed from yours who should not even have been permitted to approach you upon bended knees do not think that i am suggesting any fault to youdo not think that i am forcing your confidence in any way but these are the thoughts which came to me only a little time ago  she was silent they listened together to the splashing of the water what was the special gift she wondered which gave this man such insight she felt her heart beating she was conscious that he was looking at her he knew already that it was through her medium that those despatches which never reached london were to have been handed on to their destination he must know that she was to some extent in the confidence of her countrys ambassador perhaps he knew too those other thoughts which were in her mindknew that it had been her deliberate intent to deceive him to pluck those secrets which he carried with him even from his heart what a fool she had been to dream for a moment of measuring her wits against his  he began to speak again and his voice seemed pitched in lighter key  after all he said you must think it strange of me to be so egotisticalto speak all the time so much of my likes and dislikes to you i have been a little more outspoken than to others  you have found me an interesting subject for investigation perhaps she asked looking up suddenly  you possess gifts he admitted calmly which one does not find amongst the womenfolk of my country nor can i say that i have found them to any extent amongst the ladies of the english court  gifts of which you do not approve when possessed by my sex she suggested  you are a law to yourself miss morse he said what one would not admire in others seems natural enough in you you have brains and you have insight for that reason i have been with you a little outspokenfor that reason and another which i think you know of you see my time over here grows nearer to an end with every day soon i must carry away with me over the seas all the delightful memories the friendships the affections which have made this country such a pleasant place for me  you are going soon she asked quickly  very soon he answered my work is nearly finished if indeed i may dignify it by the name of work then i must go back  she shrank a little away from him as though the word were distasteful to her  do you mean that you will go back for always she asked  there are many chances in life he answered i am the servant of the emperor and my country  there is no hope then she continued of your settling down here altogether  for once the marble immobility of his features seemed disturbed he looked at her in honest amazement  here he exclaimed but i am a son of japan  there are many of your race who do live here she reminded him  he smiled with the air of one who is forced to humor a person of limited vision  with them it is alas a matter of necessity he said it is very hard indeed to make you understand over here how we feel about such thingsthere seems to be a different spirit amongst you western races a different spirit or a lack of spiriti do not know which i should say but in japan the love of our country is a passion which seems to throb with every beat of our hearts if we leave her it is for her good when we go back it is our reward  then you are here now for her good she asked  assuredly he answered  tell me in what way she begged you have been studying english customs their methods of education their political life perhaps  he turned his head slowly and looked into her eyes she bore the ordeal well but she never forgot it it seemed to her afterwards that he must have read every thought which had flashed through her brain she felt like a little child in the presence of some mysterious being thoughts of whom had haunted her dreams now visible in bodily shape for the first time  my dear young lady he said please do not ask me too much for i love to speak the truth and there are many things which i may not tell only you must understand that the country i lovemy own countrymust enter soon upon a new phase of her history we who look into the future can see the great clouds gathering some of us must needs be pioneers must go forward a little to learn our safest and best course may i tell you that much  of course she answered softly  and now he added leaving his seat as though with reluctance the duchess reminded me above all things that directly i found you i was to take you to supper one of your royal princes has been good enough to signify his desire that we should sit at the same table  she rose at once  does the duchess know that you are taking me she asked  i arranged it with her he answered my time draws soon to an end and i am to be spoilt a little  they crossed the ballroom together and mounted the great stairs somethingshe never knew quite what it wasprompted her to detain him as they paused on the threshold of the supper room  you do not often read the papers prince she said perhaps you have not seen that after all the police have discovered a clue to the hamilton fynes murder  the prince looked down upon her for a moment without reply  yes he murmured softly  she understood that she was to go onthat he was anxious for her to go on  some little doctor in a village near willington where the line passes has come forward with a story about attending to a wounded man on the night of the murder she said  he was very silent it seemed to her that there was something strange about the immovability of his features she looked at him wonderingly then it suddenly flashed upon her that this was his way of showing emotion her lips parted the color seemed drawn from her cheeks the majordomo of the duchess stood before them with a bow  her grace desires me to show your highness to your seats he announced  prince maiyo turned to his companion  will you allow me to precede you through the crush he said we are to go this way    chapter xiii east and west  after the supper there were obligations which the prince whose sense of etiquette was always strong could not avoid he took penelope back to her aunt reminding her that the next dance but one belonged to him miss morse who was an invalid and was making one of her very rare appearances in society watched him curiously as he disappeared  i wonder what theyd think of your new admirer in new york penelope she remarked  i imagine penelope answered that they would envy me very much  miss morse who was a new englander of the oldfashioned type opened her lips but something in her nieces face restrained her  well at any rate she said i hope we dont go to war with them the admiral wrote me a few weeks ago that he saw no hope for anything else  it would be a terrible complication the duchess sighed especially considering our own alliance with japan i dont think we need consider it seriously however over in america you people have too much common sense  the government have very likely miss morse admitted but it isnt always the government who decide things or who even rule the country we have an omnipotent press you know all thats wanted is a weak president and heaven knows where we should be  of course the duchess remarked prince maiyo is half an englishman his mother was a strettonwynne one of the first intermarriages i should think lord strettonwynne was ambassador to japan  i think said penelope that if you could look into prince maiyos heart you would not find him half an englishman i think that he is more than seveneighths a japanese  i have heard it whispered the duchess remarked leaning forward that he is over here on an exceedingly serious mission one thing is quite certain no one from his country or from any other country for that matter has ever been so entirely popular amongst us he has the most delightful manners of any man i ever knew of any race  sir charles came up with gloomy face to claim a dance after it was over he led penelope back to her aunt almost in silence  you are dancing again with the prince he asked  certainly she answered here he comes  the prince smiled pleasantly at the young man who towered like a giant above him and noticed at once his lack of cordiality  i am selfish he exclaimed pausing with penelopes hand upon his coat sleeve i am taking you too much away from your friends and spoiling your pleasure perhaps because i do not dance is it not so it is your kindness to a stranger and they do not all appreciate it  we will go into the winter garden and talk it over she answered smiling  they found their old seats unoccupied once more they sat and listened to the fall of the water  prince said penelope there is one thing i have learned about you this evening and that is that you do not love questions and yet there is one other which i should like to ask you  if you please the prince murmured  you spoke a little time ago she continued of some great crisis with which your country might soon come face to face might i ask you this were you thinking of war with the united states  he looked at her in silence for several moments  dear miss penelope he saidmay i call you that forgive me if i am too forward but i hear so many of our friends  you may call me that she interrupted softly  let me remind you then of what we were saying a little time ago he went on you will not take offence you will understand i am sure those things that lie nearest to my heart concerning my country are the things of which i cannot speak  not even to me she pleaded i am so insignificant surely i do not count  miss penelope he said you yourself are a daughter of that country of which we have been speaking  she was silent  you think then she asked that i put my country before everything else in the world  i believe he answered that you would your country is too young to be wholly degenerate it is true that you are a nation of fused racesa strange medley of people but still you are a nation i believe that in time of stress you would place your country before everything else  and therefore she murmured  and therefore he continued with a delightful smile i shall not discuss my hopes or fears with you or if we do discuss them he went on let us weave them into a fairy tale let us say that you are indeed the daughter of all america and that i am the son of all japan you know what happens in fairyland when two great nations rise up to fight  tell me she begged  why the daughter of all america and the son of all japan stand hand in hand before their people and as they plight their troth all bitter feelings pass away the shouts of anger cease and there is no more talk of war  she sighed and leaned a little towards him her eyes were soft and dusky her red lips a little parted  but i she whispered am not the daughter of all america  nor am i he answered with a sigh the son of all japan  there was a breathless silence the water splashed into the basin the music came throbbing in through the flowerhung doorways it seemed to penelope that she could almost hear her heart beat the blood in her veins was dancing to the one perfect waltz the moments passed she drew a little breath and ventured to look at him his face was still and white as though indeed it had been carved out of marble but the fire in his eyes was a living thing  we have actually been talking nonsense she said and i thought that you prince were far too serious  we were talking fairy tales he answered and they are not nonsense do not you ever read the history of your country as it was many hundreds of years ago before this ugly thing they call civilization weakened the sinews of our race and besmirched the very face of duty do you not like to read of the times when life was simpler and more natural and there was space for every man to live and grow and stretch out his hands to the skiesevery man and every woman they call them in your literature the days of romance they existed too in my country it is not nonsense to imagine for a little time that the ages between have rolled away and that those days are with us  no she answered it is not nonsense but if they were  he raised her fingers to his lips and kissed them the touch of his hand the absolute delicacy of the salute itself made it unlike any other caress she had ever known or imagined  the world might have been happier for both of us he whispered  somerfield sullen and discontented came and looked at them moved away and then hesitatingly returned  willmott is waiting for you he said the last was my dance and this is his  she rose at once and turned to the prince  i think that we should go back she said will you take me to my aunt  if it must be so he answered tell me miss penelope he added may i ask your aunt or the duchess to bring you one day to my house to see my treasures i cannot say how long i shall remain in this country i would like you so much to come before i break up my little home  of course we will she answered my aunt goes nowhere but the duchess will bring me i am sure ask her when i am there and we can agree about the day  he leaned a little towards her  tomorrow he whispered  she nodded there were three engagements for the next day of which she took no heed  tomorrow she said come and let us arrange it with the duchess  prince maiyo left devenham house to find the stars paling in the sky and the light of an april dawn breaking through the black clouds eastwards he dismissed his electric brougham with a little wave of the hand and turned to walk to his house in st jamess square as he walked he bared his head after the long hours of artificially heated rooms there was something particularly soothing about the fresh sweetness of the early spring morning there was something it seemed to him which reminded him however faintly of the mornings in his own landthe perfume of the flowers from the windowboxes perhaps the absence of that hideous roar of traffic or the faint aromatic scent from the lime trees in the park heavy from recent rain it was the quietest hour of the twentyfourthe hour almost of dawn the night wayfarers had passed away the great army of toilers as yet slumbered one sadeyed woman stumbled against him as he walked slowly up piccadilly he lifted his hat with an involuntary gesture and her laugh changed into a sob he turned round and emptied his pockets of silver into her hand hurrying away quickly that his eyes might not dwell upon her face  a coward always he murmured to himself a little wearily for he knew where his weakness layan invincible repugnance to the ugly things of life as he passed on however his spirits rose again he caught a breath of lilac scent from a closed florists shop he looked up to the skies over the housetops faintly blue growing clearer every moment almost he fancied that he looked again into the eyes of this strange girl recalled her unexpected yet delightful frankness which to him with his love of abstract truth was after all so fascinating oh there was much to be said for this western worldmuch to be said for those whose part it was to live in it yet never so much as during that brief night walk through the silent streets did he realize how absolutely unfitted he was to be even a temporary sojourner in this vast city what would they say of him if they knewof him a breaker of their laws a guest and yet a sinner against all their conventions a guest and yet one whose hand it was which would strike them some day or other the great blow what would she think of him he wondered whether she would realize the truth whether she would understand almost as he asked himself the question he smiled to him it seemed a strange proof of the danger in which a weaker man would stand of passing under the yoke of this hateful western civilization to dream of heryes to see her face shining upon him from every beautiful place to feel the delight of her presence with every delicious sensationthe warmth of the sunlight the perfume of the blossoms he loved there was joy in this the joy of the artist and the lover but to find her in his life a real person a daughter of this new world whose every instinct would be at war with histhat way lay slavery he brushed the very thought from him  as he reached the door of his house in st james square it opened slowly before him he had brought his own servants from his own country and in their masters absence sleep was not for them his butler spoke to him in his own language the prince nodded and passed on on his study tablea curious note of modernism where everything seemed to belong to a bygone worldwas a cablegram he tore it open it consisted of one word only he let the thin paper fall fluttering from his fingers so the time was fixed  then soto came gliding noiselessly into the room fully dressed with tireless eyes but wan facesoto the prototype of his master the most perfect secretary and servant evolved through all the years  master he said there has been trouble here an englishman came with this card  the prince took it and read the name of inspector jacks  well he murmured  the man asked questions soto continued we spoke english so badly that he was puzzled he went away but he will come again  the prince smiled and laid his hand almost caressingly upon the others shoulder  it is of no consequence soto he saidno consequence whatever    chapter xiv an engagement  your rooms prince are wonderful penelope said to him i knew that you were a man of taste but i did not know that you were also a millionaire  he laughed softly  in my country he answered there are no millionaires the money which we have however we spend perhaps a little differently but indeed none of my treasures here have cost me anything they have come to me through more generations than i should care to reckon up the bronze idol for instance upon my writing case is four hundred years old to my certain knowledge and my tapestries were woven when in this country your walls went bare  what i admire more than anything the duchess declared is your beautiful violet tone  i am glad he answered that you like my coloring some people have thought it sombre to me dark colors indoors are restful  everything about the whole place is restful penelope saidyour servants with their quaint dresses and slippered feet your thick carpets the smell of those strange burning leaves and forgive me if i say so your closed windows i suppose in time i should have a headache for a little while it is delicious  the prince sighed  fresh air is good he said but the air that comes from your streets does not seem to me to be fresh nor do i like the roar of your great city always in my ears here i cut myself off and i feel that i can think duchess you must try those preserved fruits they come to me from my own land i think that the secret of preserving them is not known here you see they are packed with rose leaves and lemon plant there is a golden fig miss penelopethe fruit of great knowledge the magical fruit too they say eat that and close your eyes and you can look back and tell us all the wonders of the past that is to say he added with a faint smile if the magic works  but the magic never does work she protested with a little sigh and i am not in the least interested in the past tell me something about the future  surely that is easier he answered over the past we have lost our controlwhat has been must remain to the end of time the future is ours to do what we will with  that sounds so reasonable the duchess declared and it is so absolutely false no one can do what they will with the future it is the future which does what it will with us  the prince smiled tolerantly  it depends a good deal does it not he said upon ourselves miss penelope is the daughter of a country which is still young which has all its future before it and which has proclaimed to the world its fixed intention of controlling its own destinies she at any rate should have imbibed the national spirit you are looking at my curtains he added turning to penelope let me show you the figures upon them and i will tell you the allegory  he led her to the window and explained to her for some moments the story of the faded images which represented one chapter out of the mythology of his country and then she stopped him  always she said you and i seem to be talking of things that are dead and past or of a future which is out of our reach isnt it possible to speak now and then of the present  of the actual present he asked softly of this very moment  of this very moment if you will she answered your fairy tale the other night was wonderful but it was a long way off  the prince was summoned away somewhat abruptly to bid farewell to a little stream of departing guests today more than ever he seemed to belong indeed to the world of real and actual things for a cousin of his mothers a lady strettonwynne was helping him receive his guestshis own aunt as penelope told herself more than once struggling all the time with a vague incredulity when he was able to rejoin her she was examining a curious little coffer which stood upon an ivory table  show me the mystery of this lock she begged i have been trying to open it ever since you went away one could imagine that the secrets of a nation might be hidden here  he smiled and taking the box from her hands touched a little spring almost at once the lid flew open  i am afraid he said that it is empty  she peered in  no she exclaimed there is something there see she thrust in her hand and drew out a small curiously shaped dagger of fine blue steel and a roll of silken cord she held them up to him  what are these she asked are they symbolsthe cord and the knife of destiny  he took them gently from her hand and replaced them in the box she heard the lock go with a little click and looked into his face surprised at his silence  is there anything the matter she asked ought i not to have taken them up  almost as the words left her lips she understood his face was inscrutable but his very silence was ominous she remembered a drawing in one of the halfpenny papers the drawing of a dagger found in a horrible place she remembered the description of that thin silken cord and she began to tremble  i did not know that anything was in the box he said calmly i am sorry if its contents have alarmed you  she scarcely heard his words the room seemed wheeling round with her the floor unsteady beneath her feet the atmosphere of the place had suddenly become horriblethe faint odor of burning leaves the pictures almost like caricatures which mocked her from the walls the grinning idols the strangely shaped weapons in their cases of black oak she faltered as she crossed the room but recovered herself  aunt she said if you are ready i think that we ought to go  the duchess was more than ready she rose promptly the prince walked with them to the door and handed them over to his majordomo  it has been so nice of you he said to the duchess to honor my bachelor abode i shall often think of your visit  my dear prince the duchess declared it has been most interesting really i found it hard to believe in that charming room of yours that we had not actually been transported to your wonderful country  you are very gracious the prince answered bowing low  penelopes hands were within her muff she was talking some nonsenseshe scarcely knew what but her eyes rested everywhere save on the face of her host somehow or other she reached the door ran down the steps and threw herself into a corner of the brougham then for the first time she allowed herself to look behind the door was already closed but between the curtains which his hands had drawn apart prince maiyo was standing in the room which they had just quitted and there was something in the calm impassivity of his white stern face which seemed to madden her she clenched her hands and looked away  really i was not so much bored as i had feared the duchess remarked composedly that strettonwynne woman generally gets on my nerves but her nephew seemed to have a restraining effect upon her she didnt tell me more than once about her husbands bad luck in not getting canada and she never even mentioned her girls but i do think penelope she continued that i shall have to talk to you a little seriously theres the bestlooking and richest young bachelor in london dying to marry you and you wont have a word to say to him on the other hand after starting by disliking him heartily you are making yourself almost conspicuous with this fascinating young oriental i admit that he is delightful my dear penelope but i think you should ask yourself whether it is quite worth while prince maiyo may take home with him many western treasures but i do not think that he will take home a wife  if you say another word to me aunt penelope exclaimed i shall shriek  the duchess being a woman of tact laughed the subject away and pretended not to notice penelopes real distress but when they had reached devenham house she went to the telephone and called up somerfield  charlie she said  right o he interrupted who is it  be careful what you are saying she continued because it isnt any one who wants you to take them out to supper  i only wish you did he answered its the duchess isnt it  the worst of having a distinctive voice she sighed listen i want to speak to you  i am listening hard somerfield answered hold the instrument a little further away from youthats better   we have been to the princes for tea this afternoonpenelope and i she said  i know he assented i was asked but i didnt see the fun of it it puts my back up to see penelope monopolized by that fellow he added gloomily  well listen to what i have to say the duchess went on something happened therei dont know whatto upset penelope very much she never spoke a word coming home and she has gone straight up to her room and locked herself in somehow or other the prince managed to offend her i am sure of that charlie  im beastly sorry somerfield answered i meant to say that i was jolly glad to hear it  the duchess coughed  i didnt quite hear what you said before she said severely perhaps it is just as well i rang up to say that you had better come round and dine with us tonight you will probably find penelope in a more reasonable frame of mind  awfully good of you somerfield declared heartily ill come with pleasure  dinner at devenham house that evening was certainly a domestic meal even the duke was away attending a political gathering penelope was pale but otherwise entirely her accustomed self she talked even more than usual and though she spoke of a headache she declined all remedies to somerfields surprise she made not the slightest objection when he followed her into the library after dinner  penelope he said something has gone wrong wont you tell me what it is you look worried  she returned his anxious gaze dryeyed but speechless  has that fellow prince maiyo done or said anything  she interrupted him  no she cried no dont mention his name please i dont want to hear his name again just now  for my part somerfield said bitterly i never want to hear it again as long as i live  there was a short silence suddenly she turned towards him  charlie she said you have asked me to marry you six times  seven he corrected i ask you again nowthat makes eight  very well she answered i accepton one condition  on any he exclaimed his voice trembling with joy penelope it sounds too good to be true you cant be in earnest  i am she declared i will marry you if you will see that our engagement is announced everywhere tomorrow and that you do not ask me for anything at all mind not evennot anythingfor three months time at least promise that until then you will not let me hear the sound of the word marriage  i promise he said firmly penelope you mean it you mean this seriously  she gave him her hands and a very sad little smile  i mean it charlie she answered i will keep my word    chapter xv penelope explains  once more penelope found herself in the library of the great house in park lane where mr blaineharvey presided over the interests of his country this time she came as an uninvited even an unexpected guest the ambassador indeed had been fetched away by her urgent message from the reception rooms where his wife was entertaining a stream of callers penelope refused to sit down  i have not much to say to you mr harvey she said there is just something which i have discovered and which you ought to know i want to tell it you as quickly as possible and get away  a propos of our last conversation he asked eagerly  she bowed her head  it concerns prince maiyo she admitted  you are sure that you will not sit down he persisted you know how interesting this is to me  she smiled faintly  to me she said it is terrible my only desire is to tell you and have finished with it you remember when i was here last you told me that it was your firm belief that somewhere behind the hand which murdered hamilton fynes and poor dicky stood the shadow of prince maiyo  i remember it perfectly he answered  you were right penelope said  the ambassador drew a little breath it was staggering this even if expected  i have talked with the prince several times since our conversation penelope continued so far as any information which he gave me or seemed likely to give me i might as well have talked in a foreign language but in his house the day before yesterday in his own library hidden in a casket which opened only with a secret lock i found two things  what were they the ambassador asked quickly  a roll of silken cord penelope said such as was used to strangle poor dicky and a strangely shaped dagger exactly like the picture of the one with which hamilton fynes was stabbed  did he know that you found them mr blaineharvey asked  he was with me penelope answered he even at my request opened the casket he must have forgotten that they were there  perhaps the ambassador said thoughtfully he never knew  one cannot tell penelope answered  did he say anything when you discovered them the ambassador asked  nothing penelope declared it was not necessary i saw his face he knows that i understand it may have been some one else connected with the house of course but the main fact is beyond all doubt those murders were instigated if they were not committed by the prince  the ambassador walked to the window and back again  penelope he said you have only confirmed what i felt must be so but even then the certainty of it is rather a shock  she gave him her hand  i have told you the truth she said make what use of it you will there is one other thing perhaps which i ought to tell you the prince is going back to his own country very shortly  mr harvey nodded  i have just been given to understand as much he said at present he is to be met with every day i believe that he is even now in my drawing rooms  where i ought to be penelope said turning toward the door only i felt that i must see you first  i will not come with you mr harvey said there is no need for our little conference to become the subject of comment by the bye he added let me take this opportunity of wishing you every happiness i havent seen somerfield yet but he is a lucky fellow as an american however i cannot help grudging another of our most popular daughters to even the best of englishmen  penelopes smile was a little forced  thank you very much she said it is all rather in the air at present you know we are not going to be married for some time  when it comes off the ambassador said i am going to talk to the duchess and miss morse i think that i ought to give you away  penelope made her way into mrs blaineharveys reception rooms crowded with a stream of guests who were sitting about drinking tea and listening to the music passing in and out all the time curiously enough almost the first person whom she saw was the prince he detached himself from a little group and came at once towards her he took her hand in his and for a moment said nothing notwithstanding the hours of strenuous consideration the hours which she had devoted to anticipating and preparing for this meeting she felt her courage suddenly leaving her a sinking at the knees a wild desire to escape at any cost the color which had been so long denied her streamed into her cheeks there was something baffling yet curiously disturbing in the manner of his greeting  is it true he asked  she did not pretend to misunderstand him it was amazing that he should ignore that other tragical incident that he should think of nothing but this yet in a way she accepted it as a natural thing  it is true that i am engaged to sir charles somerfield she answered  i must wish you every happiness he said slowly indeed that wish comes from my heart and i think that you know it as for sir charles somerfield i cannot imagine that he has anything left in the world to wish for  you are a born courtier prince she murmured please remember that in my democratic country one has never had a chance of getting used to such speeches  your country he remarked prides itself upon being the country where truth prevails if so you should have become accustomed by now to hearing pleasant things about yourself so you are going to marry sir charles somerfield  why do you say that over to yourself so doubtfully she asked you know who he is do you not he is rich of old family popular with everybody a great sportsman a mighty hunter these are the things which go to the making of a man are they not  beyond a doubt the prince answered gravely they go to the making of a man it is as you say  you like him personally dont you she asked  sir charles somerfield and i are almost strangers the prince replied i have not seen much of him and he has so many tastes which i cannot share that it is hard for us to come very near together but if you have chosen him it is sufficient i am quite sure that he is all that a man should be  tell me in what respect your tastes are so far apart she asked you say that as though there were something in the manner of his life of which you disapproved  we are sons of different countries miss penelope the prince said we look out upon life differently and the things which seem good to him may well seem idle to me before i go he added a little hesitatingly we may speak of this again but not now  i shall remind you of that promise prince she declared  i will not fail to keep it he replied you have at least he added after a moments pause one great claim upon happiness you are the son and the daughter of kindred races  she looked at him as though not quite understanding  i was thinking he continued simply of my own father and mother my father was a japanese nobleman with the home call of all the centuries strong in his blood he was an enlightened man but he saw nothing in the manner of living or the ideals of other countries to compare with those of the country of his own birth i sometimes think that my mother and father might have been happier had one of them been a little more disposed to yield to the other i think perhaps that their union would have been a more successful one they were married and they lived together but they lived apart  it was not well for you this she remarked  he shrugged his shoulders  do not mistake me he begged so far as i am concerned i am content i am japanese the english blood that is in my veins is but as a drop of water compared to the call of my own country and yet there are some things which have come to me from my motherthings which come most to the surface when i am in this her own countrywhich make life at times a little sad forgive me if i have been led on to speak too much of myself today one should think of nothing but of you and of your happiness  he turned to accept the greeting of an older woman who had lingered for a moment in passing evidently anxious to speak to him penelope watched his kindly air listened to the courteous words which flowed from his lips the interest in his manner which his whole bearing denoted notwithstanding the fact that the woman was elderly and plain and had outlived the friends of her day and received but scanty consideration from the present generation it was typical of him too she realized it was never to the great women of the world that he unbent most thoroughly gray hairs seemed to inspire his respect to command his attentions in a way that youth and beauty utterly failed to do these things seemed suddenly clear to penelope as she stood there watching him a hundred little acts of graceful kindness which she had noticed and admired returned to her memory it was this man whom she had lifted her hand to betray it was this man who was to be accounted guilty even of crime there came a sudden revulsion of feeling the whole mechanical outlook upon life as she had known it seemed even in those few seconds to become a false and meretricious thing whatever he had done or countenanced was right she had betrayed his hospitality she had committed an infamous breach of trust an overwhelming desire came over her to tell him everything she took a quick step forward and found herself face to face with somerfield the prince was buttonholed by some friends and led away the moment had passed  come and talk to the duchess somerfield said she has something delightful to propose    chapter xvi concerning prince maiyo  the duchess looked up from her writing table and nodded to her husband who had just entered  good morning ambrose she said do you want to talk to me  if you can spare me five minutes the duke suggested i dont think that i need keep you longer  the duchess handed her notebook to her secretary who hastened from the room the duke seated himself in her vacant chair  about our little party down in hampshire next week he began  i am waiting to hear from you before i send out any invitations the duchess answered  quite so the duke assented to tell you the truth i dont want anything in the nature of a house party what i should really like would be to get maiyo there almost to ourselves  his wife looked at him in some surprise  you seem particularly anxious to make things pleasant for this young man she remarked if he were the son of the emperor himself no one could do more for him than you people have been doing these last few weeks  the duke of devenham chancellor of the duchy of lancaster whose wife entertained for his party and whose immense income derived mostly from her american relations was always at its disposal was a person almost as important in the councils of his country as the prime minister himself it sometimes occurred to him that the person who most signally failed to realize this fact was the lady who did him the honor to preside over his household  my dear margaret he said you can take my word for it that we know what we are about it is very important indeed that we should keep on friendly terms with this young mani dont mean as a personal matter its a matter of politicsperhaps of something greater even than that  the duchess liked to understand everything and her husbands reticence annoyed her  but we have the japanese ambassador always with us she remarked a most delightful person i call the baron hesho and i am sure he loves us all  that is not exactly the point my dear the duke explained prince maiyo is over here on a special mission we ourselves have only been able to surmise its object with the aid of our secret service in tokio you can rest assured of one thing however it is of vast importance to the interests of this country that we secure his goodwill  the duchess smiled good humoredly  well my dear ambrose she said i dont know what more we can do than feed him properly and give him pleasant people to talk to he doesnt go in for sports does he all i can promise is that we will do our best to be agreeable to him  i am sure of it my dear the duke said you havent committed yourself to asking any one by the bye  not a soul his wife answered except sir charles i had to ask him of course for penelope  naturally the duke assented i am glad penelope will be there i only wish that she were english instead of american and that maiyo would take a serious fancy to her  perhaps the duchess said dryly you would like him to take a fancy to grace  i shouldnt mind in the least her husband declared i never met a young man whom i respected and admired more  nor i for that matter the duchess agreed and yet somehow or other  somehow or other the duke repeated courteously  well i never altogether trust these paragons his wife said in all the ordinary affairs of life the prince seems to reach an almost perfect standard i sometimes wonder whether he would be as trustworthy in the big things nothing else you want to talk about ambrose  nothing at all the duke said rising to his feet i only wanted to make it plain that we dont require a house party next week  i shant ask a soul the duchess answered do you mind ringing the bell as you pass ill have miss smith back again and send these letters off  good the duke declared im going down to the house but i dont suppose therell be anything doing by the bye we shall have to be a little feudal next week japan is a country of many ceremonies and after all maiyo is one of the royal family i have written perkins to stir him up a little  the duke drove down to the house but called first in downing street he found the prime minister anxious to see him  youve arranged about maiyo coming down to you next week he asked  thats all right the duke answered he is coming for certain one good thing about that young manhe never breaks an engagement  the prime minister consulted a calendar which lay open before him  do you mind he asked if i come too and bransome  why of course not the duke replied we shall be delighted we have seventy bedrooms and only half a dozen or so of us but tell meis this young man as important as all that  we shall have to have a serious talk the prime minister said in a few days time i dont think that even you grasp the exact position of affairs as they stand today just now i am bothered to death about other things heseltine has just been in from the home office he is simply inundated with correspondence from america about those two murders  the duke nodded  its an odd thing he remarked that they should both have been americans  heseltine thinks theres something behind this correspondence the prime minister said slowly washington was very secretive about the man fynes identity i found that out from scotland yard do you know im half inclined to think although i cant get a word out of harvey that this man fynes  the prime minister hesitated  well the duke asked a little impatiently  i dont want to go too far his chief said i am making some fresh inquiries and i am hoping to get at the bottom of the matter very shortly one thing is very certain though and that is that no two murders have ever been committed in this city with more coldblooded deliberation and with more of what i should call diabolical cleverness take the affair of poor young vanderpole for instance the person who entered his taxi and killed him must have done so while the vehicle was standing in the middle of the road at one of the three blocks not only that but he must have been a friend or some one posing as a friendsome one at any rate of his own order vanderpole was over six feet high and as muscular as a young bull he could have thrown any one out into the street who had attempted to assault him openly  it is the most remarkable case i ever heard of in my life the duke admitted helping himself to a cigarette from a box which he had just discovered  there is another point the prime minister continued there are features in common about both these murders not only were they both the work of a most accomplished criminal but he must have been possessed of an iron nerve and amazing strength the dagger by which hamilton fynes was stabbed was driven through the middle of his heart the cord with which vanderpole was strangled must have been turned by a wrist of steel no time for a word afterwards mind or before it was a wonderful feat i am not surprised that the americans cant understand it  they dont suggest i suppose the duke asked that we are not trying to clear the matter up  they dont suggest it his chief answered but i cant quite make out whats at the back of their heads however i wont bother you about that now if i were to propound heseltines theory to you you would think that he had been reading the works of some of our enterprising young novelists things will have cleared up i dare say by next week i am coming round to the house for a moment if youre not in a hurry  the duke assented and waited while the secretary locked up the papers which the prime minister had been examining and prepared others to be carried into the house the two men left the place together and the duke pointed toward his brougham  do you mind walking the prime minister said there is another matter id like to talk to you about and theres nowhere better than the streets for a little conversation besides i need the air  with pleasure the duke answered who loathed walking  he directed his coachman to precede them and they started off arm in arm  devenham the prime minister said we were speaking a few minutes ago of prince maiyo i want you to understand this that upon that young man depends entirely the success or failure of my administration  you are serious the duke exclaimed  absolutely the prime minister answered i know quite well what he is here for he is here to make up his mind whether it will pay japan to renew her treaty with us or whether it would be more to her advantage to enter into an alliance with any other european power he has been to most of the capitals in europe he has been here with us by this time he has made up his mind he knows quite well what his report will be yet you cant get a word out of him he is a delightful young fellow i know but he is as clever as any trained diplomatist i have ever come across ive had him to dine with me alone and ive done all that i could to make him talk when he went away i knew just exactly as much as i did before he came  he seems pleased enough with us the duke remarked  i am not so sure the prime minister answered he has travelled about a good deal in england i heard of him in manchester and sheffield newcastle and leicester absolutely unattended i wonder what he was doing there  from my experience of him the duke said i dont think we shall know until he chooses to tell us  i am afraid you are right the prime minister declared at the same time you might just drop a hint to your wife and to that remarkably clever young niece of hers miss penelope morse of course i dont expect that he would unbosom himself to any one but to tell you the truth as we are situated now the faintest hint as regards his inclinations or lack of inclinations towards certain things would be of immense service if he criticised any of our institutions for instance his remarks would be most interesting then he has been spending several months in various capitals he would not be likely to tell any one his whole impressions of those few months but a phrase a word even a gesture to a clever woman might mean a great deal it might also mean a great deal to us  ill mention it the duke promised but i am afraid my womenfolk are scarcely up to this sort of thing the best plan would be to tackle him ourselves down at devenham  i thought of that the prime minister assented that is why i am coming down myself and bringing bransome if he will have nothing to say to us within a week or so of his departure we shall know what to think remember my words devenhamwhen our chronicler dips his pen into the ink and writes of our government our foreign policy at least will be judged by our position in the far east exactly what that will be depends upon prince maiyo with a renewal of our treaty we could go to the country tomorrow without it especially if the refusal should come from them there will be some very ugly writing across the page  the duke threw away his cigarette  well he said we can only do our best the young man seems friendly enough  the prime minister nodded  it is precisely his friendliness which i fear he said    chapter xvii a gay night in paris  mr james b coulson was almost as much at home at the grand hotel paris as he had been at the savoy in london his headquarters were at the american bar where he approved of the cocktails patronized the highballs and continually met fellowcountrymen with whom he gossiped and visited various places of amusement his business during the daytime he kept to himself but he certainly was possessed of a bagful of documents and drawings relating to sundry patents connected with the manufacture of woollen goods the praises of which he was always ready to sing in a most enthusiastic fashion  mr coulson was not a man whose acquaintance it was difficult to make from five to seven every afternoon scorning the attractions of the band outside and the generally festive air which pervaded the great tea rooms he sat at the corner of the bar upon an article of furniture which resembled more than anything else an office stool dividing his attention between desultory conversation with any other gentleman who might be indulging in a drink and watching the billiards in which some of his compatriots were usually competing it was not so far as one might judge a strenuous life which mr coulson was leading he had been known once or twice to yawn and he had somewhat the appearance of a man engaged in an earnest but at times not altogether successful attempt to kill time perhaps for that reason he made acquaintances with a little more than his customary freedom there was a young englishman for instance whose name it appeared was gaynsforth with whom after a drink or two at the bar he speedily became on almost intimate terms  mr gaynsforth was a young man apparently of good breeding and some means he was well dressed of cheerful disposition knew something about the woollen trade and appeared to take a distinct liking to his new friend the two men after having talked business together for some time arranged to dine together and have what they called a gay evening they retired to their various apartments to change mr gaynsforth perfectly well satisfied with his progress mr james b coulson with a broad grin upon his face  after a very excellent dinner for which mr gaynsforth insisted upon paying they went to the folies bergeres where the englishman developed a thirst which considering the coolness of the evening was nothing short of amazing mr coulson however kept pace with him steadily and toward midnight their acquaintance had steadily progressed until they were certainly on friendly if not affectionate terms a round of the supper places proposed by the englishman was assented to by mr coulson with enthusiasm about three oclock in the morning mr coulson had the appearance of a man for whom the troubles of this world are over and who was realizing the ecstatic bliss of a temporary nirvana mr gaynsforth on the other hand although half an hour ago he had been boisterous and unsteady seemed suddenly to have become once more the quiet discreetlooking young englishman who had first bowed to mr coulson in the bar of the grand hotel and accepted with some diffidence his offer of a drink to prevent his friend being jostled by the somewhat mixed crowd in which they then were mr gaynsforth drew nearer and nearer to him he even let his hand stray over his person as though to be sure that he was not carrying too much in his pockets  say old man he whispered in his earthey were sitting side by side now in the bal tabarinif you are going on like this heaven knows where youll land at the end of it all ill look after you as well as i canwhere you go ill gobut we cant be together every second of the time dont you think youd be safer if you handed over your pocketbook to me  right you are mr coulson declared falling a little over on one side take it out of my pocket be careful of it now theres five hundred francs there and the plans of a loom which i wouldnt sell for a good many thousands  mr gaynsforth possessed himself quickly of the pocketbook and satisfied himself that his friends description of its contents was fairly correct  youve nothing else upon you worth taking care of he whispered you can trust me you know you havent any papers or anything of that sort  then mr james b coulson who was getting tired of his part suddenly sat up and a soberer man had never occupied that particular chair in the bal tabarin  and if i have my young friend he said calmly what the devil business is it of yours  mr gaynsforth was taken aback and showed it he recovered himself as quickly as possible and realized that he had been living in a fools paradise so far as the condition of his companion was concerned he realized also that the first move in the game between them had been made and that he had lost  you are too good an actor for me mr coulson he said suppose we get to business  thats all right mr coulson answered lets go somewhere where we can get some supper well go to the abbaye theleme and you shall have the pleasure of entertaining me  mr gaynsforth handed back the pocketbook and led the way out of the place without a word it was only a few steps up the hill and they found themselves then in a supper place of a very different class here mr coulson after a brief visit to the lavatory during which he obliterated all traces of his recent condition seated himself at one of the small flowerdecked tables and offered the menu to his new friend  its up to you to pay he said so you shall choose the supper personally im for a few oysters a hot bird and a cold bottle  mr gaynsforth who was still somewhat subdued commanded the best supper procurable on these lines mr coulson having waved his hand to a few acquaintances and chaffed the spanish dancing girls in their own languagenot a little to his companions astonishmentat last turned to business  come he said you and i ought to understand one another you are over here from london either to pump me or to rob me you are either a detective or a political spy or a secret service agent of some sort or you are on a lay of your own now put it in a business form what can i do for you make your offer and lets see where we are  mr gaynsforth began to recover himself it did not follow because he had made one mistake that he was to lose the game  i am neither a detective mr coulson he said nor a secret service agentin fact i am nothing of that sort at all i have a friend however who for certain reasons does not care to approach you himself but who is nevertheless very much interested in a particular event or rather incident in which you are concerned  good mr coulson declared get right on  that friend mr gaynsforth continued calmly is prepared to pay a thousand pounds for full information and proof as to the nature of those papers which were stolen from mr hamilton fynes on the night of march 22nd  a thousand pounds mr coulson repeated gee whiz  he is also the englishman continued prepared to pay another thousand for a satisfactory explanation of the murder of mr richard vanderpole on the following day  say your friends got the stuff mr coulson remarked admiringly  my friend is not a poor man mr gaynsforth admitted you see theres a sort of feeling abroad that these two things are connected i am not working on behalf of the police i am not working on behalf of any one who desires the least publicity but i am working for some one who wants to know and is prepared to pay  thats a very interesting job youre on and no mistake mr coulson declared i wonder you waste time coming over here on the spree when youve got a piece of business like that to look after  i came over here mr gaynsforth replied entirely on the matter i have mentioned to you  what over here to paris mr coulson exclaimed  not only to paris the other replied dryly but to discover one mr james b coulson whose health i now have the pleasure of drinking  mr coulson drained the glass which the waiter had just filled  well this licks me he exclaimed how any one in their senses could believe that there was any connection between me and hamilton fynes or that other young swell i cant imagine  you knew hamilton fynes mr gaynsforth remarked that fact came out at the inquest you appeared to have known him better than most men mr vanderpole had just left you when he was murderedthat also came out at the inquest  kind of queer wasnt it mr coulson remarked meditatively how i seemed to get hung up with both of them you may also remember that at the inquest mr vanderpoles business with me was testified to by the chief of his department  certainly mr gaynsforth answered however thats neither here nor there everything was properly arranged so far as you were concerned of course that doesnt alter my friends convictions this is a business matter with me and if the two thousand pounds dont sound attractive enough well the amount must be revised thats all but i want you to understand this mr coulson i represent a man or a syndicate or call it what you will  call it a government mr coulson muttered under his breath  call it what you will mr gaynsforth continued with an air of not having heard the interruption we have the money and we want the information you can give it to us if you like we dont ask for too much we dont even ask for the name of the man who committed these crimes but we do want to know the nature of those papers exactly what position mr hamilton fynes occupied in the stamp and excise duty department at washington and finally what the mischief you are doing over here in paris  have you ordered the supper mr coulson inquired anxiously  i have ordered everything you suggested mr gaynsforth answeredsome oysters a chicken en casserole lettuce salad some cheese and a magnum of pommery  it is understood that you are my host mr coulson insisted  absolutely his companion declared i consider it an honor  then mr coulson said pointing out his empty glass to the sommelier we may as well understand one another to you i am mr james b coulson travelling in patents for woollen machinery if you put a quarter of a million of francs upon that table i am still mr james b coulson travelling in woollen machinery and if you add a million to that and pile up the notes so high that they touch the ceiling i remain mr james b coulson travelling in patents for woollen machinery now if youll get that firmly into your head and stick to it and believe it theres no reason why you and i shouldnt have a pleasant evening  mr gaynsforth although he was an englishman and young showed himself to be possessed of a sense of humor he leaned back in his seat and roared with laughter  mr coulson he said i congratulate you and your employers to the lower regions with business help yourself to the oysters and pass the wine    chapter xviii mr coulson is indiscreet  on the following morning mr coulson received what he termed his mail from america locked in his room on the fifth floor of the hotel he carefully perused the contents of several letters a little later he rang and ordered his bill at four oclock he left the gare du nord for london  like many other great men mr coulson was not without his weakness he was brave shrewd and farseeing he enjoyed excellent health and he scarcely knew the meaning of the word nerves nevertheless he suffered from seasickness the first thing he did therefore when aboard the boat at boulogne was to bespeak a private cabin the steward to whom he made his application shook his head with regret the last two had just been engaged mr coulson tried a tip and then a larger tip with equal lack of success he was about to abandon the effort and retire gloomily to the saloon when a man who had been standing by wrapped in a heavy fur overcoat intervened  i am afraid sir he said that it is i who have just secured the last cabin if you care to share it with me however i shall be delighted as a matter of fact i use it very little myself the night has turned out so fine that i shall probably promenade all the time  if you will allow me to divide the expense mr coulson replied i shall be exceedingly obliged to you and will accept your offer i am unfortunately a bad sailor  that is as you will sir the gentleman answered the amount is only trifling  the night was a bright one but there was a heavy sea running and even in the harbor the boat was rocking mr coulson groaned as he made his way across the threshold of the cabin  i am going to have a horrible time he said frankly i am afraid youll repent your offer before youve done with me  his new friend smiled  i have never been seasick in my life he said and i only engage a cabin for fear of wet weather a fine night like this i shall not trouble you so pray be as ill as you like  its nothing to laugh at mr coulson remarked gloomily  let me give you a little advice his friend said and i can assure you that i know something of these matters for i have been on the sea a great deal let me mix you a stiff brandy and soda drink it down and eat only a dry biscuit i have some brandy of my own here  nothing does me any good mr coulson groaned  this the stranger remarked producing a flask from his case and dividing the liquor into equal parts may send you to sleep if so youll be across before you wake up heres luck  mr coulson drained his glass his companion was in the act of raising his to his lips when the ship gave a roll his elbow caught the back of a chair and the tumbler slipped from his fingers  its of no consequence he declared ringing for the steward ill go into the smoking room and get a drink i was only going to have some to keep you company as a matter of fact i prefer whiskey  mr coulson sat down upon the berth he seemed indisposed for speech  ill leave you now then his friend said buttoning his coat around him you lie flat down on your back and i think youll find yourself all right  that brandy mr coulson muttered was infernally strong  his companion smiled and went out in a quarter of an hour he returned and locked the door they were out in the channel now and the boat was pitching heavily mr james b coulson however knew nothing of it he was sleeping like one who wakes only for the judgment day over his coat and waistcoat the other mans fingers travelled with curious dexterity the oilskin case in which mr coulson was in the habit of keeping his private correspondence was reached in a very few minutes the stranger turned out the letters and read them one by one until he came to the one he sought he held it for a short time in his hand looked at the address with a faint smile and slipped his fingers lightly along the gummed edge of the envelope  no seal he said softly to himself my friend mr coulson plays the game of travelling agent to perfection  he glided out of the cabin with the letter in his hand in about ten minutes he returned mr coulson was still sleeping he replaced the letter pressing down the envelope carefully  my friend he whispered looking down upon mr coulsons uneasy figure on the whole i have been perhaps a little premature i think you had better deliver this document to its proper destination if only there was to have been a written answer we might have met again it would have been most interesting  he slipped the oilskin case back into the exact position in which he had found it and watched his companion for several minutes in silence then he went to his dressing bag and from a phial mixed a little draught lifting the sleeping mans head he forced it down his throat  i think he said i think mr coulson that you had better wake up  he unlocked the door and resumed his promenade of the deck in the bows he stood for some time leaning with folded arms against a pillar his eyes fixed upon the line of lights ahead the great waves now leaped into the moonlight the wind sang in the rigging and came booming across the waters the salt spray stung his cheeks high above his head the slender mast with its marconi attachment swang and dived reached out for the stars and fell away with a shudder the man who watched stood and dreamed until the voyage was almost over then he turned on his heel and went back to see how his cabin companion was faring  mr coulson was sitting on the edge of his bunk he had awakened with a terrible headache and a sense of some hideous indiscretion it was not until he had examined every paper in his pocket and all his money that he had begun to feel more comfortable and in the meantime he had forgotten altogether to be seasick  well how has the remedy worked the stranger inquired  mr coulson looked him in the face then he drew a short breath of relief he had been indiscreet but he had alarmed himself unnecessarily there was nothing about the appearance of the quiet dark little man with the amiable eyes and slightly foreign manner in the least suspicious  its given me a brute of a headache he declared but i certainly havent been seasick up till now and i must say ive never crossed before without being ill  the stranger laughed soothingly  that brandy and soda would keep you right he said when we get to folkestone youll be wanting a supper basket make yourself at home i dont need the cabin its a glorious night outside i shouldnt have come in at all except to see how you were getting on  how long before we are in mr coulson asked  about a quarter of an hour was the answer ill come for you if you like have a few minutes nap if you feel sleepy  mr coulson got up  not i he said i am going to douse my head in some cold water that must have been the strongest brandy and soda that was ever brewed to send me off like that  his friend laughed as he helped him out on to the deck  i shouldnt grumble at it if i were you he said carelessly it saved you from a bad crossing  mr coulson washed his face and hands in the smoking room lavatory and was so far recovered even as to be able to drink a cup of coffee before they reached the harbor at folkestone he looked everywhere for his friend but in vain at charing cross he searched once more the little dark gentleman with the distinguished air and the easy correct speech who had mixed his brandy and soda had disappeared  and i owe the little beggar for half that cabin mr coulson thought with a sensation of annoyance i wonder where hes hidden himself    chapter xix a momentous question  the duke paused in his way across the crowded reception rooms to speak to his host sir edward bransome secretary of state for foreign affairs  i have just written you a line bransome he said as they shook hands the chief tells me that he is going to honor us down at devenham for a few days and that we may expect you also  you are very kind duke bransome answered i suppose haviland explained the matter to you  the duke nodded  you are going to help me entertain my other distinguished visitor he remarked i fancy we shall be quite an interesting party  bransome glanced around  i hope most earnestly he said that we shall induce our young friend to be a little more candid with us than he has been one cant get a word out of hesho but im bound to say that i dont altogether like the look of things the press are beginning to smell a rat two leading articles this morning i see upon our eastern relations  the duke nodded  i read them he said we are informed that the prestige and success of our ministry will entirely depend upon whether or not we are able to arrange for the renewal of our treaty with japan i remember the same papers shrieking themselves hoarse with indignation when we first joined hands with our little friends across the sea  his secretary approached bransome and touched him on the shoulder  there is a person in the anteroom sir he said whom i think that you ought to see  the duke nodded and passed on the secretary drew his chief on one side  this man has just arrived from paris sir he continued and is the bearer of a letter which he is instructed to deliver into your hands only  bransome nodded  is he known to us at all he asked from whom does the letter come  the young man hesitated  the letter itself sir has nothing to do with france i imagine he said the person i refer to is an american and although i have no positive information i believe that he is sometimes intrusted with the carrying of despatches from washington to his embassy once or twice lately i have had it reported to me that communications from the other side to mr harvey have been sent by hand it seems as though they had some objection to committing important documents to the post  bransome walked through the crowded rooms by the side of his secretary stopping for a moment to exchange greetings here and there with his friends his wife was giving her third reception of the session to the diplomatic world  washington has certainly shown signs of mistrust lately he remarked but if communications from them are ever tampered with it is more likely to be on their side than ours they have a particularly unscrupulous press to deal with besides political intriguers if this person you speak of is really the bearer of a letter from there he added i think we can both guess what it is about  the secretary nodded  shall i ring up mr haviland sir he asked  not yet bransome answered it is just possible that this person requires an immediate reply in which case it may be convenient for me not to be able to get at the prime minister bring him along into my private room sidney  sir edward bransome made his way to his study opened the door with a yale key turned on the electric lights and crossed slowly to the hearthrug he stood there for several moments with his elbow upon the mantelpiece looking down into the fire a darker shadow had stolen across his face as soon as he was alone in his court dress and brilliant array of orders he was certainly a very distinguishedlooking figure yet the last few years had branded lines into his face which it was doubtful if he would ever lose to be secretary of state for foreign affairs to the greatest power which the world had as yet known must certainly seem on paper to be as brilliant a post as a mans ambition could covet many years ago it had seemed so to bransome himself it was a post which he had deliberately coveted worked for and strived for and now when in sight of the end with two years of office only to run he was appalled at the evergrowing responsibilities thrust upon his shoulders there was never perhaps a time when on paper things had seemed smoother when the distant mutterings of disaster were less audible it was only those who were behind the curtain who realized how deceptive appearances were  in a few minutes his secretary reappeared ushering in mr james b coulson mr coulson was still a little pale from the effects of his crossing and he wore a long thick ulster to conceal the deficiencies of his attire nevertheless his usual breeziness of manner had not altogether deserted him sir edward looked him up and down and finding him look exactly as mr james b coulson of the coulson  bruce syndicate should look was inclined to wonder whether his secretary had made a mistake  i was told that you wished to see me he said i am sir edward bransome  mr james b coulson nodded appreciatively  very good of you sir edward he said to put yourself out at this time of night to have a word or two with me i am sorry to have troubled you anyway but the matter was sort of urgent  sir edward bent his head  i understand mr coulson he said that you come from the united states  that is so sir mr coulson replied i am at the head of a syndicate the coulson  bruce syndicate which in course of time hope to revolutionize the machinery used for spinning wool all over the world likewise we have patents for other machinery connected with the manufacture of all varieties of woollen goods i am over here on a business trip which i have just concluded  satisfactorily i trust sir edward remarked  well im not grumbling sir mr coulson assented here and there i may have missed a thing and the old fashioned way of doing business on this side bothers me a bit but on the whole im not grumbling  bransome bowed perhaps after all the man was not a fool  i have a good many friends round about washington mr coulson continued and sometimes when they know i am coming across one or the other of them finds it convenient to hand me a letter it isnt the postage stamp that worries them he added with a little laugh but they sort of feel that anything committed to me is fairly safe to reach its right destination  without disputing that fact for one moment mr coulson sir edward remarked i might also suggest that the ordinary mail service between our countries has reached a marvellous degree of perfection  the post office mr coulson continued meditatively is a great institution both on your side and ours but a letter posted in washington has to go through a good many hands before it is delivered in london  sir edward smiled  it is a fact sir he said which the various governments of europe have realized for many years in connection with the exchange of communications one with the other your own great country as it grows and expands becomes of necessity more in touch with our methods did i understand that you have a letter for me mr coulson  mr coulson produced it  friend of mine you may have heard of he said asked me to leave this with you i am catching the princess cecilia from southampton tomorrow i thought perhaps if i waited an hour or so i might take the answer back with me  it is getting late mr coulson sir edward reminded him glancing at the clock  mr coulson smiled  i think sir edward he said that in your line of business time counts for little  sir edward motioned his visitor to a chair and touched the bell  i shall require the a3x cipher sidney he said to his secretary  mr coulson looked up  why he said i dont think youll need that the letter youve got in your hand is just a personal one and what my friend has to say to you is written out there in black and white  sir edward withdrew the enclosure from its envelope and raised his eyebrows  isnt this a trifle indiscreet he asked  why i should say not mr coulson answered my friendmr jones well call himknew me and i presume knew what he was about besides that is a plain letter from the head of a business firm toshall we say a client theres nothing in it to conceal  at the same time sir edward remarked it might have been as well to have fastened the flap of the envelope  mr coulson held out his hand  let me look he said  sir edward gave it into his hands mr coulson held it under the electric light there was no indication in his face of any surprise or disturbance  bit short of gum in our stationery office he remarked  sir edward was looking at him steadily  my impressions were he said when i opened this letter that i was not the first person who had done so the envelope flew apart in my fingers  mr coulson shook his head  the document has never been out of my possession sir he said it has not even left my person my friend mr jones does not believe in too much secrecy in matters of this sort i have had a good deal of experience now and am inclined to agree with him a letter in a doubleended envelope stuck all over with sealing wax is pretty certain to be opened in case of any accident to the bearer this one as you may not have noticed is written in the same handwriting and addressed in the same manner as the remainder of my letters of introduction to various london and paris houses of business  sir edward said no more he read the few lines written on a single sheet of notepaper starting a little at the signature then he read them again and placed the document beneath a paper weight in front of him when he leaned across the table his folded arms formed a semicircle around it  this letter mr coulson he said is not an official communication  it is not mr coulson admitted i fancy it occurred to my friend jones that anything official would be hardly in place and might be easier to evade the matter has already cropped up in negotiations between mr harvey and your cabinet but so far we are without any definite pronouncementat least that is how my friend mr jones looks at it  sir edward smiled  the only answer your friend asks for is a verbal one he remarked  a verbal one mr coulson assented delivered to me in the presence of one other person whose name you will find mentioned in that letter  sir edward bowed his head when he spoke again his manner had somehow changed it had become at once more officiala trifle more stilted  this is a great subject mr coulson he said it is a subject which has occupied the attention of his majestys ministers for many months i shall take the opinion of the other person whose name is mentioned in this letter as to whether we can grant mr jones request if we should do so it will not i am sure be necessary to say to you that any communication we may make on the subject tonight will be from men to a man of honor and must be accepted as such it will be our honest and sincere conviction but it must also be understood that it does not bind the government of this country to any course of action  mr coulson smiled and nodded his head  that is what i call diplomacy sir edward he remarked i always tell our people that they are too bullheaded they dont use enough words what about that other friend of yours  sir edward glanced at his watch  it is possible he said that by this time mr mr smith shall we call him to match your mr jonesis attending my wifes reception from which your message called me if he has not yet arrived my secretary shall telephone for him  mr coulson indicated his approval  seems to me he remarked that i have struck a fortunate evening for my visit  sir edward touched the bell and his secretary appeared  sidney he said i want you to find the gentleman whose name i am writing upon this piece of paper if he is not in the reception rooms and has not arrived telephone for him say that i shall be glad if he would come this way at once he will understand that it is a matter of some importance  the secretary bowed and withdrew after a glance at the piece of paper which he held in his hand sir edward turned toward his visitor  mr coulson he said will you allow me the privilege of offering you some refreshment  i thank you sir mr coulson answered i am in want of nothing but a smoke  sir edward turned to the bell but his visitor promptly stopped him  if you will allow me sir he said i will smoke one of my own homemade article five dollars a hundred but i cant stand these strong havanas try one  sir edward waved them away  if you will excuse me he said i will smoke a cigarette since you are here mr coulson i may say that i am very glad to meet you i am very glad also of this opportunity for a few minutes conversation upon another matter  mr coulson showed some signs of surprise  hows that he asked  there is another subject sir edward said which i should like to discuss with you while we are waiting for mr smith    chapter xx the answer  mr coulson moved his cigar into a corner of his mouth as though to obtain a clear view of his questioners face his expression was one of bland interest  well i guess youve got me puzzled sir edward he said you arent thinking of doing anything in woollen machinery are you  sir edward smiled  i think not mr coulson he answered at any rate my question had nothing to do with your other very interesting avocation what i wanted to ask you was whether you could tell me anything about a compatriot of yoursa mr hamilton fynes  hamilton fynes mr coulson repeated thoughtfully why thats the man who got murdered on the cars going from liverpool to london  that is so sir edward admitted  mr coulson shook his head  i told that reporter fellow all i knew about him he said he was an unsociable sort of chap you know sir edward and he wasnt in any line of business  hm i thought he might have been the minister answered glancing keenly for a moment at his visitor to tell you the truth mr coulson we have been a great deal bothered about that unfortunate incident and by the subsequent murder of the young man who was attached to your embassy here scotland yard has strained every nerve to bring the guilty people to justice but so far unsuccessfully it seems to me that your friends on the other side scarcely seem to give us credit for our exertions they do not help us in the least they assure us that they had no knowledge of mr fynes other than has appeared in the papers they recognize him only as an american citizen going about his legitimate business a little more confidence on their part would i think render our task easier  mr coulson scratched his chin for a moment thoughtfully  well he said i can understand their feeling a bit sore about it im not exactly given to brag when im away from my own countryone hears too much of that all the timebut between you and me i shouldnt say that it was possible for two crimes like that to be committed in new york city and for the murderer to get off scot free in either case  the matter sir edward declared has given us a great deal of anxiety and i can assure you that the home secretary himself has taken a strong personal interest in it but at the same time as i have just pointed out to you our investigations are rendered the more difficult from the fact that we cannot learn anything definite concerning this mr hamilton fynes or his visit to this country now if we knew for instance sir edward continued that he was carrying documents or even a letter similar to the one you have just handed to me we might at once discover a motive to the crime and work backwards until we reached the perpetrator  mr coulson knocked the ash from his cigar  i see what you are driving at he said i am sorry i can be of no assistance to you sir edward  neither in the case of mr hamilton fynes or in the case of mr richard vanderpole sir edward asked  mr coulson shook his head  quite out of my line he declared  notwithstanding the fact sir edward reminded him quietly that you were probably the last person to see vanderpole alive he came to the savoy to call upon you before he got into the taxicab where he was murdered that is so isnt it  sure mr coulson answered a nice young fellow he was too well set up and real american mannershail fellow well met with you right away  i suppose mr coulson the minister suggested smoothly it wouldnt answer your purpose to put aside that bluff about patents for the development of the woollen trade for a few moments and tell me exactly what passed between you and mr vanderpole at the savoy hotel and the object of his calling upon you whether for instance he took away with him documents or papers intended for the embassy and which you yourself had brought from america  you do think of things mr coulson remarked admiringly youre on the wrong track this time though sure still supposing i were able to tell you that mr vanderpole was carrying papers of importance to my country and that mr hamilton fynes was also in possession of the same class of document how would it help you in what fresh direction should you look then for the murderers of these two men  mr coulson sir edward said we should consider the nature of those documents and we should see to whose advantage it was that they were suppressed  mr coulsons face seemed suddenly old and lined he spoke with a new vigor and his eyes were very keen and bright under his bushy eyebrows  and supposing it was your countrys he asked supposing they contained instructions to our ambassador which you might consider inimical to your interests do you mean that you would look at home for the murderer you mean that you have men so devoted to their native land that they were willing to run the risk of death by the hangman to aid her you mean that your secret service is perfected to that extent and that the scales of justice are held blindfolded or do you mean that scotland yard would have its orders and that these men would go free  i was not thinking of my own country sir edward admitted i must confess that my thoughts had turned elsewhere  let me tell you this sir mr coulson continued i should imagine that the trouble with washington if there is any is simply that they will not believe that your police have a free hand they will not believe that you are honestly and genuinely anxious for the discovery of the perpetrator of these crimes i speak without authority you understand i am no more in a position to discuss this affair than any other tourist from my country who might happen to come along  sir edward shrugged his shoulders  can you suggest any method he asked a little dryly by means of which we might remove this unfortunate impression  mr coulson flicked the ash once more from the end of his cigar and looked at it thoughtfully  this isnt my show he said and you understand i am giving the views of mr james b coulson and nobody but mr james b coulson but if i were in your position and knew that a friendly country was feeling a little bit sore at having two of her citizens disposed of so unceremoniously id do my best to prove by the only possible means that i was taking the matter seriously  the only possible means being sir edward asked  i guess id offer a reward mr coulson admitted  sir edward did not hesitate for a moment  your idea is an excellent one mr coulson he said it has already been mooted but we will give it a little emphasis tomorrow we will offer a reward of one thousand pounds for any information leading to the apprehension of either murderer  that sounds bully mr coulson declared  you think that it will have a good effect upon your friends in washington  me mr coulson asked i know nothing about it ive given you my personal opinion only seems to me though its the best way of showing that youre in earnest  before we quit this subject finally mr coulson sir edward said i am going to ask you a question which you have been asked before  referring to hamilton fynes mr coulson asked  yes  get your young man to lay his hand on that copy of the comet mr coulson begged earnestly i told that pushing young journalist all i knew and a bit more i assure you my information isnt worth anything  was it meant to be worth anything sir edward asked  mr coulson remained imperturbable  if you dont mind sir edward he said i guess well drop the subject of mr hamilton fynes we cant get any forwarder let it go at that  there was a knock at the door sir edwards secretary ushered in a tall plainly dressed gentleman who had the slightly aggrieved air of a man who has been kept out of his bed beyond the usual time  my dear bransome he said shaking hands isnt this a little unreasonable of you business at this hour of the night i was in the midst of a most amusing conversation with a delightful acquaintance of your wifes a young lady who turned up her nose at hegel and had developed a philosophy of her own i was just beginning to grasp its first principles nothing else i am quite sure would have kept me awake  sir edward leaned across the table towards mr coulson mr coulson had risen to his feet  this gentleman he said is mr smith  the newcomer opened his lips to protest but sir edward held out his hand  one moment he begged our friend heremr j b coulson from new yorkhas brought a letter from america he is sailing tomorrowleaving london somewhere about eight oclock in the morning i imagine he wishes to take back a verbal reply the letter you will understand comes from a mr jones and the reply is delivered in the presence ofmr smith our friend here is not personally concerned in these affairs as a matter of fact i believe he has been on the continent exploiting some patents of his own invention  the newcomer accepted the burden of his altered nomenclature and took up the letter he glanced at the signature and his manner became at once more interested he accepted the chair which sir edward had placed by his side and drawing the electric light a little nearer read the document through word by word then he folded it up and glanced first at his colleague and afterwards at mr coulson  i understand he said that this is a private inquiry from a private gentleman who is entitled however to as much courtesy as it is possible for us to show him  that is exactly the position sir mr coulson replied negotiations of a more formal character are naturally conducted between your foreign office and the foreign office of my country these few lines come from man to man i think that it occurred to my friend that it might save a great deal of trouble a great deal of specious diplomacy and a great many hundred pages of labored despatches if at the bottom of it all he knew your true feelings concerning this question it is after all a simple matter mr coulson continued and yet it is a matter with so many ramifications that after much discussion it might become a veritable chaos  mr smith inclined his head gently  i appreciate the situation he said my friend heresir edward bransomeand i have already discussed the matter at great length we have also had the benefit of the advice and help of a greater foreign minister than either of us could ever hope to become i see no objection to giving you the verbal reply you ask for do you bransome  none whatever sir  i leave it to you to put it in your own words mr smith continued the affair is within your province and the policy of his majestys ministers is absolutely fixed  sir edward turned toward their visitor  mr coulson he said we are asked by your friend in a few plain words what the attitude of great britain would be in the event of a war between japan and america my answerour answerto you is thisno war between japan and america is likely to take place unless your cabinet should go to unreasonable and uncalledfor extremes we have ascertained beyond any measure of doubt the sincere feeling of our ally in this matter japan does not desire war is not preparing for it is unwilling even to entertain the possibility of it at the same time she feels that her sons should receive the same consideration from every nation in the world as the sons of other people personally it is our profound conviction that the good sense the fairness and the generous instincts of your great country will recognize this and act accordingly war between your country and japan is an impossible thing the thought of it exists only in the frothy vaporings of cheap newspapers and the sensational utterances of the catch politician who must find an audience and a hearing by any methods the sober possibility of such a conflict does not exist  mr coulson listened attentively to every word when sir edward had finished he withdrew his cigar from his mouth and knocked the ash on to a corner of the writing table  thats all very interesting indeed sir edward he declared i am very pleased to have heard what you have said and i shall repeat it to my friend on the other side who i am sure will be exceedingly obliged to you for such a frank exposition of your views and now he continued i dont want to keep you gentlemen up too late so perhaps you will be coming to the answer of my question  the answer sir edward exclaimed surely i made myself clear  all that you have said mr coulson admitted has been remarkably clear but the question i asked you was thiswhat is to be the position of your country in the event of war between japan and america  and i have told you sir edward declared that war between japan and america is not a subject within the scope of practical politics  we may consider ourselvesmy friend mr jones would certainly consider himself mr coulson affirmedas good a judge as you sir edward so far as regards that matter i am not asking you whether it is probable or improbable you may know the feelings of your ally you do not know ours we may look into the future and we may see that sooner or later war between our country and japan is a necessity we may decide that it is better for us to fight now than later these things are in the clouds they only enter into the present discussion to this extent but it is not for you to sit here and say whether war between the united states and japan is possible or impossible what mr jones asks you iswhat would be your position if it should take place the little diatribe with which you have just favored me is exactly the reply we should have expected to receive formally from downing street it isnt that sort of reply i want to take back to mr jones  mr smith and his colleague exchanged glances and the latter drew his chief on one side  you will excuse me for a moment i know mr coulson he said  why by all means mr coulson declared my time is my own and it is entirely at your service if you say the word ill go outside and wait  it is not necessary sir edward answered  the room was a large one and the two men walked slowly up and down mr smith leaning all the time upon his colleagues shoulder they spoke in an undertone and what they said was inaudible to mr coulson during his period of waiting he drew another cigar from his pocket and lit it from the stump of the old one then he made himself a little more comfortable in his chair and looked around at the walls of the handsomely furnished but rather sombre apartment with an air of pleased curiosity it was scarcely perhaps what he should have expected from a man in a similar position in his own country but it was at any rate impressive presently they came back to him this time it was mr smith who spoke  mr coulson he said we need not beat about the bush you ask us a plain question and you want a plain answer then i must tell you this the matter is not one concerning which i can give you any definite information i appreciate the position of your friend mr jones and i should like to have met him in the same spirit as he has shown in his inquiry but i may tell you that being utterly convinced that japan does not seek war with you and that therefore no war is likely my government is not prepared to answer a question which they consider based upon an impossibility if this war should come the position of our country would depend entirely upon the rights of the dispute as a corollary to that i would mention two things you read your newspapers mr coulson  sure that gentleman answered  you are aware then mr smith continued of the present position of your fleet you know how many months must pass before it can reach eastern waters it is not within the traditions of this country to evade fulfillment of its obligations however severe and unnatural they may seem but in three months time mr coulson our treaty with japan will have expired  you are seeking to renew it mr coulson declared quickly  mr smith raised his eyebrows  the renewal of that treaty he said is on the knees of the gods one cannot tell i go so far only as to tell you that in three months the present treaty will have expired  mr coulson rose slowly to his feet and took up his hat  gentlemen both he said thats what i call plain speaking i suppose its up to us to read between the lines i can assure you that my friend mr jones will appreciate it it isnt my place to say a word outside the letter which i have handed to you i am a plain business man and these things dont come in my way that is why i feel i can criticizei am unprejudiced you are britishers and youve got one eternal fault you seem to think the whole world must see a matter as you see it if japan has convinced you that she doesnt seek a war with us it doesnt follow that shes convinced us as to the rights of our dispute dont rely so much upon hearing one side only dont be dogmatic about it and say this thing is and that thing isnt you may bet your last dollar that america isnt going to war about trifles we are the same flesh and blood you know we have the same traditions to uphold what we do is what we should expect you to do if you were in our place thats all gentlemen now i wish you both good night mr smith i am proud to shake hands with you sir edward i say the same to you  bransome touched the bell and summoned his secretary  sidney will you see this gentleman out he said you are quite sure there is nothing further we can do for you mr coulson  nothing at all i thank you sir that gentleman answered i have only got to thank you once more for the pleasure of this brief interview good night  good night and bon voyage sir edward answered  the door was closed the two men looked at one another for a moment mr smith shrugged his shoulders and helped himself to a cigarette  i wonder he remarked thoughtfully how our friends in japan convinced themselves so thoroughly that mr jones was only playing ships  sir edward shook his head  it makes one wonder he said    chapter xxi a clue  by midday on the following morning london was placarded with notices the heading of which was sensational enough to attract observation from every passerby young or old rich or poor one thousand pounds reward for the apprehension of the murderer of either hamilton fynes or richard vanderpole inspector jacks who was amongst the first to hear the news after a brief interview with his chief put on his hat and walked round to the home office he sought out one of the underlings with whom he had some acquaintance and whom he found ready enough even eager to discuss the matter  there wasnt a word about any reward inspector jacks was told until this morning we had a telephone message from the chiefs bedroom and phoned you up at once its a pretty stiff amount isnt it  it is the inspector admitted our chief seems to be taking quite a personal interest in the matter all at once  ill lay two to one that some one was on to him at sir edward bransomes reception last night the other remarked i know very well that there was no idea of offering a reward yesterday afternoon we might have come out with a hundred pounds or so a little later on perhaps but there was nothing of this sort in the air ive no desire to seem censorious you know jacks the young man went on leaning back in his chair and lighting a cigarette but it does seem a dashed queer thing that you cant put your finger upon either of these fellows  inspector jacks nodded gloomily  no doubt it seems so to you he admitted you forget that we have to have a reasonable amount of proof before we can tap a man on the shoulder and ask him to come with us it isnt so abroad or in america there they can hand a man up with less than half the evidence we have to be prepared with and of course they get the reputation of being smarter on the job we may learn enough to satisfy ourselves easily but to get up a case which we can put before a magistrate and be sure of not losing our man takes time  so youve got your eye on some one the young man asked curiously  i did not say so the inspector answered warily by the bye do you think there would be any chance of five minutes interview with your chief  the young man shook his head slowly  what a cheek youve got jacks he declared youre not serious are you  perfectly inspector jacks answered and to tell you the truth my young friend i am half inclined to think that when he is given to understand as he will be by you if he doesnt know it already that i am in charge of the investigations concerning these two murders he will see me  the young man was disposed to consider the point  well he remarked the chief does seem plaguy interested all of a sudden ill pass your name in if you take a seat its just possible that he may spare you a minute or two in about an hours time he wont be able to before then im sure theres a deputation almost due and two other appointments before luncheon time  the inspector accepted a newspaper and an easy chair his young friend disappeared and returned almost immediately looking a little surprised  ive managed it for you he explained the chief is going to spare you five minutes at once come along and ill show you in  inspector jacks took up his hat and followed his acquaintance to the private room of the home secretary that personage nodded to him upon his entrance and continued to dictate a letter when he had finished he sent his clerk out of the room and motioning mr jacks to take a seat by his side leaned back in his own chair with the air of one prepared to relax for a moment he was a man of somewhat insignificant presence but he had keen gray eyes half the time concealed under thick eyebrows and flashing out upon you now and then at least expected moments  from scotland yard i understand mr jacks he remarked  at your service sir the inspector answered i am in charge of the investigations concerning these two recent murders  quite so the home secretary remarked i am very glad to meet you mr jacks so far i suppose you are willing to admit that you gentlemen down at scotland yard have not exactly distinguished yourselves  we are willing to admit that inspector jacks said  i do not know whether the reward will help you very much the home secretary continued so far as you people personally are concerned i imagine that it will make no difference the only point seems to be that it may bring you outside help which at the present time is being withheld  the offering of the reward sir inspector jacks said can do no harm and it may possibly assist us very materially  i am glad to have your opinion mr jacks the home secretary said  there was a moments pause the minister trifled with some papers lying on the desk before him then he turned to his visitor and continued  you will forgive my reminding you mr jacks that i am a busy man and that this is a busy morning you had some reason i presume for wishing to see me  i had sir the inspector answered i took the liberty of waiting upon you sir to ask whether the idea of a reward for so large a sum came spontaneously from your department  the home secretary raised his eyebrows  really mr jacks he began  i hope sir the inspector protested that you will not think i am asking this question through any irrelevant curiosity i am beginning to form a theory of my own as to these two murders but it needs building up the offering of a reward like this if it emanates from the source which i suspect that it does gives a solid foundation to my theories i am here sir in the interests of justice only and i should be exceedingly obliged to you if you would tell me whether the suggestion of this large reward did not come from the foreign office  the minister considered for several moments and then slowly inclined his head  mr jacks he said your question appears to me to be a pertinent one i see not the slightest reason to conceal from you the fact that your surmise is perfectly accurate  a flash of satisfaction illuminated for a moment the detectives inexpressive features he rose and took up his hat  i am very much obliged to you sir he said the information which you have given me is extremely valuable  i am glad to hear you say so the home secretary declared you understand of course that it is within the province of my department to assist at all times and in any possible way the course of justice is there anything more i can do for you  inspector jacks hesitated  if you would not think it a liberty sir he said i should be very glad indeed if you would give me a note which would insure me an interview with sir edward bransome  i will give it you with pleasure the secretary answered although i imagine that he would be quite willing to see you on your own request  he wrote a few lines and passed them over inspector jacks saluted and turned towards the door  youll let me know if anything turns up the home secretary said  you shall be informed at once sir the inspector assured him a as he left the room  sir edward bransome was just leaving his house when inspector jacks entered the gate the latter who knew him by sight saluted and hesitated for a moment  did you wish to speak to me sir edward asked drawing back from the step of his electric brougham  the inspector held out his letter sir edward tore it open and glanced through the few lines which it contained then he looked keenly for a moment at the man who stood respectfully by his side  so you are inspector jacks from scotland yard he remarked  at your service sir the detective answered  you can get in with me if you like sir edward continued motioning toward the interior of his brougham i am due in downing street now but i dare say you could say what you wish to on the way there  certainly sir inspector jacks answered it will be very good of you indeed if you can spare me those few minutes  the brougham glided away  now mr jacks sir edward said what can i do for you if you want to arrest me i shall claim privilege  the inspector smiled  i am in charge sir he said of the investigations concerning the murder of mr hamilton fynes and mr richard vanderpole the news of the reward came to us at scotland yard this morning its unusual amount led me to make some injuries at the home office i found that what i partly expected was true i found sir that your department has shown some interest in the apprehension of these two men  sir edward inclined his head slowly  well he said  sir edward bransome the inspector continued i have a theory of my own as to these murders and though it may take me some time to work it out i feel myself day by day growing nearer the truth these were not ordinary crimes any one can see that they were not even crimes for the purpose of robberynot that is to say for robbery in the ordinary sense of the word that is apparent even to those who write for the press it has been apparent to us from the first it is beginning to dawn upon me now what the nature of the motive must be which was responsible for them i have in my possession a slight a very slight clue the beginning of it is there and the end it is the way between which is tangled  sir edward lit a cigarette and leaned back amongst the cushions with a little gesture he indicated his desire that inspector jacks should proceed  my object in seeking for a personal interview with you sir inspector jacks continued is to ask you a somewhat peculiar question if i find that my investigations lead me in the direction which at present seems probable it is no ordinary person whom i shall have to arrest when the time comes the reward which has been offered is a large one and it is not for me to question the bona fide nature of it i would not presume sir even to ask you whether it was offered by reason of any outside pressure but there is one question which i must ask do you really wish sir that the murderer or murderers of these two men shall be brought to justice  sir edward looked at his companion in steadfast amazement  my dear inspector he said what is this that you have in your mind i hold no brief for any man capable of such crimes as these representations have been made to us by the american government that the murder of two of her citizens within the course of twentyfour hours and the absence of any arrest is somewhat of a reflection upon our police service it is for your assistance and in compliment to our friends across the atlantic that the reward was offered  inspector jacks seemed a little at a loss  it is your wish then sir he said slowly that the guilty person or persons be arrested without warning whoever they may be  by all means sir edward affirmed i cannot conceive inspector what you have in your mind which could have led you for a moment to suspect the contrary  the brougham had come to a standstill in front of a house in downing street inspector jacks descended slowly it was hard for him to decide on the spot how far to take into his confidence a person whose attitude was so unsympathetic  i am exceedingly obliged to you for your answer to my question sir he said saluting i hope that in a few days we shall have some news for you  sir edward watched him disappear as he mounted the steps of the prime ministers house  i wonder he said to himself thoughtfully what that fellow can have in his mind  inspector jacks did not at once return to scotland yard on his way there he turned into st james square and stood for several moments looking at the corner house on the far side finally after a hesitation which seldom characterized his movements he crossed the road and rang the bell the door was opened almost at once by a japanese butler  is your master at home the inspector asked  his highness does not see strangers the man replied coldly  will you take him my card the inspector asked  the man bowed and showed him into an apartment on the ground floor then with the card in his hand he turned reluctantly away  his highness shall be informed that you are here he said i fear however that you waste your time i go to see  inspector jacks subsided into a bamboo chair and looked out of the window with a frown upon his forehead it was certain that he was not proceeding with altogether his usual caution as a matter of tactics this visit of his might very well be fatal    chapter xxii a breath from the east  inspector jacks was a man who had succeeded in his profession chiefly on account of an average amount of natural astuteness and also because he was one of those favored persons whose nervous system was a whole and perfect thing yet curiously enough as he sat in this large gloomy apartment into which he had been shown a room filled with art treasures whose appearance and significance were entirely strange to him he felt a certain uneasiness which he was absolutely unable to understand he was somewhat instinctive in his likes and dislikes and from the first he most heartily disliked the room itselfits vague perfumes its subdued violet coloring the faces of the grinning idols which seemed to meet his gaze in every direction the pictures of those fiercelooking warriors who brandished twoedged swords at him from the walls they belonged to the period when japanese art was perhaps in its crudest state and yet in this uncertain atmosphere they seemed to possess an extraordinary vitality as though indeed they were prepared at a moments notice to leap from their frames and annihilate this mysterious product of modern days who in black clothes and silk hat unarmed and without physical strength yet wielded the powers of life and death as surely as they in their time had done  the detective rose from his seat and walked around the room he made a show of examining the arms against the walls the brocaded hangings with their wonderful design of faded gold the ivory statuettes the black god who sat on his haunches and into whose face seemed carved some dumb but eternal power movement was in some respects a solace but the sound of a hansom bell tinkling outside was a much greater relief he crossed to the windows and looked out over the somewhat silent square a hurdygurdy was playing in the corner opposite the club just visible from where he stood the members were passing in and out the commissionaire stood stolidly in his place raising every now and then his cab whistle to his lips a flickering sunlight fell upon the windshaken lilac trees in the square enclosure inspector jacks found himself wishing that the perfume of those lilacs might reach even to where he stood and help him to forget for a moment that subtler and to him curiously unpleasant odor which all the time became more and more apparent so overpowering did he feel it that he tried even to open the window but found it an impossible task the atmosphere seemed to him to be becoming absolutely stifling  he turned around and walked uneasily toward the door he decided then that this was some sort of gruesome nightmare with which he was afflicted he was quite certain that in a few minutes he would wake in his little iron bedstead with the sweat upon his forehead and a reproachful consciousness of having eaten an indiscreet supper it could not possibly be a happening in real life it could not be true that his knees were sinking beneath the weight of his body that the clanging of iron hammers was really smiting the drums of his ears that the purple of the room was growing red and that his veins were strained to bursting he threw out his arms in a momentary instinct of fiercely struggling consciousness the idols on the walls jeered at him those strangely clad warriors seemed to him now to be looking down upon his discomfiture with a satanic smile mocking the pygmy who had dared to raise his hand against one so jealously guarded clang once more went the blacksmiths hammers and then chaos  the end of the nightmare was not altogether according to inspector jacks expectations he found himself in a small back room stretched upon a sofa before the open frenchwindows through which came a pleasant vision of waving green trees and a pleasanter stream of fresh air his first instinct was to sniff and a sense of relief crept through him when he realized that this room at any rate was free from abnormal odors he sat up on the couch a palefaced japanese servant stood by his side with a glass in his hand a few feet away the man whom he had come to visit was looking down upon him with an expression of grave concern in his kindly face  you are better i trust sir prince maiyo said  i am better inspector jacks muttered i dont knowi cant imagine what happened to me  you were not feeling quite well perhaps this morning the prince said soothingly a little run down no doubt your professioni gather from your card that you come from scotland yardis an arduous one i came into the room and found you lying upon your back gasping for breath  inspector jacks was making a swift recovery he noticed that the glass which the manservant was holding was empty he had a dim recollection of something having been forced through his lips already he was beginning to feel himself again  i was absolutely and entirely well he declared stoutly both when i left home this morning and when i entered that room to wait for you i dont know what it was that came over me he continued doubtfully but the atmosphere seemed suddenly to become unbearable  prince maiyo nodded understandingly  people often complain he admitted so many of my hangings in the room have been wrapped in spices to preserve them and my people burn dead blossoms there occasionally some of us too he concluded are very susceptible to strange odors i should imagine perhaps that you are one of them  inspector jacks shook his head  i call myself a strong man he said and i couldnt have believed that anything of the sort would have happened to me  i shouldnt worry about it the prince said gently go and see your doctor if you like but i have known many people perfectly healthy affected in the same way i understood that you wished to have a word with me do you feel well enough to enter upon your business now or would you prefer to make another appointment  i am feeling quite well again thank you the inspector said slowly if you could spare me a few minutes i should be glad to explain the matter which brought me here  the prince merely glanced at his servant who bowed and glided noiselessly from the room then he drew an easy chair to the side of the couch where mr jacks was still sitting  i am very much interested to meet you mr inspector jacks he remarked with a glance at the card which he was still holding in his fingers i have studied very many of your english institutions during my stay over here with much interest but it has not been my good fortune to have come into touch at all with your police system sir goreham briggsyour chief i believehas invited me several times to scotland yard and i have always meant to avail myself of his kindness you come to me perhaps from him  the inspector shook his head  my business prince he said is a little more personal  prince maiyo raised his eyebrows  indeed he said well whatever it is let us hear it i trust that i have not unconsciously transgressed against your laws  inspector jacks hesitated after all his was not so easy a task  prince he said my errand is not in any way a pleasant one and i should be very sorry indeed to find myself in the position of bringing any annoyance upon a stranger and a gentleman who is so highly esteemed at the same time there are certain duties in connection with my everyday life which i cannot ignore in england as i dare say you know sir the law is a great leveller i have heard that it is not quite so in your country but over here we all stand equal in its sight  that is excellent the prince said please believe mr inspector jacks that i do not wish to stand for a single moment between you and your duty whatever it may be let me hear just what you have to say as though i were an ordinary dweller here while i am in england at any rate he added with a smile i am subject to your laws and i do my best to obey them  it has fallen to my lot inspector jacks said to take charge of the investigations following upon the murder of a man named hamilton fynes who was killed on his way from liverpool to london about a fortnight ago  the prince inclined his head  i believe he said amiably that i remember hearing the matter spoken of it was the foundation of a debate i recollect at a recent dinner party as to the extraordinarily exaggerated value people in your country seem to claim for human life as compared to us orientals but pray proceed mr inspector jacks the prince continued courteously the investigation i am sure is in most able hands  you are very kind sir said the inspector i do my best but i might admit to you that i have never found a case so difficult to grasp our methods perhaps are slow but they are in a sense sure we are building up our case and we hope before long to secure the criminal but it is not an easy task  the prince bowed this time he made no remark  the evidence which i have collected from various sources inspector jacks continued leads me to believe that the person who committed this murder was a foreigner  what you call an alien the prince suggested there is much discussion i gather concerning their presence in this country nowadays  the evidence which i possess the detective proceeded points to the murderer belonging to the same nationality as your highness  the prince raised his eyebrows  a japanese he asked  the inspector assented  i am sorry the prince said with a touch of added gravity in his manner that one of my race should have committed a misdemeanor in this country but if that is so your way of course is clear you must arrest him and deal with him as an ordinary english criminal he is here to live your life and he must obey your laws  in time sir inspector jacks said slowly we hope to do so but over here we may not arrest upon suspicion we have to collect evidence and build and build until we can satisfy any reasonable individual that the accused person is guilty  the prince sighed sympathetically  it is not for me he said to criticize your methods  i come now inspector jacks said slowly to the object of my call upon your highness following upon what i have just told you certain other information has come into my possession to this effectthat not only was this murderer a japanese but we have evidence which seems to suggest that he was attached in some way to your household  to my household the prince repeated  to this household your highness the detective repeated  the prince shook his head slowly  mr jacks he said you are i am sure a very clever man let me ask you one question has it ever fallen to your lot to make a mistake  very often indeed the inspector admitted frankly  then i am afraid the prince said that you are once more in that position i have attached to my household fourteen japanese servants a secretary a majordomo and a butler it may interest you perhaps to know that during my residence in this country not one of my retinue with the exception of my secretary who has been in paris for some weeks has left this house  the inspector stared at the prince incredulously  never left the house he repeated do you mean sir that they do not go out for holidays for exercise to the theatre  the prince shook his head  such things are not the custom with us he said they are my servants the duty of their life is service london is a world unknown to themlondon and all these western cities they have no desire to be made mock of in your streets their life is given to my interests they do not need distractions  inspector jacks was dumfounded such a state of affairs seemed to him impossible  do you mean that they do not take exercise he asked that they never breathe the fresh air  the prince smiled  such fresh air as your city can afford them he said is to be found in the garden there into which i never penetrate and which is for their use i see that you look amazed mr inspector jacks this thing which i have told you seems strange no doubt but you must not confuse the servants of my country with the servants of yours i make no comment upon the latter you know quite well what they are so do i with us service is a religionservice to country and service to master these men who perform the duties of my household would give their lives for me as cheerfully as they would for their country should the occasion arise  but their health the inspector protested it is not surely well for them to be herded together like this  the prince smiled  i am not what is called a sportsman in this country mr inspector jacks he said but you shall go to the house of any nobleman you choose and if you will bring me an equal number of your valets or footmen or chefs who can compete with mine in running or jumping or wrestling then i will give you a prize what you willa hundred pounds or more you see my servants have learned the secret of diet they drink nothing save water sickness is unknown to them  the inspector was silent for some time then he rose to his feet  prince he said what should you declare then if i told you that a man of obvious japanese extraction was seen to enter your house on the morning after the murder and that he was a person to whom certain circumstances pointed as being concerned in that deed  mr inspector jacks the prince said calmly i was the only person of my race who entered my house that morning  the inspector moved toward the door  your highness he said gravely i am exceedingly obliged to you for your courteous attention and for your kindness after my unfortunate indisposition  the prince smiled graciously  mr inspector jacks he said your visit has been of great interest to me if i can be of any further assistance pray do not hesitate to call upon me    chapter xxiii on the trail  inspector jacks studied the brass plate for a moment and then rang the patients bell the former he noticed was very much in want of cleaning and for a doctors residence there was a certain lack of smartness about the house and its appointments which betokened a limited practice the railing in front was broken and no pretence had been made at keeping the garden in order inspector jacks had time to notice these things for it was not until after his second summons that the door was opened by dr whiles himself  good morning the latter said tentatively then with a slight air of disappointment he recognized his visitor  good morning doctor inspector jacks replied you havent forgotten me i hope i came down to see you a short time ago respecting the man who was knocked down by a motor car and treated by you on a certain evening  the doctor nodded  will you come in he asked  he led the way into a somewhat dingy waiting room a copy of the field a month old a dogeared magazine and a bound volume of good words were spread upon the table the room itself except for a few chairs was practically bare  i do not wish to take up too much of your time dr whiles the inspector began  the doctor laughed shortly  you neednt bother about that he said im tired of making a bluff my time isnt any too well occupied  the inspector glanced at his watchit was a few minutes past twelve  if you are really not busy he said i was about to suggest to you that you should come back to town with me and lunch i do not expect of course to take up your day for nothing he continued you will understand as a professional man that when your services are required by the authorities they expect and are willing to pay for them  but what use can i be to you the doctor asked you know all about the man whom i fixed up on the night of the murder theres nothing more to tell you about that id as soon go up to town and lunch with you as not but if you think that ive anything more to tell you youll only be disappointed  the inspector nodded  im quite content to run the risk of that he said of course he continued it does not follow in the least that this person was in any way connected with the murder in fact so far as i can tell at present the chances are very much against it but at the same time it would interest my chief if you were able to identify him  the doctor nodded  i begin to understand he said  if you will consider a day spent up in town equivalent to the treatment of twentyfive patients at your ordinary scale inspector jacks said i shall be glad if you would accompany me there by the next train we will lunch together first and look for our friend later in the afternoon  the doctor did not attempt to conceal the fact that he found this suggestion entirely satisfactory in less than half an hour the two men were on their way to town  curiously enough penelope and prince maiyo met that morning for the first time in several days they were both guests of the duchess of devenham at a large luncheon party at the savoy restaurant penelope felt a little shiver when she saw him coming down the stairs somehow or other she had dreaded this meeting yet when it came she knew that it was a relief there was no change in his manner no trace of anxiety in his smooth unruffled face he seemed if possible to have grown younger to walk more buoyantly his eyes met hers frankly his smile was wholly unembarrassed it was not possible for a man to bear himself thus who stood beneath the great shadow  so far from avoiding her he came over to her side directly he had greeted his hostess  this morning he said i heard some good news you are to be a fellow guest at devenham  i am afraid she admitted that of my two aunts i impose most frequently upon the one where my claims are the slightest the duchess is so goodnatured  she is charming the prince declared i am looking forward to my visit immensely i think i am a little weary of london a visit to the country seems to me most delightful they tell me too that your spring gardens are wonderful what london suffers from i think at this time of the year is a lack of flowers we want something to remind us that the spring is coming besides these occasional gleams of blue sky and very occasional bursts of sunshine  you are a sentimentalist prince she declared smiling  no i think not he answered seriously i love all beautiful things i think that there are many men as well as women who are like that shall i be very rude and say that in the matter of climate and flowers one grows perhaps to expect a little more in my own country  an uncontrollable impulse moved her she leaned a little towards him  climate and flowers only she murmured what about the third essential  miss penelope he said under his breath i have to admit that one must travel further afield for heavens greatest gift even then one can only worship the stars are denied to us  the duchess came sailing over to them  every one is here she said i hope that you are all hungry after lunch prince i want you to speak to general sherrif he has been dying to meet you to talk over your campaign together in manchuria theres another man who is anxious to meet you tooprofessor spenlove he has been to japan for a month and thinks about writing a book on your customs i believe he looks to you to correct his impressions  so long as he does not ask me to correct his proofs the prince murmured  that is positively the most unkind thing i have ever heard you say the duchess declared come along you good people jules has promised me a new omelet on condition that we sit down at precisely halfpast one if we are five minutes late he declines to send it up  they took their places at the round table which had been reserved for the duchess of devenhamnot very far penelope remembered from the table at which they had sat for dinner a little more than a fortnight ago the recollection of that evening brought her a sudden realization of the tragedy which seemed to have taken her life into its grip again the prince sat by her side she watched him with eyes in which there was a gleam sometimes almost of horror easy and natural as usual with his pleasant smile and simple speech he was making himself agreeable to one of the older ladies of the party to whom by chance no one had addressed more than a word or so it was always the samealways like this she realized with a sudden keen apprehension of this part of the mans nature if there was a kindness to be done a thoughtful action it was not only he who did it but it was he who first thought of it the papers during the last few days had been making public an incident which he had done his best to keep secret he had signalized his arrival in london some months ago by going overboard from a police boat into the thames to rescue a halfdrunken lighterman and when the humane society had voted him their medal he had accepted it only on condition that the presentation was private and kept out of the papers it was not one but fifty kindly deeds which stood to his credit always with the manners of a princegracious courteous and genialnever a word had passed his lips of evil towards any human being the barriers today between the smoking room and the drawing room are shadowy things and she knew very well that he was held in a somewhat curious respect by men as a person to whom it was impossible to tell a story in which there was any shadow of indelicacy the ways of the socalled man of world seemed in his presence as though they must be the ways of some creature of a different and a lower stage of existence a young man whom he had once corrected had christened him half jestingly sir galahad and certainly his life in london a life which had to bear all the while the test of the limelight had appeared to merit some such title these thoughts chased one another through her mind as she looked at him and marvelled surely those other things must be part of a bad nightmare it was not possible that such a man could be associated with wrongdoingsuch manner of wrongdoing  even while these thoughts passed through her brain he turned to talk to her and she felt at once that little glow of pleasure which the sound of his voice nearly always evoked  i am looking forward so much he said to my stay at devenham you know it will not be very much longer that i shall have the opportunity of accepting such invitations  you mean that the time is really coming when we shall lose you she asked suddenly  when my work is finished i return home he answered i fancy that it will not be very long now  when you do leave england she asked after a moments pause do you go straight to japan  he bowed  with the continent i have finished he said the cruiser which his majesty has sent to fetch me waits even now at southampton  you speak of your work she remarked as though you had been collecting material for a book  he smiled  i have been busy collecting information in many ways he saidtrying to live your life and feel as you feel trying to understand those things in your country and in other countries too which seem at first so strange to us who come from the other side of the east  and the end of it all she asked  his eyes gleamed for a moment with a light which she did not understand his smile was tolerant even genial but his face remained like the face of a sphinx  it is for the good of japan i came he said for her good that i have stayed here so long at the same time it has been very pleasant i have met with great kindness  she leaned a little forward so as to look into his face the impassivity of his features was like a wall before her  after all she said i suppose it is a period of probation you are like a schoolboy already who is looking forward to his holidays you will be very happy when you return  i shall be very happy indeed he admitted simply why not i am a true son of japan and for every true son of his country absence from her is as hard a thing to be borne as absence from ones own family  somerfield who was sitting on her other side insisted at last upon diverting her attention  penelope he declared lowering his voice a little it isnt fair you never have a word to say to me when the prince is here  she smiled  you must remember that he is going away very soon charlie she reminded him  good job too somerfield muttered sotto voce  and then penelope continued with the air of not having heard her companions last remark he possesses also a very great attraction he is absolutely unlike any other human being i ever met or heard of  somerfield glanced across at his rival with lowering brows  ive nothing to say against the fellow he remarked except that it seems queer nowadays to run up against a man of his birth who is not a sportsmanin the sense of being fond of sport i mean he corrected himself quickly  sometimes i wonder penelope said thoughtfully whether such speeches as the one which you have just made do not indicate something totally wrong in our modern life you for instance have no profession charlie and you devote your life to a systematic course of what is nothing more or less than pleasureseeking you hunt or you shoot you play polo or golf you come to town or you live in the country entirely according to the seasons if any one asked you why you had not chosen a profession you would as good as tell them that it was because you were a rich man and had no need to work for your living that is practically what it comes to you englishmen work only if you need money if you do not need money you play the prince is wealthy but his profession was ordained for him from the moment when he left the cradle the end and aim of his life is to serve his country and i believe that he would consider it sacrilege if he allowed any slighter things to divert at any time his mind from its main purpose he would feel like a priest who has broken his ordination vows  thats all very well somerfield said coolly but theres nothing in life nowadays to make us quite so strenuous as that  isnt there penelope answered you are an englishman and you should know are you convinced then that your country today is at the height of her prosperity safe and sound bound to go on triumphant prosperous without the constant care of her men  somerfield looked up at her in growing amazement  what on earths got hold of you penelope he asked have you been reading the sensational papers or stuffing yourself up with jingoism or what  she laughed  none of those things i can assure you she said a man like the prince makes one think because you see every standard of life we have is a standard of comparison when one sees the sort of man he is one wonders when one sees how far apart he is from you englishmen in his ideals and the way he spends his life one wonders again  somerfield shrugged his shoulders  we do well enough he said japan is the youngest of the nations she has a long way to go to catch us up  we do well enough she repeated under her breath there was a great city once which adopted that as her mottopeople dig up mementoes of her sometimes from under the sands  somerfield looked at her in an aggrieved fashion  well he said i thought that this was to be an amusing luncheon party  you should have talked more to lady grace she answered i am sure that she is quite ready to believe that you are perfection and the english army the one invincible institution in the world you mustnt take me too seriously today charlie i have a headache and i think that it has made me dull  they trooped out into the foyer in irregular fashion to take their coffee the prince and penelope were side by side  what i like about your restaurant life the prince said is the strange mixture of classes which it everywhere reveals  those two for instance penelope said and then stopped short  the prince followed her slight gesture inspector jacks and dr spencer whiles were certainly just a little out of accord with their surroundings the detectives clothes were too new and his companions too old the doctors clothes indeed were as shabby as his waiting room and he sat where the sunlight was merciless  how singular the prince remarked with a smile that you should have pointed those two men out one of them i know and if you will excuse me for a moment i should like to speak to him  penelope was not capable of any immediate answer the prince with a kindly and yet gracious smile walked over to inspector jacks who rose at once to his feet  i hope you have quite recovered mr inspector the prince said holding out his hand in friendly fashion i have felt very guilty over your indisposition i am sure that i keep my rooms too close for english people  thank you prince the inspector answered i am perfectly well again in fact i have not felt anything of my little attack since  the prince smiled  i am glad he said next time you are good enough to pay me a visit i will see that you do not suffer in the same way  he nodded kindly and rejoined his friends the inspector resumed his seat and busied himself with relighting his cigar he purposely did not even glance at his companion  who was that the doctor asked curiously did you call him prince  inspector jacks sighed this was a disappointment to him  his name is prince maiyo he said slowly he is a japanese  the doctor looked across the restaurant with puzzled face  its queer he said how all these japanese seem to one to look so much alike and yet  he broke off in the middle of his sentence  you are thinking of your friend of the other night the inspector remarked  i was the doctor admitted for a moment it seemed to me like the same man with a different manner  inspector jacks was silent he puffed steadily at his cigar  you dont suppose he asked quietly that it could have been the same man  the doctor was still looking across the room  i could not tell he said i should like to see him again i wasnt prepared and there was something so altered in his tone and the way he carried himself and yet  the pause was expressive inspector jacks eyes brightened he hated to feel that his day had been altogether wasted    chapter xxiv prince maiyo bids high  inspector jacks was in luck at last eleven times he had called at st thomass hospital and received the same reply today he was asked to wait the patient was betterwould be able to see him soon a nurse in neat uniform came quietly down the corridor and took charge of him  ten minutes no more she insisted goodhumoredly  the inspector nodded  one question if you please nurse he asked is the man going to live  not a doubt about it she declared why  a matter of depositions the inspector exclaimed id rather let it go though if hes sure to recover  its a simple case she answered and his constitution is excellent there isnt the least need for your to think about depositions here he is dont talk too long  the inspector sat down by the bedside the patient a young man welcomed him a little shyly  you have come to ask me about what i saw in pall mall and opposite the hyde park hotel he said speaking slowly and in a voice scarcely raised above a whisper i told them all before the operation but they couldnt send for you then there wasnt time  the inspector nodded  tell me your own way he said dont hurry we can get the particulars later on glad youre going to be mended  it was touch and go the young man declared with a note of awe in his tone if the omnibus wheel had turned a foot more i should have lost both my legs it was all through watching that chap hop out of the taxicab too  the inspector inclined his head gravely  you saw him get in didnt you he asked  thats so the patient admitted i was on my waycharing cross to the kensington palace hotel on a bicycle there was a blockcorner of pall mall and haymarket i caught holdtaxi in frontto steady me  the nurse bent over him with a glass in her hand she raised him a little with the other arm  not too much of this you know young man she said with a pleasant smile heres something to make you strong  right you are  he drained the contents of the glass and smacked his lips  jolly good stuff he declared where was i mr inspector  holding the back of a taxicab corner of regent street and haymarket inspector jacks reminded him  the patient nodded  there was an electric brougham he continued drawn up alongside the taxi while we were there waiting i saw a chap get out speak to some one through the window of the taxi open the door and step in when we moved on he stayed in the taxi dark slim chap he was the patient continued a regular howling swellsilk hat white muffler white kid glovesall the rest of it  and afterwards the inspector asked  i kept behind the taxi the youth continued we got blocked again at hyde park corner i saw him step out of the taxi and disappear amongst the vehicles a moment or two later i passed the taxi and looked insaw something had happenedthe fellow was lying sideways it gave me a bit of a start i skidded and over i went sort of had an idea that every one in the world had started shouting to me and felt that i was half underneath an omnibus woke up to find myself here  should you know the man again the inspector asked i mean the man whom you saw enter and leave the taxi  i think sopretty sure  the nurse came up shaking her head inspector jacks rose from his seat  right nurse he said im off take care of our young friend he is going to be very useful to us as soon as he can use his feet and get about ill come and sit with you for half an hour next visiting day if i may he added turning to the patient  glad to see you the youth answered my people live down in the country and i havent many pals  inspector jacks left the hospital thoughtfully the smell of anaesthetics somehow reminded him of the library in the house at the corner of st james square it was not altogether by chance perhaps that he found himself walking in that direction he was in pall mall in fact before he realized where he was and at the corner of st james square and pall mall he came face to face with prince maiyo walking slowly westwards  the meeting between the two men was a characteristic one the inspector suffered no signs of surprise or even interest to creep into his expressionless face the prince on the other hand did not attempt to conceal his pleasure at this unexpected encounter his lips parted in a delightful smile he ignored the inspectors somewhat stiff salute and insisted upon shaking him cordially by the hand  mr inspector jacks he said you are the one person whom i desired to see you are not busy i hope you can talk with me for five minutes  the inspector hesitated for a moment he was versed in every form of duplicity and yet he felt that in the presence of this young aristocrat who was smiling upon him so delightfully he was little more than a babe in wisdom an amateur pure and simple he was conscious too of a sentiment which rarely intruded itself into his affairs he was conscious of a strong liking for this debonair pleasantfaced young man who treated him not only as an equal but as an equal in whose society he found an especial pleasure  i have the time to spare sir certainly he admitted  the prince smiled gayly  inspector jacks he said you are a wonderful man even now you are asking yourself what does he want to say to meprince maiyo is he going to ask me questions or will he tell me things which i should like to hear you know mr inspector jacks between ourselves you are just a little interested in me is it not so  the detective was dumb he stood there patiently waiting he had the air of a man who declines to commit himself  just a little interested in me i think the prince murmured smiling at his companion ah well many of the things i do over here perhaps must seem very strange and that reminds me only a short time ago you were asking questions about the man who travelled from liverpool to london and reached his destination with a dagger through his heart tell me mr inspector jacks have you discovered the murderer yet  not yet the detective answered  i have heard you speak of this affair the prince continued and before now i expected to read in the papers that you had put your hand upon the guilty one if you have not done so i am very sure that there is some explanation  it is better sometimes to wait the detective said quietly  the prince bowed as one who understands  i think so he assented i think i follow you on the very next day there was another tragedy which seemed to me even more terrible i mean the murder of that young fellow vanderpole of the american embassy mr inspector jacks has it ever occurred to you i wonder that it might be as well to let the solution of one await the solution of the other  inspector jacks shrugged his shoulders  occasionally he admitted reluctantly when one is following up a clue one discovers things  you are wonderful the prince declared you are indeed i know what is in your mind you have said to yourself between these two murders there is some connection they were both done by the hand of a master criminal the victims in both cases were americans you said to yourself first of all i will discover the motive then perhaps a clue which seems to belong to the one will lead me to the other or both you are not sure which way to turn there is nothing there upon which you can lay your hand you say to yourself i will make a bluff that is the word is it not you come to me you tell me gravely that you have reason to suspect some one in my household that is because you believe that the crimes were perpetrated by some one of my country you do not ask for information you think perhaps that i would not give it you confront me with a statement it was very clever of you mr inspector jacks  i had reason for what i did sir the detective said  no doubt the prince agreed and now tell me when are you going to electrify us all when is the great arrest to take place  the detective coughed discreetly  i am not yet in a position sir he said to make any definite announcement  cautious mr jacks cautious the prince remarked smilingly it is a great qualitya quality which i too have learned how to appreciate and now for our five minutes talk if i say to you return home with me i think you will remember that unpleasant room of mine and you will recollect an important engagement at scotland yard in the clubs one is always overheard walk with me a little way mr jacks in st james park we can speak there without fear of interruption come  he thrust his arm through the detectives and led him across the street mr inspector jacks was only human and he yielded without protest they passed st james palace and on to the broad promenade where there were few passersby and no listeners  you see my dear inspector the prince said i am really a sojourner in your marvellous city not altogether for pleasure my stay over here is more in the light of a mission i have certain arrangements which i wish to effect for the good of my country amongst them is one concerning which i should like to speak to you  to me sir inspector jacks repeated  the prince twirled his cane and nodded his head  it is a very important matter mr jacks he said it is nothing less than a desire on the part of the city government of tokio to perfect thoroughly their police system on the model of yours over here we are a progressive nation you know mr jacks but we are also a young nation and though i think that we advance all the time we are still in many respects a long way behind you we have no scotland yard in tokio to be frank with you the necessity for such an institution has become a real thing with us only during the last few years do you read history mr jacks  the inspector was doubtful  i cant say sir he admitted that i have done much reading since i left school and that was many years ago  well the prince said it is one of the axioms of history mr jacks that as a country becomes civilized and consequently more prosperous there is a corresponding growth in her criminal classes a corresponding need for a different state of laws by which to judge them a different machinery for checking their growth we have arrived at that position in japan and in my latest despatches from home comes to me a request that i send them out a man who shall reorganize our entire police system i am a judge of character mr jacks and if i can get the man i want i do not need to ask my friends at downing street to help me i should like you to accept that post  the inspector was scarcely prepared for this he allowed himself to show some surprise  i am very much obliged to you prince for the offer he said i am afraid however that i should not be competent  that the prince reminded him is a risk which we are willing to take  i do not think either the detective continued that at my time of life i should care to go so far from home to settle down in an altogether strange country  it must be as you will of course the prince declared only remember mr jacks that a great nation like mine which wants a particular man for a particular purpose is not afraid to pay for him your work out there would certainly take you no more than three years for that three years work you would receive the sum of thirty thousand pounds  the detective gasped  it is a great sum he said  the prince shrugged his shoulders  you could hardly call it that he said still it would enable you to live in comfort for the rest of your life  and when should i be required to start sir the inspector asked  that perhaps the prince replied would seem the hardest part of all you would be required to start tomorrow afternoon from southampton at four oclock  the inspector started then a new light dawned suddenly in his face  tomorrow afternoon he murmured  the prince assented  so far as regards your position at scotland yard he said i have influential friends in your government who will put that right for you you need not be afraid of any unpleasantness in that direction remember mr inspector thirty thousand pounds and a free hand while you are in my country you are a man i should judge of fiftytwo or fiftythree years of age you can spend your fiftysixth birthday in england then and be a man of means for the remainder of your days  and this sum of money the detective said is for my services in building up the police force of tokio  broadly speaking yes the prince answered  and incidentally the detective continued glancing cautiously at his companion it is the price of my leaving unsuspected the murderer of two innocent men  the prince walked on in silence every line in his face seemed slowly to have hardened his brows had contracted he was looking steadfastly forward at the great front of buckingham palace  i am disappointed in you mr jacks he said a little stiffly i do not understand your allusion the money i have mentioned is to be paid to you for certain welldefined services the other matter you speak of does not interest me it is no concern of mine whether this man of whom you are in search is brought to justice or not all that i wish to hear from you is whether or not you accept my offer  the inspector shook his head  prince he said there can be no question about that i thank you very much for it but i must decline  your mind is quite made up the prince asked regretfully  quite the inspector said firmly  japan the prince said thoughtfully is a pleasant country  london suits me moderately well inspector jacks declared  under certain conditions the prince continued i should have imagined that the climate here might prove most unhealthy for you you must remember that i was a witness of your slight indisposition the other day  in my profession sir the detective said we must take our risks  the prince came to a standstill they were at the parting of the ways  i am very sorry he said simply it was a great post and it was one which you would have filled well it is not for me however to press the matter  it would make no difference sir the detective answered  the prince was on the point of moving away  i shall not seek in any case to persuade you he said my offer remains open if you should change your mind think too over what i have said about our climate at your time of life mr inspector jacks and particularly at this season of the year one should be careful a sea voyage now would i am convinced be the very thing for you good day mr jacks  the prince turned towards buckingham palace and the inspector slowly retraced his steps  it is a bribe he muttered to himself slowlya cleverly offered bribe thirty thousand pounds to forget the little i have learned thirty thousand pounds for silence    chapter xxv hobsons choice  there were some days when the absence of patients seemed to dr spencer whiles a thing almost insupportable too late he began to realize that he had set up in the wrong neighborhood in years to come he reflected gloomily when the great building estate which was to have been developed more than a year ago was really opened up there might be an opportunity where he was a very excellent opportunity too for a young doctor of ability just now however the outlook was almost hopeless he found himself even looking eagerly forward every day for another visit from mr inspector jacks another trip to town would mean a peep into the world of luxury whose doors were so closely barred against him and what was more important still it would mean a fee which would keep the wolf from the door for another week it had come to that with dr whiles his little stock of savings was exhausted unless something turned up within the course of the next few weeks he knew very well that there was nothing left for him to do but to slip away quietly into the embrace of the more shady parts of the great city to find a situation somewhere somehow beyond the ken of the disappointed creditors whom he would leave behind  mr inspector jacks however had apparently no further use for the present at any rate for his medical friend on the other hand dr spencer whiles was not left wholly to himself on the fourth day after his visit to london a motor car drew up outside his modest surgery door and with an excitement which he found it almost impossible to conceal he saw a plainly dressed young man evidently a foreigner and he believed a japanese descend and ring the patients bell the doctor had dismissed his boy a week ago from sheer inability to pay his modest wages and he did not hesitate for a moment about opening the door himself the man outside raised his hat and made him a sweeping bow  it is dr spencer whiles he asked  the doctor admitted the fact and invited his visitor to enter  it is here perhaps the latter continued that a gentleman who was riding a bicycle and was run into by a motor car was brought after the accident and treated so skilfully  that is so dr whiles admitted there was nothing much the matter with him he had rather a narrow escape  i am that gentlemans servant the visitor continued with a bland smile he has sent me down here to see you the leg which was injured is perfectly well but there was a pain in the side of which he spoke to you which has not disappeared this morning in fact it is worsemuch worse my master therefore has sent me to you he begs that if it is not inconvenient you will return with me at once and examine him  the doctor drew a little breath this might mean another week or so of respite  where does your master live he asked the man  in the west end of london sir was the reply the square of st james it is called  dr whiles glanced at his watch  it will take me some time to go there with you he said and i shall have to arrange with a friend to treat any other patients do you think your master will understand that i shall need an increased fee  my master desired me to say the other answered that he would be prepared to pay any fee you cared to mention money is not of account with him he has not had occasion to seek medical advice in london and as he is leaving very soon he did not wish to send for a strange physician he remembered with gratitude your care of him and he sends for you  thats all right dr whiles declared so long as its understood youll excuse me for a moment while i write a note and ill come along  dr whiles had no note to write but he made a few changes in his toilet which somewhat improved his appearance in due course he reappeared and was rapidly whirled up to london the sole passenger in the magnificent car the man who had brought him the message from his quondam patient was sitting in front next the chauffeur so dr whiles had no opportunity of asking him for any information concerning his master nor did the car itself slacken speed until it drew up before the door of the large corner house in st james square a footman in dark livery came running out a butler bowed upon the steps dr spencer whiles was immensely impressed the servants were all japanese but their livery and manners were faultless he made his way into the hall and followed the butler up the broad stairs  my master the latter explained will receive you very shortly he is but partly dressed at present  dr spencer whiles came of a family of successful tradespeople and he was not used to such quiet magnificence as was everywhere displayed yet with it all there seemed to him to be an air of gloom about the place something almost mysterious in the silence of the thick carpets the subdued voices and the absence of maidservants the house itself was apparently an old one he noticed that the doors were very heavy and thick the corridors roomy the absence of light almost remarkable the apartment into which he was shown however came as a pleasant surprise it was small but delightfully furnished in the most modern fashion its only drawback was that it looked out upon a blank wall  my master will come to you in a few minutes the butler announced what refreshments may i have the honor of serving  dr whiles waved aside the invitationhe would at any rate remain professional the man withdrew and almost immediately afterwards prince maiyo entered the room the doctor rose to his feet with a little thrill of excitement the prince held out his hand  i am very pleased to see you again doctor he said you looked after me so well last time that i was afraid i should have no excuse for sending for you  i am glad to find that you are not suffering the doctor answered i understood from your servant that you were feeling a good deal of pain in the side  it troubles me at times the prince admitted drawing a chair up towards his visitorjust sufficiently perhaps to give me the excuse of seeking a little conversation with you you must let me offer you something after your ride  you are very good the doctor answered perhaps i had better examine you first  the prince rang the bell and waved aside the suggestion  that he said can wait in my country you know we do not consider that a guest is properly treated unless he partakes of our hospitality the moment he crosses the threshold the whiskey and soda water he ordered of the butler who appeared at the door we will talk of my ailments the prince continued in a moment or two tell me what you thought of that marvellous restaurant where i saw you the other morning  the doctor drew a little breath  it was you then he exclaimed  but naturally the prince murmured i took it for granted that you would recognize me  the doctor found some difficulty in proceeding he was trying to imagine the cousin of an emperor riding a bicycle along a country road staggering into his surgery at midnight covered with dust inarticulate pointing only to the wounds beneath his cheap clothes  nothing the prince continued easily has impressed me more in your country than the splendor of your restaurants you see that side of your life represents something we are altogether ignorant of in japan  it is a very wonderful place the doctor admitted we had luncheon my friend and i in the grillroom but we came for a few minutes into the foyer to watch the people from the restaurant  the prince nodded genially  by the bye he remarked it is strange that my very good friendmr inspector jacksshould also be a friend of yours  he is scarcely that the doctor objected i have known him for a very short time  the prince raised his eyebrows the whiskey and soda were brought and the doctor helped himself how curiously deficient these westerners were the prince thought in every instinct of duplicity as clearly as possible the doctor had revealed the fact that his acquaintance with inspector jacks was of precisely that nature which might have been expected  the prince sighed there was but one course open to him  now dr whiles he said i will tell you something you must listen to me very carefully please i sent for you not so much on account of any immediate pain but because my general health has been giving me a little trouble lately i have come to the conclusion that i require the services of a medical attendant always at hand  the doctor looked at his prospective patient skeptically  you have not the appearance he remarked of being in ill health  perhaps not the prince answered perhaps even there is not for the moment very much the matter with me one has humors you know my dear doctor i have a somewhat large suite here with me in england but i do not number amongst them a physician i wanted to ask you to accept that position in my household for two months  do you mean come and live here the doctor asked  that is exactly what i do mean the prince answered i am thankful to observe that your apprehensions are so acute i warn you that i am going to make some very curious conditions i do not know whether money is an object to you if not i am powerless if it is i propose to make it worth your while  the doctor did not hesitate  money he said is the greatest object in life to me i have none and i want some very badly  the prince smiled  i find your candor delightful he declared now tell me dr whiles how many patients have you in your neighborhood absolutely dependent upon your services  the doctor hesitated opened his mouth and closed it again  not one he declared  once more the princes lips parted his smile this time was definite transfiguring  i find you dr whiles he announced a most charmingly reasonable person i make you my offer then with every confidence although i warn you that there will be some strange conditions attached to it i ask you to accept the post of private physician to this household for the space of oneit may be two months and i offer you also as an honorarium the fee of one thousand guineas  the doctor sat quite still for a moment he was in a condition when speech was difficult then his eyes fell upon his tumbler of whiskey and soda still half filled he emptied it at a draught  a thousand guineas he repeated hoarsely  i trust that you will find the sum attractive the prince said smoothly because as i have warned you before there are one or two curious conditions coupled with the post  i dont care what the conditions are the doctor said slowly i accept  the prince nodded  you are the man i thought you were doctor he said the first condition then is this you see the sitting room we are now ina pleasant little apartment i thinkbooks you see papers a smoking cabinet in which i can assure you that you will find the finest havana cigars and the best cigarettes to be procured in london through herethe prince threw open an inner dooris a small sleeping apartment it has as you see the same outlook it is comfortable if not luxurious  the doctor sighed  i am not used to luxury he said  these two rooms will be yours the prince announced and the first condition of our arrangement is that until two months are up or our engagement is finished you do not leave them  the doctor stared at him blankly  are you in earnest sir he asked  in absolute earnest the prince assured him not only that but i require you to keep your whereabouts until after the period of time i have mentioned an entire secret from every one i gather that you are not married and that there is no one living in your house to whom it would seem necessary to disclose your movements in any case this is another of my conditions you are neither to write nor receive any letters whilst here you are to figure in the neighborhood from which you came as a man who has disappearedas a man in short who has found it impossible to pay his way and has preferred simply to slip out of his place at the end of two months you can reappear or not as you choose that rests with yourself  the doctor smiled faintly to make some sort of disappearance had been his precise intention but to disappear in this fashion and make his return to the world with a thousand guineas in his pocket had not exactly come within the scope of his imagination it was a situation full of allurements nevertheless he was bewildered  i am to live in these two rooms he demanded i am to let no one know where i am to write no letters to receive none my duties are to be simply to treat you  when required the prince remarked dryly  i suppose the doctor asked my friend mr jacks was speaking the truth when he told me your name  my name is prince maiyo the prince said  mechanically the doctor helped himself to another whiskey and soda  you are to be my only patient he said thoughtfully may i take the liberty of feeling your pulse prince  the prince extended his hand the doctor felt it and resumed his seat  there is of course nothing whatever the matter with you he declared you are i should say in absolutely perfect health you have no need of a physician  on the contrary the prince protested smiling i need you dr whiles so much that i am paying you a thousand guineas  to remain in these two rooms the doctor remarked quietly  it is not your business to think that or to know that the prince said do you accept my offer  if i should refuse the doctor asked  the prince hesitated  do not let us suppose that he said it is not a pleasant suggestion i do not think that you mean to refuse  frankly i do not the doctor answered and yet treat it as a whim of mine and answer my question supposing i should  the matter would arrange itself in precisely the same way the prince answered you would not leave these rooms for two months  the doctor leaned back in his chair and laughed shortly  this is rather hard luck on inspector jacks he said he paid me ten guineas the other day to lunch with him  mr inspector jacks the prince remarked is scarcely in a position to bid you an adequate sum for your services  it appears to me the doctor continued that i am kidnapped  an admirable word the prince declared at what time do you usually lunch  the doctor smiled  i am not used to motoring he said or interviews of this exciting character i lunch as a rule when i can get anything to eat the present seems to me to be a most suitable hour  the prince nodded and rose to his feet  i will send my servant he said to take your orders my cook is very highly esteemed here and i can assure you that you will not be starved please also make out a list of the newspapers magazines and books with which you would like to be supplied i fear that for obvious reasons my people would hardly be able to anticipate your wants  and about that examination the doctor remarked  i shall do myself the pleasure of seeing you every day the prince answered there will be time enough for that  with an amiable word of farewell the prince departed the doctor threw himself into an easy chair his single exclamation was laconic but forcible    chapter xxvi some farewells  never did prince maiyo show fewer signs of his japanese origin than when in the company of other men of his own race side by side with his excellency the baron hesho the contrasts in feature and expression were so marked as to make it hard indeed to believe that these two men could belong to the same nation the baron hesho had high cheekbones a yellow skin closecropped black hair and wore goldrimmed spectacles through which he beamed upon the whole world the prince as he lounged in his wicker chair and watched the blue smoke of his cigarette curl upwards looked more like an italianperhaps a spaniard the shape of his head was perfectly western perfectly and typically romanesque the carriage of his body must have been inherited from his mother of whom it was said that no more graceful woman ever walked yet between these two men so different in all externals there was the strongest sympathy although they met but seldom  so we are to lose you soon prince the baron was saying  very soon indeed prince maiyo answered next week i go down to devenham i understand that the prime minister and sir edward bransome will be there if so that i think will be practically my leavetaking there is no object in my staying any longer over here  the baron blinked his eyes meditatively  i have seen very little of you maiyo he said since your last visit to the continent i take it that your views are unchanged  the prince assented  unchanged indeed he answeredunchangeable i think almost that i might now say they have been wonderful months these last months baron he continued i have seen some of those things which we in japan have heard about and wondered about all our lives i have seen the german army at manoeuvres i have talked to their officers where i could i have talked to the men i have been to some of their great socialist meetings i have heard them talk about their country and their emperor and what would happen to their officers if war should come i have seen the french artillery i have been the guest of the president i have tried to understand the peculiar attitude which that country has always adopted toward us i have been unrecognized in st petersburg i have tried to understand a little the resources of that marvellous country i came back here in time for the great review in the solent i have seen the most magnificent ships and the most splendid naval discipline the world has ever known then i have explored the interior of this island as few of our race have explored it before not for the purpose of studying the manufactures the trades the immense shipbuilding industriessimply to study the people themselves  the baron nodded gravely  i ask no questions he said it is the emperors desire i know that you go straight to him i take it that your mind is made upyou have arrived at definite conclusions  absolutely prince maiyo answered i shall make no great secret of them you already my dear baron know i think whither they lead i shall be unpopular for a time i suppose and your own position may be made a little difficult after that things will go on pretty much the same of one thing though i am assured i see it as clearly as the shepherd who has lain the night upon the hillside sees the coming day it may be twelve months it may be two years it may even be three but before that time has passed the clouds will have gathered the storm will have burst then i think hesho our master will be glad that we are free  the baron agreed  only a few nights ago he said captain koki and the other attaches spent an evening with me we have charts and pieces and with locked doors we played a war game of our own invention it should all be over in three weeks  prince maiyo laughed softly  you are right he said i have gone over the ground myself it could be done in even less time you should ask a few of our friends to that war game baron how they would smile you read the newspapers of the country  invariably the ambassador answered  there is an undercurrent of feeling somewhere the prince continuedone of the cheaper organs is shrieking all the time a brazen warning patriotism as you and i understand it dear friend is long since dead but if one strikes hard enough at the flint some fire may come hesho how short our life is how little we can understand we have only the written words of those who have gone before to show us the cities and the empires that have been to teach us the reasons why they decayed and crumbled away we have only our own imagination to help us to look forward into the future and see the empires that may rise the kingdoms that shall stand the kingdoms that shall fall amongst them all hesho there is but this much of truth it is our own dear country and our one great rival across the pacific who in the years to come must fight for the supremacy of the world  it will be no fight that the ambassador answered slowlyno fight unless a new prophet is born to them the moneypoison is sucking the very blood from their body the country is slowly but surely becoming honeycombed with corruption the voices of its children are like the voices from the tower of babel if their strong man should arise then the fight will be the fiercest the world has ever known even then the end is not doubtful the victory will be ours when the universe is left for them and for us it will be our sons who shall rule listen maiyo  i listen the prince answered  the baron hesho had laid aside his spectacles he leaned a little towards his companion his voice had fallen to a whisper his hand fell almost caressingly upon his friends shoulder  i would speak of something else he continued soon you go to the dukes house you will meet there the people who are in authority over this country when you leave it everything is finished tell me is the way homeward safe for you  wonderful person prince maiyo said smiling  no i am not wonderful the ambassador declared all the time i have had my fears why not a month ago i sought your aid i knew from our friends in new york that a man was on his way to england with letters which made clear beyond a doubt the purpose of this world journey of the american fleet i sent for you we both agreed that it was an absolute necessity for us to know the contents of those letters  we discovered them the prince answered it was well that we did  you discovered them the ambassador interrupted i have taken no credit for it the credit is yours but in this land there are so many things which one may not do the bowstring and the knife are unrecognized civilization has set an unwholesome value upon human life it is the maudlin sentiment which creeps like corruption through the body of a dying country  i know it the prince declared sighing i know it very well indeed  dear maiyo the ambassador asked how well do you know it  my friend the prince answered it were better for you not to ask that question  here under this roof the baron continued is sanctuary but in the streets and squares beyond it seems to meand i have thought this over many timesit seems to me that even the person of the great prince cousin of the emperor holy son of japan would not be safe  prince maiyo shrugged his shoulders there was gravity in his face but it was the gravity of a man who has learnt to look upon serious things with a light heart  i also he said have weighed this matter very carefully in my mind what i did was well done and if the bill is thrust into my face i must pay first of all baron i promise you that i shall finish my work after that what does it matter you and i know better than this nation of lifeloving shopkeepers a week a year a span of yearsof what account are they to us who have sipped ever so lightly at the great cup if we died tomorrow for the glory of our country should we not say to one another you and i that it was well  the baron rose to his feet and bowed into his voice there had crept a note almost of reverence  prince he said almost you take me back to the one mother country almost your words persuade me that the strangeness of these western lands is a passing thing we wonder and as we wonder they shall crumble away the sun rises in the east  the prince also rose servants came silently forward bearing his hat and gloves  perhaps the prince smiled as he made his adieux  perhaps the ambassador echoed who can tell  the prince sent away his carriage and walked homeward greeting every now and then an acquaintance he walked cheerfully and with a smile upon his face there was nothing in his appearance which could possibly have indicated to the closest observer that this was a man who had taken death by the hand at the corner of regent street and pall mall he overtook inspector jacks he leaned forward at once and touched the detective on the shoulder  mr jacks he said it is pleasant to see you once more i was afraid that i should have to leave without bidding you farewell  the inspector started the prince laughed to himself as he watched that gesture indeed a man who showed his feelings so easily would be very much at a loss in tokio  you are going away prince the inspector asked quickly when  the exact day is not fixed the prince replied but it is true that i am going home i have finished my work and you see there is nothing to keep me over here any longer tell me have you had any fortune yet i read the papers every day hoping to see that you have cleared up those two terrible affairs  inspector jacks shook his head  not yet prince he said  not yet the prince echoed dear me that is very unfortunate  inspector jacks watched the people who were passing for a moment with a fixed unseeing gaze  i am afraid he said that we must seem to you very slow and very stupid very likely we are and yet yet in time we generally reach our goal sometimes we go a long way round sometimes we wait almost over long but sooner or later we strike  the prince nodded sympathetically  the best of fortune to you mr jacks he said i wish you could have cleared these matters up before i left for home it is pure selfishness of course but i have always felt a great interest in your work  if we do not clear them up before you leave the country prince the inspector answered i fear that we shall never clear them up at all  the prince passed on smiling a conversation with inspector jacks seemed always to inspire him it was a fine afternoon and pall mall was crowded in a few moments he came face to face with somerfield who greeted him a little gloomily  sir charles the prince said i hope that i shall have the pleasure of meeting you at devenham  i am not sure somerfield answered i have been asked but i promised some time ago to go up to scotland i have a third share in a river there and the season for salmon is getting on  i am sorry the prince declared i have no doubt however but that miss morse will induce you to change your mind i should regret your absence the more he continued because this i fear is the last visit which i shall be paying in this country  somerfield was genuinely interested  you are really going home he asked eagerly  almost at once the prince answered  only for a time i suppose somerfield continued  the prince shook his head  on the contrary he said i imagine that this will be a long goodbye i think i can promise you that if ever i reach japan i shall remain there my work in this hemisphere will be accomplished  somerfield looked at him with the puzzled air of a man who is face to face with a problem which he cannot solve  youll forgive my putting it so plainly prince he remarked but do you mean to say that after having lived over here you could possibly settle down again in japan  the prince returned for a moment his companions perplexed gaze then his lips parted his eyes shone he laughed softly gracefully with genuine mirth  sir charles he said i shall not forget that question i think that of all the englishmen whom i have met you are the most english of all when i think of your great country as i often shall do of her sons and her daughters i will promise you that to me you shall always represent the typical man of your race and fortune  the prince left his companion loitering along pall mall still a little puzzled he called a taxi and drove to devenham house the great drawing rooms were almost empty lady grace was just saying goodbye to some parting guests she welcomed the prince with a little flush of pleasure  i find you alone he remarked  my mother is opening a bazaar somewhere lady grace said she will be home very soon do let me give you some tea  it is my excuse for coming the prince admitted  she called back the footman who had shown him in  china tea very weak in a china teapot with lemon and no sugar isnt that it she asked smiling  lady grace he declared you spoil me perhaps it is because i am going away every one is kind to the people who go away  she looked at him anxiously  going away she exclaimed when do you mean back to japan  back to my own country he answered perhaps in two weeks perhaps threewho can tell  but you are coming to devenham first she asked eagerly  i am coming to devenham first he assented i called this afternoon to let your father know the date on which i could come i promised that he should hear from me today he was good enough to say either thursday or friday thursday i find will suit me admirably  she drew a little sigh  so you are going back she said softly i wonder why so many people seem to have taken it for granted that you would settle down here even i had begun to hope so  he smiled  lady grace he said i am not what you call a cosmopolitan to live over here in any of these western countries would seem to denote that one may change ones dwelling place as easily as one changes ones clothes the further east you go the more reluctant one is i think to leave the shadow of ones own trees the man who leaves my country leaves it to go into exile the man who returns returns home  she was a little perplexed  i should have imagined she said that the people who leave your country as emigrants to settle in american or even over here might have felt like that but you of the educated classes i should have thought would have found more over here to attract you more to induce you to choose a new home  he shook his head  lady grace he said believe me that is not so the traditions of our racethe call of the blood as you put it over hereis as powerful a thing with our aristocratics as with our peasants we find much here to wonder at and admire much that however unwillingly we are forced to take back and adopt in our own country but it is a strange atmosphere for us this for my countrypeople there is but one real home but one motherland  yet you have seemed so contented over here she remarked you have entered so easily into all our ways  he set down his teacup and smiled at her for a moment gravely  i came with a purpose he said i came in order to observe and to study certain features of your life but believe me i have felt the straini have felt it sometimes very badly these countries yours especially are like what one of your great poets called the lotuslands for us much of your life here is given to pursuits which we do not understand to sports and games to various forms of what we should call idleness in my country we know little of that in one way or another from the emperor to the poor runner in the streets we work  is there nothing which you will regret she asked  i shall regret the friends i have madethe very dear friends he repeated who have been so very much kinder to me than i have deserved life is a sad pilgrimage sometimes because one may not linger for a moment at any one spot nor may one ever look back but i know quite well that when i leave here there will be many whom i would gladly see again  there will be many prince she said softly who will be sorry to see you go  the prince rose to his feet another little stream of callers had come into the room presently he drank his tea and departed when he reached st james square his majordomo came hurrying up and whispered something in his own language  the prince smiled  i go to see him he said i will go at once    chapter xxvii a prisoner  dr spencer whiles was sitting in a very comfortable easy chair smoking a particularly good cigar with a pile of newspapers by his side his appearance certainly showed no signs of hardship his linen and the details of his toilet generally supplied from some mysterious source into which he had not inquired were much improved notwithstanding his increased comfort however he was looking perplexed even a little worried and the cause of it was there in front of him in the advertisement sheets of the various newspapers which had been duly laid upon his table  the prince came in quietly and closed the door behind him  good afternoon my friend he said i understood that you wished to see me  the doctor had made up his mind to adopt a firm attitude nevertheless the genial courtesy of the princes tone and manner had the same effect upon him as it had upon most people he half rose to his feet and became at once apologetic  i hope that i have not disturbed you prince he said i thought that i should like to have a word or two with you concerning something which i have come across in these journals   he tapped them with his forefinger and the prince nodded thoughtfully  your wonderful press he exclaimed how much it is responsible for well dr whiles what have the newspapers to say to you  the doctor handed across a carefully folded journal and pointed to a certain paragraph  will you kindly read this he begged  the prince accepted the sheet and read the paragraph aloud  fifty pounds reward disappeared from his home in long whatton on wednesday morning last herbert spencer whiles surgeon the above reward will be paid to any one giving information which will lead to the discovery of his present whereabouts was last seen in a motor car limousine body painted dark green leaving long whatton in the direction of london  the prince laid down the paper smiling  well he asked that seems clear enough some one is willing to give fifty pounds to know where you are  the doctor tapped the advertisement with his forefinger impressively  fifty pounds he repeated there isnt a person in the world to whom the knowledge of my movements is worth fifty poundsexcept  except the prince murmured  except mr inspector jacks dr whiles said slowly  the prince seemed scarcely to grasp the situation  well he said fifty pounds is not a great deal of money some unknown personpossibly as you suggest mr jacksis willing to give fifty pounds to discover your whereabouts i on the other hand am giving a thousand guineas to keep you here as my guest the odds do not seem even do they  put in that way dr whiles admitted they certainly do not but there is another thing which has come into my mind  the prince smiled and helped himself to one of the very excellent cigarettes which had been provided for the delectation of his visitor  pray treat me with every confidence dr whiles he said tell me exactly what is in your thoughts  well then i will the doctor answered sitting here with nothing particular to do one has plenty of leisure to think for the first time i have seriously tried to puzzle out what mr inspector jacks really wanted with me why he came down to ask me about the person whom i treated for injuries resulting from a bicycle accident one wednesday evening not long ago why he took me up to london to see if i could identify that person in a very different guise i have tried to put the pieces together and to ask myself what he meant by it all  with so much time upon your hands dr whiles the prince remarked you can scarcely fail to have arrived at some reasonable explanation  i dont know whether it is reasonable or not the doctor answered but the obvious explanation is getting on my nerves there are two things which i cannot get away from one is that i cannot for the life of me imagine your riding a bicycle twelve or fifteen miles north of london between eleven oclock and midnight and the other  come the other the prince remarked encouragingly  the other the doctor continued is the fact that within half a mile of my house runs the main london and north western line  the london and north western railway line the prince repeated and what has that to do with it  this much the doctor answered that on that very night about half an hour before yourshall we call it bicycle accidentthe special train from liverpool to london passed along that line you will remember the tragic occurrence which took place before she reached london the murder of the man hamilton fynes if you read the report of the evidence at the inquest you will notice the engine drivers declaration that the only time on the whole journey when he travelled at less than forty miles an hour was when passing over the viaduct and before entering the tunnel which is plainly visible from my house  this is very interesting the prince remarked but it is not new we have known all this before perhaps though some fresh thing has come into your mind connected with these happenings if so please do not hesitate let me hear it  it is a fresh thing to me the doctor saidfresh in a sense though all the time i have had an uneasy feeling at the back of my head i know now what it was which brought inspector jacks to see me i know now what it was he had at the back of his head concerning the man who met with a bicycle accident at this psychological moment  inspector jacks is a very shrewd fellow the prince said i should not be in the least surprised if you were entirely right  the doctor moved restlessly in his chair his eyes remained on his companions face as though fascinated  cant you understand he said that inspector jacks is on your track rightly or wrongly he believes that you had something to do with the murder on the train that night  the prince nodded amiably he seemed in no way discomposed  i feel convinced he said that you are right i agree with you i believe that inspector jacks has had that idea for some little time now  the doctor gripped the sides of his chair and stared at this man who discussed a matter so terrible with calm and perfect ease  yes i have felt that more than once the prince continued my presence upon the spot at that precise moment with injuries which had to be explained somehow or other was without doubt unfortunate  the two men sat for several moments without further speech the doctors features seemed to reflect something of the horror which he undoubtedly felt the prince appeared only a trifle bored  so that is why the former exclaimed hoarsely i have been appointed your physician in chief  i had given you the credit my dear doctor the prince said smoothly of having arrived at that decision some time ago to a man of your perceptions there can scarcely have been any question about it at all besides even princes you know do not give fees of a thousand guineas for nothing  dr whiles rose slowly to his feet  you know the secret of that murder he declared  why ask me the prince answered if i tell you that i do you may find conscientious scruples about remaining here a man is not bound you know to give himself away make the best of things and do not try to see too far  the doctor was looking a little shaken  if you were mixed up in that affair he said and if i remain here when my evidence is needed i become an accomplice  only if you remain here voluntarily the prince reminded him cheerfully remember that and be comforted no effort that you could make now would bring you into touch with mr inspector jacks until i am quite prepared so you see my dear doctor that you have nothing with which to reproach yourself i will not insult you he continued by suggesting that a reward of fifty pounds could possibly have influenced your attitude if you have suffered your mind to dwell upon it for a single moment try and remember the relative unimportance of such an amount when compared with a thousand guineas  the doctor moved to the window and back again  supposing he said i decline to remain here supposing i say that believing you now to have a guilty knowledge of this murder i repudiate our bargain supposing i say that i will have nothing more to do with your thousand guineasthat i will leave this house  then we come to close quarters the prince answered and you force me to tell you in plain words that until i am ready for you to leave it you are as much a prisoner in this room as though the keys of the strongest fortress in europe were turned upon you i have told you this before i thought that we perfectly understood one another  i did not understand the doctor protested i knew that there was trouble but i did not know that it was this  the fact of your knowing or not knowing makes no difference the prince answered you are no longer a free agent the only question for you to decide is whether you remain here willingly or whether you will force me to remind you of our bargain  the doctor was sitting down again now all the time he watched the prince with a gleam in his eyes partly of horror partly of fear he no longer doubted but that he was in the presence of a criminal  i am sorry the prince continued that you have allowed this little matter to disturb you i thought that we had arranged it all at our last interview if you did not surmise my reasons for keeping you here then i am afraid i gave you credit for more intelligence than you possess you will excuse me now i am sure he added rising i have some letters to send off before i change by the bye do you care to give me your parole it might perhaps lessen the inconvenience to which you are unfortunately subject  the doctor shook his head  no he said i will not give my parole  late that night he tried the handle of his door and found it open the corridor outside was in thick darkness he felt his way along by the wall suddenly from behind a pair of large soft hands gripped him by the throat slowly he was drawn backalmost strangled  let me go he called out struggling in vain to find a body upon which he could gain a grip  the grasp only tightened  back to your rooms came a whisper through the darkness  the doctor returned when he staggered into his sitting room he turned up the electric light there were red marks upon his throat and perspiration upon his forehead he opened the door once more and looked out upon the landing striking a match and holding it over his head there was no one in sight yet all the time he had the uncomfortable feeling that he was being watched for the first time in his life he wondered whether a thousand guineas was after all such a magnificent fee  almost at the same time the prince sat back in the shadows of the duchess of devenhams box at the opera and talked quietly to lady grace  but tell me prince she begged i know that you are glad to go home but wont you really miss this a littlethe music the life all these things that make up existence here your own country is wonderful i know but it has not progressed so far has it  he shook his head  i think he said that the portion of our education which we have most grievously neglected is the development of our recreations but then you must remember that we are to a certain extent without that craving for amusement which makes these things necessary for you others we are perhaps too serious in my country lady grace we lack altogether that delightful air of irresponsibility with which you londoners seem to make your effortless way through life  she was a little perplexed  i dont believe she said that in your heart you approve of us at all  do not say that lady grace he begged it is simply that i have been brought up in so different a school this sort of thing is very wonderful and i shall surely miss it yet nowadays the world is being linked together in marvellous fashion tokio and london are closer today than ever they have been in the worlds history  and our people she asked do you really think that our people are so far apart between you and me for instance she added meaning to ask the question naturally enough but suddenly losing confidence and looking away from himbetween you and me there seems no radical difference of race you might almost be an englishmannot one of these men of fashion of course but a statesman or a man of letters some one who had taken hold of the serious side of life  you pay me a very delightful compliment he murmured  please repay me then by being candid she answered consider for a moment that i am a typical english girl and tell me whether i am so very different from the japanese women of your own class  he hesitated for a moment the question was not without its embarrassments  men he said are very much the same all the world over they are like the coarse grass which grows everywhere but the flowers you know are different in every country  lady grace sighed perhaps she had been a trifle too daring she was willing enough at any rate to let the subject drift away  soon the curtain will go up she said and we can talk no longer i should like to tell you though how glad i amhow glad we all arethat you can come to us next week  i can assure you that i am looking forward to it he answered a little gravely it is my farewell to all of you you know and it seems to me that those who will be your fathers guests are just those with whom i have been on the most intimate terms since i came to england  she nodded  penelope is coming she said quicklyyou know thatpenelope and sir charles somerfield  yes he answered i heard so  the curtain went up the faint murmur of the violins was suddenly caught up and absorbed in the thunderous music of a march lady grace moved nearer to the front prince maiyo remained where he was among the shadows the music was in his ears but his eyes were half closed    chapter xxviii patriotism  the dukes chef had served an emperor with honorthe billiard room at devenham castle was the most comfortable room upon earth the three men who sat together upon a huge divan the three men most powerful in directing the councils of their country felt a gentle wave of optimism stealing through their quickened blood nevertheless this was a serious matter which occupied their thoughts  we are becoming the prime minister said much too modern we are becoming overcivilized out of any similitude to a nation of men of blood and brawn  you are quoting some impossible person sir edward bransome declared  one is always quoting unconsciously the prime minister admitted with a sigh what i mean is that five hundred years ago we should have locked this young man up in a room hung with black crape and with a pleasant array of unfortunately extinct instruments we should have succeeded beyond a doubt in extorting the truth from him  and if the truth were not satisfactory the duke asked lighting a cigar  we should have endeavored to change his point of view the prime minister continued even if we had to change at the same time the outline of his particularly graceful figure the age of thumbscrews and the rack was after all a very virile age just consider for a moment our positionsthree of the greatest and most brilliant statesmen of our dayand we can do very little save wait for this young man to declare himself we are the puppets with whom he plays it rests with him whether our names are written upon the scroll of fame or whether our administration is dismissed in half a dozen contemptuous words by the coming historian it rests with him whether our friend bransome here shall be proclaimed the greatest foreign minister that ever breathed and whether i myself have a statue erected to me in westminster yard which shall be crowned with a laurel wreath by patriotic young ladies on the morning of my anniversary  the duke stretched himself out with a sigh of content his cigar was burning well and the flavor of old armignac lingered still upon his palate  come he protested i think you exaggerate maiyos importance just a little haviland hesho seems excellently disposed towards us and after all i should have thought his word would have had more weight in tokio than the word of a young man who is new to diplomacy and whose claims to distinction seem to rest rather upon his soldiering and the fact that he is a cousin of the emperor  the prime minister sighed  dear duke he said no one of us not even myself has ever done that young man justice to me he represents everything that is most strenuous and intellectual in japanese manhood the spirit of that wonderful country runs like the elixir of life itself through his veins since the day he brought me his letter from the emperor i have watched him carefully and i believe i can honestly declare that not once in these eighteen months has he looked away from his task nor has he given to one single person even an inkling of the thoughts which have passed through his mind he came back from the continent from berlin from paris from petersburg with a mass of acquired information which would have made some of our bluebooks read like hans andersens fairy tales he had made up his mind exactly what he thought of each country of their political systems of their social life of their military importance he had them all weighed up in the hollow of his hand he was willing to talk as long as i for instance was willing to listen he spoke of everybody whom he had met and every place which he had visited without reserve and yet i guarantee that there is no person in england today however much he may have talked with him who knows in the least what his true impressions are  haviland is right bransome agreed many a time i have caught myself wondering when he talks so easily about his travels what the real thoughts are which lie at the back of his brain we know of course what the object of those travels was he went as no tourist he went with a deep and solemn purpose always before him he went to find out whether there was any other european power whose alliance would be a more advantageous thing for japan than a continuation of their alliance with us such a thing has never been mentioned or hinted at between us but we know it all the same  i wonder the duke remarked whether we shall really get the truth out of him before he goes  the prime minister shook his head  look at him now teaching old lady saunderson how to hold her cue he singled her out because she was the least attractive person playing because no one took any particular notice of her and every one seemed disposed to let her go her own way those girls were all buzzing around him as though he were something holy but you see how gently he eluded them watch what an interest she is taking in the game now he has been encouraging the poor old lady until her last few shots have been quite good that is maiyo all the world over i will wager that he is thinking of nothing on earth at this moment but of making that poor old lady feel at her ease and enjoy her game a stranger looking on would imagine him to be just a kindhearted simpleminded fellow yet there is not one of us three who has wit enough to get a single word from him against his will you shall see there is an excellent opportunity here i suppose both of you read his speech at the herrick club last night  i did the duke answered  and i bransome echoed it seemed to me that he spoke a little more freely than usual  he went as near to censure as i have ever heard him when speaking of any of the institutions of our country the prime minister declared i will ask him about it directly we get the chance you shall see how he will evade the point  you will have to be quick if you mean to get hold of him the duke remarked see the game is over and there he goes with penelope  the prime minister rose to his feet and intercepted them on their way to the door  miss morse he said may we ransom the prince we want to talk to him  do you insinuate she laughed that he is a captive of mine  we are all captives of miss morses bransome said with a bow and all enemies of somerfields  somerfield hearing his name came up to them the duchess too strolled over to the fire the prime minister and bransome returned with maiyo towards the corner of the room where they had been sitting  prince the prime minister said we have been talking about your speech at the herrick club last night  the prince smiled a little gravely  did i say too much he asked it all came as a surprise to methe toast and everything connected with it i saw my name down to reply and it seemed discourteous of me not to speak but as yet i do not altogether understand these functions i did not altogether understand for instance how much i might say and how much i ought to leave unsaid  we have read what you said bransome remarked what we should like to hear if i may venture to say so is what you left unsaid  the prince for a moment was thoughtful perhaps he remembered that the days had passed when it was necessary for him to keep so jealously his own counsel perhaps his natural love of the truth triumphed he felt a sudden longing to tell these people who had been kind to him the things which he had seen amongst them the things which only a stranger coming fresh to the country could perhaps fully comprehend  what i said was of little importance the prince remarked but i felt myself placed in a very difficult position before i knew what to expect i was listening to a glorification of the arms of my country at the expense of russia i was being hailed as one of a nation who possess military genius which had not been equalled since the days of hannibal and caesar many things of that sort were said many things much too kind many things which somehow it grieved me to listen to and when i stood up to reply i felt that the few words which i must say would sound perhaps ungracious but they must be said it was one of those occasions which seemed to call for the naked truth  penelope and the duchess had joined the little group  may we stay the former asked i read every word of your speech she added turning to the prince do tell us why you spoke so severely what it was that you objected to so strongly in general ennisons remarks  the prince turned earnestly towards her  my dear young lady he said all that i objected to was this overglorification of the feats of arms accomplished by us people over here did not understand on the one side were the great armies of russiamen drawn all of them from the ranks of the peasant men of low nerve force men who were not many degrees better than animals they came to fight against us because it was their business to fight because for fighting they drew their scanty pay their food and their drink and the clothes they wore they fought because if they refused they faced the revolver bullets of their officersmen like themselves who also fought because it was their profession because it was in the traditions of their family but who would i think have very much preferred disporting themselves in the dancing halls of their cities drinking champagne with the ladies of their choice or gambling with cards i do not say that these were not brave men all of them i myself saw them face death by the hundreds but the lust of battle was in their veins then the taste of blood upon their palates we do not claim to be called world conquerors because we overcame these men if one could have seen into the hearts of our own soldiers as they marched into battle and seen also into the hearts of those others who lay there sullenly waiting one would not have wondered then there was indeed nothing to wonder at what we cannot make you understand over here is that every japanese soldier who crept across the bare plains or lay stretched in the trenches who loaded his rifle and shot and killed and waited for deathevery man felt something beating in his heart which those others did not feel we have no great army mr haviland but what we have is a great nation who have things beating in their heart the knowledge of which seems somehow to have grown cold amongst you western people the boy is born with it it is there in his very soul as dear to him as the little home where he lives the blossoming trees under which he plays it leads him to the rifle and the drill ground as naturally as the boys of your country turn to the cricket fields and the football ground over here you call that spirit patriotism it was something which beat in the heart of every one of those hundreds of thousands of men something which kept their eyes clear and bright as they marched into battle which made them look death itself in the face and fight even while the blackness crept over them you see your own people have so many interests so many excitements so much to distract with us it is not so in the heart of the japanese comes the love of his parents the love of his wife and children and deepest perhaps of all the emotions he knows the strong magnificent background to his life the love of the country which bore him which shelters them it is for his home he fights for his simple joys amongst those who are dear to him for the great mysterious love of the motherland forgive me if i have expressed myself badly have repeated myself often it is a matter which i find it so hard to talk about so hard here to make you understand  but you must not think prince that we over here are wholly lacking in that same instinct the duke said remember our south african war and the men who came to arms and rallied round the flag when their services were needed  i do remember that the prince answered i wish that i could speak of it in other terms yet it seems to me that i must speak as i find things you say that the men came to arms they did but how untrained unskilled in carrying weapons they rushed across the seas to be the sport of the farmers who cut them off or shot them down to be a hindrance in the way of the mercenaries who fought for you yes you say they rallied to the call what brought them excitement necessity necessities of their social standing bravado cheap heroismany one of these but i tell you that patriotism as we understand it is a deeper thing in the land where it flourishes there is no great preeminence in what you call sports or games it does not come like a whirlwind on the wings of disaster it grows with the limbs and the heart of the boy grows with his muscles and his brawn it is part of his conscience part of his religion as he realizes that he has a country of his own to protect a dear precious heritage come down to him through countless ages so he learns that it is his sacred duty to know how to do his share in defending it the spare time of our youth mr haviland is spent learning to shoot to scout to bear hardships to acquire the arts of war i tell you that there was not one general who went with our troops to manchuria but a hundred thousand we have no great army we are a nation of men whose religion it is to fight when their countrys welfare is threatened  there was a short silence the prime minister and bransome exchanged rapid glances  these then penelope said slowly were the things you left unsaid  the prince raised his hand a littlea deprecatory gesture  perhaps even now he said it was scarcely courteous of me to say them only i know that they come to you as no new thing there are many of your countrymen who are speaking to you now in the press as i a stranger have spoken sometimes it is harder to believe one of your own family that is why i have dared to say so muchi a foreigner eager and anxious only to observe and to learn i think perhaps that it is to such that the truth comes easiest  of a purpose the three men who were there said nothing the prince offered penelope his arm  i will not be disappointed he said you promised that you would show me the palm garden i have talked too much    chapter xxix a race  the prince on his way back from his usual beforebreakfast stroll lingered for a short time amongst the beds of hyacinths and yellow crocuses somehow or other these spring flowers stiffly set out and with shrivelled edgesa little reminiscent of the last east windstill seemed to him in their perfume at any rate to being him memories of his own country pink and blue and yellow in all manner of sizes and shapes the beds spread away along the great front below the terrace of the castle this morning the wind was coming from the west the sun indeed seemed already to have gained some strength the prince sat for a moment or two upon the gray stone balustrade looking to where the level country took a sudden ascent and ended in a thick belt of pine trees beyond lay the sea as he sat there with folded arms he was surely a fatalist the question as to whether or not he should ever reach it should ever find himself really bound for home was one which seemed to trouble him slightly enough he thought with a faint wistful interest of the various ports of call of the days which might pass each one bringing him nearer the end he suffered himself even to think of that faint blur upon the horizon the breath of the spicy winds the strange home perfumes of the bay as he drew nearer and nearer to the outstretched arms of his country well if not he another it was something to have done ones best  the rustle of a womans garment disturbed him and he turned his head penelope stood there in her trim riding habita garb in which he had never seen her she held her skirts in her hand and looked at him with a curious little smile  it is too early in the morning prince she said for you to sit there dreaming so long and so earnestly come in to breakfast every one is down for a wonder  breakfast by all means he answered coming blithely up the broad steps you are going to ride this morning  i suppose we all are more or less she answered it is our hunt steeplechases you know poor grace is in there nearly sobbing her eyes out captain chalmers has thrown her over lady barbaritythats graces favorite mare and her entry for the cupturned awkward with him yesterday and he wont have anything more to do with her  from your tone he remarked pushing open the french windows i gather that this is a tragedy i unfortunately do not understand  you should ask grace herself penelope said there she is  lady grace looked round from her place at the head of the breakfast table  come and sympathize with me prince she cried for weeks i have been fancying myself the proud possessor of the hunt cup now that horrid man captain chalmers has thrown me over at the last moment he refuses to ride my mare because she was a little fractious yesterday  it is a great misfortune the prince said in a tone of polite regret but surely it is not irreparable there must be otherswhy not your own groom  a smile went round the table the duke hastened to explain  the race is for gentlemen riders only he said the horses have to be the property of members of the hunt there would be no difficulty of course in finding a substitute for captain chalmers but the race takes place this morning and i am afraid with all due respect to my daughter that her mare hasnt the best of reputations  i wont have a word said against lady barbarity lady grace declared captain chalmers is a good horseman of course but for a lightweight he has the worst hands i ever knew  but surely amongst your immediate friends there must be many others the prince said sir charles for instance  charlie is riding his own horse lady grace answered he hasnt the ghost of a chance but of course he wont give it up  not i somerfield answered gorgeous in pink coat and riding breeches my old horse may not be fast but he can go the course and im none too certain of the others some of those hurdlesll take a bit of doing  it is a shame the prince remarked that you should be disappointed lady grace would they let me ride for you  nothing the prince could have said would have astonished the little company more somerfield came to a standstill in the middle of the room with a cup of tea in one hand and a plate of ham in the other  you lady grace exclaimed  do you really mean it prince penelope cried  well why not he asked himself in turn somewhat surprised if i am eligible and lady grace chooses it seems to me very simple  but the duke intervened i did not knowwe did not know that you were a sportsman prince  a sportsman the prince repeated a little doubtfully perhaps i am not that according to your point of view but when it comes to a question of riding why that is easy enough  have you ever ridden in a steeplechase somerfield asked him  never in my life the prince declared frankly i do not know what it is  there are jumps for one thing somerfield continuedpretty stiff affairs too  if lady graces mare is a hunter the prince remarked she can probably jump them  the question is whether somerfield began and stopped short  the prince looked up  yes he asked  somerfield hesitated to complete his sentence and the duke once more intervened  what somerfield was thinking my dear prince he said was that a steeplechase course as they ride in this country needs some knowing you have never been on my daughters mare before  the prince smiled  so far as i am concerned he said that is of no account there was a day at mukdeni do not like to talk of it but it comes back to mewhen i rode twelve different horses in twentyfour hours but perhaps he added turning to lady grace you would not care to trust your horse with one who is a stranger to yourwhat is it you call themsteeplechases  on the contrary prince lady grace exclaimed you shall ride her and i am going to back you for all i am worth  bransome who was also in riding clothes although he was not taking part in the steeplechases himself glanced at the clock  you are running it rather fine he said youll scarcely have time to hack round the course  some one must explain it to me the prince said i need only to be told where to go if there is no time for that i must stay with the other horses until the finish there is a flat finish perhaps  about three hundred yards the duke answered  have you any riding clothes penelope whispered to him  without a doubt he answered i will go and change in a few minutes  we start in half an hour somerfield remarked even that allows us none too much time  perhaps the duke suggested diffidently you would like to ride over prince it is a good eleven miles and you would have a chance of getting into your stride  the prince shook his head  no he said i should like to motor with you others if i may  just as you like of course the duke agreed graces mare is over there now we shall be able to have a look at her before the race at any rate  the opinions after the prince had left the table were a little divided as to what was likely to happen  for a man who has never even hunted and knows nothing whatever about the country somerfield declared to attempt to ride in a steeplechase of this sort is sheer folly if you take my advice lady grace you will get out of it lady barbarity is far too good a mare to have her knees broken  i am perfectly content to take my risks lady grace answered confidently if the prince had never ridden before in his life i would trust him  somerfield turned away frowning  what do you think about it penelope he asked  i am afraid she answered that i agree with grace  two punctures and a leaking valve delayed them over an hour on the road when they reached their destination the first race was already over  its shocking bad luck the duke declared but theres no earthly chance of your seeing the course prince come on the top of the stand with me and bring your glasses i think i can point out the way for you  that will do excellently the prince answered there is no need to go and look at every jump show me where we start and as near as possible the way we have to go and tell me where we finish  the course was a natural one and the stand itself on a hill the greater part of it was clearly visible from where they stood the duke pointed out the water jump with some trepidation but the princes glasses rested on it only for a moment he pointed to a clump of trees  which side there he asked  to the left the duke answered remember to keep inside the red flags  the prince nodded  where do we finish he asked  the duke showed him  that is all right he said i need not look any more  in the paddock some of the horses were being led around the prince noted them approvingly  very nice horses he saidlight but very nice that one i like best he added pointing to a dark bay mare who was already giving her boy some trouble  thats lucky the duke answered for shes your mount i must go and talk to the clerk about your entry it is a little late but i think that it will be all right  the prince glanced over lady graces mare and turned aside to join penelope and somerfield  i like the look of my horse sir charles he said i think that i shall beat you today  we both start at five to one somerfield answered shall we have a bet  with pleasure the prince agreed will you name the amount i do not know what is usual  anything you like somerfield answered from ten pounds to a hundred  one hundredwe will say one hundred then the prince declared my mount against yours so  he threw off his overcoat and they saw for the first time that he was dressed in english riding clothes of dark material but absolutely correct cut  i must go now and be introduced to the clerk of the course he said ah here is lady grace he added come with me lady grace your father is seeing about my entry i think that in five minutes the bell will ring  everything was in order and a few minutes later the prince came out the mare was stripped and the whole party gathered round to watch him mount he swung himself into the saddle without hesitation the mare suddenly reared prince maiyo only smiled and with loose reins stooped and patted her neck he seemed to whisper something in her ear and she stood for a moment afterwards quite still lady grace drew a quick breath  what did you say to her prince she asked she is behaving beautifully except for that first start  your mare understands japanese lady grace the prince answered smiling she and i are going to be great friends show me the way please ah i follow that other horse i see lady grace au revoir you shall have your cup  gad i believe she will the duke exclaimed look at the fellow ride his body is like whalebone  the parade in front of the stand was a short one the prince rode by in the merest canter the mare made one wild plunge which would have unseated any ordinary person but her rider never even moved in his saddle  i never saw a fellow sit so close in my life the duke declared do you know grace i believe i really believe hell ride her  lady grace laughed scornfully  i have a years allowance on already she said so you had better pray that he does i think it is very absurd of you all she added because the prince cares nothing for games to conclude that he is any the less likely to be able to do the things that a man should do he perhaps cannot ride about on a trained pony with a long stick and knock a small ball between two posts but i think that if he had to ride for his own life or the life of others he would show you all something  theyre off the duke exclaimed  they watched the first jump breathlessly the prince riding a little apart simply ignored the hurdle and the mare took it in her stride they turned the corner and faced an awkward post and rails the leading horse took off too late and fell the prince who was close behind steered his mare on one side like lightning she jumped like a catthe prince never moved in his seat  he rides like an italian bransome declared shutting up his glasses theres never a thing in this race to touch him i am going to see if i can get any money on  another set of hurdles and then the field were out of sight soon they were visible again in the valley the prince was riding second now somerfield was leading and there were only three other horses left they cleared a hedge and two ditches at the second one somerfields horse stumbled and there was a suppressed cry he righted himself almost at once however and came on then they reached the water jump there was a sudden silence on the stand and the hillside somerfield took off first the prince lying well away from him both cleared it but whereas lady graces mare jumped wide and clear and her rider never even faltered in his saddle somerfield lost all his lead and only just kept his seat they were on the homeward way now with only one more jump a double set of hurdles suddenly in the flat the prince seemed to stagger in his saddle lady grace cried out  hes over by jove the duke exclaimed no hes righted himself  the prince had lost ground but he came on toward the last jump gaining with every stride somerfield was already riding his mount for all he was worth but the prince as yet had not touched his whip they drew closer and closer to the jump once more the silence came then there was a little cryboth were over they were turning the corner coming into the straight somerfield was leaning forward now using his whip freely but it was clear that his big chestnut was beaten the prince with merely a touch of the whip and riding absolutely upright passed him with ease and rode in a winner by a dozen lengths as he cantered by the stand they all saw the cause of his momentary stagger one stirrup had gone and he was riding with his leg quite stiff  youve won your money grace the duke declared shutting up his glass a finely ridden race too did you see hed lost his stirrup he must have taken the last jump without it ill go and fetch him up  the duke hurried down the prince was already in the weighing room smoking a cigarette  it is all right he said smiling they have passed me i have won i hope that lady grace will be pleased  she is delighted the duke exclaimed shaking him by the hand we all are what happened to your stirrup  you must ask your groom the prince answered the leather snapped right in the flat but it made no difference we have to ride like that half the time it is quite pleasant exercise he continued but i am very dirty and very thirsty i am sorry for sir charles but his horse was not nearly so good as your daughters mare  they made their way toward the stand but met the rest of the party in the paddock lady grace went up to the prince with outstretched hands  prince she declared you rode superbly it was a wonderful race i have never felt so grateful to any one in my life  the prince smiled in a puzzled way  my dear young lady he said it was a great pleasure and a very pleasant ride you have nothing to thank me for because your horse is a little better than those others  it was not my mare alone she answeredit was your riding  the prince laughed as one who does not understand  you make me ashamed lady grace he declared why there is only one way to ride you did not think that because i was not english i should fall off a horse  i am afraid the duke remarked smiling that several englishmen have fallen off  it is a matter of the horse the prince said some are not trained for jumping what would you have then in my battalion we have nine hundred horsemen if i found one who did not ride so well as i do he would go back to the ranks we would make an infantryman of him miss morse he added turning suddenly to where penelope was standing a little apart i am so sorry that sir charles horse was not quite so good as lady graces you will not blame me  she looked at him curiously she did not answer immediately somerfield was coming towards them his pink coat splashed with mud his face scratched and a very distinct frown upon his forehead she looked away from him to the prince their eyes met for a moment  no she said i do not blame you    chapter xxx inspector jacks importunate  they were talking of the prince during those few minutes before they separated to dress for dinner the whole of the houseparty with the exception of the prince himself were gathered around the great open fireplace at the north end of the hall the weather had changed during the afternoon and a cold wind had blown in their faces on the homeward drive every one had found comfortable seats here watching the huge logs burn and there seemed to be a general indisposition to move a couple of young men from the neighborhood had joined the houseparty and the conversation naturally enough was chiefly concerned with the days sport the young men somerfield especially were inclined to regard the princes achievement from a somewhat critical standpoint  he rode the race well enough somerfield admitted but the mare is a topper and no mistake he had nothing to do but to sit tight and let her do the work  of course he hadnt to finish either one of the newcomers a captain everard wilmot remarked thats where you can tell if a fellow really can ride or not anyhow his style was rotten to me he seemed to sit his horse exactly like a groom  you will perhaps not deny him the duke remarked mildly a certain amount of courage in riding a strange horse of uncertain temper over a strange country in an enterprise which was entirely new to him  i call it one of the most sporting things i ever heard of in my life lady grace declared warmly  somerfield shrugged his shoulders  one must admit that he has pluck he remarked critically at the same time i cannot see that a single effort of this sort entitles a man to be considered a sportsman he doesnt shoot nor does he ever ride except when he is on military service he neither plays games nor has he the instinct for them a man without the instinct for games is a fellow i cannot understand hed never get along in this country would he wilmot  no im shot if he would that young man replied there must be something wrong about a man who hasnt any taste whatever for sport  penelope suddenly intervenedintervened too in somewhat startling fashion  charlie she said you are talking like a baby i am ashamed of you i am ashamed of you all you are talking like narrowminded ignorant little squireens  somerfield went slowly white he looked across at penelope but the angry flash in his eyes was met by an even brighter light in her own  i will tell you what i think she exclaimed i think that you are all guilty of the most ridiculous presumption in criticising such a man as the prince you would dareyou captain wilmot and you charlie and you mr hannaway she added turning to the third young man to stand there and tell us all in a lordly way that the prince is no sportsman as though that mysterious phrase disposed of him altogether as a creature inferior to you and your kind if only you could realize the absolute absurdity of any of you attempting to depreciate a person so immeasurably above you prince maiyo is a man not an overgrown boy to go through life shooting birds playing games which belong properly to your schooldays and hanging round the stage doors of half the theatres in london you are satisfied with your lives and the prince is satisfied with his he belongs to a race whom you do not understand let him alone dont presume to imagine yourselves his superior because he does not conform to your pygmy standard of life  penelope was standing now her slim elegant form throbbing with the earnestness of her words a spot of angry color burning in her cheeks during the moments silence which followed lady grace too rose to her feet and came to her friends side  i agree with every word penelope has said she declared  the duchess smiled  come she said soothingly we mustnt take this little affair too seriously you are all right all of you every one must live according to his bringing up the prince no doubt is as faithful to his training and instincts as the young men of our own country it is more interesting to compare than to criticise  somerfield who for a moment had been too angry to speak had now recovered himself  i think he said stiffly that we had better drop the subject i had no idea that miss morse felt so strongly about it or i should not have presumed even here and amongst ourselves to criticise a person who holds such a high place in her esteem everard ill play you a game of billiards before we go upstairs theres just time  captain wilmot hesitated he was a peaceloving man and after all penelope and his friend were engaged  perhaps miss morse he began  penelope turned upon him  i should like you all to understand she declared that every word i said came from my heart and that i would say it again and more with the same provocation  there was a finality about penelopes words which left no room for further discussion the little group was broken up she and lady grace went to their rooms together  penelope youre a dear the latter said as they mounted the stairs i am afraid youve made charlie very angry though  i hope i have penelope answered i meant to make him angry i think that such selfsufficiency is absolutely stifling it makes me sometimes almost loathe young englishmen of his class  and you dont dislike the prince so much nowadays lady grace remarked with transparent indifference  no penelope answered that is finished i misunderstood him at first it was entirely my own fault i was prejudiced and i hated to feel that i was in the wrong i do not see how any one could dislike him unless they were enemies of his country then i fancy that they might have cause  lady grace sighed  to tell you the truth penelope she said i almost wish that he were not quite so devotedly attached to his country  penelope was silent they had reached lady graces room now and were standing together on the hearthrug in front of the fire  i am afraid he is like that penelope said gently he seems to have none of the ordinary weaknesses of men i too wish sometimes that he were a little different one would like to think of him for his own sake as being happy some day he reminds me somehow of the men who build and build toiling always through youth unto old age there seems no limit to their strength nor any respite they build a palace which those who come after them must inhabit  once more lady grace sighed she was looking into the heart of the fire penelope took her hands  it is hard sometimes dear she said to realize that a thing is impossible that it is absolutely out of our reach yet it is better to bring ones mind to it than to suffer all the days  lady grace looked up at that moment she was more than pretty her eyes were soft and bright the color had flooded her cheeks  but i dont see why it should be impossible penelope she protested we are equals in every way alliances between our two countries are greatly to be desired i have heard my father say so and mr haviland the trouble is pen she added with trembling lips that he does not care for me  you cannot tell penelope answered he has never shown any signs of caring for any woman remember though that he would want you to live in japan  id live in thibet if he asked me to lady grace declared raising her handkerchief to her eyes but he never will he doesnt care he doesnt understand i am very foolish penelope  penelope kissed her gently  dear she said you are not the only foolish woman in the world  conversation amongst the younger members of the houseparty at devenham castle was a little disjointed that evening perhaps penelope who came down in a wonderful black velveteen gown with a bunch of scarlet roses in her corsage was the only one who seemed successfully to ignore the passage of arms which had taken place so short a while ago she talked pleasantly to somerfield who tried to be dignified and succeeded only in remaining sulky chance had placed her at some distance from the prince to whom lady grace was talking with a subdued softness in her manner which puzzled captain wilmot her neighbor on the other side  i saw you with all the evening papers as usual bransome the prime minister remarked during the service of dinner was there any news  nothing much the foreign secretary replied consuls are down another point and the daily comet says that you are like a drowning man clinging to the raft of your majority excellent cartoon of you by the bye you shall see it after dinner  thank you the prime minister said was there anything about you in the same paper by any chance  nothing particularly abusive sir edward answered blandly by the bye the police declare that they have a definite clue this time and are going to arrest the murderer of hamilton fynes and poor dicky vanderpole tonight or tomorrow  excellent the duke declared it would have been a perfect disgrace to our police system to have left two such crimes undetected our respected friend at the home office will have a little peace now  how about me bransome grumbled havent i been worried to death too  the prince who had just finished describing to lady grace a typical landscape of his country turned toward bransome  i think that i heard you say something about a discovery in connection with those wonderful murder cases he said has any one actually been arrested  my paper was an early edition bransome answered but it spoke of a sensational denouement within the next few hours i should imagine that it is all over by now at the same time its absurd how the press give these things away it seems that some fellow who was bicycling saw a man get in and out of poor dickys taxi and is quite prepared to swear to him  has he not been rather a long time in coming forward with his evidence the prince remarked i do not remember to have seen any mention of such a person in the papers before  he watched so well bransome answered and was so startled that he was knocked down and run over the detective in charge of the case found him in a hospital  these things always come out sooner or later the prime minister remarked as a matter of fact i am inclined to think that our police wait too long before they make an arrest they play with their victim so deliberately that sometimes he slips through their fingers very often too they let a man go who would give himself away from sheer fright if he felt the touch of a policeman upon his shoulder  as a nation bransome remarked helping himself to the entree we handle life amongst ourselves with perpetual kid gloves we are always afraid of molesting the liberty of the subject a trifle more brutality sometimes would make for strength we are like a dentist whose work suffers because he is afraid of hurting his patient  somerfield was watching his fiancee curiously  are you really very pale tonight penelope he asked or is it those red flowers which have drawn all the color from your cheeks  i believe that i am pale penelope answered i am always pale when i wear black and when people have disagreed with me as a matter of fact i am trying to make the prince feel homesick tell me she asked him across the round table dont you think that i remind you a little tonight of the women of your country  the prince returned her gaze as though indeed something were passing between them of greater significance than that halfbantering question  indeed he said i think that you do you remind me of my country itselfof the things that wait for me across the ocean  the princes servant had entered the dining room and whispered in the ear of the butler who was superintending the service of dinner the latter came over at once to the prince  your highness he said some one is on the telephone speaking from london they ask if you could spare half a minute  the prince rose with an interrogative glance at his hostess and the duchess smilingly motioned him to go even after he had left the room when he was altogether unobserved his composed demeanor showed no signs of any change he took up the receiver almost blithely it was soto his secretary who spoke to him  highness he said the man jacks with a policeman is here in the hall at the present moment he asks permission to search this house  for what purpose the prince asked  to discover some person whom he believes to be in hiding here the secretary answered he explains that in any ordinary case he would have applied for what they call a search warrant owing to your highness position however he has attended here hoping for your gracious consent without having made any formal application  i must think the prince answered tell me soto you are sure that the english doctor has had no opportunity of communicating with any one  he has had no opportunity was the firm reply if your highness says the word he shall pass  let him alone the prince answered refuse this man jacks permission to search my house during my absence tell him that i shall be there at three oclock tomorrow afternoon and that at that hour he is welcome to return  it shall be done highness was the answer  the prince set down the receiver upon the instrument and stood for a moment deep in thought it was a strange country thisa strange end which it seemed that he must prepare to face he felt like the man who had gone out to shoot lions and returning with great spoil had died of the bite of a poisonous ant    chapter xxxi goodbye  the prince on his return from the library intercepted penelope on her way across the hall  forgive me he said but i could not help overhearing some sentences of your conversation with sir charles somerfield as we sat at dinner you are going to talk with him now is it not so  as soon as he comes out from the dining room  he saw the hardening of her lips the flash in her eyes at the mention of somerfields name  yes she continued sir charles and i are going to have a little understanding  are you sure he asked softly that it will not be a misunderstanding  she looked into his face  what does it matter to you she asked what do you care  come into the conservatory for a few minutes he begged you know that i take no wine and i prefer not to return into the dining room i would like so much instead to talk to you before you see sir charles  she hesitated he stood by her side patiently waiting  remember he said that i am a somewhat privileged person just now my days here are numbered you see  she turned toward the conservatories  very well she said i must be like every one else i suppose and spoil you how dare you come and make us all so fond of you that we look upon your departure almost as a tragedy  he smiled  indeed he declared there is a note of tragedy even in these simplest accidents of life i have been very happy amongst you all miss penelope you have been so much kinder to me than i have deserved you have thrown a bridge across the gulf which separates us people of alien tongues and alien manners life has been a pleasant thing for me here  why do you go so soon she whispered  miss penelope he answered to those others who ask me that question i shall say that my mission is over that my report has been sent to my emperor and that there is nothing left for me to do but to follow it home i could add and it would be true that there is very much work for me still to accomplish in my own country to you alone i am going to say something else  she was no longer pale her eyes were filled with an exceedingly soft light she leaned towards him and her face shone as the face of a woman who prays that she may hear the one thing in life a woman craves to hear from the lips she loves best  go on she murmured  i want to ask you miss penelope he continued whether you remember the day when you paid a visit to my house  very well she answered  i was showing you a casket he went on  she gripped his arm  dont she begged dont i cant bear any more of that you dont know how horrible it seems to me you dont knowwhat fears i have had  he looked away from her  i have sometimes wondered he said what your thoughts were at that moment what you have thought of me since  she shivered a little but did not answer him  very soon he reminded her i shall have passed out of your life  he heard the sudden halfstifled exclamation he felt rather than saw the eyes which pleaded with him and he hastened on  you understand what is meant by the inevitable he continued whatever has happened in the matters with which i have been concerned has been inevitable i have had no choicesometimes no choice in such events is possible do not think he went on that i tell you this to beg for your sympathy i would not have a thing other than as it is but when we have said goodbye i want you to believe the best of me to think as kindly as you can of the things which you may not be able to comprehend remember that we are not so emotional a nation as that to which you belong our affections are but seldom touched we live without feeling for many days sometimes for longer even than many days it has not been so altogether with me i have felt more than i dare at this moment to speak of  yet you go she murmured  yet i go he assented nothing in the world is more certain than that i must say farewell to you and all of my good friends here in a sense i want this to be our farewell leaving out of the question just now the more serious dangers which threaten me the result of my mission here alone will make me unpopular in this country as the years pass i fear that nothing can draw your own land and mine into any sort of accord that is why i asked you to come here with me and listen while i said these few words to you why i ask you now that whatever the future may bring you will sometimes spare me a kindly thought  i think you know she answered that you need not ask that  you will marry sir charles somerfield he continued and you will be happy in this country men develop late somerfield too will develop i am sure he will become worthy even i trust to be your husband miss penelope something was said of his going into parliament when he is foreign minister and i am the counsellor of the emperor we may perhaps send messages to one another if not across the seas through the clouds  a mans footstep approached them somerfield himself drew near and hesitated the prince rose at once  sir charles he said i have been bidding farewell to miss penelope i have had news tonight over the telephone and i find that i must curtail my visit  the duke will be disappointed somerfield said are you off at once  probably tomorrow the prince answered may i leave miss penelope in your charge he added with a little bow the duke i believe is awaiting me  he passed out of the conservatory penelope sat quite still  well somerfield said if he is really going  charlie she interrupted if ever you expect me to marry you i make one condition and that is that you never say a single word against prince maiyo  the man whom a month ago he remarked curiously you hated  she shook her head  i was an idiot she said i did not understand him and i was prejudiced against his country  well as he actually is going away sir charles remarked with a sigh of content i suppose its no use being jealous  you havent any reason to be penelope answered just a little wistfully prince maiyo has no room in his life for such frivolous creatures as women  the prince found the rest of the party dispersed in various directions lady grace was playing billiards with captain wilmot she showed every disposition to lay down her cue when he entered the room  do come and talk to us prince she begged i am so tired of this stupid game and i am sure captain wilmot is bored to tears  the prince shook his head  thank you he said but i must find the duke i have just received a telephone message and i fear that i may have to leave tomorrow  tomorrow she cried in dismay  the prince sighed  if not tomorrow the next day he answered i have had a summonsa summons which i cannot disobey shall i find your father in the library lady grace  yes she answered he is there with mr haviland and sir edward are you really going to waste your last evening in talking about treaties and such trifles  i am afraid i must he answered regretfully  you are a hopelessly disappointing person she declared a little pitifully  it is because you are all much too kind to me that you think so he answered you make me welcome amongst you even as one of yourselves you forgetyou would almost teach me to forget that i am only a wayfarer here  that is your own choice she said coming a little nearer to him  ah no he answered there is no choice i serve a great mistress and when she calls i come there are no other voices in the world for one of my race and faith the library you said lady grace i must go and find your father  he passed out closing the door behind him captain wilmot chalked his cue carefully  thats the queerest fellow i ever knew in my life he said he seems all the time as though his head were in the clouds  lady grace sighed she too was chalking her cue  i wonder she said what it would be like to live in the clouds    chapter xxxii prince maiyo speaks  the library at devenham castle was a large and sombre apartment with high oriel windows and bookcases reaching to the ceiling it had an unused and somewhat austere air tonight especially an atmosphere of gloom seemed to pervade it the prince when he opened the door found the three men who were awaiting him seated at an oval table at the further end of the room  i do not intrude i trust the prince said i understood that you wished me to come here  certainly the duke answered we were sitting here awaiting your arrival will you take this easy chair the cigarettes are at your elbow  the prince declined the easy chair and leaned for a moment against the table  perhaps later he said just now i feel that you have something to say to me is it not so i talk better when i am standing  it was the prime minister who made the first plunge he spoke without circumlocution and his tone was graver than usual  prince he said this is perhaps the last time that we shall all meet together in this way you go from us direct to the seat of your government so far there has been very little plain speaking between us it would perhaps be more in accord with etiquette if we let you go without a word and waited for a formal interchange of communications between your ambassador and ourselves but we have a feeling sir edward and i that we should like to talk to you directly before we go any further however let me ask you this question have you any objection prince to discussing a certain matter here with us  the prince for several moments made no reply he was still standing facing the fireplace leaning slightly against the table behind him on his right was the duke seated in a library chair on his left the prime minister and sir edward bransome the prince seemed somehow to have become the central figure of the little group  perhaps he said if you had asked me that question a month ago mr haviland i might have replied to you differently circumstances however since then have changed my departure will take place so soon and the kindness i have met here from all of you has been so overwhelming that if you will let me i should like to speak of certain things concerning which no written communication could ever pass between our two countries  i can assure you my dear prince that we shall very much appreciate your doing so mr haviland declared  i think the prince continued that the greatest and the most subtle of all policies is the policy of perfect truthfulness listen to me then the thing which you have in your mind concerning me is true two years i have spent in this country and in other countries of europe these two years have not been spent in purposeless travel on the contrary i have carried with me always a definite and very fixed purpose  the prime minister and bransome exchanged rapid glances  that has been our belief from the first bransome remarked  i came to europe the prince continued gravely to make a report to my cousin the emperor of japan as to whether i believed that a renewal of our alliance with you would be advantageous to my country i need not shrink from discussing this matter with you now for my report is made it is even now on its way to the emperor  there was a moments silence a silence which in this corner of the great room seemed marked with a certain poignancy it was the prime minister who broke it  the report he said is out of your hands the official decision of your government will reach us before long is there any reason why you should not anticipate that decision why you should not tell us frankly what your advice was  there is no reason the prince answered i will tell you i owe that to you at least i have advised the emperor not to renew the treaty  not to renew the prime minister echoed  this time the silence was portentous it was a blow and there was not one of the three men who attempted to hide his dismay  i am afraid the prince continued earnestly that to you i must seem something of an ingrate i have been treated by every one in this country as the son of a dear friend the way has been made smooth for me everywhere nothing has been hidden from all quarters i have received hospitality which i shall never forget but you are three just men i know you will realize that my duty was to my country and to my country alone no one else has any claims upon me what i have seen i have written of what i believe i have spoken  prince mr haviland said there is no one here who will gainsay your honesty you came to judge us as a nation and you have found us wanting at least we can ask you why  the prince sighed  it is hard he said it is very hard when i tell you of the things which i have seen remember if you please that i have seen them with other eyes than yours the conditions which you have grown up amongst and lived amongst all your days pass almost outside the possibility of your impartial judgment you have lived with them too long they have become a part of you then too your national weakness bids your eyes see what you would have them see  go on mr haviland said drumming idly with his fingers upon the table  i have had to ask myself the prince continuedit has been my business to ask myself what is your position as a great military power and the answer i have found is that as a great military power it does not exist i have had to ask myself what would happen to your country in the case of a european war where your fleet was distributed to guard your vast possessions in every quarter of the world and the answer to that is that you are to all practical purposes defenceless in almost any combination which could arrange itself your country is at the mercy of the invader  bransome leaned forward in his chair  i can disprove it he declared firmly come with me to aldershot next week and i will show you that those who say that we have no army are ignorant alarmists the secretary for war shall show you our new scheme for defensive forces you have gone to the wrong authorities for information on these matters prince you have been entirely and totally misled  the prince drew a little breath  sir edward he said i do not speak to you rashly i have not looked into these affairs as an amateur you forget that i have spent a week at aldershot that your secretary for war gave me two days of his valuable time every figure with which you could furnish me i am already possessed of i will be frank with you what i saw at aldershot counted for nothing with me in my decision your standing army is good beyond a doubta welltrained machine an excellent plaything for a general to move across the chessboard it might even win battles and yet your standing army are mercenaries and no great nation from the days of babylon has resisted invasion or held an empire by her mercenaries  they are english soldiers mr haviland declared i do not recognize your use of the word  they are paid soldiers the prince said men who have adopted soldiering as a profession come i will not pause halfway i will tell you what is wrong with your country you will not believe it some day you will see the truth and you will remember my words it may be that you will realize it a little sooner or i would not have dared to speak as i am speaking this then is the curse which is eating the heart out of your very existence the love of his motherland is no longer a religion with your young man let me repeat thati will alter one word only the love of his motherland is no longer the religion or even part of the religion of your young man soldiering is a profession for those who embrace it it is so that mercenaries are made i have been to every one of your great cities in the north i have been there on a saturday afternoon the national holiday that is the day in japan on which our young men march and learn to shoot form companies and attend their drill feast days and holidays it is always the same they do what tradition has made a necessity for them they do it without grumbling wholeheartedly with an enthusiasm which has in it something almost of passion how do i find the youth of your country engaged i have discovered it is for that purpose that i have toured through england they go to see a game played called football they sit on seats and smoke and shout they watch a score of performersone score mindand the numbers who watch them are millions from town to town i went and it was always the same i see their white faces in a huge amphitheatre fifteen thousand here twenty thousand there thirty thousand at another place they watch and they shout while these men in the arena play with great skill this wonderful game when the match is over they stream into public houses their afternoon has been spent they talk it over again they smoke and drink so it is in one town and anotherso it is everywherethe strangest sight of all that i have seen in europe these are your young men the material out of which the coming generation must be fashioned how many of them can shoot how many of them can ride how many of them have any sort of uniform in which they could prepare to meet the enemy of their country what do they know or care for anything outside their little lives and what they call their love of sportthey who spend five days in your grim factories toiling before machinestheir one afternoon content to sit and watch the prowess of others i speak to these footballers themselves they are strong men and swift they are paid to play this game i do not find that even one of them is competent to strike a blow for his country if she needs him it is because of your young men then mr haviland that i cannot advise japan to form a new alliance with you it is because you are not a serious people it is because the units of your nation have ceased to understand that behind the life of every great nation stands the love of god whatever god it may be and the love of motherland these things may not be your fault they may indeed be the terrible penalty of success but no one who lives for ever so short a time amongst you can fail to see the truth you are commercialized out of all the greatness of life forgive me all of you that i say it so plainly but you are a race who are on the downward grade and japan seeks for no alliance save with those whose faces are lifted to the skies  the pause which followed was in itself significant the duke alone remained impassive bransomes face was dark with anger even the prime minister was annoyed bransome would have spoken but the former held out his hand to check him  if that is really your opinion of us prince he said it is useless to enter into argument with you especially as you have already acted upon your convictions i should like to ask you this question though a few weeks ago an appeal was made to our young men to bring up to its full strength certain forces which have been organized for the defence of the country do you know how many recruits we obtained in less than a month  fourteen thousand four hundred and seventyfive the prince answered promptly out of nearly seven millions who were eligible this pitiful result of itself might have been included amongst my arguments if i had felt that arguments were necessary mr haviland you may drive some of these young men to arms by persuasion by appealing to them through their womankind or their employers but you cannot create a national spirit and i tell you and i have proved it that the national spirit is not there i will go further the prince continued with increased earnestness if you still are not weary of the subject i will point out to you how little encouragement the youth of this country receive from those who are above them in social station in every one of your counties there is a hunt cricket clubs golf clubs in such numbers that their statistics absolutely overwhelm me everywhere one meets young men of leisure well off calmly proposing to settle down and spend the best part of their lives in what they call country life they will look after their estates they will hunt a little shoot a little go abroad for two months in the winter play golf a little lawn tennis perhaps or cricket i tell you that there are hundreds and thousands of these young men with money to spare who have no uniform which they could wearno i want to change that the prince cried with an impressive gesturewho have no uniform which they will be able to wear when the evil time comes how will they feel then these young men of family whose life has been given to sports and to idle amusements when their womankind come shrieking to them for protection and they dare not even handle a gun or strike a blow they must stand by and see their lands laid waste their womankind insulted they must see the land run red with the blood of those who offer a futile resistance but they themselves must stand by inactive they are not trained to fight as soldiersthey cannot fight as civilians  the prince forgets bransome remarked dryly that an invasion of this countrya practical invasionis very nearly an impossible thing  the prince laughed softly  my friend he said if i thought that you believed that although you are a cabinet minister of england i should think that you were the biggest fool who ever breathed today in warfare nothing is impossible i will guarantee i who have had only ten years of soldiering that if japan were where holland is today i would halve my strength in ships and i would halve my strength in men and i would overrun your country with ease at any time i chose you need not agree with me of course it is not a subject which we need discuss it is perhaps out of my province to allude to it the feeling which i have in my heart is this the laws of history are incontrovertible so surely as a great nation has weakened with prosperity so that her limbs have lost their suppleness and her finger joints have stiffened so surely does the plunderer come in good time the nation which loses its citizen army drives the first nail into its own coffin i do not say who will invade you or when although to my thinking any one could do it i simply say that in your present state invasion from some one or other is a sure thing  without admitting the truth of a single word you have said my dear prince the prime minister remarked there is another aspect of the whole subject which i think that you should consider if you find us in so parlous a state it is surely scarcely dignified or gracious on the part of a great nation like yours to leave us so abruptly to our fate supposing it were true that we were suffering a little from a period of too lengthened prosperity from an attack of overconfidence still think of the part we have played in the past we kept the world at bay while you fought with russia  that the prince replied was one of the conditions of a treaty which has expired if by that treaty our country profited more than yours that is still no reason why we should renew it under altered conditions gratitude is an admirable sentiment but it has nothing to do with the making of treaties  we are nevertheless bransome declared justified in pointing out to you some of the advantages which you have gained from your alliance with us you realize i suppose that save for our intervention the united states would have declared war against you four months ago  your good offices were duly acknowledged by my government the prince admitted yet what you did was in itself of no consequence it is as sure as north is north and south is south that you and america would never quarrel for the sake of japan that is another reason if another reason is needed why a treaty between us would be valueless you and ithe whole world knows that before a cycle of years have passed japan and america must fight when that time comes it will not be you who will help us  an alliance duly concluded between this country  the prince held out both his hands  listen he said a fortnight ago a certain person in america wrote and asked you in plain terms what your position would be if war between japan and america were declared what was your reply  bransome was on the point of exclaiming but the prime minister intervened  you appear to be a perfect secret service to yourself prince he said smoothly perhaps you can also tell us our reply  i can tell you this much the prince answered you did not send word back to washington that your alliance was a sacred charge upon your honor and that its terms must be fulfilled to the uttermost letter your reply i fancy was more in the nature of a compromise  how do you know what our reply was mr haviland asked  to tell you the truth i do not the prince answered smiling i have simply told you what i am assured that your answer must have been let us leave this matter we gain nothing by discussing it  you have been very candid with us prince mr haviland remarked we gather that you are opposed to a renewal of our alliance chiefly for two reasonsfirst that you have formed an unfavorable opinion of our resources and capacity as a nation and secondly because you are seeking an ally who would be of service to you in one particular eventuality namely a war with the united states you have spent some time upon the continent may we inquire whether your present attitude is the result of advances made to you by any other power if i am asking too much leave my question unanswered  the prince shook his head slowly  tonight he said i am speaking to you as one who is willing to show everything that is in his heart i will tell you then i have been to germany and i can assure you of my own knowledge that germany possesses the mightiest fighting machine ever known in the worlds history that i do truthfully and honestly believe yet listen to me i have talked to the men and i have talked to the officers i have seen them in barracks and on the parade ground and i tell you this when the time arrives for that machine to be set in motion it is my profound conviction that the result will be one of the greatest surprises of modern times i say no more nor must you ask me any questions but i tell you that we do not need germany as an ally i have been to russia and although our hands have crossed there can be no real friendship between our countries till time has wiped out the memory of our recent conflict france hates us because it does not understand us the future of japan is just as clear as the disaster which hangs over great britain there is only one possible ally for us only one possible combination that is what i have written home to my cousin the emperor that is what i pray that our young professors will teach throughout japan that is what it will be my mission to teach my country people if the fates will that i return safely home east and west are too far apart we are well outside the coming european struggle our strength will come to us from nearer home  china the prime minister exclaimed  the china of our own making the prince declared a note of tense enthusiasm creeping into his tonechina recreated after its great lapse of a thousand years you and i in our lifetime shall not see it but there will come a day when the ancient conquests of persia and greece and rome will seem as nothing before the allconquering armies of china and japan until those days we need no allies we will have none we must accept the insults of america and the rough hand of germany we must be strong enough to wait  a footman entered the room and made his way to the dukes chair  your grace he said a gentleman is ringing up from downing street who says he is speaking from the home office  whom does he want the duke asked  both your grace and mr haviland the man replied he wished me to say that the matter was of the utmost importance  the duke rose at once and glanced at the clock  it is an extraordinary hour he remarked for heseltine to be wanting us shall we go and see what it means haviland you will excuse us prince  the prince bowed  i think that we have talked enough of serious affairs tonight he said i shall challenge sir edward to a game of billiards    chapter xxxiii unafraid  the prince still fully attired save that in place of his dress coat he wore a loose smoking jacket stood at the windows of his sitting room at devenham castle looking across the park in the somewhat fitful moonlight the trees had taken to themselves grotesque shapes away in the distance the glimmer of the sea shone like a thin belt of quicksilver the stable clock had struck two the whole place seemed at rest only one light was gleaming from a long low building which had been added to the coach houses of recent years for a motor garage that one light the prince knew was on his account there his chauffeur waited untiring and sleepless with his car always ready for that last rush to the coast the advisability of which the prince had considered more than once during the last twentyfour hours the excitement of the evening the excitement of his unwonted outburst was still troubling him it was not often that he had so far overstepped the bounds which his natural caution his everpresent selfrestraint imposed upon him he paced restlessly to and fro from the sitting room to the bedroom and back again he had told the truththe bare simple truth he had seen the letters of fire in the sky and he had read them to these people because of their kindness because of a certain affection which he bore them to them it must have sounded like a man speaking in a strange tongue they had not understood perhaps even they would not believe in the absolute sincerity of his motives again he paused at the window and looked over the park to that narrow glittering stretch of sea why should he not for once forget the traditions of his race the pride which kept him there to face the end there was still time the cruiser which the emperor had sent was waiting for him in southampton harbor in twentyfour hours he would be in foreign waters he thought of these things earnestly even wistfully and yet he knew that he could not go perhaps they would be glad of an opportunity of getting rid of him now that he had spoken his mind in any case right was on their side the end if it must come was simple enough  he turned away from the window with a little shrug of the shoulders even as he did so there came a faint knocking at the door his servant had already retired for a moment it seemed to him that it could mean but one thing while he hesitated the handle was softly turned and the door opened to his amazement it was penelope who stood upon the threshold  miss morse he exclaimed breathlessly  she held out her hand as though to bid him remain silent for several seconds she seemed to be listening then very softly she closed the door behind her  miss penelope he cried softly you must not come in here please  she ignored his outstretched hand advancing a little further into the room there was tragedy in her white face she seemed to be shaking in every limb but not with nervousness directly he looked into her eyes he knew very well that the thing was close at hand  listen she whispered i had to come you dont know what is going on for the last half hour the telephone has been ringing continuously it is about you the home office has been ringing up to speak to the prime minister the chief inspector of scotland yard has been to see them one of their detectives has collected evidence which justifies them in issuing a warrant for your arrest  for my arrest the prince repeated  dont you understand she continued breathlessly dont you see how horrible it is they mean to arrest you for the murder of hamilton fynes and dicky vanderpole  if this must be so the prince answered why do they not come i am here  but you must not stay here she exclaimed you must escape it is too terrible to think that you shouldoh i cant say itthat you should have to face these charges if you are guilty well heaven help youif you are guilty i want you to escape all the same  he looked at her with the puzzled air of one who tries to reason with a child  dear miss penelope he said this is kind of you but after all remember that i am a man and i must not run away  but you cannot meet these charges she interrupted you cannot meet them you know it oh dont think i cant appreciate your point of view if you killed those men you killed them to obtain papers which you believed were necessary for the welfare of your country oh it is not i who judge you you did not do it i know for your own gain you did it because you are heart and soul a patriot but here alas they do not understand their whole standpoint is different they will judge you as they would a common criminal you must flyyou must indeed  dear miss penelope he said i cannot do that i cannot run away like a thief in the dark if this thing is to come it must come  but you dont understand she continued wringing her hands you think because you are a great prince and a prince of a friendly nation that the law will treat you differently it will not they have talked of it downstairs you are not formally attached to any one in this country you are not even upon the staff of the embassy you are here on a private mission as a private person and there is no way in which the government can intervene even if it would you are subject to its laws and you have broken them for heavens sake fly you have your motor car here let your man drive you to southampton and get on board the japanese cruiser you mustnt wait a single moment i believe that tomorrow morning will be too late  he took her hands in his very tenderly and yet with something of reverence in his gesture he looked into her eyes and he spoke very earnestly every word seemed to come from his heart  dear miss penelope he said it is very very kind of you to have come here and warned me only you cannot quite understand what this thing means to me remember what i told you once life and death to your people in this country seem to be the greatest things which the mind of man can hold it is not so with us we are brought up differently in a worthy cause a true japanese is ready to take death by the hand at any moment so it is with me now i have no regret even if i had even if life were a garden of roses for me what is ordained must come a little sooner or a little later it makes no matter  she sank on her knees before him  cant you understand why i am here she cried passionately it was i who told of the silken cord and knife  he was wholly unmoved he even smiled as though the thing were of no moment  it was right that you should do so he declared you must not reproach yourself with that  but i do i do she cried again i always shall dont you understand that if you stay here they will treat you  he interrupted laying his hand gently upon her shoulder  dear young lady he said you need never fear that i shall wait for the touch of your men of law death is too easily won for that if the end which you have spoken of comes there is another wayanother house of rest which i can reach  she rose slowly to her feet the absolute serenity of his manner bespoke an impregnability of purpose before which the words died away on her lips she realized that she might as well plead with the dead  you do not mind he whispered if i tell you that you must not stay here any longer  he led her toward the door upon the threshold he took her cold fingers into his hand and kissed them reverently  do not be too despondent he said i have a star somewhere which burns for me tonight i have been looking for it it is there still he added pointing to the wide open window it is there undimmed clearer and brighter than ever i have no fear  she passed away without looking up again the prince listened to her footsteps dying away in the corridor then he closed the door and entering his bedroom undressed himself and slept  when prince maiyo awoke on the following morning the sunshine was streaming into the room and his gravefaced valet was standing over his bed  his highness bath is ready he announced  the prince dressed quickly and was first in the pleasant morning room with its open windows leading on to the terrace he strolled outside and wandered amongst the flower beds here he was found soon afterwards by the dukes valet  your highness the latter said his grace has sent me to look for you he would be glad if you could spare him a moment or two in the library  the prince followed the man to the room where his host was waiting for him the duke with his hands behind his back was pacing restlessly up and down the apartment  good morning duke the prince said cheerfully another of your wonderful spring mornings upon the terrace the sun is almost hot soon i shall begin to fancy that the perfume of your spring flowers is the perfume of almond and cherry blossom  prince the duke said quietly i have sent for you as your host i speak to you now unofficially as an englishman to his guest i have been besieged through the night and even this morning with incomprehensible messages which come to me from those who administer the law in this country prince i want you to remember that however effete you may find us as a nation from your somewhat romantic point of view we have at least realized the highest ideals any nation has ever conceived in the administration of the law nobleman and pauper here are judged alike if their crime is the same their punishment is the same there is no man in this country who is strong enough to arrest the hand of justice  the prince bowed  my dear duke he said it has given me very much pleasure in the course of my investigations to realize the truth of what you have just said i agree with you entirely you could teach us in japan a great lesson on the fearless administration of the law now in some other countries  never mind those other countries the duke interrupted gravely i did not send for you to enter into an academic discussion i want you clearly to understand how i am placed supposing a distinguished member of my householdsupposing even you prince maiyowere to come within the arm of the law even the great claims of hospitality would leave me powerless  this the prince admitted i fully apprehend it is surely reasonable that the stranger in your country should be subject to your laws  very well then the duke continued listen to me prince this morning a london magistrate will grant what is called a search warrant which will enable the police to search from attic to cellar your house in st james square an inspector from scotland yard will be there this afternoon awaiting your return and he believes that he has witnesses who will be able to identify you as one who has broken the laws of this country i ask you no questions there is the telephone on the table my eightyhorsepower daimler is at the door and at your service i understand that your cruiser in southampton harbor is always under steam if there is anything more in reason that i can do you have only to speak the prince shook his head slowly  duke he said please send away your car unless it will take me to london quicker than my own what i have done i have done and for what i have done i will pay  the duke laid his hands upon the young mans shoulders and looked down into his face the duke was over six feet high and broad in proportion before him the prince seemed almost like a boy  maiyo he said we have grown fond of youmy wife my daughter all of us we dont want harm to come to you but there is the american ambassador watching all the time already he more than half suspects for our sakes princecome i will say for the sake of those who are grateful to you for your candor and truthfulness for the lessons you have tried to teach usmake use of my car you will reach southampton in half an hour  the prince shook his head his lips had parted in what was certainly a smile at the corners they quivered a little tremulous  my dear friend he said and his voice had softened almost to affection you do not quite understand you look upon the things which may come from your point of view and not from mine remember that to your philosophy life itself is the greatest thing born into the world to us it is the least if you would do me a service please see that i am able to start for london in half an hour    chapter xxxiv banzai  it was curious how the princes sudden departure seemed to affect almost every member of the little house party at first it had been arranged that the duke mr haviland sir edward bransome and the prince should leave in the formers car the princes following later with the luggage then the duchess whose eyes had filled with tears more than once after her whispered conversation with her husband announced that she too must go to town lady grace insisted upon accompanying her and penelope reminded them that she was already dressed for travelling and that in any case she meant to be one of the party before ten oclock they were all on their way to london  the prince sat side by side with lady grace the other two occupants of the car being the duke himself and mr haviland no one seemed in the least inclined for conversation the duke and mr haviland exchanged a few remarks but lady grace leaning back in her seat her features completely obscured by a thick veil declined to talk to any one the prince seemed to be the only one who made any pretence at enjoying the beauty of the spring morning who seemed even to be aware of the warm west wind the occasional perfume of the hedgeside violets and the bluebells which stretched like a carpet in and out of the belts of wood lady graces eyes from beneath her veil scarcely once left his face perhaps she thought these things were merely allegorical to him perhaps his eyes fixed so steadfastly upon the distant horizon were not as it seemed following the graceful outline of that grove of dark green pine trees but were indeed searching back into the corners of his life measuring up the good and evil of it asking the eternal questionwas it worth while  in the other car too silence reigned somerfield was the only one who struggled against the general air of depression  after all he remarked to bransome i dont see what were all so blue about if scotland yard are right and the prince is really the guilty person they imagine him i cannot see what sympathy he deserves of course they look upon this sort of thing more lightly in his own country but after all he was no fool he knew his risks  penelope spoke for the first time since they had left devenham  if you begin to talk like that charlie she said i shall ask the duchess to stop the car and put you down here in the road  somerfield laughed not altogether pleasantly  seven miles from any railway station he remarked  penelope shrugged her shoulders  i should not care in the least what happened to you today or at any other time she declared  after that somerfield held his peace and a somewhat strained silence followed soon they reached the outskirts of london long before midday they slackened speed after crossing battersea bridge and the two cars drew alongside they had arranged to separate here but curiously enough no one seemed to care to start the leave taking  you see the time the prince exclaimed it is barely eleven oclock i want you all if you will to come with me for ten minutes only to my house tomorrow it will be dismantled today i want you each to choose a keepsake from amongst my treasures there are so many ornaments over here engravings and bronzes which are called japanese and which are really only imitations i want you to have something if you will to remember me by all of you something which is really the handicraft of my country people  the duke looked for a moment doubtful  it wants an hour to midday the prince said softly there is time  they reached st james square in a few minutes there were no signs of disturbance the door flew open at their approach the same solemnfaced quietly moving butler admitted them the prince led the way into the room upon the ground floor which he called his library  it is a fancy of mine he said smiling to say goodbye to you all here you see that there is nothing in this room which is not really the product of japan here i feel indeed as though i had crossed the seas and were back under the shadow of my own mountains here i feel indeed your host especially as i am going to distribute my treasures  he took a picture from the wall and turned with it to the duke  duke he said this engraving is a rude thing but the hand which guided the steel has been withered for two hundred years and no other example remains of its cunning mr haviland he added stepping to his writing table this lacquered shrine with its pagoda roof has been attributed to kobodaishi and has stood upon the writing table of seven emperors sir edward this sword notwithstanding its strange shape and gilded chasing was wielded with marvellous effect if history tells the truth a hundred and thirty years ago by my greatgrandfather when he fought his way to the throne sir charles you are to go into parliament some day you will become a diplomat some day perhaps you will understand our language just now i am afraid he concluded this will seem to you but a bundle of purple velvet and vellum but it is really a manuscript of great curiosity which comes from the oldest monastery in asia the monastery of koyasan  he turned to the duchess  duchess he said you see that my tapestries have already gone they left yesterday for devenham castle i hope that you will find a place there where you may hang them they are a little older than your french ones and time as you may remember has been kind to them it may interest you to know that they were executed some thirteen hundred and fifty years ago and are of a design which alas we borrowed from the chinese  the prince paused for a moment all were trying to express their thanks but no one was wholly successful he waved their words gently aside  lady grace he said turning to the statuette of buddha in a corner of the room and taking from its neck a string of strange blue stones i will not ask you to wear these for they have adorned the necks of idols for many centuries but if you will keep them for my sake they may remind you sometimes of the color of our skies  once more he went to his writing table from it he lifted almost reverently a small bronze figurethe figure of a woman strongly built almost squat without grace whose eyes and head and arms reached upwards  miss penelope he said to you i make my one worthless offering this statuette has no grace no shapeliness according to the canons of your wonderful western art yet for five generations of my family it has been the symbol of our lives we are not idol worshippers in japan yet one by one the men of my race have bent their knee before this figure and have left their homes to fight for the thing which she represents she is not beautiful she does not stand for the joys and the great gifts of life but she represents the country which to us stands side by side with our god our parents and our emperor nothing in life has been dearer to me than this miss penelope to no other person would i part with it  she took it with a sudden hysterical sob which seemed to ring out like a strange note upon the unnatural stillness of the room and then there came a thing which happened before its time the door was opened inspector jacks came in with him were dr spencer whiles and the man who a few days ago had been discharged from st thomas hospital of the very distinguished company who were gathered there inspector jacks took little notice his eyes lit upon the form of the prince and he drew a sigh of relief the door was closed behind him and he saw no way by which he could be cheated of his victory he took a step forward and the prince advanced courteously as though to meet him the others for those few seconds seemed as though they had lost the power of speech or movement then before a word could be uttered by either the inspector or the prince the door was opened from the outside and a man came running ina man dressed in a shabby blue serge suit dark and thin he ran past the inspector and his companions and he fell on his knees before his master  i confess he cried it was i who climbed on to the railway car it was i who stabbed the american man in the tunnel and robbed him of his papers the others are innocent marki who brought the car for me knew nothing those who saw me return to this house knew nothing no man was my confidant i alone am guilty i thought they could not discover the truth but they have hunted me down he is therethe doctor who bandaged my knee i told him that it was a bicycle accident listen it was i who killed the young american vanderpole i followed him from the savoy hotel i dressed myself in the likeness of my master and i entered his taxi as a pleasant jest then i strangled him and i robbed him too he saw methat man soto cried pointing to the youth who stood at the inspectors left hand he was on his bicycle he skidded and fell through watching me i told my master that i was in trouble and he has tried to shield me but he did not know the truth if he had he would have given me over as i give myself now what i did i did because i love japan and because i hate america  his speech ended in a fit of breathlessness he lay there gasping the doctor bent forward looking at him first in perplexity and afterwards in amazement then very slowly and with the remnants of doubt still in his tone he answered inspector jacks unspoken question  he is the image of the man who came to me that night he declared he is wearing the same clothes too  what do you say the inspector whispered hoarsely to the youth on his other side dont hurry look at him carefully  the young man hesitated  he is the same height and figure as the man i saw enter the taxi he said i believe that it is he  inspector jacks stepped forward but the prince held out his hand  wait he ordered and his voice was sterner than any there had ever heard him use there was a fire in his eyes from which the man at his feet appeared to shrink  soto the prince said and he spoke in his own language so that no person in that room understood him save the one whom he addressedwhy have you done this  the man lay there resting now upon his side and supporting himself by the palm of his right hand his upturned face seemed to have in it all the passionate pleading of a dumb animal  illustrious prince he answered speaking also in his own tongue i did it for japan who are you to blame me who have offered his own life so freely i have no weight in the world for you the future is big you will go back to japan you will sit at the right hand of the emperor you will tell him of the follies and the wisdom of these strange countries you will guide him in difficulties your hand will be upon his as he writes across the sheets of time for the glory of the motherland banzai illustrious prince i too am of the immortals  he suddenly collapsed the doctor bent over him but the prince shook his head slowly  it is useless he said the man has confessed his crime he has told me the whole truth he has taken poison  lady grace began to cry softly the air of the room seemed heavy with pentup emotions the prince moved slowly toward the door and threw it open he turned towards them all  will you leave me he asked i wish to be alone  his eyes were like the eyes of a blind man  one by one they left the room inspector jacks amongst them the only person who spoke even in the hall was the inspector  it was the prince who brought the doctor here he muttered he must have known at least he must have known  mr haviland touched him on the arm  inspector jacks he whispered  inspector jacks saluted  the murderer is dead he continued speaking still under his breath silence is a wonderful gift mr jacks sometimes its reward is greater even than the reward of action  they passed from the house and once more its air of deep silence was unbroken the prince stood in the middle of that strange room whose furnishings and atmosphere seemed indeed so marvellously reminiscent of some far distant land he looked down upon the now lifeless figure raised the still white fingers in his for a moment and laid them reverently down then his head went upward and his eyes seemed to be seeking the heavens  so do the great die he murmured already the gods of our fathers are calling you soto the faithful banzai
