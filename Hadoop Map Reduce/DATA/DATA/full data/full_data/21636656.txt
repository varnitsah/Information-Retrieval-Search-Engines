21636656	picture and text  by henry james  harper and brothers  mdcccxciii     note  two of the following papers were originally published with illustrations in harpers magazine and the title of one of themthe first of titles has been altered from our artists in europe the other the article on mr sargent was accompanied by reproductions of several of his portraits the notice of mr abbey and that of mr reinhart appeared in harpers weekly that of mr alfred parsons figured as an introduction to the catalogue of an exhibition of his pictures the sketch of daumier was first contributed to the century and after the play to the new review     black and white  illustration black and white page image  if there be nothing new under the sun there are some things a good deal less old than others the illustration of books and even more of magazines may be said to have been born in our time so far as variety and abundance are the signs of it or born at any rate the comprehensive ingenious sympathetic spirit in which we conceive and practise it  if the centuries are ever arraigned at some bar of justice to answer in regard to what they have given of good or of bad to humanity our interesting age which certainly is not open to the charge of having stood with its hands in its pockets might perhaps do worse than put forth the plea of having contributed a fresh interest in black and white the claim may now be made with the more confidence from the very evident circumstance that this interest is far from exhausted these pages are an excellent place for such an assumption in harper they have again and again as it were illustrated the illustration and they constitute for the artist a series of invitations provocations and opportunities they may be referred to without arrogance in support of the contention that the limits of this large movement with all its new and rare refinement are not yet in sight     i  it is on the contrary the constant extension that is visible with the attendant circumstances of multiplied experiment and intensified researchcircumstances that lately pressed once more on the attention of the writer of these remarks on his finding himself in the particular spot which history will perhaps associate most with the charming revival a very old english village lying among its meadows and hedges in the very heart of the country in a hollow of the green hills of worcestershire is responsible directly and indirectly for some of the most beautiful work in black and white with which i am at liberty to concern myself here in other words for much of the work of mr abbey and mr alfred parsons i do not mean that broadway has told these gentlemen all they know the name from which the american reader has to brush away an incongruous association may as well be written first as last for mr parsons in particular who knows everything that can be known about english fields and flowers would have good reason to insist that the measure of his large landscape art is a large experience i only suggest that if one loves broadway and is familiar with it and if a part of that predilection is that one has seen mr abbey and mr parsons at work there the pleasant confusion takes place of itself ones affection for the wide long grassbordered vista of brownish gray cottages thatched latticed mottled mended ivied immemorial grows with the sense of its having ministered to other minds and transferred itself to other recipients just as the beauty of many a bit in many a drawing of the artists i have mentioned is enhanced by the sense or at any rate by the desire of recognition broadway and much of the land about it are in short the perfection of the old english rural tradition and if they do not underlie all the combinations by which in their pictorial accompaniments to rediscovered ballads their vignettes to story or sonnet these particular talents touch us almost to tears we feel at least that they would have sufficed they cover the scale  illustration priory  in regard however to the implications and explications of this perfection of a village primarily and to be just broadway is more than any one else mr frank millet mr laurence hutton discovered but mr millet appropriated it its sweetness was wasted until he began to distil and bottle it he disinterred the treasure and with impetuous liberality made us sharers in his fortune his own work moreover betrays him as well as the gratitude of participants as i could easily prove if it did not perversely happen that he has commemorated most of his impressions in color that excludes them from the small space here at my command otherwise i could testify to the identity of old nooks and old objects those that constitute both outofdoor and indoor furniture  illustration the villagegreen broadway  in such places as broadway and it is part of the charm of them to american eyes the sky looks down on almost as many things as the ceiling and things are the joy of the illustrator furnished apartments are useful to the artist but a furnished country is still more to his purpose a ripe midland english region is a museum of accessories and specimens and is sure under any circumstances to contain the article wanted this is the great recommendation of broadway everything in it is convertible even the passing visitor finds himself becoming so the place has so much character that it rubs off on him and if in an old gardenan old garden with old gates and old walls and old summerhouseshe lies down on the old grass on an immemorial rug no doubt it is ten to one but that he will be converted the little oblong sheaves of blank paper with elastic straps are fluttering all over the place there is portraiture in the air and composition in the very accidents everything is a subject or an effect a bit or a good thing it is always some kind of day if it be not one kind it is another the garden walls the mossy roofs the open doorways and brown interiors the oldfashioned flowers the bushes in figures the geese on the green the patches the jumbles the glimpses the color the surface the general complexion of things have all a value a reference and an application if they are a matter of appreciation that is why the graybrown houses are perhaps more brown than gray and more yellow than either they are various things in turn according to lights and days and needs it is a question of color all consciousness at broadway is that but the irresponsible profane are not called upon to settle the tint  it is delicious to be at broadway and to be one of the irresponsible profanenot to have to draw the single street is in the grand style sloping slowly upward to the base of the hills for a mile but you may enjoy it without a carking care as to how to render the perspective everything is stone except the general greennessa charming smooth local stone which looks as if it had been meant for great constructions and appears even in dry weather to have been washed and varnished by the rain halfway up the road in the widest place where the coaches used to turn there were many of old but the traffic of broadway was blown to pieces by steam though the destroyer has not come nearer than half a dozen miles a great gabled mansion which was once a manor or a house of state and is now a rambling inn stands looking at a detached swinging sign which is almost as big as itselfa very grand sign the arms of an old family on the top of a very tall post you will find something very like the place among mr abbeys delightful illustrations to she stoops to conquer when the september day grows dim and some of the windows glow you may look out if you like for tony lumpkins red coat in the doorway or imagine miss hardcastles quilted petticoat on the stair     ii  illustration millet  it is characteristic of mr frank millets checkered career with opposites so much mingled in it that such work as he has done for harper should have had as little in common as possible with midland english scenery he has been less a producer in black and white than a promoter and as i may say a protector of such production in others but none the less the back volumes of harper testify to the activity of his pencil as well as to the variety of his interests there was a time when he drew little else but cossacks and orientals and drew them as one who had good cause to be vivid of the young generation he was the first to know the russian plastically especially the russian soldier and he had paid heavily for his acquaintance during the russoturkish war he was correspondent in the field with the victors of the new york herald and the london daily newsa capacity in which he made many outoftheway many precious observations he has seen strange countriesthe east and the south and the west and the northand practised many arts to the london graphic in 1877 he sent striking sketches from the east as well as capital prose to the journals i have mentioned he has always been as capable of writing a text for his own sketches as of making sketches for the text of others he has made pictures without words and words without pictures he has written some very clever ghoststories and drawn and painted some very immediate realities he has lately given himself up to these latter objects and discovered that they have mysteries more absorbing than any others i find in harper in 1885 a wildgoose chase through north germany and denmark in which both pencil and pen are mr millets and both show the natural and the trained observer  he knows the artschools of the continent the studios of paris the dodges of antwerp the subjects the models of venice and has had much æsthetic as well as much personal experience he has draped and distributed greek plays at harvard as well as ridden over balkans to post pressing letters and given publicity to english villages in which susceptible americans may get the strongest sensations with the least trouble to themselves if the trouble in each case will have been largely his this is but congruous with the fact that he has not only found time to have a great deal of history himself but has suffered himself to be converted by others into an elementbeneficent i should call it if discretion did not forbid meof their history springing from a very old new england stock he has found the practice of art a wonderful antidote in his own language for belated puritanism he is very modern in the sense of having tried many things and availed himself of all of the facilities of his time but especially on this ground of having fought out for himself the battle of the puritan habit and the æsthetic experiment his experiment was admirably successful from the moment that the puritan levity was forced to consent to its becoming a serious one in other words if mr millet is artistically interesting today and to the author of these remarks he is highly so it is because he is a striking example of what the typical american quality can achieve  he began by having an excellent pencil because as a thoroughly practical man he could not possibly have had a weak one but nothing is more remunerative to follow than the stages by which faculty in general which is what i mean by the characteristic american quality has become the particular faculty so that if in the artists present work one recognizesrecognizes even fondlythe national handiness it is as handiness regenerate and transfigured the american adaptiveness has become a dutch finish the only criticism i have to make is of the preordained paucity of mr millets drawings for my mission is not to speak of his work in oils every year more important as was indicated by the brilliant interior with figures that greeted the spectator in so friendly a fashion on the threshold of the royal academy exhibition of 1888 nor to say that it is illustration tooillustration of any oldfashioned song or story that hums in the brain or haunts the memorynor even to hint that the admirable rendering of the charming old objects with which it deals among which i include the human face and figure in dresses unfolded from the lavender of the past the old surfaces and tones the stuffs and textures the old mahogany and silver and brassthe old sentiment too and the old picturemaking visionare in the direct tradition of terburg and de hoogh and metzu     iii  there is no paucity about mr abbey as a virtuoso in black and white and if one thing more than another sets the seal upon the quality of his work it is the rare abundance in which it is produced it is not a frequent thing to find combinations infinite as well as exquisite mr abbey has so many ideas and the gates of composition have been opened so wide to him that we cultivate his company with a mixture of confidence and excitement the readers of harper have had for years a great deal of it and they will easily recognize the feeling i allude tothe expectation of familiarity in variety the beautiful art and taste the admirable execution strike the hour with the same note but the figure the scene is ever a fresh conception never was ripe skill less mechanical and never was the faculty of perpetual evocation less addicted to prudent economies mr abbey never saves for the next picture yet the next picture will be as expensive as the last his whole career has been open to the readers of harper so that what they may enjoy on any particular occasion is not only the talent but a kind of affectionate sense of the history of the talent that history is from the beginning in these pages and it is one of the most interesting and instructive just as the talent is one of the richest and the most sympathetic in the artannals of our generation i may as well frankly declare that i have such a taste for mr abbeys work that i cannot affect a judicial tone about it criticism is appreciation or it is nothing and an intelligence of the matter in hand is recorded more substantially in a single positive sign of such appreciation than in a volume of sapient objections for objections sakethe cheapest of all literary commodities silence is the perfection of disapproval and it has the great merit of leaving the value of speech when the moment comes for it unimpaired  accordingly it is important to translate as adequately as possible the positive side of mr abbeys activity none today is more charming and none helps us more to take the large joyous observant various view of the business of art he has enlarged the idea of illustration and he plays with it in a hundred spontaneous ingenious ways truth and poetry is the motto legibly stamped upon his pencilcase for if he has on the one side a singular sense of the familiar salient importunate facts of life on the other they reproduce themselves in his mind in a delightfully qualifying medium it is this medium that the fond observer must especially envy mr abbey and that a literary observer will envy him most of all  such a hapless personage who may have spent hours in trying to produce something of the same result by sadly different means will measure the difference between the roundabout faint descriptive tokens of respectable prose and the immediate projection of the figure by the pencil a charming storyteller indeed he would be who should write as mr abbey draws however what is style for one art is style for other so blessed is the fraternity that binds them together and the worker in words may take a lesson from the picturemaker of she stoops to conquer it is true that what the verbal artist would like to do would be to find out the secret of the pictorial to drink at the same fountain mr abbey is essentially one of those who would tell us if he could and conduct us to the magic spring but here he is in the nature of the case helpless for the happy ambiente as the italians call it in which his creations move is exactly the thing as i take it that he can least give an account of it is a matter of genius and imaginationone of those things that a man determines for himself as little as he determines the color of his eyes how for instance can mr abbey explain the manner in which he directly observes figures scenes places that exist only in the fairyland of his fancy for the peculiar sign of his talent is surely this observation in the remote it brings the remote near to us but such a complicated journey as it must first have had to make remote in time in differing degrees remote in place remote in feeling in habit and in their ambient air are the images that spring from his pencil and yet all so vividly so minutely so consistently seen where does he see them where does he find them how does he catch them and in what language does he delightfully converse with them in what mystic recesses of space does the revelation descend upon him  the questions flow from the beguiled but puzzled admirer and their tenor sufficiently expresses the claim i make for the admirable artist when i say that his truth is interfused with poetry he spurns the literal and yet superabounds in the characteristic and if he makes the strange familiar he makes the familiar just strange enough to be distinguished everything is so human so humorous and so caught in the act so buttoned and petticoated and gartered that it might be round the corner and so it isbut the corner is the corner of another world in that other world mr abbey went forth to dwell in extreme youth as i need scarcely be at pains to remind those who have followed him in harper it is not important here to give a catalogue of his contributions to that journal turn to the back volumes and you will meet him at every step every one remembers his young tentative prelusive illustrations to herrick in which there are the prettiest glimpses guesses and foreknowledge of the effects he was to make completely his own the herrick was done mainly if i mistake not before he had been to england and it remains in the light of this fact a singularly touching as well as a singularly promising performance the eye of sense in such a case had to be to a rare extent the minds eye and this convertibility of the two organs has persisted  from the first and always that other world and that qualifying medium in which i have said that the human spectacle goes on for mr abbey have been a county of old england which is not to be found in any geography though it borders as i have hinted on the worcestershire broadway few artistic phenomena are more curious than the congenital acquaintance of this perverse young philadelphian with that mysterious locality it is there that he finds them allthe nooks the corners the people the clothes the arbors and gardens and teahouses the queer courts of old inns the sunwarmed angles of old parapets i ought to have mentioned for completeness in addition to his pictures to goldsmith and to the scraps of homely british song this latter class has contained some of his most exquisite work his delicate drawings for mr william blacks judith shakespeare and in relation to that distinguished namei dont mean mr blacksit is a comfort if i may be allowed the expression to know that as to the best of my belief i violate no confidence in saying he is even now engaged in the great work of illustrating the comedies he is busy with the merchant of venice he is up to his neck in studies in rehearsals here again while in prevision i admire the result what i can least refrain from expressing is a sort of envy of the process knowing what it is with mr abbey and what explorations of the delightful it entailsarduous indefatigable till the end seems almost smothered in the means such material complications they engender but making ones daily task a thing of beauty and honor and beneficence     iv  illustration alfred parsons  even if mr alfred parsons were not a masterly contributor to the pages of harper it would still be almost inevitable to speak of him after speaking of mr abbey for the definite reason i hope that in giving it i may not appear to invade too grossly the domain of private life that these gentlemen are united in domestic circumstance as well as associated in the nature of their work in london in the relatively lucid air of campden hill they dwell together and their beautiful studios are side by side however there is a reason for commemorating mr parsons work which has nothing to do with the accidentalthe simple fact that that work forms the richest illustration of the english landscape that is offered us today harper has for a long time past been full of mr alfred parsons who has made the dense fine detail of his native land familiar in far countries amid scenery of a very different type this is what the modern illustration can do when the ripeness of the modern sense is brought to it and the woodcutter plays with difficulties as the brilliant americans do today following his original at a breakneck pace an illusion is produced which in its very completeness makes one cast an uneasy eye over the dwindling fields that are still left to conquer such art as alfred parsonssuch an accomplished translation of local aspects translated in its turn by cunning hands and diffused by a wonderful system of periodicity through vast and remote communities has i confess in a peculiar degree the effect that so many things have in this age of multiplicationthat of suppressing intervals and differences and making the globe seem alarmingly small vivid and repeated evocations of english rural thingsthe meadows and lanes the sedgy streams the old orchards and timbered houses the stout individual insular trees the flowers under the hedge and in it and over it the sweet rich country seen from the slope the bend of the unformidable river the actual romance of the castle against the sky the place on the hillside where the gray church begins to peep a peaceful little grassy path leads up to it over a stileall this brings about a terrible displacement of the very objects that make pilgrimage a passion and hurries forward that ambiguous advantage which i dont envy our grandchildren that of knowing all about everything in advance having trotted round the globe annually in the magazines and lost the bloom of personal experience it is a part of the general abolition of mystery with which we are all so complacently busy today one would like to retire to another planet with a box of mr parsons drawings and be homesick there for the pleasant places they commemorate  there are many things to be said about his talent some of which are not the easiest in the world to express i shall not however make them more difficult by attempting to catalogue his contributions in these pages a turning of the leaves of harper brings one constantly face to face with him and a systematic search speedily makes one intimate the reader will remember the beautiful illustrations to mr blackmores novel of springhaven which were interspersed with striking figurepieces from the pencil of that very peculiar pictorial humorist mr frederick barnard who allowing for the fact that he always seems a little too much to be drawing for dickens and that the footlights are the illumination of his scenic world has so remarkable a sense of english types and attitudes costumes and accessories in what may be called the greatcoatandgaiters periodthe period when people were stiff with riding and wicked conspiracies went forward in sanded provincial innparlors mr alfred parsons who is still conveniently young waked to his first vision of pleasant material in the comprehensive county of somerseta capital centre of impression for a painter of the bucolic he has been to america he has even reproduced with remarkable discrimination and truth some of the wayside objects of that country not making them look in the least like their english equivalents if equivalents they may be said to have was it there that mr parsons learned so well how americans would like england to appear i ask this idle question simply because the england of his pencil and not less of his brush of his eminent brush there would be much to say is exactly the england that the american imagination restricted to itself constructs from the poets the novelists from all the delightful testimony it inherits it was scarcely to have been supposed possible that the native point of view would embrace and observe so many of the things that the more or less famished outsider is in vulgar parlance after in other words though i appear to utter a foolish paradox the danger might have been that mr parsons knew his subject too well to feel itto feel it i mean à laméricaine he is as tender of it as if he were vague about it and as certain of it as if he were blasé  but after having wished that his country should be just so we proceed to discover that it is in fact not a bit different between these phases of our consciousness he is an unfailing messenger the reader will remember how often he has accompanied with pictures the text of some amiable paper describing a pastoral regionwarwickshire or surrey devonshire or the thames he will remember his exquisite designs for certain of wordsworths sonnets a sonnet of wordsworth is a difficult thing to illustrate but mr parsons ripe taste has shown him the way then there are lovely morsels from his hand associated with the drawings of his friend mr abbeyheadpieces tailpieces vignettes charming combinations of flower and foliage decorative clusters of all sorts of pleasant rural emblems if he has an inexhaustible feeling for the country in general his love of the myriad english flowers is perhaps the fondest part of it he draws them with a rare perfection and alwayslittle definite delicate tremulous things as they arewith a certain nobleness this latter quality indeed i am prone to find in all his work and i should insist on it still more if i might refer to his important paintings so composite are the parts of which any distinguished talent is made up that we have to feel our way as we enumerate them and yet that very ambiguity is a challenge to analysis and to characterization this nobleness on mr parsons part is the element of stylesomething large and manly expressive of the total character of his facts his landscape is the landscape of the male vision and yet his touch is full of sentiment of curiosity and endearment these things and others besides make him the most interesting the most living of the new workers in his line and what shall i say of the other things besides how can i take precautions enough to say that among the new workers deeply english as he is there is comparatively something french in his manner many people will like him because they see in himor they think they doa certain happy mean will they not fancy they catch him taking the middle way between the unsociable french étude and the oldfashioned english picture if one of these extremes is a desert the other no doubt is an oasis still more vain i have a recollection of productions of mr alfred parsons which might have come from a frenchman who was in love with english riversides i call to mind no studiesif he has made anyof french scenery but if i did they would doubtless appear english enough it is the fashion among sundry to maintain that the english landscape is of no use for la peinture sérieuse that it is wanting in technical accent and is in general too storytelling too selfconscious and dramatic also too lumpish and stodgy of a greendun vert bêtewhich when reproduced looks like that of the chromo certain it is that there are many hands which are not to be trusted with it and taste and integrity have been known to go down before it but alfred parsons may be pointed to as one who has made the luxuriant and lovable things of his own country almost as serious as those familiar objectsthe pasture and the poplarwhich even when infinitely repeated by the great school across the channel strike us as but meagre morsels of france     v  illustration mr george h boughton  in speaking of mr george h boughton ara i encounter the same difficulty as with mr millet i find the window closed through which alone almost it is just to take a view of his talent mr boughton is a painter about whom there is little that is new to tell today so conspicuous and incontestable is his achievement the fruit of a career of which the beginning was not yesterday he is a draughtsman and an illustrator only on occasion and by accident these accidents have mostly occurred however in the pages of harper and the happiest of them will still be fresh in the memory of its readers in the sketching rambles in holland mr abbey was a participant as witness among many things the admirable drawing of the old frisian woman bent over her bible in church with the heads of the burghers just visible above the rough archaic pewtopsa drawing opposite to page 112 in the handsome volume into which these contributions were eventually gathered together but most of the sketches were mr boughtons and the charming amusing text is altogether his save in the sense that it commemorates his companions impressions as well as his ownthe delightful irresponsible visual sensual pictorial capricious impressions of a painter in a strange land the person surely whom at particular moments one would give most to be if there be anything happier than the impressions of a painter it is the impressions of two and the combination is set forth with uncommon spirit and humor in this frank record of the innocent lust of the eyes mr boughton scruples little in general to write as well as to draw when the fancy takes him to write in the manner of painters with the bold irreverent unconventional successful brush if i were not afraid of the patronizing tone i would say that there is little doubt that if as a painter he had not had to try to write in character he would certainly have made a characteristic writer he has the most enviable finds not dreamed of in timid literature yet making capital descriptive prose other specimens of them may be encountered in two or three christmas tales signed with the name whose usual place is the corner of a valuable canvas  if mr boughton is in this manner not a simple talent further complications and reversions may be observed in him as for instance that having reverted from america where he spent his early years back to england the land of his origin he has now in a sense oscillated again from the latter to the former country he came to london one day years ago from paris where he had been eating nutritively of the tree of artistic knowledge in order to reembark on the morrow for the united states but that morrow never cameit has never come yet certainly now it never can come for the country that mr boughton left behind him in his youth is no longer there the old new york is no longer a port to sail to unless for phantom ships in imagination however the author of the return of the mayflower has several times taken his way back he has painted with conspicuous charm and success various episodes of the early puritan story he was able on occasion to remember vividly enough the low new england coast and the thin new england air he has been perceptibly an inventor calling into being certain types of face and dress certain tones and associations of color all in the line of what i should call subdued harmonies if i were not afraid of appearing to talk a jargon which people are hungry for when they acquire a boughton and which they can obtain on no other terms this pictorial element in which he moves is made up of divers delicate things and there would be a roughness in attempting to unravel the tapestry there is old english and old american and old dutch in it and a friendly unexpected new dutch tooan ingredient of new amsterdama strain of knickerbocker and of washington irving there is an admirable infusion of landscape in it from which some people regret that mr boughton should ever have allowed himself to be distracted by his importunate love of sadfaced pretty women in closefitting coifs and old silverclasped cloaks and indeed though his figures are very tender his landscape is to my sense tenderer still moreover mr boughton bristles not aggressively but in the degree of a certain conciliatory pertinacity with contradictious properties he lives in one of the prettiest and most hospitable houses in london but the note of his work is the melancholy of rural things of lonely people and of quaint faroff legend and refrain there is a delightful ambiguity of period and even of clime in him and he rejoices in that inability to depict the modern which is the most convincing sign of the contemporary he has a genius for landscape yet he abounds in knowledge of every sort of ancient fashion of garment the buckles and buttonholes the very shoeties of the past are dear to him it is almost always autumn or winter in his pictures his horizons are cold his trees are bare he does the bare tree beautifully and his draperies lined with fur but when he exhibits himself directly as in the fantastic rambles before mentioned contagious high spirits are the clearest of his showing here he appears as an irrepressible felicitous sketcher and i know no pleasanter record of the joys of sketching or even of those of simply looking théophile gautier himself was not more inveterately addicted to this latter wanton exercise there ought to be a pocket edition of mr boughtons book which would serve for travellers in other countries too give them the point of view and put them in the mood such a blessing and such a distinction too is it to have an eye mr boughtons in his goodhumored dutch wanderings holds from morning till night a sociable graceful revel from the moment it opens till the moment it closes its day is a round of adventures his jolly pictorial narrative reflecting every glint of october sunshine and patch of russet shade tends to confirm us afresh in the faith that the painters life is the best life the life that misses fewest impressions     vi  illustration du maurier  mr du maurier has a brilliant history but it must be candidly recognized that it is written or drawn mainly in an english periodical it is only during the last two or three years that the most ironical of the artists of punch has exerted himself for the entertainment of the readers of harper but i seem to come too late with any commentary on the nature of his satire or the charm of his execution when he began to appear in harper he was already an old friend and for myself i confess i have to go through rather a complicated mental operation to put into words what i think of him what does a man think of the language he has learned to speak he judges it only while he is learning mr du mauriers work in regard to the life it embodies is not so much a thing we see as one of the conditions of seeing he has interpreted for us for so many years the social life of england that the interpretation has become the text itself we have accepted his types his categories his conclusions his sympathies and his ironies it is not given to all the world to thread the mazes of london society and for the great body of the disinherited the vast majority of the anglosaxon public mr du mauriers representation is the thing represented is the effect of it to nip in the bud any remote yearning for personal participation i feel tempted to say yes when i think of the follies the flatnesses the affectations and stupidities that his teeming pencil has made vivid but that vision immediately merges itself in anothera panorama of tall pleasant beautiful people placed in becoming attitudes in charming gardens in luxurious rooms so that i can scarcely tell which is the more definite the impression satiric or the impression plastic  this i take to be a sign that mr du maurier knows how to be general and has a conception of completeness the world amuses him such queer things go on in it but the part that amuses him most is certain lines of our personal structure that amusement is the brightest the other is often sad enough a sharp critic might accuse mr du maurier of lingering too complacently on the lines in question of having a certain ideal of lissome elongation to which the promiscuous truth is sometimes sacrificed but in fact this artists p truth never pretends to be promiscuous it is avowedly select and specific what he depicts is so preponderantly the tapering people that the remainder of the picture in a notice as brief as the present may be neglected if his dramatis personæ are not all the tenants of drawingrooms they are represented at least in some relation to these arry and his friends at the fancy fair are in society for the time the point of introducing them is to show how the contrast intensifies them of late years mr du maurier has perhaps been a little too docile to the muse of elegance the idiosyncrasies of the masher and the high girl with elbows have beguiled him into occasional inattention to the doings of the short and shabby but his career has been long and rich and i allude in such words but to a moment of it  the moral of iti refer to the artistic oneseen altogether is striking and edifying enough what mr du maurier has attempted to do is to give in a thousand interrelated drawings a general satiric picture of the social life of his time and country it is easy to see that through them an increasing purpose runs they all hang together and refer to each othercomplete confirm correct illuminate each other sometimes they are not satiric satire is not pure charm and the artist has allowed himself to go in for pure charm sometimes he has allowed himself to go in for pure fantasy so that satire which should hold on to the mane of the real slides off the other side of the runaway horse but he remains on the whole pencil in hand a wonderfully copious and veracious historian of his age and his civilization     vii  i have left mr reinhart to the last because of his importance and now this very importance operates as a restriction and even as a sort of reproach to me to go well round him at a deliberate pace would take a whole book with mr abbey mr reinhart is the artist who has contributed most abundantly to harper his work indeed in quantity considerably exceeds mr abbeys he is the observer of the immediate as mr abbey is that of the considerably removed and the conditions he asks us to accept are less expensive to the imagination than those of his colleague he is in short the vigorous racy prosateur of that human comedy of which mr abbey is the poet he illustrates the modern sketch of travel the modern talethe poor little quiet psychological conversational modern tale which i often think the artist invited to represent it to the eye must hate unless he be a very intelligent master little on a superficial view would there appear to be in it to represent the superficial view is after all the natural one for the picturemaker a talent of the first order however only wants to be set thinking as a single word will often make it mr reinhart at any rate triumphs whether there be life or not in the little tale itself there is unmistakable life in his version of it mr reinhart deals in that element purely with admirable frankness and vigor he is not so much suggestive as positively and sharply representative his facility his agility his universality are a truly stimulating sight he asks not too many questions of his subject but to those he does ask he insists upon a thoroughly intelligible answer by his universality i mean perhaps as much as anything else his admirable drawing not precious as the æsthetic say nor pottering as the vulgar but free strong and secure which enables him to do with the human figure at a moments notice anything that any occasion may demand it gives him an immense range and i know not how to express it is not easy my sense of a certain capable indifference that is in him otherwise than by saying that he would quite as soon do one thing as another  for it is true that the admirer of his work rather misses in him that intimation of a secret preference which many strong draughtsmen show and which is not absent for instance i dont mean the secret but the intimation from the beautiful doings of mr abbey it is extremely present in mr du mauriers work just as it was visible less elusively in that of john leech his predecessor in punch mr abbey has a haunting type du maurier has a haunting type there was little perhaps of the haunted about leech but we know very well how he wanted his pretty girls his british swell and his hunting men to look he betrayed a predilection he had his little ideal that an artist may be a great force and not have a little ideal the scarcely too much to be praised charles keene is there i mean he is in punch to show us he has not a haunting typenot heand i think that no one has yet discovered how he would have liked his pretty girls to look he has kept the soft conception too much to himselfhe has not trifled with the common truth by letting it appear this common truth in its innumerable combinations is what mr reinhart also shows us with of course infinitely less of a parti pris of laughing at it though as i must hasten to add the female face and form in his hands always happen to take on a much lovelier cast than in mr keenes these things with him however are not a private predilection an artists dream mr reinhart is solidly an artist but i doubt whether as yet he dreams and the absence of private predilections makes him seem a little hard he is sometimes rough with our average humanity and especially rough with the feminine portion of it he usually represents american life in which that portion is often spoken of as showing to peculiar advantage but mr reinhart sees it generally as very bourgeois his good ladies are apt to be rather thick and short rather huddled and plain i shouldnt mind it so much if they didnt look so much alive they are incontestably possible the long brilliant series of drawings he made to accompany mr charles dudley warners papers on the american wateringplaces form a rich bourgeois epic which imaginations haunted by a type must accept with philosophy for the sketches in question will have carried the tale and all sorts of irresistible illusion with it to the four corners of the earth full of observation and reality of happy impressionism taking all things as they come with many a charming picture of youthful juxtaposition they give us a sense to which nothing need be added of the energy of mr reinharts pencil they are a final collection of pictorial notes on the manners and customs the aspects and habitats in july and august of the great american democracy of which certainly taking one thing with another they give a very comfortable cheerful account but they confirm that analytic view of which i have ventured to give a hintthe view of mr reinhart as an artist of immense capacity who yet somehow doesnt care i must add that this aspect of him is modified in the one case very gracefully in the other by the operation of a sort of constructive humor remarkably strong in his illustrations of spanish life and his sketches of the berlin political world  his fashion of remaining outside as it were makes him to the analyst only the more interesting for the analyst if he have any critical life in him will be prone to wonder why he doesnt care and whether matters may not be turned about in such a way as that he should with the consequence that his large capacity would become more fruitful still mr reinhart is open to the large appeal of paris where he livesas is evident from much of his workwhere he paints and where in crowded exhibitions reputation and honors have descended upon him and yet paris for all she may have taught him has not given him the mystic sentimentabout which i am perhaps writing nonsense is it nonsense to say that being very much an incarnation of the modern international spirit he might be a frenchman in new york were he not an american in paris the moral of his work is possibly the inevitable want of finality of intrinsic character in that sweet freedom does the cosmopolite necessarily pay for his freedom by a want of functionthe impersonality of not being representative must one be a little narrow to have a sentiment and very local to have a quality or at least a style and would the missing type if i may mention it yet again haunt our artistwho is somehow in his rare instrumental facility outside of quality and stylea good deal more if he were not amid the mixture of associations and the confusion of races liable to fall into vagueness as to what types are he can do anything he likes by which i mean he can do wonderfully even the things he doesnt like but he strikes me as a force not yet fully used     edwin a abbe  nothing is more interesting in the history of an artistic talent than the moment at which its elective affinity declares itself and the interest is great in proportion as the declaration is unmistakable i mean by the elective affinity of a talent its climate and period of preference the spot on the globe or in the annals of mankind to which it most fondly attaches itself to which it reverts incorrigibly round which it revolves with a curiosity that is insatiable from which in short it draws its strongest inspiration a man may personally inhabit a certain place at a certain time but in imagination he may be a perpetual absentee and to a degree worse than the worst irish landlord separating himself from his legal inheritance not only by mountains and seas but by centuries as well when he is a man of genius these perverse predilections become fruitful and constitute a new and independent life and they are indeed to a certain extent the sign and concomitant of genius i do not mean by this that high ability would always rather have been born in another country and another age but certainly it likes to choose it seldom fails to react against imposed conditions if it accepts them it does so because it likes them for themselves and if they fail to commend themselves it rarely scruples to fly away in search of others we have witnessed this flight in many a case i admit that if we have sometimes applauded it we have felt at other moments that the discontented undomiciled spirit had better have stayed at home  mr abbey has gone afield and there could be no better instance of a successful fugitive and a genuine affinity no more interesting example of selectionselection of field and subjectoperating by that insight which has the precocity and certainty of an instinct the domicile of mr abbeys genius is the england of the eighteenth century i should add that the palace of art which he has erected there commandsfrom the rear as it werevarious charming glimpses of the preceding age the finest work he has yet done is in his admirable illustrations in harpers magazine to she stoops to conquer but the promise that he would one day do it was given some years ago in his delightful volume of designs to accompany herricks poems to which we may add as supplementary evidence his drawings for mr william blacks novel of judith shakespeare  mr abbey was born in philadelphia in 1852 and manifesting his brilliant but unencouraged aptitudes at a very early age came in 1872 to new york to draw for harpers weekly other views than this if i have been correctly informed had been entertained for his futurea fact that provokes a smile now that his manifest destiny has been or is in course of being so very neatly accomplished the spirit of modern aesthetics did not at any rate as i understand the matter smile upon his cradle and the circumstance only increases the interest of his having had from the earliest moment the clearest artistic vision  it has sometimes happened that the distinguished draughtsman or painter has been born in the studio and fed as it were from the palette but in the great majority of cases he has been nursed by the profane and certainly on the doctrine of mathematical chances a philadelphia genius would scarcely be an exception mr abbey was fortunate however in not being obliged to lose time he learned how to swim by jumping into deep water even if he had not known by instinct how to draw he would have had to perform the feat from the moment that he found himself attached to the art department of a remarkably punctual periodical in such a periodical the events of the day are promptly reproduced and with the morrow so near the day is necessarily a short onetoo short for gradual education such a school is not no doubt the ideal one but in fact it may have a very happy influence if a youth is to give an account of a scene with his pencil at a certain hourto give it as it were or perishhe will have become conscious in the first place of a remarkable incentive to observe it so that the roughness of the fostermother who imparts the precious faculty of quick complete observation is really a blessing in disguise to say that it was simply under this kind of pressure that mr abbey acquired the extraordinary refinement which distinguishes his work in black and white is doubtless to say too much but his admirers may be excused in view of the beautiful result for almost wishing on grounds of patriotism to make the training or the absence of training responsible for as much as possible for as no artistic genius that our country has produced is more delightful than mr abbeys so surely nothing could be more characteristically american than that it should have formed itself in the conditions that happened to be nearest at hand with the crowds streets and squares the railway stations and telegraph poles the wondrous signboards and triumphant bunting of new york for the source of its inspiration and with a big hurrying printinghouse for its studio if to begin the practice of art in these conditions was to incur the danger of being crude mr abbey braved it with remarkable success at all events if he went neither i through the mill of paris nor through that of munich the writer of these lines more than consoles himself for the accident his talent is unsurpassably fine and yet we reflect with complacency that he picked it up altogether at home if he is highly distinguished he is irremediably native and premising always that i speak mainly of his work in black and white it is difficult to see as we look for instance at the admirable series of his drawings for she stoops to conquer what more paris or munich could have done for him there is a certain refreshment in meeting an american artist of the first order who is not a pupil of gérôme or of cabanel  of course i hasten to add we must make our account with the fact that as i began with remarking the great development of mr abbeys powers has taken place amid the brown old accessories of a country where that eighteenth century which he presently marked for his own are more profusely represented than they have the goodfortune to be in america and consequently limit our contention to the point that his talent itself was already formed when this happy initiation was opened to it he went to england for the first time in 1878 but it was not all at once that he fell into the trick so irresistible for an artist doing his special work of living there i must forbid myself every impertinent conjecture but it may be respectfully assumed that mr abbey rather drifted into exile than committed himself to it with malice prepense the habit at any rate today appears to be confirmed and to express it roughly he is surrounded by the utensils and conveniences that he requires during these years until the recent period when he began to exhibit at the watercolor exhibitions his work has been done principally for harpers magazine and the record of it is to be found in the recent back volumes i shall not take space to tell it over piece by piece for the reader who turns to the magazine will have no difficulty in recognizing it it has a distinction altogether its own there is always poetry humor charm in the idea and always infinite grace and security in the execution  as i have intimated mr abbey never deals with the things and figures of today his imagination must perform a wide backward journey before it can take the air but beyond this modern radius it breathes with singular freedom and naturalness at a distance of fifty years it begins to be at home it expands and takes possession it recognizes its own with all his ability with all his tact it would be impossible to him we conceive to illustrate a novel of contemporary manners he would inevitably throw it back to the age of hairpowder and postchaises the coats and trousers the feminine gear the chairs and tables of the current year the general aspect of things immediate and familiar say nothing to his mind and there are other interpreters to whom he is quite content to leave them he shows no great interest even in the modern face if there be a modern face apart from a modern setting i am not sure what he thinks of its complications and refinements of expression but he has certainly little relish for its banal vulgar mustache its prosaic mercantile whisker surmounting the last new thing in shirtcollars dear to him is the physiognomy of cleanshaven periods when cheek and lip and chin abounding in line and surface had the air of soliciting the pencil impeccable as he is in drawing he likes a whole face with reason and likes a whole figure the latter not to the exclusion of clothes in which he delights but as the clothes of our greatgrandfathers helped it to be seen no one has ever understood breeches and stockings better than he or the human leg that delight of the draughtsman as the costume of the last century permitted it to be known the petticoat and bodice of the same period have as little mystery for him and his women and girls have altogether the poetry of a bygone manner and fashion they are not modern heroines with modern nerves and accomplishments but figures of remembered song and story calling up visions of spinet and harpsichord that have lost their music today highwalled gardens that have ceased to bloom flowered stuffs that are faded locks of hair that are lost loveletters that are pale by which i dont mean that they are vague and spectral for mr abbey has in the highest degree the art of imparting life and he gives it in particular to his wellmade blooming maidens they live in a world in which there is no question of their passing harvard or other examinations but they stand very firmly on their quaintlyshod feet they are exhaustively felt and eminently qualified to attract the opposite sex which is not the case with ghosts who moreover do not wear the most palpable petticoats of quilted satin nor sport the most delicate fans nor take generally the most ingratiating attitudes  illustration the old house  the best work that mr abbey has done is to be found in the succession of illustrations to she stoops to conquer here we see his happiest characteristics andtill he does something still more brilliantmay take his full measure no work in black and white in our time has been more truly artistic and certainly no success more unqualified the artist has given us an evocation of a social state to its smallest details and done it with an unsurpassable lightness of touch the problem was in itself delightfulthe accidents and incidents granted a situation de comédie of an old rambling wainscoted outoftheway english countryhouse in the age of goldsmith here mr abbey is in his elementgiven up equally to unerring observation and still more infallible divination the whole place and the figures that come and go in it live again with their individual look their peculiarities their special signs and oddities the spirit of the dramatist has passed completely into the artists sense but the spirit of the historian has done so almost as much tony lumpkin is as we say nowadays a document and miss hardcastle embodies the results of research delightful are the humor and quaintness and grace of all this delightful the variety and the richness of personal characterization and delightful above all the drawing it is impossible to represent with such vividness unless to begin with one sees and it is impossible to see unless one wants to very much or unless in other words one has a great love mr abbey has evidently the tenderest affection for just the old houses and the old things the old faces and voices the whole irrevocable human scene which the genial hand of goldsmith has passed over to him and there is no inquiry about them that he is not in a position to answer he is intimate with the buttons of coats and the buckles of shoes he knows not only exactly what his people wore but exactly how they wore it and how they felt when they had it on he has sat on the old chairs and sofas and rubbed against the old wainscots and leaned over the old balusters he knows every mended place in tony lumpkins stockings and exactly how that ingenuous youth leaned back on the spinet with his thick familiar thumb out when he presented his inimitable countenance with a grin to mr hastings after he had set his fond mother awhimpering there is nothing in the whole series bytheway better indicated than the exquisitely simple halfbumpkin halfvulgar expression of tonys countenance and smile in this scene unless it be the charming arch yet modest face of miss hardcastle lighted by the candle she carries as still holding the door by which she comes in she is challenged by young marlow to relieve his bewilderment as to where he really is and what she really is in short if we have all seen she stoops to conquer acted mr abbey has had the better fortune of seeing it off the stage and it is noticeable how happily he has steered clear of the danger of making his people theatrical typesmere masqueraders and wearers of properties this is especially the case with his women who have not a hint of the conventional paint and patches simpering with their hands in the pockets of aprons but are taken from the same originals from which goldsmith took them  if it be asked on the occasion of this limited sketch of mr abbeys powers where after all he did learn to draw so perfectly i know no answer but to say that he learned it in the school in which he learned also to paint as he has been doing in these latest years rather tentatively at first but with greater and greater successthe school of his own personal observation his drawing is the drawing of direct immediate solicitous study of the particular case without tricks or affectations or any sort of cheap subterfuge and nothing can exceed the charm of its delicacy accuracy and elegance its variety and freedom its clear frank solution of difficulties if for the artist it be the foundation of every joy to know exactly what he wants as i hold it is indeed mr abbey is to all appearance to be constantly congratulated and i apprehend that he would not deny that it is a goodfortune for him to have been able to arrange his life so that his eye encounters in abundance the particular cases of which i speak two or three years ago at the institute of painters in watercolors in london he exhibited an exquisite picture of a peaceful old couple sitting in the corner of a low quiet ancient room in the waning afternoon and listening to their daughter as she stands up in the middle and plays the harp to them they are darby and joan with all the poetry preserved they sit hand in hand with bent approving heads and the deep recess of the window looking into the garden where we may be sure there are yewtrees clipped into the shape of birds and beasts the panelled room the quaintness of the fireside the oldtime provincial expression of the scene all belong to the class of effects which mr abbey understands supremely well so does the great russet wall and highpitched mottled roof of the rural almshouse which figures in the admirable watercolor picture that he exhibited last spring a group of remarkably pretty countrywomen have been arrested in front of it by the passage of a young soldiera raw recruit in scarlet tunic and white ducks somewhat prematurely conscious of military glory he gives them the benefit of the goosestep as he goes he throws back his head and distends his fingers presenting to the ladies a back expressive of more consciousness of his fine figure than of the lovely mirth that the artist has depicted in their faces lovely is their mirth indeed and lovely are they altogether mr abbey has produced nothing more charming than this bright knot of handsome tittering daughters of burghers in their primeval pelisses and sprigged frocks i have however left myself no space to go into the question of his prospective honors as a painter to which everything now appears to point and i have mentioned the two pictures last exhibited mainly because they illustrate the happy opportunities with which he has been able to surround himself the sweet old corners he appreciates the russet walls of mossgrown charities the lowbrowed nooks of manor cottage and parsonage the fresh complexions that flourish in green pastoral countries where it rains not a littleevery item in this line that seems conscious of its pictorial use appeals to mr abbey not in vain he might have been a grandson of washington irving which is a proof of what i have already said that none of the young american workers in the same field have so little as he of that imperfectly assimilated foreignness of suggestion which is sometimes regarded as the strength but which is also in some degree the weakness of the pictorial effort of the united states his execution is as sure of itself as if it rested upon infinite parisian initiation but his feeling can best be described by saying that it is that of our own dear mothertongue if the writer speaks when he writes and the draughtsman speaks when he draws mr abbey in expressing himself with his pencil certainly speaks pure english he reminds us to a certain extent of meissonier especially the meissonier of the illustrations to that charming little volume of the conies rémois and the comparison is highly to his advantage in the matter of freedom variety ability to represent movement meissoniers figures are stockstill and facial expressionabove all in the handling of the female personage so rarely attempted by the french artist but he differs from the latter signally in the fact that though he shares his sympathy as to period and costume his people are of another race and tradition and move in a world locally altogether different mr abbey is still young he is full of ideas and intentions and the work he has done may in view of his time of life of his opportunities and the singular completeness of his talent be regarded really as a kind of foretaste and prelude it can hardly fail that he will do better things still when everything is so favorable life itself is his subject and that is always at his door the only obstacle therefore that can be imagined in mr abbeys future career is a possible embarrassment as to what to choose he has hitherto chosen so well however that this obstacle will probably not be insuperable      charles s reinhart  we americans are accused of making too much ado about our celebrities of being demonstratively conscious of each step that we take in the path of progress and the accusation has its ground doubtless in this sense that it is possible among us today to become a celebrity on unprecedentedly easy terms this however at the present hour is the case all the world over and it is difficult to see where the standard of just renown remains so high that the first stone may be cast it is more and more striking that the machinery of publicity is so enormous so constantly growing and so obviously destined to make the globe small in relation of the objects famous or obscure which cover it that it procures for the smallest facts and the most casual figures a reverberation to be expected only in the case of a worldconqueror the newspaper and the telegram constitute a huge soundingboard which has every day and every hour to be made to vibrate to be fed with items and the diffusion of the items takes place on a scale out of any sort of proportion to their intrinsic importance the crackle of common things is transmuted into thundera thunder perhaps more resounding in america than elsewhere for the reason that the sheet of tin shaken by the jupiter of the press has been cut larger but the difference is only of degree not of kind and if the system we in particular have brought to perfection would seem to be properly applied only to alexanders and napoleons it is not striking that these adequate subjects present themselves even in other countries the end of it all surely no man can see unless it be that collective humanity is destined to perish from a rupture of its tympanum that is a theme for a later hour and meanwhile perhaps it is well not to be too frightened some of the items i just spoke of are after all larger than others and if as a general thing it is a mistake to pull up our reputations to see how they are growing there are some so well grown that they will bear it and others of a hardy stock even while they are tender we may feel for instance comparatively little hesitation in extending an importunate hand towards the fine young sapling of which mr reinhart is one of the branches it is a plant of promise which has already flowered profusely and the fragrance of which it would be affectation not to to notice let us notice it then with candor for it has all the air of being destined to make the future sweeter the plant in question is of course simply the art of illustration in black and white to which american periodical literature has lately given such an impetus and which has returned the good office by conferring a great distinction on our magazines in its new phase the undertaking has succeeded and it is not always that fortune descends upon so deserving a head two or three fine talents in particular have helped it to succeed and mr reinhart is not the least conspicuous of these it would be idle for a writer in harper to pretend to any diffidence of appreciation of his work for the pages are studded from many years back with the record of his ability mr reinhart took his first steps and made his first hits in harper which owes him properly a portrait in return for so much portraiture i may exaggerate the charm and the importance of the modern illustrative form may see in it a capacity of which it is not yet itself wholly conscious but if i do so mr reinhart is partly responsible for the aberration abundant intelligent interpretative work in black and white is to the sense of the writer of these lines one of the pleasantest things of the time having only to rise to the occasion to enjoy a great future this idea i confess is such as to lead one to write not only sympathetically but pleadingly about the artists to whom one looks for confirmation of it if at the same time as we commemorate what they have done we succeed in enlarging a little the conception of what they may yet do we shall be repaid even for having exposed ourselves as fanaticsfanatics of the general manner i mean not of particular representatives of it  may not this fanaticism in a particular case rest upon a sense of the resemblance between the general chance as it may be called of the draughtsman in black and white with contemporary life for his theme and the opportunity upon which the literary artist brings another form to bear the forms are different though with analogies but the field is the samethe immense field of contemporary life observed for an artistic purpose there is nothing so interesting as that because it is ourselves and no artistic problem is so charming as to arrive either in a literary or a plastic form at a close and direct notation of what we observe if one has attempted some such exploit in a literary form one cannot help having a sense of union and comradeship with those who have approached the question with the other instrument this will be especially the case if we happen to have appreciated that instrument even to envy we may as well say it outright we envy it quite unspeakably in the hands of mr reinhart and in those of mr abbey there is almost no limit to the service to which we can imagine it to be applied and we find ourselves wishing that these gentlemen may be made adequately conscious of all the advantages it represents we wonder whether they really are so we are disposed even to assume that they are not in order to join the moral to insist on the lesson the master whom we have mentally in view mr reinhart is a near approach to him may be if he will only completely know it so prompt so copious so universalso all there as we say nowadays and indeed so all everywhere there is only too much to see too much to do and his process is the one that comes nearest to minimizing the quantity he can touch so many things he can go from one scene to another he can sound a whole concert of notes while the painter is setting up his easel the painter is majestic dignified academic important superior anything you will but he is in the very nature of the case only occasional he is serious but he is comparatively clumsy he is a terrible time getting under way and he has to sacrifice so many subjects while he is doing one the illustrator makes one immense sacrifice of coursethat of color but with it he purchases a freedom which enables him to attack ever so many ideas it is by variety and numerosity that he commends himself to his age and it is for these qualities that his age commends him to the next the twentieth century the latter half of it will no doubt have its troubles but it will have a great compensatory luxury that of seeing the life of a hundred years before much more vividly than weeven happy wesee the life of a hundred years ago but for this our illustrators must do their best appreciate the endless capacity of their form it is to the big picture what the short story is to the novel  it is doubtless too much i hasten to add to ask mr reinhart for instance to work to please the twentieth century the end will not matter if he pursues his present very prosperous course of activity for it is assuredly the fruitful vein the one i express the hope to see predominant the portrayal of the manners types and aspects that surround us mr reinhart has reached that happy period of life when a worker is in full possession of his means when he has done for his chosen instrument everything he can do in the way of forming it and rendering it complete and flexible and has the fore only to apply it with freedom confidence and success these to our sense are the golden hours of an artists life happier even than the younger time when the future seemed infinite in the light of the first rays of glory the first palpable hits the very sense that the future is not unlimited and that opportunity is at its highwatermark gives an intensity to the enjoyment of maturity then the acquired habit of knowing how must simplify the problem of execution and leave the artist free to think only of his purpose as befits a real creator mr reinhart is at the enviable stage of knowing in perfection how he has arrived at absolute facility and felicity the machine goes of itself it is no longer necessary to keep lifting the cover and pouring in the oil of fond encouragement all the attention may go to the idea and the subject it may however remain very interesting to others to know how the faculty was trained the pipe was tuned the early phases of such a process have a relative importance even when at the lime so gradual are many beginnings and so obscure man a morrow they may have appeared neither delightful nor profitable they are almost always to be summed up in the single precious word practice this word represents at any rate mr reinharts youthful history and the profusion in which though no doubt occasionally disguised the boon was supplied to him in the offices of harpers magazine there is nothing so innate that it has not also to be learned for the best part of any aptitude is the capacity to increase it  mr reinharts experience began to accumulate very early for at pittsburgh where he was born he was free to draw to his hearts content there was no romantic attempt as i gather to nip him in the bud on the contrary he was despatched with almost prosaic punctuality to europe and was even encouraged to make himself at home in munich munich in his case was a pisaller for paris where it would have been his preference to study when he definitely surrendered as it were to his symptoms he went to paris but paris seemed blocked and complicated and munich presented advantages which if not greater were at least easier to approach mr reinhart passe through the mill of the bavarian school and when it had turned him out with its characteristic polish he came back to america with a very substantial stock to dispose of it would take a chapter by itself if we were writing a biography this now very usual episode of the return of the young american from the foreign conditions in which he has learned his professional language and his position in face of the community that he addresses in a strange idiom there has to be a prompt adjustment between ear and voice if the interlocutor is not to seem to himself to be intoning in the void there is always an inner history in all this as well as an outer onesuch however as it would take much space to relate mr reinharts more or less alienated accent fell by goodfortune on a comprehending listener he had made a satirical drawing in the nature of the cartoon of a comic journal on a subject of the hour and addressed it to the editor of harpers weekly the drawing was not publishedthe satire was perhaps not exactly on the right notebut the draughtsman was introduced thus began by return of post as it were and with preliminaries so few that they could not well have been less a connection of many years if i were writing a biography another chapter would come in herea curious almost a pathetic one for the course of things is so rapid in this country that the years of mr reinharts apprenticeship to pictorial journalism positively recent as they are already are almost prehistoric tomorrow at least the complexion of that time its processes ideas and standards together with some of the unsophisticated who carried them out will belong to old new york a certain mollifying dimness rests upon them now and their superseded brilliancy gleams through it but faintly it is a lively span for mr reinhart to have been at once one of the unsophisticated and one of the actually modern  that portion of his very copious work to which more particularly i apply the latter term has been done for harpers magazine during these latter years it has come like so much of american work today from beyond the seas whether or not that foreign language of which i just spoke never became in new york for this especial possessor of it a completely convenient medium of conversation is more than i can say at any rate mr reinhart eventually reverted to europe and settled in paris paris had seemed rather inhospitable to him in his youth but he has now fitted his key to the lock it would be satisfactory to be able to express scientifically the reasons why as a general thing the american artist as well as his congener of many another land carries on his function with less sense of resistance in that city than elsewhere he likes paris best but that is not scientific the difference is that though theoretically the production of pictures is recognized in america and in england in paris it is recognized both theoretically and practically and i do not mean by this simply that pictures are boughtfor they are not predominantly as it happensbut that they are more presupposed the plastic is implied in the french conception of things and the studio is as natural a consequence of it as the postoffice is of letterwriting vivid representation is the genius of the french language and the need of the french mind the people have invented more aids to it than any other and as these aids make up a large part of the artists life he feels his best home to be in the place where he finds them most he may begin to quarrel with that home on the day a complication is introduced by the question of what he shall representa totally different consideration from that of the method but for mr reinhart this question has not yet offered insoluble difficulties he represents everythinghe has accepted so general an order so long as his countrymen flock to paris and pass in a homogeneous procession before his eyes there is not the smallest difficulty in representing them when the case requires that they shall be taken in connection with their native circumstances and seen in their ambient air he is prepared to come home and give several months to the task as on the occasion of mr dudley warners history of a tour among the wateringplaces to which he furnished so rich and so curious a pictorial accompaniment sketchbook in hand he betakes himself according to need to germany to england to italy to spain the readers of harper will have forgotten his admirable pictorial notes on the political world at berlin so rich and close in characterization to the spanish vistas of mr g p lathrop he contributed innumerable designs delightful notes of an artists quest of the sketchable many of which are singularly full pictures the soldiers playing dominoes at a café is a powerful page of life mr reinhart has of course interpreted many a fictive scenehe has been repeatedly called upon to make the novel and the story visible this he energetically and patiently does though of course we are unable to say whether the men and women he makes us see are the very people whom the authors have seen that is a thing that in any case one will never know besides the authors who dont see vaguely are apt to see perversely the storyteller has at any rate the comfort with mr reinhart that his drawings are constructive and have the air of the actual he likes to represent characterhe rejoices in the specifying touch  the evidence of this is to be found also in his pictures for i ought already to have mentioned that for these many years they are beginning to be many he has indulged in the luxury of color it is not probable that he regards himself in the first place as an illustrator in the sense to which the term is usually restricted he is a very vigorous and various painter and at the salon a constant and conspicuous exhibitor he is fond of experiments difficulties and dangers and i divine that it would be his preference to be known best by his painting in which he handles landscape with equal veracity it is a pity that the critic is unable to contend with him on such a point without appearing to underestimate that work mr reinhart has so much to show for his preference that i am conscious of its taking some assurance to say that i am not sure he is right this would be the case even if he had nothing else to show than the admirable picture entitled washed ashore un epave  which made such an impression in the salon of 1887 it represents the dead body of an unknown man whom the tide has cast up lying on his back feet forward disfigured dishonored by the sea a small group of villagers are collected near it divided by the desire to look and the fear to see a gendarme official and responsible his uniform contrasting with the mortal disrepair of the victim takes down in his notebook the procèsverbal of the incident and an old sailor pointing away with a stiffened arm gives him the benefit of what he knows about the matter plain pitying fishwives hushed with their shawls in their mouths hang back as if from a combination too solemnthe mixture of death and the law three or four men seem to be glad it isnt they the thing is a masterpiece of direct representation and has wonderfully the air of something seen found without being looked for excellently composed but not artificial deeply touching but not sentimental large close and sober this important work gives the full measure of mr reinharts great talent and constitutes a kind of pledge it may be perverse on my part to see in it the big banknote as it were which may be changed into a multitude of gold and silver pieces i cannot however help doing so washed ashore is painted as only a painter paints but i irreverently translate it into its equivalent in illustrationshalf a hundred little examples in black and white of the same sort of observation for this observation immediate familiar sympathetic human and not involving a quest of style for which color is really indispensable is a mistress at whose service there is no derogation in placing ones self to do little things instead of big may be a derogation a great deal will depend upon the way the little things are done besides no work of art is absolutely little i grow bold and even impertinent as i think of the way mr reinhart might scatter the smaller coin at any rate whatever proportion his work in this line may bear to the rest it is to be hoped that nothing will prevent him from turning out more and more to play the rare faculty that produces it his studies of american moeurs in association with mr warner went so far on the right road that we would fain see him make all the rest of the journey they made us ask straightway for more and were full of intimations of what was behind they showed what there is to seewhat there is to guess let him carry the same inquiry further let him carry it all the way it would be serious work and would abound in reality it would help us as it were to know what we are talking about in saying this i feel how much i confirm the great claims i just made for the revival of illustration     alfred parsons  it would perhaps be extravagant to pretend in this embarrassed age that merry england is still intact but it would be strange if the words happy england should not rise to the lips of the observer of mr alfred parsons numerous and delightful studies of the gardens great and small of his country they surely have a representative value in more than the literal sense and might easily minister to the quietest complacency of patriotism people whose criticism is imaginative will see in them a kind of compendium of what in home things is at once most typical and most enviable and going further they will almost wish that such a collection might be carried by slow stages round the globe to kindle pangs in the absent and passions in the alien as it happens to be a globe the english race has largely peopled we can measure the amount of homesickness that would be engendered on the way in fact one doubts whether the sufferer would even need to be of english strain to attach the vision of home to the essentially lovable places that mr parsons depicts they seem to generalize and typify the idea so that every one may feel in every case that he has a sentimental property in the scene the very sweetness of its reality only helps to give it that storybook quality which persuades us we have known it in youth  and yet such scenes may well have been constructed for the despair of the colonial for they remind us at every glance of that perfection to which there is no short cutnot even unexampled prosperity and to which time is the only guide mr parsons pictures speak of many complicated things but in what they tell us of his subjects they speak most of duration such happy nooks have grown slowly such fortunate corners have had a history and their fortune has been precisely that they have had time to have it comfortably have not been obliged to try for character without it  character is their strong point and the most expensive of all ingredients mr parsons portraiture seizes every shade of it seizes it with unfailing sympathy he is doubtless clever enough to paint rawness when he must but he has an irrepressible sense of ripeness half the ripeness of englandhalf the religion one might almost sayis in its gardens they are truly pious foundations it is doubtless because there are so many of them that the country seems so finished and the sort of care they demand is an intenser deliberation which passes into the national temper one must have lived in other lands to observe fully how large a proportion of this one is walled in for growing flowers the english love of flowers is inveterate it is the most unanimous protest against the grayness of some of the conditions and it should receive justice from those who accuse the race of taking its pleasure too sadly a good garden is an organized revel and there is no country in which there are so many  mr parsons had therefore only to choose at his leisure and one might heartily have envied him the process scarcely knowing which to prefer of all the pleasant pilgrimages that would make up such a quest he had fortunately the knowledge which could easily lead to more and a career of discovery behind him he knew the right times for the right things and the right things for the right places he had innumerable memories and associations he had painted up and down the land and looked over many walls he had followed the bounty of the year from month to month and from one profusion to another to follow it with him in this admirable series is to see that he is master of the subject there will be no lack of confidence on the part of those who have already perceived in much of mr parsons work a supreme illustration of all that is widely natureloving in the english interest in the flower no sweeter submission to mastery can be imagined than the way the daffodils under his brush to begin at the beginning break out into early april in the lovely drawings of stourhead one of the most charming of thesea corner of an old tumbledup place in wiltshire where many things have come and gonerepresents that moment of transition in which contrast is so vivid as to make it more dramatic than many playsthe very youngest throb of spring with the brown slope of the foreground coming back to consciousness in pale lemoncolored patches and on the top of the hill against the still cold sky the equally delicate forms of the wintry trees by the time these forms have thickened the expanses of daffodil will have become a mass of bluebells all the daffodil pictures have a rare loveliness but especially those that deal also with the earlier fruitblossom the young plumtrees in berkshire orchards here the air is faintly pink and the painter makes us feel the little blow in the thin blue sky the spring fortunately is everybodys property and in the language of all the arts the easiest word to conjure with it is therefore partly mr parsons goodluck that we enjoy so his rendering of these phases but on the other hand we look twice when its a case of meddling with the exquisite and if he inspires us with respect it is because we feel that he has been deeply initiated no one knows better the friendly reasons for our stopping when chatting natives pronounce the weather foine at charming casual corners of old villages where grassy ways cross each other and timbered houses bulge irregularly and there are fresh things behind crooked palings witness the little vision of blewbury in berkshire reputedly of ancient british origin with a road all round it and only footways within no one in the herefordshire orchards masses the white cowparsley in such profusion under the apple blossoms or makes the whitewashed little damsontrees look so innocently responsible and charming on the edge of the brook over which the planks are laid for the hens delightful in this picture is the sense of the clean spring day after rain with the blue of the sky washed faint delightful is the biggish view one of the less numerous oilpictures of the somersetshire garden where that peculiarly english look of the openair room is produced by the stretched carpet of the turf and the firm cushions of the hedges and a pair of proprietors perhaps happier than they know are putting in an afternoon among their tulips under the flushed appletrees whose stems are so thin and whose brims so heavy are the absorbed couple at any rate aware of the surprising degree to which the clustered ruddy roofs of the next small town over the hedge off at the left may remind the fanciful spectator of the way he has seen little dim italian cities look on their hilltops the whole thing in this subject has the particular english note to which mr parsons repeatedly testifies the nook quality the air of a land and a life so infinitely subdivided that they produce a thousand pleasant privacies the painter moves with the months and finds after the earliest things the great bed of pansies in the angle of the old garden at sutton in which for felicity of position and perfect pictorial service renderedto say nothing of its polygonal pyramidal roofthe ancient toolhouse or teahouse is especially to be commended very far descended is such a corner as this very full of reference to vanished combinations and uses and the artist communicates to us a feeling for it that makes us wish disinterstedly it may be still as long preserved  he finds in june at blackdown the blaze of the yellow azaleabush or in another spot the strong pink of the rhododendron beneath the silver firs that deepen the blue of the sky he finds the vicarage walk at kings langley a smother of oldfashioned flowersa midsummer vista for the figures of a happy lady and a lucky dog he finds the delicious huddle of the gabled pigeonhaunted roof of a certain brown old building at frame with poppies and gladiolus and hollyhock crowding the beautiful foreground he findsapparently in the same placethe tangle of the hardy flowers that come while the roses are still in bloom with the tall blue larkspurs standing high among them he finds the lilies white and red at broadway and the poppies which have dropped most of their petalsapparently to let the roses which are just coming out give their grand party their humility is rewarded by the artists admirable touch in the little bare poppyheads that nod on their flexible pins  but i cannot go on to say everything that such a seeker such a discoverer as mr parsons findsthe less that the purpose of these limited remarks is to hint at our own trouvailles a view of the field at any rate would be incomplete without such specimens as the three charming oilpictures which commemorate holme lacey there are gardens and gardens and these represent the sort that are always spoken of in the plural and most arrogate the title they form in england a magnificent collection and if they abound in a quiet assumption of the grand style it must be owned that they frequently achieve it there are people to be found who enjoy them and it is not at any rate when mr parsons deals with them that we have an opening for strictures as we look at the blaze of full summer in the brilliantly conventional parterres we easily credit the tale of the 40000 plants it takes to fill the beds more than this we like the long paths of turf that stretch between splendid borders recalling the frescoed galleries of a palace we like the immense hedges whose tops are high against the sky while we are liking we like perhaps still better since they deal with a very different order the two watercolors from the dear little garden at winchelseaespecially the one in which the lady takes he ease in her hammock on a sociable shady terrace from which the ground drops and looks at red rye across the marshes another garden where a contemplative hammock would be in order is the lovely canonical plot at salisbury with the everlasting spire above it tinted in the summer skyunless in the same place you should choose to hook yourself up by the grassy bank of the avon at the end of the lawn with the meadows the cattle the distant willows across the river to look at  three admirable watercolors are devoted by mr parsons to the perceptible dignity of gravetye in sussex the dignity of very serious gardens entitled to ceremonious consideration few things in england can show a greater wealth of bloom than the wide flowery terrace immediately beneath the gray gabled house where tens of thousands of tearoses in predominant possession have in one direction a mass of high yews for a background they divide their province with the carnations and pansies a wilder ness of tender petals ignorant of anything rougher than the neighborhood of the big unchanged medley of tall yuccas and saxifrage with miscellaneous fillingin in the picture which presents the charming house in profile the artist shows us later in september at gravetye the pale violet multitude of the michaelmas daisies another i great bunch or bank of which half masks and greatly beautifies the rather bare yellow cottage at broadway this brings us on to the autumn if i count as autumnal the admirable large watercolor of a part of a garden at shiplake with the second bloom of the roses and a glimpse of a turn of the thames this exquisite picture expresses to perfection the beginning of the languor of the completed seasonwith its look of warm rest of doing nothing in the cloudless sky to the same or a later moment belongs the straight walk at fladburythe old rectory garden by the avon with its irish yews and the red lady in her chair also the charming watercolor of young slim appletrees full of fruit this must be october beneath an admirable blue and white sky still later comes the big peartree that has turned among barer boughs to flamecolor and in another picture the very pale russet of the thinned cherrytrees standing beneath a grayish sky above a foreshortened slope last of all we have in oils december and a hard frost in a bare appleorchard indented with a deep gully which makes the place somehow a subject and which in fact three or four years ago made it one for a larger picture by mr parsons full of truth and style  this completes his charming story of the life of the english year told in a way that convinces us of his intimate acquaintance with it half the interest of mr parsons work is in the fact that he paints from a full mind and from a store of assimilated knowledge in every touch of nature that he communicates to us we feel something of the thrill of the wholewe feel the innumerable relations the possible variations of the particular objects this makes his manner serious and masculinerescues it from the thinness of tricks and the coquetries of chic we walk with him on a firm earth we taste the tone of the air and seem to take nature and the climate and all the complicated conditions by their big general hand the painters manner in short is one with the study of thingshis talent is a part of their truth in this happy series we seem to see still more how that talent was formed how his rich motherland has been from the earliest observation its nurse and inspirer he gives back to her all the good she has done him     john s sargent  i was on the point of beginning this sketch of the work of an artist to whom distinction has come very early in life by saying in regard to the degree to which the subject of it enjoys the attention of the public that no american painter has hitherto won himself such recognition from the expert but i find myself pausing at the start as on the edge of a possible solecism is mr sargent in very fact an american painter the proper answer to such a question is doubtless that we shall be well advised to pretend it and the reason of this is simply that we have an excellent opportunity born in europe he has also spent his life in europe but none the less the burden of proof would rest with those who should undertake to show that he is a european moreover he has even on the face of it this great symptom of an american origin that in the line of his art he might easily be mistaken for a frenchman it sounds like a paradox but it is a very simple truth that when today we look for american art we find it mainly in paris when we find it out of paris we at least find a great deal of paris in it mr sargent came up to the irresistible city in his twentieth year from florence where in 1856 he had been born of american parents and where his fortunate youth had been spent he entered immediately the studio of carolus duran and revealed himself in 1877 at the age of twentytwo in the portrait of that mastera fine model in more than one sense of the word he was already in possession of a style and if this style has gained both in finish and in assurance it has not otherwise varied as he saw and rendered ten years ago so he sees and renders today and i may add that there is no present symptom of his passing into another manner  those who have appreciated his work most up to the present time articulate no wish for a change so completely does that work seem to them in its kind the exact translation of his thought the exact fit of his artistic temperament it is difficult to imagine a young painter less in the dark about his own ideal more lucid and more responsible from the first about what he desires in an altogether exceptional degree does he give us the sense that the intention and the art of carrying it out are for him one and the same thing in the brilliant portrait of carolus duran which he was speedily and strikingly to surpass he gave almost the full measure of this admirable peculiarity that perception with him is already by itself a kind of execution it is likewise so of course with many another genuine painter but in sargents case the process by which the object seen resolves itself into the object pictured is extraordinarily immediate it is as if painting were pure tact of vision a simple manner of feeling  from the time of his first successes at the salon he was hailed i believe as a recruit of high value to the camp of the impressionists and today he is for many people most conveniently pigeonholed under that head it is not necessary to protest against the classification if this addition always be made to it that mr sargents impressions happen to be worthy of record this is by no means inveterately the case with those of the ingenuous artists who most rejoice in the title in question to render the impression of an object may be a very fruitful effort but it is not necessarily so that will depend upon what i wont say the object but the impression may have been the talents engaged in this school lie not unjustly as it seems to me under the suspicion of seeking the solution of their problem exclusively in simplification if a painter works for other eyes as well as his own he courts a certain danger in this directionthat of being arrested by the cry of the spectator ah but excuse me i myself take more impressions than that we feel a synthesis not to be an injustice only when it is rich mr sargent simplifies i think but he simplifies with style and his impression is the finest form of his energy  his work has been almost exclusively in portraiture and it has been his fortune to paint more women than men therefore he has had but a limited opportunity to reproduce that generalized grand air with which his view of certain figures of gentlemen invests the model which is conspicuous in the portrait of carolus duran and of which his splendid docteur pozzi the distinguished paris surgeon a work not sent to the salon is an admirable example in each of these cases the model has been of a gallant pictorial type one of the types which strike us as made for portraiture which is by no means the way of all as especially appears for instance in the handsome hands and frilled wrists of m carolus whose cane rests in his fine fingers as if it were the hilt of a rapier the most brilliant of all mr sargents productions is the portrait of a young lady the magnificent picture which he exhibited in 1881 and if it has mainly been his fortune since to commemorate the fair faces of women there is no ground for surprise at this sort of success on the part of one who had given so signal a proof of possessing the secret of the particular aspect that the contemporary lady of any period likes to wear in the eyes of posterity painted when he was but fourandtwenty years of age the picture by which mr sargent was represented at the salon of 1881 is a performance which may well have made any critic of imagination rather anxious about his future in common with the superb group of the children of mr edward boit exhibited two years later it offers the slightly uncanny spectacle of a talent which on the very threshold of its career has nothing more to learn it is not simply precocity in the guise of maturitya phenomenon we very often meet which deceives us only for an hour it is the freshness of youth combined with the artistic experience really felt and assimilated of generations my admiration for this deeply distinguished work is such that i am perhaps in danger of overstating its merits but it is worth taking into account that today after several years acquaintance with them these merits seem to me more and more to justify enthusiasm the picture has this sign of productions of the first order that its style clearly would save it if everything else should changeour measure of its value of resemblance its expression of character the fashion of dress the particular associations it evokes it is not only a portrait but a picture and it arouses even in the profane spectator something of the painters sense the joy of engaging also by sympathy in the solution of the artistic problem there are works of which it is sometimes said that they are painters pictures this description is apt to be intended invidiously and the production of which i speak has the goodfortune at once to belong to this class and to give the plain man the kind of pleasure that the plain man looks for  the young lady dressed in black satin stands upright with her right hand bent back resting on her waist while the other with the arm somewhat extended offers to view a single white flower the dress stretched at the hips over a sort of hoop and ornamented in front where it opens on a velvet petticoat with large satin bows has an oldfashioned air as if it had been worn by some demure princess who might have sat for velasquez the hair of which the arrangement is odd and charming is disposed in two or three large curls fastened at one side over the temple with a comb behind the figure is the vague faded sheen exquisite in tone of a silk curtain light undefined and losing itself at the bottom the face is young candid and peculiar out of these few elements the artist has constructed a picture which it is impossible to forget of which the most striking characteristic is its simplicity and yet which overflows with perfection painted with extraordinary breadth and freedom so that surface and texture are interpreted by the lightest hand it glows with life character and distinction and strikes us as the most completewith one exception perhapsof the authors productions i know not why this representation of a young girl in black engaged in the casual gesture of holding up a flower should make so ineffaceable an impression and tempt one to become almost lyrical in its praise but i remember that encountering the picture unexpectedly in new york a year or two after it had been exhibited in paris it seemed to me to have acquired an extraordinary general value to stand for more artistic truth than it would be easy to formulate the language of painting the tongue in which exclusively mr sargent expresses himself is a medium into which a considerable part of the public for the simple an excellent reason that they dont understand it will doubtless always be reluctant and unable to follow him  two years before he exhibited the young lady in black in 1879 mr sargent had spent several months in spain and here even more than he had already been the great velasquez became the god of his idolatry no scenes are more delightful to the imagination than those in which we figure youth and genius confronted with great examples and if such matters did not belong to the domain of private life we might entertain ourselves with reconstructing the episode of the first visit to the museum of madrid the shrine of the painter of philip iv of a young francoamerican worshipper of the highest artistic sensibility expecting a supreme revelation and prepared to fall on his knees it is evident that mr sargent fell on his knees and that in this attitude he passed a considerable part of his sojourn in spain he is various and experimental if i am not mistaken he sees each work that he produces in a light of its own not turning off successive portraits according to some welltried receipt which has proved useful in the case of their predecessors nevertheless there is one idea that pervades them all in a different degree and gives them a family resemblancethe idea that it would be inspiring to know just how velasquez would have treated the theme we can fancy that on each occasion mr sargent as a solemn preliminary invokes him as a patron saint this is not in my intention tantamount to saying that the large canvas representing the contortions of a dancer in the lamplit room of a posada which he exhibited on his return from spain strikes me as having come into the world under the same star as those compositions of the great spaniard which at madrid alternate with his royal portraits this singular work which has found an appreciative home in boston has the stamp of an extraordinary energy and facilityof an actual scene with its accidents and peculiarities caught as distinguished from a composition where arrangement and invention have played their part it looks like life but it looks also to my view rather like a perversion of life and has the quality of an enormous note or memorandum rather than of a representation a woman in a voluminous white silk dress and a black mantilla pirouettes in the middle of a dusky room to the accompaniment of her own castanets and that of a row of men and women who sit in straw chairs against the whitewashed wall and thrum upon guitar and tambourine or lift other castanets into the air she appears almost colossal and the twisted and inflated folds of her long dress increase her volume she simpers in profile with a long chin while she slants back at a dangerous angle and the lamplight it proceeds from below as if she were on a big platform makes a strange play in her large face in the background the straight line of blackclad blackhatted whiteshirted musicians projects shadows against the wall on which placards guitars and dirty fingermarks display themselves the merit of this production is that the air of reality is given in it with remarkable breadth and boldness its defect it is difficult to express save by saying that it makes the spectator vaguely uneasy and even unhappyan accident the more to be regretted as a lithe inspired female figure given up to the emotion of the dance is not intrinsically a displeasing object el jaleo sins in my opinion in the direction of ugliness and independently of the fact that the heroine is circling round incommoded by her petticoats has a want of serenity  this is not the defect of the charming dusky whiterobed person who in the tangerine subject exhibited at the salon of 1880 the fruit of an excursion to the african coast at the time of the artists visit to spain stands on a rug under a great white moorish arch and from out of the shadows of the large drapery raised pentwise by her hands which covers her head looks down with painted eyes and brows showing above a bandaged mouth at the fumes of a beautiful censer or chafingdish placed on the carpet i know not who this stately mahometan may be nor in what mysterious domestic or religious rite she may be engaged but in her muffled contemplation and her pearlcolored robes under her plastered arcade which shines in the eastern light she transports and torments us the picture is exquisite a radiant effect of white upon white of similar but discriminated tones in dividing the honor that mr sargent has won by his finest work between the portrait of the young lady of 1881 and the group of four little girls which was painted in 1882 and exhibited with the success it deserved the following year i must be careful to give the latter picture not too small a share the artist has done nothing more felicitous and interesting than this view of a rich dim rather generalized french interior the perspective of a hall with a shining floor where screens and tall japanese vases shimmer and loom which encloses the life and seems to form the happy playworld of a family of charming children the treatment is eminently unconventional and there is none of the usual symmetrical balancing of the figures in the foreground the place is regarded as a whole it is a scene a comprehensive impression yet none the less do the little figures in their white pinafores when was the pinafore ever painted with that power and made so poetic detach themselves and live with a personal life two of the sisters stand hand in hand at the back in the delightful the almost equal company of a pair of immensely tall emblazoned jars which overtop them and seem also to partake of the life of the picture the splendid porcelain and the aprons of the children shine together while a mirror in the brown depth behind them catches the light another little girl presents herself with abundant tresses and slim legs her hands behind her quite to the left and the youngest nearest to the spectator sits on the floor and plays with her doll the naturalness of the composition the loveliness of the complete effect the light free security of the execution the sense it gives us as of assimilated secrets and of instinct and knowledge playing togetherall this makes the picture as astonishing a work on the part of a young man of twentysix as the portrait of 1881 was astonishing on the part of a young man of twentyfour  it is these remarkable encounters that justify us in writing almost prematurely of a career which is not yet half unfolded mr sargent is sometimes accused of a want of finish but if finish means the last word of expressiveness of touch the hall with the four children as we may call it maystand as a permanent reference on this point if the picture of the spanish dancer illustrates as it seems to me to do the latent dangers of the impressionist practice so this finer performance shows what victories it may achieve and in relation to the latter i must repeat what i said about the young lady with the flower that this is the sort of work which when produced in youth leads the attentive spectator to ask unanswerable questions he finds himself murmuring yes but what is left and even wondering whether it be an advantage to an artist to obtain early in life such possession of his means that the struggle with them discipline tâtonnement cease to exist for him may not this breed an irresponsibility of cleverness a wantonness an irreverencewhat is vulgarly termed a larkinesson the part of the youthful genius who has as it were all his fortune in his pocket such are the possibly superfluous broodings of those who are critical even in their warmest admirations and who sometimes suspect that it may be better for an artist to have a certain part of his property invested in unsolved difficulties when this is not the case the question with regard to his future simplifies itself somewhat portentously what will he do with it we ask meaning by the pronoun the sharp completely forged weapon it becomes more purely a question of responsibility and we hold him altogether to a higher account this is the case with mr sargent he knows so much about the art of painting that he perhaps does not fear emergencies quite enough and that having knowledge to spare he may be tempted to play with it and waste it various curious as we have called him he occasionally tries experiments which seem to arise from the mere high spirits of his brush and runs risks little courted by the votaries of the literal who never expose their necks to escape from the common for the literal and the common he has the smallest taste when he renders an object into the language of painting his translation is a generous paraphrase  as i have intimated he has painted little but portraits but he has painted very many of these and i shall not attempt in so few pages to give a catalogue of his works every canvas that has come from his hands has not figured at the salon some of them have seen the light at other exhibitions in paris some of them in london of which city mr sargent is now an inhabitant at the royal academy and the grosvenor gallery if he has been mainly represented by portraits there are two or three little subjectpictures of which i retain a grateful memory there stands out in particular as a pure gem a small picture exhibited at the grosvenor representing a small group of venetian girls of the lower class sitting in gossip together one summers day in the big dim hall of a shabby old palazzo the shutters let in a clink of light the scagliola pavement gleams faintly in it the whole place is bathed in a kind of transparent shade the girls are vaguely engaged in some very humble household work they are counting turnips or stringing onions and these small vegetables enchantingly painted look as valuable as magnified pearls the figures are extraordinarily natural and vivid wonderfully light and fine is the touch by which the painter evokes the small familiar venetian realities he has handled them with a vigor altogether peculiar in various other studies which i have not space to enumerate and keeps the whole thing free from that element of humbug which has ever attended most attempts to reproduce the idiosyncrasies of italy i am however drawing to the end of my remarks without having mentioned a dozen of those brilliant triumphs in the field of portraiture with which mr sargents name is preponderantly associated i jumped from his carolus duran to the masterpiece of 1881 without speaking of the charming madame pailleron of 1879 or the picture of this ladys children the following year many or rather most of mr sargents sitters have been french and he has studied the physiognomy of this nation so attentively that a little of it perhaps remains in the brush with which today more than in his first years he represents other types i have alluded to his superb docteur pozzi to whose very handsome still youthful head and slightly artificial posture he has given so fine a french cast that he might be excused if he should even on remoter pretexts find himself reverting to it this gentleman stands up in his brilliant red dressinggown with the prestance of a princely vandyck i should like to commemorate the portrait of a lady of a certain age and of an equally certain interest of appearancea lady in black with black hair a black hat and a vast feather which was displayed at that entertaining little annual exhibition of the mirlitons in the place vendôme with the exquisite modelling of its face no one better than mr sargent understands the beauty that resides in exceeding fineness this head remains in my mind as a masterly rendering of the look of experiencesuch experience as may be attributed to a woman slightly faded and eminently distinguished subject and treatment in this valuable piece are of an equal interest and in the latter there is an element of positive sympathy which is not always in a high degree the sign of mr sargents work what shall i say of the remarkable canvas which on the occasion of the salon of 1884 brought the critics about our artists ears the already celebrated portrait of madame g it is an experiment of a highly original kind and the painter has had in the case in regard to what mr ruskin would call the rightness of his attempt the courage of his opinion a contestable beauty according to parisian fame the lady stands upright beside a table on which her right arm rests with her body almost fronting the spectator and her face in complete profile she wears an entirely sleeveless dress of black satin against which her admirable left arm detaches itself the line of her harmonious profile has a sharpness which mr sargent does not always seek and the crescent of diana an ornament in diamonds rests on her singular head this work had not the goodfortune to please the public at large and i believe it even excited a kind of unreasoned scandalan idea sufficiently amusing in the light of some of the manifestations of the plastic effort to which each year the salon stands sponsor this superb picture noble in conception and masterly in line gives to the figure represented something of the high relief of the profiled images on great friezes it is a work to take or to leave as the phrase is and one in regard to which the question of liking or disliking comes promptly to be settled the author has never gone further in being boldly and consistently himself  two of mr sargents recent productions have been portraits of american ladies whom it must have been a delight to paint i allude to those of lady playfair and mrs henry white both of which were seen in the royal academy of 1885 and the former subsequently in boston where it abides these things possess largely the quality which makes mr sargent so happy as a painter of womena quality which can best be expressed by a reference to what it is not to the curiously literal prosaic sexless treatment to which in the commonplace work that looks down at us from the walls of almost all exhibitions delicate feminine elements have evidently so often been sacrificed mr sargent handles these elements with a special feeling for them and they borrow a kind of noble intensity from his brush this intensity is not absent from the two portraits i just mentioned that of lady playfair and that of mrs henry white it looks out at us from the erect head and frank animation of the one and the silvery sheen and shimmer of white satin and white lace which form the setting of the slim tallness of the other in the royal academy of 1886 mr sargent was represented by three important canvases all of which reminded the spectator of how much the brilliant effect he produces in an english exhibition arises from a certain appearance that he has of looking down from a height a height of cleverness a sensible giddiness of facility at the artistic problems of the given case sometimes there is even a slight impertinence in it that doubtless was the impression of many of the people who passed staring with an ejaculation before the triumphant group of the three misses v these young ladies seated in a row with a room much foreshortened for a background and treated with a certain familiarity of frankness excited in london a chorus of murmurs not dissimilar to that which it had been the fortune of the portrait exhibited in 1884 to elicit in paris and had the further privilege of drawing forth some prodigies of purblind criticism works of this character are a genuine service after the shortlived gibes of the profane have subsided they are found to have cleared the air they remind people that the faculty of taking a direct independent unborrowed impression is not altogether lost  in this very rapid review i have accompanied mr sargent to a very recent date if i have said that observers encumbered with a nervous temperament may at any moment have been anxious about his future i have it on my conscience to add that the day has not yet come for a complete extinction of this anxiety mr sargent is so young in spite of the place allotted to him in these pages so often a record of long careers and uncontested triumphs that in spite also of the admirable works he has already produced his future is the most valuable thing he has to show we may still ask ourselves what he will do with it while we indulge the hope that he will see fit to give successors to the two pictures which i have spoken of emphatically as his finest there is no greater work of art than a great portraita truth to be constantly taken to heart by a painter holding in his hands the weapon that mr sargent wields the gift that he possesses he possesses completelythe immediate perception of the end and of the means putting aside the question of the subject and to a great portrait a common sitter will doubtless not always contribute the highest result is achieved when to this element of quick perception a certain faculty of brooding reflection is added i use this name for want of a better and i mean the quality in the light of which the artist sees deep into his subject undergoes it absorbs it discovers in it new things that were not on the surface becomes patient with it and almost reverent and in short enlarges and humanizes the technical problem     honorÉ daumier  as we attempt at the present day to write the history of everything it would be strange if we had happened to neglect the annals of caricature for the very essence of the art of cruikshank and gavarni of daumier and leech is to be historical and every one knows how addicted is this great science to discoursing about itself many industrious seekers in england and france have ascended the stream of time to the source of the modern movement of pictorial satire the stream of time is in this case mainly the stream of journalism for social and political caricature as the present century has practised it is only journalism made doubly vivid  the subject indeed is a large one if we reflect upon it for many people would tell us that journalism is the greatest invention of our age if this rich affluent has shared the great fortune of the general torrent so on other sides it touches the fine arts touches manners touches morals all this helps to account for its inexhaustible life journalism is the criticism of the moment at the moment and caricature is that criticism at once simplified and intensified by a plastic form we know the satiric image as periodical and above all as punctualthe characteristics of the printed sheet with which custom has at last inveterately associated it  this bytheway makes us wonder considerably at the failure of caricature to achieve as yet a high destiny in americaa failure which might supply an occasion for much explanatory discourse much searching of the relations of things the newspaper has been taught to flourish among us as it flourishes nowhere else and to flourish moreover on a humorous and irreverent basis yet it has never taken to itself this helpful concomitant of an unscrupulous spirit and a quick periodicity the explanation is probably that it needs an old society to produce ripe caricature the newspaper thrives in the united states but journalism languishes for the lively propagation of news is one thing and the large interpretation of it is another a society has to be old before it becomes critical and it has to become critical before it can take pleasure in the reproduction of its incongruities by an instrument as impertinent as the indefatigable crayon irony scepticism pessimism are in any particular soil plants of gradual growth and it is in the art of caricature that they flower most aggressively furthermore they must be watered by educationi mean by the education of the eye and handall of which things take time the soil must be rich too the incongruities must swarm it is open to doubt whether a pure democracy is very liable to make this particular satiric return upon itself for which it would seem tha certain social complications are indispensable these complications are supplied from the moment a democracy becomes as we may say impure from its own point of view from the moment variations and heresies deviations or perhaps simple affirmations of taste and temper begin to multiply within it such things afford a point dappui for it is evidently of the essence of caricature to be reactionary we hasten to add that its satiric force varies immensely in kind and in degree according to the race or to the individual talent that takes advantage of it  i used just now the term pessimism but that was doubtless in a great measure because i have been turning over a collection of the extraordinarily vivid drawings of honoré daumier the same impression would remain with me no doubt if i had been consulting an equal quantity of the work of gavarni the wittiest the most literary and most acutely profane of all chartered mockers with the pencil the feeling of disrespect abides in all these things the expression of the spirit for which humanity is definable primarily by its weaknesses for daumier these weaknesses are altogether ugly and grotesque while for gavarni they are either basely graceful or touchingly miserable but the vision of them in both cases is close and direct if on the other hand we look through a dozen volumes of the collection of punch we get an equal impression of hilarity but we by no means get an equal impression of irony certainly the pages of punch do not reek with pessimism their criticism of life is gentle and forbearing leech is positively optimistic there is at any rate nothing infinite in his irreverence it touches bottom as soon as it approaches the pretty woman or the nice girl it is such an apparition as this that really in gavarni awakes the scoffer du maurier is as graceful as gavarni but his sense of beauty conjures away almost everything save our minor vices it is in the exploration of our major ones that gavarni makes his principal discoveries of charm or of absurdity of attitude none the less of course the general inspiration of both artists is the same the desire to try the innumerable different ways in which the human subject may not be taken seriously  if this view of that subject in its plastic manifestations makes history of a sort it will not in general be of a kind to convert those persons who find history sad reading the writer of the present lines remained unconverted lately on an occasion on which many cheerful influences were mingled with his impression they were of a nature to which he usually does full justice even overestimating perhaps their charm of suggestion but at the hour i speak of the old parisian quay the belittered printshop the pleasant afternoon the glimpse of the great louvre on the other side of the seine in the interstices of the sallow estampes suspended in window and doorwayall these elements of a rich actuality availed only to mitigate without transmuting that general vision of a high cruel pillory which pieced itself together as i drew specimen after specimen from musty portfolios i had been passing the shop when i noticed in a small vitrine let into the embrasure of the doorway half a dozen soiled striking lithographs which it took no more than a first glance to recognize as the work of daumier they were only old pages of the charivari torn away from the text and rescued from the injury of time and they were accompanied with an inscription to the effect that many similar examples of the artist were to be seen within to become aware of this circumstance was to enter the shop and to find myself promptly surrounded with bulging cartons and tattered relics these relicscrumpled leaves of the old comic journals of the period from 1830 to 1855are neither rare nor expensive but i happened to have lighted on a particularly copious collection and i made the most of my small goodfortune in order to transmute it if possible into a sort of compensation for my having missed unavoidably a few months before the curious exhibition de la caricature moderne held for several weeks just at hand in the École des beauxarts  daumier was said to have appeared there in considerable force and it was a loss not to have had that particular opportunity of filling ones mind with him  there was perhaps a perversity in having wished to do so strange indigestible stuff of contemplation as he might appear to be but the perversity had had an honorable growth daumiers great days were in the reign of louisphilippe but in the early years of the second empire he still plied his coarse and formidable pencil i recalled from a juvenile consciousness the last failing strokes of it they used to impress me in paris as a child with their abnormal blackness as well as with their grotesque magnifying movement and there was something in them that rather scared a very immature admirer this small personage however was able to perceive later when he was unfortunately deprived of the chance of studying them that there were various things in them besides the power to excite a vague alarm daumier was perhaps a great artist at all events unsatisfied curiosity increased in proportion to that possibility  the first complete satisfaction of it was really in the long hours that i spent in the little shop on the quay there i filled my mind with him and there too at no great cost i could make a big parcel of these cheap reproductions of his work this work had been shown in the ecole des beauxarts as it came from his hand m champfleury his biographer his cataloguer and devotee having poured forth the treasures of a precious collection as i suppose they would be called in the case of an artist of higher flights it was only as he was seen by the readers of the comic journals of his day that i could now see him but i tried to make up for my want of privilege by prolonged immersion i was not able to take home all the portfolios from the shop on the quay but i took home what i could and i went again to turn over the superannuated piles i liked looking at them on the spot i seemed still surrounded by the artists vanished paris and his extinct parisians indeed no quarter of the delightful city probably shows on the whole fewer changes from the aspect it wore during the period of louisphilippe the time when it will ever appear to many of its friends to have been most delightful the long line of the quay is unaltered and the rare charm of the river people came and went in the shop it is a wonder how many in the course of an hour may lift the latch even of an establishment that pretends to no great business what was all this small sociable contentious life but the great daumiers subjectmatter he was the painter of the parisian bourgeois and the voice of the bourgeois was in the air  m champfleury has given a summary of daumiers career in his smart little histoire e la caricature moderne a record not at all abundant in personal detail the biographer has told his story better perhaps in his careful catalogue of the artists productions the first sketch of which is to be found in lart for 1878 this copious list is daumiers real history his life cannot have been a very different business from his work i read in the interesting publication of m grandcarteret les moeurs et la caricature en france 1888 that our artist produced nearly 4000 lithographs and a thousand drawings on wood up to the time when failure of eyesight compelled him to rest this is not the sort of activity that leaves a man much time for independent adventures and daumier was essentially of the type common in france of the specialist so immersed in his specialty that he can be painted in only one attitudea general circumstance which perhaps helps to account for the paucity in that country of biography in our english sense of the word in proportion to the superabundance of criticism  honoré daumier was born at marseilles february 26th 1808 he died on the 11th of the same month 1879 his main activity however was confined to the earlier portion of a career of almost exactly seventyone years and i find it affirmed in vapereaus dictionnaire des contemporains that he became completely blind between 1850 and 1860 he enjoyed a pension from the state of 2400 francs but what relief from misery could mitigate a quarter of a century of darkness for a man who had looked out at the world with such vivifying eyes his father had followed the trade of a glazier but was otherwise vocal than in the emission of the rich streetcry with which we used all to be familiar and which has vanished with so many other friendly pedestrian notes the elder daumier wrought verses as well as windowpanes and m champfleury has disinterred a small volume published by him in 1823 the merit of his poetry is not striking but he was able to transmit the artistic nature to his son who becoming promptly conscious of it made the inevitable journey to paris in search of fortune  the young draughtsman appeared to have missed at first the way to this boon inasmuch as in the year 1832 he found himself condemned to six months imprisonment for a lithograph disrespectful to louisphilippe this drawing had appeared in the caricature an organ of pictorial satire founded in those days by one philipon with the aid of a band of young mockers to whom he gave ideas and a direction and several others of whom gavarni henry monnier decamps grandville were destined to make themselves a place m eugène montrosier in a highly appreciative article on daumier in lart for 1878 says that this same philipon was le journalisme fait homme which did not prevent himrather in fact fostered such a resultfrom being perpetually in delicate relations with the government he had had many horses killed under him and had led a life of attacks penalties suppressions and resurrections he subsequently established the charivari and launched a publication entitled lassociation lithographique mensuelle which brought to light much of daumiers early work the artist passed rapidly from seeking his way to finding it and from an ineffectual to a vigorous form  in this limited compass and in the case of such a quantity of production it is almost impossible to specifydifficult to pick dozens of examples out of thousands daumier became more and more the political spirit of the charivari or at least the political pencil for m philipon the breath of whose nostrils was oppositionone perceives from here the little bilious bristling ingenious insistent manis to be credited with a suggestive share in any enterprise in which he had a hand this pencil played over public life over the sovereign the ministers the deputies the peers the judiciary the men and the measures the reputations and scandals of the moment with a strange ugly extravagant but none the less sane and manly vigor daumiers sign is strength above all and in turning over his pages today there is no intensity of force that the careful observer will not concede to him it is perhaps another matter to assent to the proposition put forth by his greatest admirers among his countrymen that he is the first of all caricaturists to the writer of this imperfect sketch he remains considerably less interesting than gavarni andor a particular reason which it is difficult to express otherwise than by saying that he is too simple simplicity was not gavarnis fault and indeed to a large degree it was daumiers merit the single grossly ridiculous or almost hauntingly characteristic thing which his figures represent is largely the reason why they still represent life and an unlucky reality years after the names attached to them have parted with a vivifying power such vagueness has overtaken them for the most part and to such a thin reverberation have they shrunk the persons and the affairs which were then so intensely sketchable daumier handled them with a want of ceremony which would have been brutal were it not for the element of science in his work making them immense and unmistakable in their drollery or at least in their grotesqueness for the term drollery suggests gayety and daumier is anything but gay un rude peintre de moeurs m champfleury calls him and the phrase expresses his extreme breadth of treatment  of the victims of his rudeness m thiers is almost the only one whom the present generation may recognize without a good deal of reminding and indeed his hand is relatively light in delineating this personage of few inches and many episodes m thiers must have been dear to the caricaturist for he belonged to the type that was easy to do it being well known that these gentlemen appreciate public characters in direct proportion to their saliency of feature when faces are reducible to a few telling strokes their wearers are overwhelmed with the honors of publicity with which on the other hand nothing is more likely to interfere than the possession of a countenance neatly classical daumier had only to give m thiers the face of a clever owl and the trick was played of course skill was needed to individualize the symbol but that is what caricaturists propose to themselves of how well he succeeded the admirable plate of the lively little minister in a new dresstricked out in the uniform of a general of the first republicis a sufficient illustration the bird of night is not an acute bird but how the artist has presented the image of a selected specimen and with what a lifegiving pencil the whole figure is put on its feet what intelligent drawing what a rich free stroke the allusions conveyed in it are to such forgotten things that it is strange to think the personage was only the other year still contemporaneous that he might have been met on a fine day taking a few firm steps in a quiet part of the champs Élysées with his footman carrying a second overcoat and looking doubly tall behind him in whatever attitude daumier depicts him planted as a tiny boxingmaster at the feet of the virtuous colossus in a blouse whose legs are apart like thoseof the rhodian in whom the artist represents the people to watch the match that is about to come off between ratapoil and m berryer or even in the act of lifting the parricidal club of a new repressive law to deal a blow at the press an effulgent diligent sedentary muse this picture by the way is a perfect specimen of the simple and telling in political caricaturehowever as i say he takes m thiers there is always a rough indulgence in his crayon as if he were grateful to him for lending himself so well he invented ratapoil as he appropriated robert macaire and as a caricaturist he never fails to put into circulation when he can a character to whom he may attribute as many as possible of the affectations or the vices of the day robert macaire an imaginative a romantic rascal was the hero of a highly successful melodrama written for frederick lemaitre but daumier made him the type of the swindler at large in an age of feverish speculationthe projector of showy companies the advertiser of worthless shares there is a whole series of drawings descriptive of his exploits a hundred masterly plates which according to m champfleury consecrated daumiers reputation the subject the legend was in most cases still according to m champfleury suggested by philipon sometimes it was very witty as for instance when bertrand the muddled acolyte or scraping second fiddle of the hero objects in relation to a brilliant scheme which he has just developed with the part bertrand is to play that there are constables in the country and he promptly replies constables so much the bettertheyll take the shares ratapoil was an evocation of the same general character but with a difference of nuancethe ragged political bully or handtomouth demagogue with the smashed tall hat cocked to one side the absence of linen the club halfway up his sleeve the swagger and pose of being gallant for the people ratapoil abounds in the promiscuous drawings that i have looked over and is always very strong and living with a considerable element of the sinister so often in daumier an accompaniment of the comic there is an admirable pageit brings the idea down to 1851in which a sordid but astute peasant twirling his thumbs on his stomach and looking askance allows this political adviser to urge upon him in a whisper that there is not a minute to loseto lose for action of courseif he wishes to keep his wife his house his field his heifer and his calf the canny scepticism in the ugly halfaverted face of the typical rustic who considerably suspects his counsellor is indicated by a few masterly strokes  this is what the student of daumier recognizes as his science or if the word has a better grace his art it is what has kept life in his work so long after so many of the occasions of it have been swept into darkness indeed there is no such commentary on renown as the back numbers of a comic journal they show us that at certain moments certain people were eminent only to make us unsuccessfully try to remember what they were eminent for and the comparative obscurity comparative i mean to the talent of the caricaturist overtakes even the most justly honored names m berryer was a splendid speaker and a public servant of real distinction and the highest utility yet the fact that today his name is on few mens lips seems to be emphasized by this other fact that we continue to pore over daumier in whose plates we happen to come across him it reminds one afresh how art is an embalmer a magician whom we can never speak too fair people duly impressed with this truth are sometimes laughed at for their superstitious tone which is pronounced according to the fancy of the critic mawkish maudlin or hysterical but it is really difficult to see how any reiteration of the importance of art can overstate the plain facts it prolongs it preserves it consecrates it raises from the dead it conciliates charms bribes posterity and it murmurs to mortals as the old french poet sang to his mistress you will be fair only so far as i have said so when it whispers even to the great you depend upon me and i can do more for you in the longrun than any one else it is scarcely too proud it puts method and power and the strange real mingled air of things into daumiers black sketchiness so full of the technical gras the fat which french critics commend and which we have no word to express it puts power above all and the effect which he best achieves that of a certain simplification of the attitude or the gesture to an almost symbolic generality his persons represent only one thing but they insist tremendously on that and their expression of it abides with us unaccompanied with timid detail it may really be said that they represent only one classthe old and ugly so that there is proof enough of a special faculty in his having played such a concert lugubrious though it be on a single chord it has been made a reproach to him says m grandcarteret that his work is lacking in two capital elementsla jeunesse et la femme and the commentator resents his being made to suffer for the deficiencyas if an artist could be at the same time deep comic graceful and pretty as if all those who have a real value had not created for themselves a form to which they remain confined and a type which they reproduce in all its variations as soon as they have touched the æsthetic ideal that has been their dream assuredly humanity as this great painter saw it could not be beautiful one asks ones self what maiden in her teens a pretty face would have done in the midst of these good plain folk stunted and elderly with faces like wrinkled apples a simple accessory most of the time woman is for him merely a termagant or a bluestocking who has turned the corner  when the eternal feminine for daumier appears in neither of these forms he sees it in madame chaboulard or madame fribochon the old snufftaking gossiping portress in a nightcap and shuffling savates relating or drinking in the wonderful and the intimate one of his masterpieces represents three of these dames lighted by a guttering candle holding their heads together to discuss the fearful earthquake at bordeaux the consequence of the governments allowing the surface of the globe to be unduly dug out in california the representation of confidential imbecility could not go further when a man leaves out so much of life as daumieryouth and beauty and the charm of woman and the loveliness of childhood and the manners of those social groups of whom it may most be said that they have mannerswhen he exhibits a deficiency on this scale it might seem that the question was not to be so easily disposed of as in the very nonapologetic words i have just quoted all the same and i confess it is singular we may feel what daumier omitted and yet not be in the least shocked by the claim of predominance made for him it is impossible to spend a couple of hours over him without assenting to this claim even though there may be a weariness in such a panorama of ugliness and an inevitable reaction from it this anomaly and the challenge to explain it which appears to proceed from him render him to my sense remarkably interesting the artist whose idiosyncrasies whose limitations if you will make us question and wonder in the light of his fame has an element of fascination not attaching to conciliatory talents if m eugene montrosier may say of him without scandalizing us that such and such of his drawings belong to the very highest art it is interesting and daumier profits by the interest to put ones finger on the reason we are not scandalized  i think this reason is that on the whole he is so peculiarly serious this may seem an odd ground of praise for a jocose draughtsman and of course what i mean is that his comic force is seriousa very different thin from the absence of comedy this essential sign of the caricaturist may surely be anything it will so long as it is there daumiers figures are almost always either foolish fatuous politicians or frightened mystified bourgeois yet they help him to give us a strong sense of the nature of man they are some times so serious that they are almost tragic the look of the particular pretension combined with inanity is carried almost to madness there is a magnificent drawing of the series of le public du salon old classicists looking up horrified and scandalized at the new romantic work of 1830 in which the faces have an appalling gloom of mystification and platitude we feel that daumier reproduces admirably the particular life that he sees because it is the very medium in which he moves he has no wide horizon the absolute bourgeois hems him in and he is a bourgeois himself without poetic ironies to whom a big cracked mirror has been given his thick strong manly touch stands in every way for so much knowledge he used to make little images in clay and in wax many of them still exist of the persons he was in the habit of representing so that they might constantly seem to be sitting for him the caricaturist of that day had not the help of the ubiquitous photograph daumier painted actively as well in his habitation all dedicated to work on the narrow island of st louis where the seine divides and where the monuments of old paris stand thick and the types that were to his purpose pressed close upon him he had not far to go to encounter the worthy man in the series of les papas who is reading the evening paper at the café with so amiable and placid a credulity while his unnatural little boy opposite to him finds sufficient entertainment in the muchsatirized constitutionnel the bland absorption of the papa the face of the man who believes everything he sees in the newspaper is as near as daumier often comes to positive gentleness of humor of the same family is the poor gentleman in actualités seen in profile under a doorway where he has taken refuge from a torrent of rain who looks down at his neat legs with a sort of speculative contrition and says to think of my having just ordered two pairs of white trousers the tout petit bourgeois palpitates in both these sketches  i must repeat that it is absurd to pick half a dozen at hazard out of five thousand yet a few selections are the only way to call attention to his strong drawing this has a virtuosity of its own for all its hitormiss appearance whatever he touchesthe nude in the swimmingbaths on the seine the intimations of landscape when his petits rentiers go into the suburbs for a sundayacquires relief and character docteur véron a celebrity of the reign of louisphilippe a mæcenas of the hour a director of the opera author of the mémoires dun bourgeois de paristhis temporary illustration who appears to have been almost indecently ugly would not be vivid to us today had not daumier who was often effective at his expense happened to have represented him in some crisis of his career as a sort of naked inconsolable vitellius he renders the human body with a cynical sense of its possible flabbiness and an intimate acquaintance with its structure une promenade conjugale in the series of tout ce quon voudra portrays a hillside on a summer afternoon on which a man has thrown himself on his back to rest with his arms locked under his head his fat fullbosomed middleaged wife under her parasol with a bunch of fieldflowers in her hand looks down at him patiently and seems to say come my dear get up there is surely no great point in this the only point is life the glimpse of the little snatch of poetry in prose it is a matter of a few broad strokes of the crayon yet the pleasant laziness of the man the idleness of the day the fragment of homely familiar dialogue the stretch of the field with a couple of trees merely suggested have a communicative truth  i perhaps exaggerate all this and in insisting upon the merit of daumier may appear to make light of the finer accomplishment of several more modern talents in england and france who have greater ingenuity and subtlety and have carried qualities of execution so much further in looking at this complicated younger work which has profited so by experience and comparison it is inevitable that we should perceive it to be infinitely more cunning on the other hand daumier moving in his contracted circle has an impressive depth it comes back to his strange seriousness he is a draughtsman by race and if he has not extracted the same brilliancy from training or perhaps even from effort and experiment as some of his successors does not his richer satiric and sympathetic feeling more than make up the difference  however this question may be answered some of his drawings belong to the class of the unforgetable it may be a perversity of prejudice but even the little cut of the connoisseurs the group of gentlemen collected round a picture and criticising it in various attitudes of sapience and sufficiency appears to me to have the strength that abides the criminal in the dock the flatheaded murderer bending over to speak to his advocate who turns a whiskered professional anxious head to caution and remind him tells a large terrible story and awakes a recurrent shudder we see the gray courtroom we feel the personal suspense and the immensity of justice the saltimbanques reproduced in lart for 1878 is a page of tragedy the finest of a cruel series m eugène montrosier says of it that the drawing is masterly incomparably firm the composition superb the general impression quite of the first order it exhibits a pair of lean hungry mountebanks a clown and a harlequin beating the drum and trying a comic attitude to attract the crowd at a fair to a poor booth in front of which a painted canvas offering to view a simpering fat woman is suspended but the crowd doesnt come and the battered tumblers with their furrowed cheeks go through their pranks in the void the whole thing is symbolic and full of grimness imagination and pity it is the sense that we shall find in him mixed with his homelier extravagances an element prolific in indications of this order that draws us back to daumier     after the play  the play was not over when the curtain fell four months ago it was continued in a supplementary act or epilogue which took place immediately afterwards come home to tea florentia said to certain friends who had stopped to speak to her in the lobby of the little theatre in sohothey had been present at a day performance by the company of the theatre libre transferred for a week from paris and three of theseauberon and dorriforth accompanying amiciaturned up so expeditiously that the change of scene had the effect of being neatly executed the short afterpieceit was in truth very slightbegan with amicias entrance and her declaration that she would never again go to an afternoon performance it was such a horrid relapse into the real to find it staring at you through the ugly daylight on coming out of the blessed fictive world  dorriforth ah you touch there on one of the minor sorrows of life thats an illustration of the general change that comes to pass in us as we grow older if we have ever loved the stage the fading of the glamour and the mystery that surround it  auberon do you call it a minor sorrow its one of the greatest and nothing can mitigate it  amicia wouldnt it be mitigated a little if the stage were a trifle better you must remember how that has changed  auberon never never its the same old stage the change is in ourselves  florentia well i never would have given an evening to what we have just seen if one could have put it in between luncheon and tea well enough but ones evenings are too precious  dorriforth note thatits very important  florentia i mean too precious for that sort of thing  auberon then you didnt sit spellbound by the little history of the due denghien  florentia i sat yawning heavens what a piece  amicia upon my word i liked it the last act made me cry  dorriforth wasnt it a curious interesting specimen of some of the things that are worth trying an attempt to sail closer to the real  auberon how much closer the fiftieth part of a pointit isnt calculable  florentia it was just like any other playi saw no difference it had neither a plot nor a subject nor dialogue nor situations nor scenery nor costumes nor acting  amicia then it was hardly as you say just like any other play  auberon florentia should have said like any other badone the only way it differed seemed to be that it was bad in theory as well as in fact  amicia its a morceau de vie as the french say  auberon oh dont begin on the french  amicia its a french experimentque voulezvous  auberon english experiments will do  dorriforth no doubt they wouldif there were any but i dont see them  amicia fortunately think what some of them might be though florentia saw nothing i saw many things in this poor little shabby due denghien coming over to our roaring london where the dots have to be so big on the is with its barely audible note of originality it appealed to me touched me offered me a poignant suggestion of the way things happen in life  auberon in life they happen clumsily stupidly meanly one goes to the theatre just for the refreshment of seeing them happen in another wayin symmetrical satisfactory form with unmistakable effect and just at the right moment  dorriforth it shows how the same cause may produce the most diverse consequences in this truth lies the only hope of art  auberon oh art artdont talk about art  amicia mercy we must talk about something  dorriforth auberon hates generalizations nevertheless i make bold to say that we go to the theatre in the same spirit in which we read a novel some of us to find one thing and some to find another and according as we look for the particular thing we find it  auberon thats a profound remark  florentia we go to find amusement that surely is what we all go for  amicia theres such a diversity in our idea of amusement  auberon dont you impute to people more ideas than they have  dorriforth ah one must do that or one couldnt talk about them we go to be interested to be absorbed beguiled and to lose ourselves to give ourselves up in short to a charm  florentia and the charm is the strange the extraordinary  amicia ah speak for yourself the charm is the recognition of what we know what we feel  dorriforth see already how you differ  so  what we surrender ourselves to is the touch of nature the sense of life  amicia the first thing is to believe  florentia the first thing on the contrary is to disbelieve  auberon lord listen to them  dorriforth the first thing is to folioto care  florentia i read a novel i go to the theatre to forget  amicia to forget what  florentia to forget life to thro myself into something more beautiful more exciting into fable and romance  dorriforth the attraction of fable and romance is that its about us about you and meor people whose power to suffer and to enjoy is the same as ours in other words we live their experience for the time and thats hardly escaping from life  florentia im not at all particular as to what you call it call it an escape from the common the prosaic the immediate  dorriforth you couldnt put it better thats the life that art with auberons permission gives us thats the distinction it confers this is why the greatest commonness is when our guide turns out a vulgar fellowthe angel as we had supposed him who has taken us by the hand then what becomes of our escape  florentia its precisely then that i complain of him he leads us into foul and dreary placesinto flat and foolish deserts  dorriforth he leads us into his own mind his own vision of things thats the only place into which the poet can lead us its there that he finds as you like it it is there that he finds comus or the way of the world or the christmas pantomime it is when he betrays us after he has got us in and locked the door when he cant keep from us that we are in a bare little hole and that there are no pictures on the walls it is then that the immediate and the foolish overwhelm us  amicia thats what i liked in the piece we have been looking at there was an artistic intention and the little room wasnt bare there was sociable company in it the actors were very humble aspirants they were common  auberon ah when the french give their mind to that  amicia nevertheless they struck me as recruits to an interesting cause which as yet the house was so empty could confer neither money nor glory they had the air poor things of working for love  auberon for love of what  amicia of the whole little enterprisethe idea of the théâtre libre  florentia gracious what you see in things dont you suppose they were paid  amicia i know nothing about it i liked their shabbinessthey had only what was indispensable in the way of dress and scenery that often pleases me the imagination in certain cases is more finely persuaded by the little than by the much  dorriforth i see what amicia means  florentia ill warrant you do and a great deal more besides  dorriforth when the appointments are meagre and sketchy the responsibility that rests upon the actors becomes a still more serious thing and the spectators observation of the way they rise to it a pleasure more intense the face and the voice are more to the purpose than acres of painted canvas and a touching intonation a vivid gesture or two than an army of supernumeraries  auberon why not have everythingthe face the voice the touching intonations the vivid gestures the acres of painted canvas and the army of supernumeraries why not use bravely and intelligently every resource of which the stage disposes what else was richard wagners great theory in producing his operas at bayreuth  dorriforth why not indeed that would be the ideal to have the picture complete at the same time the figures do their part in producing the particular illusion requiredwhat a perfection and what a joy i know no answer to that save the aggressive objectionable fact simply look at the stage of today and observe that these two branches of the matter never do happen to go together there is evidently a corrosive principle in the large command of machinery and decorationsa germ of perversion and corruption it gets the upperhandit becomes the master it is so much less easy to get good actors than good scenery and to represent a situation by the delicacy of personal art than by building it in and having everything real surely there is no reality worth a farthing on the stage but what the actor gives and only when he has learned his business up to the hilt need he concern himself with his material accessories he hasnt a decent respect for his art unless he be ready to render his part as if the whole illusion depended on that alone and the accessories didnt exist the acting is everything or its nothing it ceases to be everything as soon as something else becomes very important this is the case today on the london stage something else is very important the public have been taught to consider it so the clever machinery has ended by operating as a bribe and a blind their sense of the rest of the matter has gone to the dogs as you may perceive when you hear a couple of occupants of the stalls talking in a tone that excites your curiosity about a performance thats splendid  amicia do you ever hear the occupants of the stalls talking never in the entractes have i detected on their lips a criticism or a comment  dorriforth oh they say splendiddistinctly but a question or two reveals that their reference is vague they dont themselves know whether they mean the art of the actor or that of the stagecarpenter  auberon isnt that confusion a high result of taste isnt it whats called a feeling for the ensemble the artistic effect as a whole is so welded together that you cant pick out the parts  dorriforth precisely thats what it is in the best cases and some examples are wonderfully clever  florentia then what fault do you find dorriforth simply thisthat the whole is a pictorial whole not a dramatic one there is something indeed that you cant pick out for the very good reason thatin any serious sense of the wordit isnt there  florentia the public has taste then if it recognizes and delights in a fine picture  dorriforth i never said it hadnt so far as that goes the public likes to be amused and small blame to it it isnt very particular about the means but it has rather a preference for amusements that i believes to be improving other things being equal i dont think its either very intelligent or at all opinionated the dear old public it takes humbly enough what is given it and it doesnt cry for the moon it has an idea that fine scenery is an appeal to its nobler part and that it shows a nice critical sense in preferring it to poor thats a real intellectual flight for the public  auberon very well its preference is right and why isnt that a perfectly legitimate state of things  dorriforth why isnt it it distinctly is good scenery and poor acting are better than poor scenery with the same sauce only it becomes then another matter we are no longer talking about the drama  auberon very likely thats the future of the drama in londonan immense elaboration of the picture  dorriforth my dear fellow you take the words out of my mouth an immense elaboration of the picture and an immense sacrifice of everything else it would take very little more to persuade me that that will be the only formula for our children its all right when once we have buried our dead i have no doubt that the scenic part of the art remarkable as some of its achievements already appear to us is only in its infancy and that we are destined to see wonders done that we now but faintly conceive the probable extension of the mechanical arts is infinite built in forsooth we shall see castles and cities and mountains and rivers built in everything points that way especially the constitution of the contemporary multitude it is huge and goodnatured and common it likes big unmistakable knockdown effects it likes to get its money back in palpable computable change its in a tremendous hurry squeezed together with a sort of generalized gape and the last thing it expects of you is that you will spin things fine you cant portray a character alas or even vividly any sort of human figure unless in some degree you do that therefore the theatre inevitably accommodating itself will be at last a landscape without figures i mean of course without figures that count there will be little illustrations of costume stuck aboutdressed manikins but theyll have nothing to say they wont even go through the form of speech  amicia what a hideous prospect  dorriforth not necessarily for we shall have grown used to it we shall as i say have buried our dead today its cruel because our old ideals are only dying they are in extremis they are virtually defunct but they are abovegroundwe trip and stumble on them we shall eventually lay them tidily away this is a bad moment because its a moment of transition and we still miss the old superstition the bravery of execution the eloquence of the lips the interpretation of character we miss these things of course in proportion as the ostensible occasion for them is great we miss them particularly for instance when the curtain rises on shakespeare then we are conscious of a certain divine dissatisfaction of a yearning for that which isnt but we shall have got over this discomfort on the day when we have accepted the ostensible occasion as merely and frankly ostensible and the real one as having nothing to do with it  florentia i dont follow you as im one of the squeezed gaping public i must be dense and vulgar you do bytheway immense injustice to that body they do care for charactercare much for it arent they perpetually talking about the actors conception of it  dorriforth dear lady what better proof can there be of their ineptitude and that painted canvas and real water are the only things they understand the vanity of wasting time over that auberon over what dorriforth the actors conception of a part its the refuge of observers who are no observers and critics who are no critics with what on earth have we to do save his execution  florentia i dont in the least agree with you  amicia are you very sure my poor dorriforth  auberon give him rope and hell hang himself  dorriforth it doesnt need any great license to ask who in the world holds in his bosom the sacred secret of the right conception all the actor can do is to give us his we must take that one for granted we make him a present of it he must impose his conception upon us  auberon interrupting i thought you said we accepted it  dorriforth impose it upon our attention clever auberon it is because we accept his idea that he must repay us by making it vivid by showing us how valuable it is we give him a watch he must show us what time it keeps he winds it up that is he executes the conception and his execution is what we criticise if we be so moved can anything be more absurd than to hear people discussing the conception of a part of which the execution doesnt existthe idea of a character which never arrives at form think what it is that form as an accomplished actor may give it to us and admit that we have enough to do to hold him to this particular honor  auberon do you mean to say you dont think some conceptions are better than some others  dorriforth most assuredly some are better the proof of the pudding is in the eating the best are those which yield the most points which have the largest face those in other words that are the most demonstrable or in other words still the most actable the most intelligent performer is he who recognizes most surely this actable and distinguishes in it the more from the less but we are so far from being in possession of a subjective pattern to which we have a right to hold him that he is entitled directly to contradict any such absolute by presenting us with different versions of the same text each completely colored completely consistent with itself every actor in whom the artistic life is strong must often feel the challenge to do that i should never think for instance of contesting an actresss right to represent lady macbeth as a charming insinuating woman if she really sees the figure that way i may be surprised at such a vision but so far from being scandalized i am positively thankful for the extension of knowledge of pleasure that she is able to open to me  auberon a reading as they say either commends itself to ones sense of truth or it doesnt in the one case  dorriforth in the one case i recognizeevenor especiallywhen the presumption may have been against the particular attempt a consummate illustration of what art can do in the other i moralize indulgently upon human rashness  florentia you have an assurance à taute épreuve but you are deplorably superficial there is a whole group of plays and a whole category of acting to which your generalizations quite fail to apply help me auberon  auberon youre easily exhausted i suppose she means that its far from true everywhere that the scenery is everything it may be truei dont say it isof two or three goodnatured playhouses in london it isnt truehow can it beof the provincial theatres or of the others in the capital put it even that they would be all scenery if they could they cant poor thingsso they have to provide acting  dorriforth they have to fortunately but what do we hear of it  florentia how do you mean what do we hear of it  dorriforth in what trumpet of fame does it reach us they do what they can the performers auberon alludes to and they are brave souls but i am speaking of the conspicuous cases of the exhibitions that draw  florentia there is good acting that draws one could give you names and places  dorriforth i have already guessed those you mean but when it isnt too much a matter of the paraphernalia it is too little a matter of the play a play nowadays is a rare bird i should like to see ¦ one florentia there are lots of them all the whilethe newspapers talk about them people talk about them at dinners  dorriforth what do they say about them  florentia the newspapers  dorriforth no i dont care for them the people at dinners  florentia oh they dont say anything in particular  dorriforth doesnt that seem to show the effort isnt very suggestive  amicia the conversation at dinners certainly isnt  dorriforth i mean our contemporary drama to begin with you cant find it theres no text  florentia no text  auberon so much the better  dorriforth so much the better if there is to be no criticism there is only a dirt prompters book one cant put ones hand upon it one doesnt know what one is discussing there is no authoritynothing is ever published  amicia the pieces wouldnt bear that  dorriforth it would be a small ordeal to resistif there were anything in them look at the novels  amicia the text is the french brochure the adaptation is unprintable  dorriforth thats where its so wrong it ought at least to be as good as the original  auberon arent there some rights to protectsome risk of the play being stolen if its published  dorriforth there may bei dont know doesnt that only prove how little important we regard the drama as being and how little seriously we take it if we wont even trouble ourselves to bring about decent civil conditions for its existence what have we to do with the french brochure how does that help us to represent our own life our manners our customs our ideas our english types our english world such a field for comedy for tragedy for portraiture for satire as they all makesuch subjects as they would yield think of london alonewhat a matchless huntingground for the satiristthe most magnificent that ever was if the occasion always produced the man london would have produced an aristophanes but somehow it doesnt  florentia oh types and ideas aristophanes and satire  dorriforth im too ambitious you mean i shall presently show you that im not ambitious at all everything makes against thati am only reading the signs  auberon the plays are arranged to be as english as possible they are altered they are fitted  dorriforth fitted indeed they are and to the capacity of infants they are in too many cases made vulgar puerile barbarous they are neither fish nor flesh and with all the point thats left out and all the naïveté thats put in they cease to place before us any coherent appeal or any recognizable society  auberon they often make good plays to act all the same  dorriforth they may but they dont make good plays to see or to hear the theatre consists of two things que diableof the stage and the drama and i dont see how you can have it unless you have both or how you can have either unless you have the other they are the two blades of a pair of scissors  auberon you are very unfair to native talent there are lots of strictly original plays  amicia yes they put that expression on the posters  auberon i dont know what they put on the posters but the plays are written and actedproduced with great success  dorriforth producedpartly a play isnt fully produced until it is in a form in which you can refer to it we have to talk in the air i can refer to my congreve but i cant to my pinero         since the above was written several of mr pineros plays        have been published  florentia the authors are not bound to publish them if they dont wish  dorriforth certainly not nor are they in that case bound to insist on ones not being a little vague about them they are perfectly free to withhold them they may have very good reasons for it and i can imagine some that would be excellent and worthy of all respect but their withholding them is one of the signs  auberon what signs  dorriforth those i just spoke ofthose we are trying to read together the signs that ambition and desire are folly that the sun of the drama has set that the matter isnt worth talking about that it has ceased to be an interest for serious folk and that everythingeverything i mean thats anythingis over the sooner we recognize it the sooner to sleep the sooner we get clear of misleading illusions and are purged of the bad blood that disappointment makes its a pity because the theatreafter every allowance is mademight have been a fine thing at all events it was a pleasantit was really almost a nobledream requiescat  florentia i see nothing to confirm your absurd theory i delight in the play more people than ever delight in it with me more people than ever go to it and there are ten theatres in london where there were two of old  dorriforth which is what was to demonstrated whence do they derive their nutriment  auberon why from the enormous public  dorriforth my dear fellow im not talking of the boxoffice what wealth of dramatic of histrionic production have we to meet that enormous demand there will be twenty theatres ten years hence where there are ten today and there will be no doubt ten times as many people delighting in them like florentla but it wont alter the fact that our dream will have been dreamed florentia said a word when we came in which alone speaks volumes  florentia what was my word  auberon you are sovereignly unjust to native talent among the actorsi leave the dramatists alone there are many who do excellent independent work strive for perfection completenessin short the things we want  dorriforth i am not in the least unjust to themi only pity them they have so little to put sous la dent it must seem to them at times that no one will work for them that they are likely to starve for partsforsaken of gods and men  florentia if they work then in solitude and sadness they have the more honor and one should recognize more explicitly their great merit  dorriforth admirably said their laudable effort is precisely the one little loophole that i see of escape from the general doom certainly we must try to enlarge itthat small aperture into the blue we must fix our eyes on it and make much of it exaggerate it do anything with it tha may contribute to restore a working faith precious that must be to the sincere spirits on the stage who are conscious of all the other thingsformidable thingsthat rise against them  amicia what other things do you mean  dorriforth why for one thing the grossness and brutality of london with its scramble its pressure its hustle of engagements of preoccupations its long distances its late hours its nightly dinners its innumerable demands on the attention its general congregation of influences fatal to the isolation to the punctuality to the security of the dear old playhouse spell when florentia said in her charming way  florentia heres my dreadful speech at last  dorriforth when you said that you went to the théâtre libre in the afternoon because you couldnt spare an evening i recognized the deathknell of the drama time the very breath of its nostrils is lacking wagner was clever to go to leisurely bayreuth among the hillsthe bayreuth of spacious days a paradise of development  talk to a london audience of development the long runs would if necessary put the whole question into a nutshell figure to yourself for then the question is answered how an intelligent actor must loathe them and what a cruel negation he must find in them of the artistic life the life of which the very essence is variety of practice freshness of experiment and to feel that one must do many things in turn to do any one of them completely  auberon i dont in the least understand your acharnement in view of the vagueness of your contention  dorriforth my acharnement is your little joke and my contention is a little lesson in philosophy  florentia i prefer a lesson in taste i had one the other night at the merry wives  dorriforth if you come to that so did i  amicia so she does spare an evening sometimes  florentia it was all extremely quiet and comfortable and i dont in the least recognize dorriforths lurid picture of the dreadful conditions there was no sceneryat least not too much there was just enough and it was very pretty and it was in its place  dorriforth and what else was there  florentia there was very good acting  amicia i also went and i thought it all for a sportive wanton thing quite painfully ugly  auberon uglier than that ridiculous black room with the invisible people groping about in it of your precious duc denghien  dorriforth the black room is doubtless not the last word of art but it struck me as a successful application of a happy idea the contrivance was perfectly simplea closer night effect than is usually attempted with a few guttering candles which threw high shadows over the bare walls on the table of the courtmartial out of the gloom came the voices and tones of the distinguishable figures and it is perhaps a fancy of mine that it made themgiven the situation of coursemore impressive and dramatic  auberon you rail against scenery but what could belong more to the order of things extraneous to what you perhaps a little priggishly call the delicacy of personal art than the arrangement you are speaking of  dorriforth i was talking of the abuse of scenery i never said anything so idiotic as that the effect isnt helped by an appeal to the eye and an adumbration of the whereabouts  auberon but where do you draw the line and fix the limit what is the exact dose  dorriforth its a question of taste and tact  florentia and did you find taste and tact in that coalhole of the théâtre libre  dorriforth coalhole is again your joke i found a strong impression in itan impression of the hurried extemporized crossexamination by night of an impatient and mystified prisoner whose dreadful fate had been determined in advance who was to be shot highhandedly in the dismal dawn the arrangement didnt worry and distract me it was simplifying intensifying it gave what a judicious miseenscène should always do the essence of the matter and left the embroidery to the actors  florentia at the merry wives where you could see your hand before your face i could make out the embroidery  dorriforth could you under falstaffs pasteboard cheeks and the sad disfigurement of his mates there was no excess of scenery auberon says why falstaffs very person was nothing but scenery a false face a false figure false hands false legsscarcely a square inch on which the irrepressible humor of the rogue could break into illustrative touches and he is so human so expressive of so rich a physiognomy one would rather mr beerbohm tree should have played the part in his own clever elegant slimnessthat would at least have represented life a falstaff all makeup is an opaque substance this seems to me an example of what the rest still more suggested that in dealing with a production like the merry wives really the main quality to put forward is discretion you must resolve such a production as a thing represented into a tone that the imagination can take an aesthetic pleasure in its grossness must be transposed as it were to a fictive scale a scale of fainter tints and generalized signs a filthy eruptive realistic bardolph and pistol overlay the romantic with the literal relegate them and blur them to the eye let their blotches be constructive and their raggedness relative  amicia ah it was so ugly  dorriforth what a pity then after all there wasnt more painted canvas to divert you ah decidedly the theatre of the future must be that  florentia please remember your theory that our lifes a scramble and suffer me to go and dress for dinner  1889
