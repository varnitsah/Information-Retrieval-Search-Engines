14876389	mugby junction   chapter ibarbox brothers   i   guard  what place is this  mugby junction sir  a windy place  yes it mostly is sir  and looks comfortless indeed  yes it generally does sir  is it a rainy night still  pours sir  open the door  ill get out  youll have sir said the guard glistening with drops of wet and looking at the tearful face of his watch by the light of his lantern as the traveller descended three minutes here  more i thinkfor i am not going on  thought you had a through ticket sir  so i have but i shall sacrifice the rest of it  i want my luggage  please to come to the van and point it out sir  be good enough to look very sharp sir  not a moment to spare  the guard hurried to the luggage van and the traveller hurried after him  the guard got into it and the traveller looked into it  those two large black portmanteaus in the corner where your light shines  those are mine  name upon em sir  barbox brothers  stand clear sir if you please  one  two  right  lamp waved  signal lights ahead already changing  shriek from engine train gone  mugby junction said the traveller pulling up the woollen muffler round his throat with both hands  at past three oclock of a tempestuous morning  so  he spoke to himself  there was no one else to speak to  perhaps though there had been any one else to speak to he would have preferred to speak to himself  speaking to himself he spoke to a man within five years of fifty either way who had turned grey too soon like a neglected fire a man of pondering habit brooding carriage of the head and suppressed internal voice a man with many indications on him of having been much alone  he stood unnoticed on the dreary platform except by the rain and by the wind  those two vigilant assailants made a rush at him  very well said he yielding  it signifies nothing to me to what quarter i turn my face  thus at mugby junction at past three oclock of a tempestuous morning the traveller went where the weather drove him  not but what he could make a stand when he was so minded for coming to the end of the roofed shelter it is of considerable extent at mugby junction and looking out upon the dark night with a yet darker spirit wing of storm beating its wild way through it he faced about and held his own as ruggedly in the difficult direction as he had held it in the easier one  thus with a steady step the traveller went up and down up and down up and down seeking nothing and finding it  a place replete with shadowy shapes this mugby junction in the black hours of the fourandtwenty  mysterious goods trains covered with palls and gliding on like vast weird funerals conveying themselves guiltily away from the presence of the few lighted lamps as if their freight had come to a secret and unlawful end  halfmiles of coal pursuing in a detective manner following when they lead stopping when they stop backing when they back  redhot embers showering out upon the ground down this dark avenue and down the other as if torturing fires were being raked clear concurrently shrieks and groans and grinds invading the ear as if the tortured were at the height of their suffering  ironbarred cages full of cattle jangling by midway the drooping beasts with horns entangled eyes frozen with terror and mouths too at least they have long icicles or what seem so hanging from their lips  unknown languages in the air conspiring in red green and white characters  an earthquake accompanied with thunder and lightning going up express to london  now all quiet all rusty wind and rain in possession lamps extinguished mugby junction dead and indistinct with its robe drawn over its head like caesar  now too as the belated traveller plodded up and down a shadowy train went by him in the gloom which was no other than the train of a life from whatsoever intangible deep cutting or dark tunnel it emerged here it came unsummoned and unannounced stealing upon him and passing away into obscurity  here mournfully went by a child who had never had a childhood or known a parent inseparable from a youth with a bitter sense of his namelessness coupled to a man the enforced business of whose best years had been distasteful and oppressive linked to an ungrateful friend dragging after him a woman once beloved  attendant with many a clank and wrench were lumbering cares dark meditations huge dim disappointments monotonous years a long jarring line of the discords of a solitary and unhappy existence  yours sir  the traveller recalled his eyes from the waste into which they had been staring and fell back a step or so under the abruptness and perhaps the chance appropriateness of the question  oh  my thoughts were not here for the moment  yes  yes  those two portmanteaus are mine  are you a porter  on porters wages sir  but i am lamps  the traveller looked a little confused  who did you say you are  lamps sir showing an oily cloth in his hand as farther explanation  surely surely  is there any hotel or tavern here  not exactly here sir  there is a refreshment room here but  lamps with a mighty serious look gave his head a warning roll that plainly addedbut its a blessed circumstance for you that its not open  you couldnt recommend it i see if it was available  ask your pardon sir  if it was  open  it aint my place as a paid servant of the company to give my opinion on any of the companys toepicshe pronounced it more like toothpicksbeyond lampile and cottons returned lamps in a confidential tone but speaking as a man i wouldnt recommend my father if he was to come to life again to go and try how hed be treated at the refreshment room  not speaking as a man no i would not  the traveller nodded conviction  i suppose i can put up in the town there is a town here  for the traveller though a stayathome compared with most travellers had been like many others carried on the steam winds and the iron tides through that junction before without having ever as one might say gone ashore there  oh yes theres a town sir  anyways theres town enough to put up in but following the glance of the other at his luggage this is a very dead time of the night with us sir  the deadest time  i might amost call it our deadest and buriedest time  no porters about  well sir you see returned lamps confidential again they in general goes off with the gas  thats how it is  and they seem to have overlooked you through your walking to the furder end of the platform but in about twelve minutes or so she may be up  who may be up  the three fortytwo sir  she goes off in a sidin till the up x passes and then shehere an air of hopeful vagueness pervaded lampsdoes all as lays in her power  i doubt if i comprehend the arrangement  i doubt if anybody do sir  shes a parliamentary sir  and you see a parliamentary or a skirmishun  do you mean an excursion  thats it sira parliamentary or a skirmishun she mostly does go off into a sidin  but when she can get a chance shes whistled out of it and shes whistled up into doin all aslamps again wore the air of a highly sanguine man who hoped for the bestall as lays in her power  he then explained that the porters on duty being required to be in attendance on the parliamentary matron in question would doubtless turn up with the gas  in the meantime if the gentleman would not very much object to the smell of lampoil and would accept the warmth of his little roomthe gentleman being by this time very cold instantly closed with the proposal  a greasy little cabin it was suggestive to the sense of smell of a cabin in a whaler  but there was a bright fire burning in its rusty grate and on the floor there stood a wooden stand of newly trimmed and lighted lamps ready for carriage service  they made a bright show and their light and the warmth accounted for the popularity of the room as borne witness to by many impressions of velveteen trousers on a form by the fire and many rounded smears and smudges of stooping velveteen shoulders on the adjacent wall  various untidy shelves accommodated a quantity of lamps and oilcans and also a fragrant collection of what looked like the pockethandkerchiefs of the whole lamp family  as barbox brothers so to call the traveller on the warranty of his luggage took his seat upon the form and warmed his now ungloved hands at the fire he glanced aside at a little deal desk much blotched with ink which his elbow touched  upon it were some scraps of coarse paper and a superannuated steel pen in very reduced and gritty circumstances  from glancing at the scraps of paper he turned involuntarily to his host and said with some roughness  why you are never a poet man  lamps had certainly not the conventional appearance of one as he stood modestly rubbing his squab nose with a handkerchief so exceedingly oily that he might have been in the act of mistaking himself for one of his charges  he was a spare man of about the barbox brothers time of life with his features whimsically drawn upward as if they were attracted by the roots of his hair  he had a peculiarly shining transparent complexion probably occasioned by constant oleaginous application and his attractive hair being cut short and being grizzled and standing straight up on end as if it in its turn were attracted by some invisible magnet above it the top of his head was not very unlike a lampwick  but to be sure its no business of mine said barbox brothers  that was an impertinent observation on my part  be what you like  some people sir remarked lamps in a tone of apology are sometimes what they dont like  nobody knows that better than i do sighed the other  i have been what i dont like all my life  when i first took sir resumed lamps to composing little comicsongslike  barbox brothers eyed him with great disfavour  to composing little comicsongslikeand what was more hardto singing em afterwards said lamps it went against the grain at that time it did indeed  something that was not all oil here shining in lampss eye barbox brothers withdrew his own a little disconcerted looked at the fire and put a foot on the top bar  why did you do it then he asked after a short pause abruptly enough but in a softer tone  if you didnt want to do it why did you do it  where did you sing them  publichouse  to which mr lamps returned the curious reply bedside  at this moment while the traveller looked at him for elucidation mugby junction started suddenly trembled violently and opened its gas eyes shes got up lamps announced excited  what lays in her power is sometimes more and sometimes less but its laid in her power to get up tonight by george  the legend barbox brothers in large white letters on two black surfaces was very soon afterwards trundling on a truck through a silent street and when the owner of the legend had shivered on the pavement half an hour what time the porters knocks at the inn door knocked up the whole town first and the inn last he groped his way into the close air of a shutup house and so groped between the sheets of a shutup bed that seemed to have been expressly refrigerated for him when last made    ii   you remember me young jackson  what do i remember if not you  you are my first remembrance  it was you who told me that was my name  it was you who told me that on every twentieth of december my life had a penitential anniversary in it called a birthday  i suppose the last communication was truer than the first  what am i like young jackson  you are like a blight all through the year to me  you hardlined thin lipped repressive changeless woman with a wax mask on  you are like the devil to me most of all when you teach me religious things for you make me abhor them  you remember me mr young jackson  in another voice from another quarter  most gratefully sir  you were the ray of hope and prospering ambition in my life  when i attended your course i believed that i should come to be a great healer and i felt almost happyeven though i was still the one boarder in the house with that horrible mask and ate and drank in silence and constraint with the mask before me every day  as i had done every every every day through my schooltime and from my earliest recollection  what am i like mr young jackson  you are like a superior being to me  you are like nature beginning to reveal herself to me  i hear you again as one of the hushed crowd of young men kindling under the power of your presence and knowledge and you bring into my eyes the only exultant tears that ever stood in them  you remember me mr young jackson  in a grating voice from quite another quarter  too well  you made your ghostly appearance in my life one day and announced that its course was to be suddenly and wholly changed  you showed me which was my wearisome seat in the galley of barbox brothers when they were if they ever were is unknown to me there was nothing of them but the name when i bent to the oar  you told me what i was to do and what to be paid you told me afterwards at intervals of years when i was to sign for the firm when i became a partner when i became the firm  i know no more of it or of myself  what am i like mr young jackson  you are like my father i sometimes think  you are hard enough and cold enough so to have brought up an acknowledged son  i see your scanty figure your close brown suit and your tight brown wig but you too wear a wax mask to your death  you never by a chance remove itit never by a chance falls offand i know no more of you  throughout this dialogue the traveller spoke to himself at his window in the morning as he had spoken to himself at the junction overnight  and as he had then looked in the darkness a man who had turned grey too soon like a neglected fire so he now looked in the sunlight an ashier grey like a fire which the brightness of the sun put out  the firm of barbox brothers had been some offshoot or irregular branch of the public notary and billbroking tree  it had gained for itself a griping reputation before the days of young jackson and the reputation had stuck to it and to him  as he had imperceptibly come into possession of the dim den up in the corner of a court off lombard street on whose grimy windows the inscription barbox brothers had for many long years daily interposed itself between him and the sky so he had insensibly found himself a personage held in chronic distrust whom it was essential to screw tight to every transaction in which he engaged whose word was never to be taken without his attested bond whom all dealers with openly set up guards and wards against  this character had come upon him through no act of his own  it was as if the original barbox had stretched himself down upon the office floor and had thither caused to be conveyed young jackson in his sleep and had there effected a metempsychosis and exchange of persons with him  the discoveryaided in its turn by the deceit of the only woman he had ever loved and the deceit of the only friend he had ever made who eloped from him to be married togetherthe discovery so followed up completed what his earliest rearing had begun  he shrank abashed within the form of barbox and lifted up his head and heart no more  but he did at last effect one great release in his condition  he broke the oar he had plied so long and he scuttled and sank the galley  he prevented the gradual retirement of an old conventional business from him by taking the initiative and retiring from it  with enough to live on though after all with not too much he obliterated the firm of barbox brothers from the pages of the postoffice directory and the face of the earth leaving nothing of it but its name on two portmanteaus  for one must have some name in going about for people to pick up he explained to mugby high street through the inn window and that name at least was real once  whereas young jacksonnot to mention its being a sadly satirical misnomer for old jackson  he took up his hat and walked out just in time to see passing along on the opposite side of the way a velveteen man carrying his days dinner in a small bundle that might have been larger without suspicion of gluttony and pelting away towards the junction at a great pace  theres lamps said barbox brothers  and by the bye  ridiculous surely that a man so serious so selfcontained and not yet three days emancipated from a routine of drudgery should stand rubbing his chin in the street in a brown study about comic songs  bedside said barbox brothers testily  sings them at the bedside  why at the bedside unless he goes to bed drunk  does i shouldnt wonder but its no business of mine  let me see  mugby junction mugby junction  where shall i go next  as it came into my head last night when i woke from an uneasy sleep in the carriage and found myself here i can go anywhere from here  where shall i go  ill go and look at the junction by daylight  theres no hurry and i may like the look of one line better than another  but there were so many lines  gazing down upon them from a bridge at the junction it was as if the concentrating companies formed a great industrial exhibition of the works of extraordinary ground spiders that spun iron  and then so many of the lines went such wonderful ways so crossing and curving among one another that the eye lost them  and then some of them appeared to start with the fixed intention of going five hundred miles and all of a sudden gave it up at an insignificant barrier or turned off into a workshop  and then others like intoxicated men went a little way very straight and surprisingly slued round and came back again  and then others were so chockfull of trucks of coal others were so blocked with trucks of casks others were so gorged with trucks of ballast others were so set apart for wheeled objects like immense iron cottonreels while others were so bright and clear and others were so delivered over to rust and ashes and idle wheelbarrows out of work with their legs in the air looking much like their masters on strike that there was no beginning middle or end to the bewilderment  barbox brothers stood puzzled on the bridge passing his right hand across the lines on his forehead which multiplied while he looked down as if the railway lines were getting themselves photographed on that sensitive plate  then was heard a distant ringing of bells and blowing of whistles  then puppetlooking heads of men popped out of boxes in perspective and popped in again  then prodigious wooden razors set up on end began shaving the atmosphere  then several locomotive engines in several directions began to scream and be agitated  then along one avenue a train came in  then along another two trains appeared that didnt come in but stopped without  then bits of trains broke off then a struggling horse became involved with them  then the locomotives shared the bits of trains and ran away with the whole  i have not made my next move much clearer by this  no hurry  no need to make up my mind today or tomorrow nor yet the day after  ill take a walk  it fell out somehow perhaps he meant it should that the walk tended to the platform at which he had alighted and to lampss room  but lamps was not in his room  a pair of velveteen shoulders were adapting themselves to one of the impressions on the wall by lampss fireplace but otherwise the room was void  in passing back to get out of the station again he learnt the cause of this vacancy by catching sight of lamps on the opposite line of railway skipping along the top of a train from carriage to carriage and catching lighted namesakes thrown up to him by a coadjutor  he is busy  he has not much time for composing or singing comic songs this morning i take it  the direction he pursued now was into the country keeping very near to the side of one great line of railway and within easy view of others  i have half a mind he said glancing around to settle the question from this point by saying ill take this set of rails or that or tother and stick to it  they separate themselves from the confusion out here and go their ways  ascending a gentle hill of some extent he came to a few cottages  there looking about him as a very reserved man might who had never looked about him in his life before he saw some six or eight young children come merrily trooping and whooping from one of the cottages and disperse  but not until they had all turned at the little gardengate and kissed their hands to a face at the upper window a low window enough although the upper for the cottage had but a story of one room above the ground  now that the children should do this was nothing but that they should do this to a face lying on the sill of the open window turned towards them in a horizontal position and apparently only a face was something noticeable  he looked up at the window again  could only see a very fragile though a very bright face lying on one cheek on the windowsill  the delicate smiling face of a girl or woman  framed in long bright brown hair round which was tied a light blue band or fillet passing under the chin  he walked on turned back passed the window again shyly glanced up again  no change  he struck off by a winding branchroad at the top of the hillwhich he must otherwise have descendedkept the cottages in view worked his way round at a distance so as to come out once more into the main road and be obliged to pass the cottages again  the face still lay on the windowsill but not so much inclined towards him  and now there were a pair of delicate hands too  they had the action of performing on some musical instrument and yet it produced no sound that reached his ears  mugby junction must be the maddest place in england said barbox brothers pursuing his way down the hill  the first thing i find here is a railway porter who composes comic songs to sing at his bedside  the second thing i find here is a face and a pair of hands playing a musical instrument that dont play  the day was a fine bright day in the early beginning of november the air was clear and inspiriting and the landscape was rich in beautiful colours  the prevailing colours in the court off lombard street london city had been few and sombre  sometimes when the weather elsewhere was very bright indeed the dwellers in those tents enjoyed a pepperandsalt coloured day or two but their atmospheres usual wear was slate or snuff coloured  he relished his walk so well that he repeated it next day  he was a little earlier at the cottage than on the day before and he could hear the children upstairs singing to a regular measure and clapping out the time with their hands  still there is no sound of any musical instrument he said listening at the corner and yet i saw the performing hands again as i came by what are the children singing  why good lord they can never be singing the multiplication table  they were though and with infinite enjoyment  the mysterious face had a voice attached to it which occasionally led or set the children right its musical cheerfulness was delightful  the measure at length stopped and was succeeded by a murmuring of young voices and then by a short song which he made out to be about the current month of the year and about what work it yielded to the labourers in the fields and farmyards then there was a stir of little feet and the children came trooping and whooping out as on the previous day  and again as on the previous day they all turned at the gardengate and kissed their handsevidently to the face on the windowsill though barbox brothers from his retired post of disadvantage at the corner could not see it  but as the children dispersed he cut off one small stragglera brown faced boy with flaxen hairand said to him  come here little one  tell me whose house is that  the child with one swarthy arm held up across his eyes half in shyness and half ready for defence said from behind the inside of his elbow  phoebes  and who said barbox brothers quite as much embarrassed by his part in the dialogue as the child could possibly be by his is phoebe  to which the child made answer why phoebe of course  the small but sharp observer had eyed his questioner closely and had taken his moral measure  he lowered his guard and rather assumed a tone with him as having discovered him to be an unaccustomed person in the art of polite conversation  phoebe said the child cant be anybobby else but phoebe  can she  no i suppose not  well returned the child then why did you ask me  deeming it prudent to shift his ground barbox brothers took up a new position  what do you do there  up there in that room where the open window is what do you do there  cool said the child  eh  coool the child repeated in a louder voice lengthening out the word with a fixed look and great emphasis as much as to say whats the use of your having grown up if youre such a donkey as not to understand me  ah  school school said barbox brothers  yes yes yes  and phoebe teaches you  the child nodded  good boy  tound it out have you said the child  yes i have found it out  what would you do with twopence if i gave it you  pend it  the knockdown promptitude of this reply leaving him not a leg to stand upon barbox brothers produced the twopence with great lameness and withdrew in a state of humiliation  but seeing the face on the windowsill as he passed the cottage he acknowledged its presence there with a gesture which was not a nod not a bow not a removal of his hat from his head but was a diffident compromise between or struggle with all three  the eyes in the face seemed amused or cheered or both and the lips modestly said goodday to you sir  i find i must stick for a time to mugby junction said barbox brothers with much gravity after once more stopping on his return road to look at the lines where they went their several ways so quietly  i cant make up my mind yet which iron road to take  in fact i must get a little accustomed to the junction before i can decide  so he announced at the inn that he was going to stay on for the present and improved his acquaintance with the junction that night and again next morning and again next night and morning going down to the station mingling with the people there looking about him down all the avenues of railway and beginning to take an interest in the incomings and outgoings of the trains  at first he often put his head into lampss little room but he never found lamps there  a pair or two of velveteen shoulders he usually found there stooping over the fire sometimes in connection with a clasped knife and a piece of bread and meat but the answer to his inquiry wheres lamps was either that he was tother side the line or that it was his offtime or in the latter case his own personal introduction to another lamps who was not his lamps  however he was not so desperately set upon seeing lamps now but he bore the disappointment  nor did he so wholly devote himself to his severe application to the study of mugby junction as to neglect exercise  on the contrary he took a walk every day and always the same walk  but the weather turned cold and wet again and the window was never open    iii   at length after a lapse of some days there came another streak of fine bright hardy autumn weather  it was a saturday  the window was open and the children were gone  not surprising this for he had patiently watched and waited at the corner until they were gone  goodday he said to the face absolutely getting his hat clear off his head this time  goodday to you sir  i am glad you have a fine sky again to look at  thank you sir  it is kind if you  you are an invalid i fear  no sir  i have very good health  but are you not always lying down  oh yes i am always lying down because i cannot sit up  but i am not an invalid  the laughing eyes seemed highly to enjoy his great mistake  would you mind taking the trouble to come in sir  there is a beautiful view from this window  and you would see that i am not at all illbeing so good as to care  it was said to help him as he stood irresolute but evidently desiring to enter with his diffident hand on the latch of the gardengate  it did help him and he went in  the room upstairs was a very clean white room with a low roof  its only inmate lay on a couch that brought her face to a level with the window the couch was white too and her simple dress or wrapper being light blue like the band around her hair she had an ethereal look and a fanciful appearance of lying among clouds  he felt that she instinctively perceived him to be by habit a downcast taciturn man it was another help to him to have established that understanding so easily and got it over  there was an awkward constraint upon him nevertheless as he touched her hand and took a chair at the side of her couch  i see now he began not at all fluently how you occupy your hand only seeing you from the path outside i thought you were playing upon something  she was engaged in very nimbly and dexterously making lace  a lacepillow lay upon her breast and the quick movements and changes of her hands upon it as she worked had given them the action he had misinterpreted  that is curious she answered with a bright smile  for i often fancy myself that i play tunes while i am at work  have you any musical knowledge  she shook her head  i think i could pick out tunes if i had any instrument which could be made as handy to me as my lacepillow  but i dare say i deceive myself at all events i shall never know  you have a musical voice  excuse me i have heard you sing  with the children she answered slightly colouring  oh yes  i sing with the dear children if it can be called singing  barbox brothers glanced at the two small forms in the room and hazarded the speculation that she was fond of children and that she was learned in new systems of teaching them  very fond of them she said shaking her head again but i know nothing of teaching beyond the interest i have in it and the pleasure it gives me when they learn  perhaps your overhearing my little scholars sing some of their lessons has led you so far astray as to think me a grand teacher  ah  i thought so  no i have only read and been told about that system  it seemed so pretty and pleasant and to treat them so like the merry robins they are that i took up with it in my little way  you dont need to be told what a very little way mine is sir she added with a glance at the small forms and round the room  all this time her hands were busy at her lacepillow  as they still continued so and as there was a kind of substitute for conversation in the click and play of its pegs barbox brothers took the opportunity of observing her  he guessed her to be thirty  the charm of her transparent face and large bright brown eyes was not that they were passively resigned but that they were actively and thoroughly cheerful even her busy hands which of their own thinness alone might have besought compassion plied their task with a gay courage that made mere compassion an unjustifiable assumption of superiority and an impertinence  he saw her eyes in the act of rising towards his and he directed his towards the prospect saying beautiful indeed  most beautiful sir  i have sometimes had a fancy that i would like to sit up for once only to try how it looks to an erect head  but what a foolish fancy that would be to encourage  it cannot look more lovely to any one than it does to me  her eyes were turned to it as she spoke with most delighted admiration and enjoyment  there was not a trace in it of any sense of deprivation  and those threads of railway with their puffs of smoke and steam changing places so fast make it so lively for me she went on  i think of the number of people who can go where they wish on their business or their pleasure i remember that the puffs make signs to me that they are actually going while i look and that enlivens the prospect with abundance of company if i want company  there is the great junction too  i dont see it under the foot of the hill but i can very often hear it and i always know it is there  it seems to join me in a way to i dont know how many places and things that i shall never see  with an abashed kind of idea that it might have already joined himself to something he had never seen he said constrainedly just so  and so you see sir pursued phoebe i am not the invalid you thought me and i am very well off indeed  you have a happy disposition said barbox brothers perhaps with a slight excusatory touch for his own disposition  ah  but you should know my father she replied  his is the happy dispositiondont mind sir  for his reserve took the alarm at a step upon the stairs and he distrusted that he would be set down for a troublesome intruder  this is my father coming  the door opened and the father paused there  why lamps exclaimed barbox brothers starting from his chair  how do you do lamps  to which lamps responded the gentleman for nowhere  how do you do sir  and they shook hands to the greatest admiration and surprise of lamps daughter  i have looked you up halfadozen times since that night said barbox brothers but have never found you  so ive heerd on sir so ive heerd on returned lamps  its your being noticed so often down at the junction without taking any train that has begun to get you the name among us of the gentleman for nowhere no offence in my having called you by it when took by surprise i hope sir  none at all  its as good a name for me as any other you could call me by  but may i ask you a question in the corner here  lamps suffered himself to be led aside from his daughters couch by one of the buttons of his velveteen jacket  is this the bedside where you sing your songs  lamps nodded  the gentleman for nowhere clapped him on the shoulder and they faced about again  upon my word my dear said lamps then to his daughter looking from her to her visitor it is such an amaze to me to find you brought acquainted with this gentleman that i must if this gentleman will excuse me take a rounder  mr lamps demonstrated in action what this meant by pulling out his oily handkerchief rolled up in the form of a ball and giving himself an elaborate smear from behind the right ear up the cheek across the forehead and down the other cheek to behind his left ear  after this operation he shone exceedingly  its according to my custom when particular warmed up by any agitation sir he offered by way of apology  and really i am throwed into that state of amaze by finding you brought acquainted with phoebe that ithat i think i will if youll excuse me take another rounder  which he did seeming to be greatly restored by it  they were now both standing by the side of her couch and she was working at her lacepillow  your daughter tells me said barbox brothers still in a halfreluctant shamefaced way that she never sits up  no sir nor never has done  you see her mother who died when she was a year and two months old was subject to very bad fits and as she had never mentioned to me that she was subject to fits they couldnt be guarded against  consequently she dropped the baby when took and this happened  it was very wrong of her said barbox brothers with a knitted brow to marry you making a secret of her infirmity  well sir pleaded lamps in behalf of the longdeceased  you see phoebe and me we have talked that over too  and lord bless us  such a number on us has our infirmities what with fits and what with misfits of one sort and another that if we confessed to em all before we got married most of us might never get married  might not that be for the better  not in this case sir said phoebe giving her hand to her father  no not in this case sir said her father patting it between his own  you correct me returned barbox brothers with a blush and i must look so like a brute that at all events it would be superfluous in me to confess to that infirmity  i wish you would tell me a little more about yourselves  i hardly knew how to ask it of you for i am conscious that i have a bad stiff manner a dull discouraging way with me but i wish you would  with all our hearts sir returned lamps gaily for both  and first of all that you may know my name  stay interposed the visitor with a slight flush  what signifies your name  lamps is name enough for me  i like it  it is bright and expressive  what do i want more  why to be sure sir returned lamps  i have in general no other name down at the junction but i thought on account of your being here as a firstclass single in a private character that you might  the visitor waved the thought away with his hand and lamps acknowledged the mark of confidence by taking another rounder  you are hardworked i take for granted said barbox brothers when the subject of the rounder came out of it much dirtier than be went into it  lamps was beginning not particular sowhen his daughter took him up  oh yes sir he is very hardworked  fourteen fifteen eighteen hours a day  sometimes twentyfour hours at a time  and you said barbox brothers what with your school phoebe and what with your lacemaking  but my school is a pleasure to me she interrupted opening her brown eyes wider as if surprised to find him so obtuse  i began it when i was but a child because it brought me and other children into company dont you see  that was not work  i carry it on still because it keeps children about me  that is not work  i do it as love not as work  then my lacepillow her busy hands had stopped as if her argument required all her cheerful earnestness but now went on again at the name it goes with my thoughts when i think and it goes with my tunes when i hum any and thats not work  why you yourself thought it was music you know sir  and so it is to me  everything is cried lamps radiantly  everything is music to her sir  my father is at any rate said phoebe exultingly pointing her thin forefinger at him  there is more music in my father than there is in a brass band  i say  my dear  its very fillyillially done you know but you are flattering your father he protested sparkling  no i am not sir i assure you  no i am not  if you could hear my father sing you would know i am not  but you never will hear him sing because he never sings to any one but me  however tired he is he always sings to me when he comes home  when i lay here long ago quite a poor little broken doll he used to sing to me  more than that he used to make songs bringing in whatever little jokes we had between us  more than that he often does so to this day  oh  ill tell of you father as the gentleman has asked about you  he is a poet sir  i shouldnt wish the gentleman my dear observed lamps for the moment turning grave to carry away that opinion of your father because it might look as if i was given to asking the stars in a molloncolly manner what they was up to  which i wouldnt at once waste the time and take the liberty my dear  my father resumed phoebe amending her text is always on the bright side and the good side  you told me just now i had a happy disposition  how can i help it  well but my dear returned lamps argumentatively how can i help it put it to yourself sir  look at her  always as you see her now  always workingand after all sir for but a very few shillings a weekalways contented always lively always interested in others of all sorts  i said this moment she was always as you see her now  so she is with a difference that comes to much the same  for when it is my sunday off and the morning bells have done ringing i hear the prayers and thanks read in the touchingest way and i have the hymns sung to meso soft sir that you couldnt hear em out of this roomin notes that seem to me i am sure to come from heaven and go back to it  it might have been merely through the association of these words with their sacredly quiet time or it might have been through the larger association of the words with the redeemers presence beside the bedridden but here her dexterous fingers came to a stop on the lacepillow and clasped themselves around his neck as he bent down there was great natural sensibility in both father and daughter the visitor could easily see but each made it for the others sake retiring not demonstrative and perfect cheerfulness intuitive or acquired was either the first or second nature of both  in a very few moments lamps was taking another rounder with his comical features beaming while phoebes laughing eyes just a glistening speck or so upon their lashes were again directed by turns to him and to her work and to barbox brothers  when my father sir she said brightly tells you about my being interested in other people even though they know nothing about mewhich by the bye i told you myselfyou ought to know how that comes about thats my fathers doing  no it isnt he protested  dont you believe him sir yes it is  he tells me of everything he sees down at his work  you would be surprised what a quantity he gets together for me every day  he looks into the carriages and tells me how the ladies are dressedso that i know all the fashions  he looks into the carriages and tells me what pairs of lovers he sees and what new married couples on their wedding tripso that i know all about that  he collects chance newspapers and booksso that i have plenty to read  he tells me about the sick people who are travelling to try to get betterso that i know all about them  in short as i began by saying he tells me everything he sees and makes out down at his work and you cant think what a quantity he does see and make out  as to collecting newspapers and books my dear said lamps its clear i can have no merit in that because theyre not my perquisites  you see sir its this way a guard hell say to me hallo here you are lamps  ive saved this paper for your daughter  how is she agoing on a headporter hell say to me here  catch hold lamps  heres a couple of wollumes for your daughter  is she pretty much where she were  and thats what makes it double welcome you see  if she had a thousand pound in a box they wouldnt trouble themselves about her but being what she isthat is you understand lamps added somewhat hurriedly not having a thousand pound in a boxthey take thought for her  and as concerning the young pairs married and unmarried its only natural i should bring home what little i can about them seeing that theres not a couple of either sort in the neighbourhood that dont come of their own accord to confide in phoebe  she raised her eyes triumphantly to barbox brothers as she said  indeed sir that is true  if i could have got up and gone to church i dont know how often i should have been a bridesmaid  but if i could have done that some girls in love might have been jealous of me and as it is no girl is jealous of me  and my pillow would not have been half as ready to put the piece of cake under as i always find it she added turning her face on it with a light sigh and a smile at her father  the arrival of a little girl the biggest of the scholars now led to an understanding on the part of barbox brothers that she was the domestic of the cottage and had come to take active measures in it attended by a pail that might have extinguished her and a broom three times her height  he therefore rose to take his leave and took it saying that if phoebe had no objection he would come again  he had muttered that he would come in the course of his walks  the course of his walks must have been highly favourable to his return for he returned after an interval of a single day  you thought you would never see me any more i suppose he said to phoebe as he touched her hand and sat down by her couch  why should i think so was her surprised rejoinder  i took it for granted you would mistrust me  for granted sir  have you been so much mistrusted  i think i am justified in answering yes  but i may have mistrusted too on my part  no matter just now  we were speaking of the junction last time  i have passed hours there since the day before yesterday  are you now the gentleman for somewhere she asked with a smile  certainly for somewhere but i dont yet know where  you would never guess what i am travelling from  shall i tell you  i am travelling from my birthday  her hands stopped in her work and she looked at him with incredulous astonishment  yes said barbox brothers not quite easy in his chair from my birthday  i am to myself an unintelligible book with the earlier chapters all torn out and thrown away  my childhood had no grace of childhood my youth had no charm of youth and what can be expected from such a lost beginning  his eyes meeting hers as they were addressed intently to him something seemed to stir within his breast whispering was this bed a place for the graces of childhood and the charms of youth to take to kindly  oh shame shame  it is a disease with me said barbox brothers checking himself and making as though he had a difficulty in swallowing something to go wrong about that  i dont know how i came to speak of that  i hope it is because of an old misplaced confidence in one of your sex involving an old bitter treachery  i dont know  i am all wrong together  her hands quietly and slowly resumed their work  glancing at her he saw that her eyes were thoughtfully following them  i am travelling from my birthday he resumed because it has always been a dreary day to me  my first free birthday coming round some five or six weeks hence i am travelling to put its predecessors far behind me and to try to crush the dayor at all events put it out of my sightby heaping new objects on it  as he paused she looked at him but only shook her head as being quite at a loss  this is unintelligible to your happy disposition he pursued abiding by his former phrase as if there were some lingering virtue of selfdefence in it  i knew it would be and am glad it is  however on this travel of mine in which i mean to pass the rest of my days having abandoned all thought of a fixed home i stopped as you have heard from your father at the junction here  the extent of its ramifications quite confused me as to whither i should go from here  i have not yet settled being still perplexed among so many roads  what do you think i mean to do  how many of the branching roads can you see from your window  looking out full of interest she answered seven  seven said barbox brothers watching her with a grave smile  well  i propose to myself at once to reduce the gross number to those very seven and gradually to fine them down to onethe most promising for meand to take that  but how will you know sir which is the most promising she asked with her brightened eyes roving over the view  ah said barbox brothers with another grave smile and considerably improving in his ease of speech  to be sure  in this way  where your father can pick up so much every day for a good purpose i may once and again pick up a little for an indifferent purpose  the gentleman for nowhere must become still better known at the junction  he shall continue to explore it until he attaches something that he has seen heard or found out at the head of each of the seven roads to the road itself  and so his choice of a road shall be determined by his choice among his discoveries  her hands still busy she again glanced at the prospect as if it comprehended something that had not been in it before and laughed as if it yielded her new pleasure  but i must not forget said barbox brothers having got so far to ask a favour  i want your help in this expedient of mine  i want to bring you what i pick up at the heads of the seven roads that you lie here looking out at and to compare notes with you about it  may i  they say two heads are better than one  i should say myself that probably depends upon the heads concerned  but i am quite sure though we are so newly acquainted that your head and your fathers have found out better things phoebe than ever mine of itself discovered  she gave him her sympathetic right hand in perfect rapture with his proposal and eagerly and gratefully thanked him  thats well said barbox brothers  again i must not forget having got so far to ask a favour  will you shut your eyes  laughing playfully at the strange nature of the request she did so  keep them shut said barbox brothers going softly to the door and coming back  you are on your honour mind not to open you eyes until i tell you that you may  yes  on my honour  good  may i take your lacepillow from you for a minute  still laughing and wondering she removed her hands from it and he put it aside  tell me  did you see the puffs of smoke and steam made by the morning fasttrain yesterday on road number seven from here  behind the elmtrees and the spire  thats the road said barbox brothers directing his eyes towards it  yes  i watched them melt away  anything unusual in what they expressed  no she answered merrily  not complimentary to me for i was in that train  i wentdont open your eyesto fetch you this from the great ingenious town  it is not half so large as your lacepillow and lies easily and lightly in its place  these little keys are like the keys of a miniature piano and you supply the air required with your left hand  may you pick out delightful music from it my dear  for the presentyou can open your eyes nowgood bye  in his embarrassed way he closed the door upon himself and only saw in doing so that she ecstatically took the present to her bosom and caressed it  the glimpse gladdened his heart and yet saddened it for so might she if her youth had flourished in its natural course having taken to her breast that day the slumbering music of her own childs voice     chapter iibarbox brothers and co   with goodwill and earnest purpose the gentleman for nowhere began on the very next day his researches at the heads of the seven roads  the results of his researches as he and phoebe afterwards set them down in fair writing hold their due places in this veracious chronicle  but they occupied a much longer time in the getting together than they ever will in the perusal  and this is probably the case with most reading matter except when it is of that highly beneficial kind for posterity which is thrown off in a few moments of leisure by the superior poetic geniuses who scorn to take prose pains  it must be admitted however that barbox by no means hurried himself his heart being in his work of goodnature he revelled in it  there was the joy too it was a true joy to him of sometimes sitting by listening to phoebe as she picked out more and more discourse from her musical instrument and as her natural taste and ear refined daily upon her first discoveries  besides being a pleasure this was an occupation and in the course of weeks it consumed hours  it resulted that his dreaded birthday was close upon him before he had troubled himself any more about it  the matter was made more pressing by the unforeseen circumstance that the councils held at which mr lamps beaming most brilliantly on a few rare occasions assisted respecting the road to be selected were after all in nowise assisted by his investigations  for he had connected this interest with this road or that interest with the other but could deduce no reason from it for giving any road the preference consequently when the last council was holden that part of the business stood in the end exactly where it had stood in the beginning  but sir remarked phoebe we have only six roads after all  is the seventh road dumb  the seventh road  oh said barbox brothers rubbing his chin  that is the road i took you know when i went to get your little present that is its story  phoebe  would you mind taking that road again sir she asked with hesitation  not in the least it is a great highroad after all  i should like you to take it returned phoebe with a persuasive smile for the love of that little present which must ever be so dear to me  i should like you to take it because that road can never be again like any other road to me  i should like you to take it in remembrance of your having done me so much good of your having made me so much happier  if you leave me by the road you travelled when you went to do me this great kindness sounding a faint chord as she spoke i shall feel lying here watching at my window as if it must conduct you to a prosperous end and bring you back some day  it shall be done my dear it shall be done  so at last the gentleman for nowhere took a ticket for somewhere and his destination was the great ingenious town  he had loitered so long about the junction that it was the eighteenth of december when he left it  high time he reflected as he seated himself in the train that i started in earnest  only one clear day remains between me and the day i am running away from  ill push onward for the hillcountry tomorrow  ill go to wales  it was with some pains that he placed before himself the undeniable advantages to be gained in the way of novel occupation for his senses from misty mountains swollen streams rain cold a wild seashore and rugged roads  and yet he scarcely made them out as distinctly as he could have wished  whether the poor girl in spite of her new resource her music would have any feeling of loneliness upon her nowjust at firstthat she had not had before whether she saw those very puffs of steam and smoke that he saw as he sat in the train thinking of her whether her face would have any pensive shadow on it as they died out of the distant view from her window whether in telling him he had done her so much good she had not unconsciously corrected his old moody bemoaning of his station in life by setting him thinking that a man might be a great healer if he would and yet not be a great doctor these and other similar meditations got between him and his welsh picture  there was within him too that dull sense of vacuity which follows separation from an object of interest and cessation of a pleasant pursuit and this sense being quite new to him made him restless  further in losing mugby junction he had found himself again and he was not the more enamoured of himself for having lately passed his time in better company  but surely here not far ahead must be the great ingenious town  this crashing and clashing that the train was undergoing and this coupling on to it of a multitude of new echoes could mean nothing less than approach to the great station  it did mean nothing less  after some stormy flashes of town lightning in the way of swift revelations of red brick blocks of houses high red brick chimneyshafts vistas of red brick railway arches tongues of fire blocks of smoke valleys of canal and hills if coal there came the thundering in at the journeys end  having seen his portmanteaus safely housed in the hotel he chose and having appointed his dinner hour barbox brothers went out for a walk in the busy streets  and now it began to be suspected by him that mugby junction was a junction of many branches invisible as well as visible and had joined him to an endless number of byways  for whereas he would but a little while ago have walked these streets blindly brooding he now had eyes and thoughts for a new external world  how the many toiling people lived and loved and died how wonderful it was to consider the various trainings of eye and hand the nice distinctions of sight and touch that separated them into classes of workers and even into classes of workers at subdivisions of one complete whole which combined their many intelligences and forces though of itself but some cheap object of use or ornament in common life how good it was to know that such assembling in a multitude on their part and such contribution of their several dexterities towards a civilising end did not deteriorate them as it was the fashion of the supercilious mayflies of humanity to pretend but engendered among them a selfrespect and yet a modest desire to be much wiser than they were the first evinced in their wellbalanced bearing and manner of speech when he stopped to ask a question the second in the announcements of their popular studies and amusements on the public walls these considerations and a host of such made his walk a memorable one  i too am but a little part of a great whole he began to think and to be serviceable to myself and others or to be happy i must cast my interest into and draw it out of the common stock  although he had arrived at his journeys end for the day by noon he had since insensibly walked about the town so far and so long that the lamp lighters were now at their work in the streets and the shops were sparkling up brilliantly  thus reminded to turn towards his quarters he was in the act of doing so when a very little hand crept into his and a very little voice said  oh if you please i am lost  he looked down and saw a very little fairhaired girl  yes she said confirming her words with a serious nod  i am indeed i am lost  greatly perplexed he stopped looked about him for help descried none and said bending low  where do you live my child  i dont know where i live she returned  i am lost  what is your name  polly  what is your other name  the reply was prompt but unintelligible  imitating the sound as he caught it he hazarded the guess trivits  oh no said the child shaking her head  nothing like that  say it again little one  an unpromising business  for this time it had quite a different sound  he made the venture paddens  oh no said the child  nothing like that  once more  let us try it again dear  a most hopeless business  this time it swelled into four syllables  it cant be tappitarver said barbox brothers rubbing his head with his hat in discomfiture  no  it aint the child quietly assented  on her trying this unfortunate name once more with extraordinary efforts at distinctness it swelled into eight syllables at least  ah  i think said barbox brothers with a desperate air of resignation that we had better give it up  but i am lost said the child nestling her little hand more closely in his and youll take care of me wont you  if ever a man were disconcerted by division between compassion on the one hand and the very imbecility of irresolution on the other here the man was  lost he repeated looking down at the child  i am sure i am what is to be done  where do you live asked the child looking up at him wistfully  over there he answered pointing vaguely in the direction of his hotel  hadnt we better go there said the child  really he replied i dont know but what we had  so they set off handinhand  he through comparison of himself against his little companion with a clumsy feeling on him as if he had just developed into a foolish giant  she clearly elevated in her own tiny opinion by having got him so neatly out of his embarrassment  we are going to have dinner when we get there i suppose said polly  well he rejoined iyes i suppose we are  do you like your dinner asked the child  why on the whole said barbox brothers yes i think i do  i do mine said polly  have you any brothers and sisters  no  have you  mine are dead  oh said barbox brothers  with that absurd sense of unwieldiness of mind and body weighing him down he would have not known how to pursue the conversation beyond this curt rejoinder but that the child was always ready for him  what she asked turning her soft hand coaxingly in his are you going to do to amuse me after dinner  upon my soul polly exclaimed barbox brothers very much at a loss i have not the slightest idea  then i tell you what said polly  have you got any cards at your house  plenty said barbox brothers in a boastful vein  very well  then ill build houses and you shall look at me  you mustnt blow you know  oh no said barbox brothers  no no no  no blowing  blowings not fair  he flattered himself that he had said this pretty well for an idiotic monster but the child instantly perceiving the awkwardness of his attempt to adapt himself to her level utterly destroyed his hopeful opinion of himself by saying compassionately what a funny man you are  feeling after this melancholy failure as if he every minute grew bigger and heavier in person and weaker in mind barbox gave himself up for a bad job  no giant ever submitted more meekly to be led in triumph by all conquering jack than he to be bound in slavery to polly  do you know any stories she asked him  he was reduced to the humiliating confession no  what a dunce you must be mustnt you said polly  he was reduced to the humiliating confession yes  would you like me to teach you a story  but you must remember it you know and be able to tell it right to somebody else afterwards  he professed that it would afford him the highest mental gratification to be taught a story and that he would humbly endeavour to retain it in his mind  whereupon polly giving her hand a new little turn in his expressive of settling down for enjoyment commenced a long romance of which every relishing clause began with the words so this or and so this  as so this boy or so this fairy or and so this pie was four yards round and two yards and a quarter deep  the interest of the romance was derived from the intervention of this fairy to punish this boy for having a greedy appetite  to achieve which purpose this fairy made this pie and this boy ate and ate and ate and his cheeks swelled and swelled and swelled  there were many tributary circumstances but the forcible interest culminated in the total consumption of this pie and the bursting of this boy  truly he was a fine sight barbox brothers with serious attentive face and ear bent down much jostled on the pavements of the busy town but afraid of losing a single incident of the epic lest he should be examined in it byandby and found deficient  thus they arrived at the hotel  and there he had to say at the bar and said awkwardly enough i have found a little girl  the whole establishment turned out to look at the little girl  nobody knew her nobody could make out her name as she set it forthexcept one chambermaid who said it was constantinoplewhich it wasnt  i will dine with my young friend in a private room said barbox brothers to the hotel authorities and perhaps you will be so good as to let the police know that the pretty baby is here  i suppose she is sure to be inquired for soon if she has not been already  come along polly  perfectly at ease and peace polly came along but finding the stairs rather stiff work was carried up by barbox brothers  the dinner was a most transcendant success and the barbox sheepishness under pollys directions how to mince her meat for her and how to diffuse gravy over the plate with a liberal and equal hand was another fine sight  and now said polly while we are at dinner you be good and tell me that story i taught you  with the tremors of a civil service examination upon him and very uncertain indeed not only as to the epoch at which the pie appeared in history but also as to the measurements of that indispensable fact barbox brothers made a shaky beginning but under encouragement did very fairly  there was a want of breadth observable in his rendering of the cheeks as well as the appetite of the boy and there was a certain tameness in his fairy referable to an undercurrent of desire to account for her  still as the first lumbering performance of a goodhumoured monster it passed muster  i told you to be good said polly and you are good aint you  i hope so replied barbox brothers  such was his deference that polly elevated on a platform of sofa cushions in a chair at his right hand encouraged him with a pat or two on the face from the greasy bowl of her spoon and even with a gracious kiss  in getting on her feet upon her chair however to give him this last reward she toppled forward among the dishes and caused him to exclaim as he effected her rescue gracious angels  whew  i thought we were in the fire polly  what a coward you are aint you said polly when replaced  yes i am rather nervous he replied  whew  dont polly  dont flourish your spoon or youll go over sideways  dont tilt up your legs when you laugh polly or youll go over backwards  whew  polly polly polly said barbox brothers nearly succumbing to despair we are environed with dangers  indeed he could descry no security from the pitfalls that were yawning for polly but in proposing to her after dinner to sit upon a low stool  i will if you will said polly  so as peace of mind should go before all he begged the waiter to wheel aside the table bring a pack of cards a couple of footstools and a screen and close in polly and himself before the fire as it were in a snug room within the room then finest sight of all was barbox brothers on his footstool with a pint decanter on the rug contemplating polly as she built successfully and growing blue in the face with holding his breath lest he should blow the house down  how you stare dont you said polly in a houseless pause  detected in the ignoble fact he felt obliged to admit apologetically  i am afraid i was looking rather hard at you polly  why do you stare asked polly  i cannot he murmured to himself recall whyi dont know polly  you must be a simpleton to do things and not know why mustnt you said polly  in spite of which reproof he looked at the child again intently as she bent her head over her card structure her rich curls shading her face it is impossible he thought that i can ever have seen this pretty baby before  can i have dreamed of her  in some sorrowful dream  he could make nothing of it  so he went into the building trade as a journeyman under polly and they built three stories high four stories high even five  i say  who do you think is coming asked polly rubbing her eyes after tea  he guessed the waiter  no said polly the dustman  i am getting sleepy  a new embarrassment for barbox brothers  i dont think i am going to be fetched tonight said polly  what do you think  he thought not either  after another quarter of an hour the dustman not merely impending but actually arriving recourse was had to the constantinopolitan chambermaid who cheerily undertook that the child should sleep in a comfortable and wholesome room which she herself would share  and i know you will be careful wont you said barbox brothers as a new fear dawned upon him that she dont fall out of bed  polly found this so highly entertaining that she was under the necessity of clutching him round the neck with both arms as he sat on his footstool picking up the cards and rocking him to and fro with her dimpled chin on his shoulder  oh what a coward you are aint you said polly  do you fall out of bed  nnot generally polly  no more do i  with that polly gave him a reassuring hug or two to keep him going and then giving that confiding mite of a hand of hers to be swallowed up in the hand of the constantinopolitan chambermaid trotted off chattering without a vestige of anxiety  he looked after her had the screen removed and the table and chairs replaced and still looked after her  he paced the room for half an hour  a most engaging little creature but its not that  a most winning little voice but its not that  that has much to do with it but there is something more  how can it be that i seem to know this child  what was it she imperfectly recalled to me when i felt her touch in the street and looking down at her saw her looking up at me  mr jackson  with a start he turned towards the sound of the subdued voice and saw his answer standing at the door  oh mr jackson do not be severe with me  speak a word of encouragement to me i beseech you  you are pollys mother  yes  yes  polly herself might come to this one day  as you see what the rose was in its faded leaves as you see what the summer growth of the woods was in their wintry branches so polly might be traced one day in a careworn woman like this with her hair turned grey  before him were the ashes of a dead fire that had once burned bright  this was the woman he had loved  this was the woman he had lost  such had been the constancy of his imagination to her so had time spared her under its withholding that now seeing how roughly the inexorable hand had struck her his soul was filled with pity and amazement  he led her to a chair and stood leaning on a corner of the chimneypiece with his head resting on his hand and his face half averted  did you see me in the street and show me to your child he asked  yes  is the little creature then a party to deceit  i hope there is no deceit  i said to her we have lost our way and i must try to find mine by myself  go to that gentleman and tell him you are lost  you shall be fetched byandby  perhaps you have not thought how very young she is  she is very selfreliant  perhaps because she is so young  he asked after a short pause why did you do this  oh mr jackson do you ask me  in the hope that you might see something in my innocent child to soften your heart towards me  not only towards me but towards my husband  he suddenly turned about and walked to the opposite end of the room  he came back again with a slower step and resumed his former attitude saying  i thought you had emigrated to america  we did  but life went ill with us there and we came back  do you live in this town  yes  i am a daily teacher of music here  my husband is a bookkeeper  are youforgive my askingpoor  we earn enough for our wants  that is not our distress  my husband is very very ill of a lingering disorder  he will never recover  you check yourself  if it is for want of the encouraging word you spoke of take it from me  i cannot forget the old time beatrice  god bless you she replied with a burst of tears and gave him her trembling hand  compose yourself  i cannot be composed if you are not for to see you weep distresses me beyond expression  speak freely to me  trust me  she shaded her face with her veil and after a little while spoke calmly her voice had the ring of pollys  it is not that my husbands mind is at all impaired by his bodily suffering for i assure you that is not the case  but in his weakness and in his knowledge that he is incurably ill he cannot overcome the ascendancy of one idea  it preys upon him embitters every moment of his painful life and will shorten it  she stopping he said again speak freely to me  trust me  we have had five children before this darling and they all lie in their little graves  he believes that they have withered away under a curse and that it will blight this child like the rest  under what curse  both i and he have it on our conscience that we tried you very heavily and i do not know but that if i were as ill as he i might suffer in my mind as he does  this is the constant burdeni believe beatrice i was the only friend that mr jackson ever cared to make though i was so much his junior  the more influence he acquired in the business the higher he advanced me and i was alone in his private confidence  i came between him and you and i took you from him  we were both secret and the blow fell when he was wholly unprepared  the anguish it caused a man so compressed must have been terrible the wrath it awakened inappeasable  so a curse came to be invoked on our poor pretty little flowers and they fall  and you beatrice he asked when she had ceased to speak and there had been a silence afterwards how say you  until within these few weeks i was afraid of you and i believed that you would never never forgive  until within these few weeks he repeated  have you changed your opinion of me within these few weeks  yes  for what reason  i was getting some pieces of music in a shop in this town when to my terror you came in  as i veiled my face and stood in the dark end of the shop i heard you explain that you wanted a musical instrument for a bedridden girl  your voice and manner were so softened you showed such interest in its selection you took it away yourself with so much tenderness of care and pleasure that i knew you were a man with a most gentle heart  oh mr jackson mr jackson if you could have felt the refreshing rain of tears that followed for me  was phoebe playing at that moment on her distant couch  he seemed to hear her  i inquired in the shop where you lived but could get no information  as i had heard you say that you were going back by the next train but you did not say where i resolved to visit the station at about that time of day as often as i could between my lessons on the chance of seeing you again  i have been there very often but saw you no more until today you were meditating as you walked the street but the calm expression of your face emboldened me to send my child to you  and when i saw you bend your head to speak tenderly to her i prayed to god to forgive me for having ever brought a sorrow on it  i now pray to you to forgive me and to forgive my husband  i was very young he was young too and in the ignorant hardihood of such a time of life we dont know what we do to those who have undergone more discipline  you generous man  you good man  so to raise me up and make nothing of my crime against youfor he would not see her on her knees and soothed her as a kind father might have soothed an erring daughterthank you bless you thank you  when he next spoke it was after having drawn aside the window curtain and looked out awhile  then he only said  is polly asleep  yes  as i came in i met her going away upstairs and put her to bed myself  leave her with me for tomorrow beatrice and write me your address on this leaf of my pocketbook  in the evening i will bring her home to youand to her father      hallo cried polly putting her saucy sunny face in at the door next morning when breakfast was ready i thought i was fetched last night  so you were polly but i asked leave to keep you here for the day and to take you home in the evening  upon my word said polly  you are very cool aint you  however polly seemed to think it a good idea and added i suppose i must give you a kiss though you are cool  the kiss given and taken they sat down to breakfast in a highly conversational tone  of course you are going to amuse me said polly  oh of course said barbox brothers  in the pleasurable height of her anticipations polly found it indispensable to put down her piece of toast cross one of her little fat knees over the other and bring her little fat right hand down into her left hand with a businesslike slap  after this gathering of herself together polly by that time a mere heap of dimples asked in a wheedling manner  what are we going to do you dear old thing  why i was thinking said barbox brothers but are you fond of horses polly  ponies i am said polly especially when their tails are long  but horsesnnotoo big you know  well pursued barbox brothers in a spirit of grave mysterious confidence adapted to the importance of the consultation i did see yesterday polly on the walls pictures of two longtailed ponies speckled all over  no no no cried polly in an ecstatic desire to linger on the charming details  not speckled all over  speckled all over  which ponies jump through hoops  no no no cried polly as before  they never jump through hoops  yes they do  oh i assure you they do  and eat pie in pinafores  ponies eating pie in pinafores said polly  what a storyteller you are aint you  upon my honourand fire off guns  polly hardly seemed to see the force of the ponies resorting to fire arms  and i was thinking pursued the exemplary barbox that if you and i were to go to the circus where these ponies are it would do our constitutions good  does that mean amuse us inquired polly  what long words you do use dont you  apologetic for having wandered out of his depth he replied  that means amuse us  that is exactly what it means  there are many other wonders besides the ponies and we shall see them all  ladies and gentlemen in spangled dresses and elephants and lions and tigers  polly became observant of the teapot with a curledup nose indicating some uneasiness of mind  they never get out of course she remarked as a mere truism  the elephants and lions and tigers  oh dear no  oh dear no said polly  and of course nobodys afraid of the ponies shooting anybody  not the least in the world  no no not the least in the world said polly  i was also thinking proceeded barbox that if we were to look in at the toyshop to choose a doll  not dressed cried polly with a clap of her hands  no no no not dressed  fulldressed  together with a house and all things necessary for housekeeping  polly gave a little scream and seemed in danger of falling into a swoon of bliss  what a darling you are she languidly exclaimed leaning back in her chair  come and be hugged or i must come and hug you  this resplendent programme was carried into execution with the utmost rigour of the law  it being essential to make the purchase of the doll its first featureor that lady would have lost the poniesthe toyshop expedition took precedence  polly in the magic warehouse with a doll as large as herself under each arm and a neat assortment of some twenty more on view upon the counter did indeed present a spectacle of indecision not quite compatible with unalloyed happiness but the light cloud passed  the lovely specimen oftenest chosen oftenest rejected and finally abided by was of circassian descent possessing as much boldness of beauty as was reconcilable with extreme feebleness of mouth and combining a skyblue silk pelisse with rosecoloured satin trousers and a black velvet hat which this fair stranger to our northern shores would seem to have founded on the portraits of the late duchess of kent the name this distinguished foreigner brought with her from beneath the glowing skies of a sunny clime was on pollys authority miss melluka and the costly nature of her outfit as a housekeeper from the barbox coffers may be inferred from the two facts that her silver teaspoons were as large as her kitchen poker and that the proportions of her watch exceeded those of her fryingpan  miss melluka was graciously pleased to express her entire approbation of the circus and so was polly for the ponies were speckled and brought down nobody when they fired and the savagery of the wild beasts appeared to be mere smokewhich article in fact they did produce in large quantities from their insides  the barbox absorption in the general subject throughout the realisation of these delights was again a sight to see nor was it less worthy to behold at dinner when he drank to miss melluka tied stiff in a chair opposite to polly the fair circassian possessing an unbendable spine and even induced the waiter to assist in carrying out with due decorum the prevailing glorious idea  to wind up there came the agreeable fever of getting miss melluka and all her wardrobe and rich possessions into a fly with polly to be taken home  but by that time polly had become unable to look upon such accumulated joys with waking eyes and had withdrawn her consciousness into the wonderful paradise of a childs sleep  sleep polly sleep said barbox brothers as her head dropped on his shoulder you shall not fall out of this bed easily at any rate  what rustling piece of paper he took from his pocket and carefully folded into the bosom of pollys frock shall not be mentioned  he said nothing about it and nothing shall be said about it  they drove to a modest suburb of the great ingenious town and stopped at the forecourt of a small house  do not wake the child said barbox brothers softly to the driver i will carry her in as she is  greeting the light at the opened door which was held by pollys mother pollys bearer passed on with mother and child in to a groundfloor room there stretched on a sofa lay a sick man sorely wasted who covered his eyes with his emaciated hand  tresham said barbox in a kindly voice i have brought you back your polly fast asleep  give me your hand and tell me you are better  the sick man reached forth his right hand and bowed his head over the hand into which it was taken and kissed it  thank you thank you  i may say that i am well and happy  thats brave said barbox  tresham i have a fancycan you make room for me beside you here  he sat down on the sofa as he said the words cherishing the plump peachey cheek that lay uppermost on his shoulder  i have a fancy tresham i am getting quite an old fellow now you know and old fellows may take fancies into their heads sometimes to give up polly having found her to no one but you  will you take her from me  as the father held out his arms for the child each of the two men looked steadily at the other  she is very dear to you tresham  unutterably dear  god bless her  it is not much polly he continued turning his eyes upon her peaceful face as he apostrophized her it is not much polly for a blind and sinful man to invoke a blessing on something so far better than himself as a little child is but it would be muchmuch upon his cruel head and much upon his guilty soulif he could be so wicked as to invoke a curse  he had better have a millstone round his neck and be cast into the deepest sea  live and thrive my pretty baby  here he kissed her  live and prosper and become in time the mother of other little children like the angels who behold the fathers face  he kissed her again gave her up gently to both her parents and went out  but he went not to wales  no he never went to wales  he went straightway for another stroll about the town and he looked in upon the people at their work and at their play here there everythere and where not  for he was barbox brothers and co now and had taken thousands of partners into the solitary firm  he had at length got back to his hotel room and was standing before his fire refreshing himself with a glass of hot drink which he had stood upon the chimneypiece when he heard the town clocks striking and referring to his watch found the evening to have so slipped away that they were striking twelve  as he put up his watch again his eyes met those of his reflection in the chimneyglass  why its your birthday already he said smiling  you are looking very well  i wish you many happy returns of the day  he had never before bestowed that wish upon himself  by jupiter he discovered it alters the whole case of running away from ones birthday  its a thing to explain to phoebe  besides here is quite a long story to tell her that has sprung out of the road with no story ill go back instead of going on  ill go back by my friend lampss up x presently  he went back to mugby junction and in point of fact he established himself at mugby junction  it was the convenient place to live in for brightening phoebes life  it was the convenient place to live in for having her taught music by beatrice  it was the convenient place to live in for occasionally borrowing polly  it was the convenient place to live in for being joined at will to all sorts of agreeable places and persons  so he became settled there and his house standing in an elevated situation it is noteworthy of him in conclusion as polly herself might not irreverently have put it     there was an old barbox who lived on a hill    and if he aint gone he lives there still  here follows the substance of what was seen heard or otherwise picked up by the gentleman for nowhere in his careful study of the junction     chapter iiithe boy at mugby   i am the boy at mugby  thats about what i am  you dont know what i mean  what a pity  but i think you do  i think you must  look here  i am the boy at what is called the refreshment room at mugby junction and whats proudest boast is that it never yet refreshed a mortal being  up in a corner of the down refreshment room at mugby junction in the height of twentyseven cross draughts ive often counted em while they brush the firstclass hair twentyseven ways behind the bottles among the glasses bounded on the norwest by the beer stood pretty far to the right of a metallic object thats at times the teaurn and at times the souptureen according to the nature of the last twang imparted to its contents which are the same groundwork fended off from the traveller by a barrier of stale spongecakes erected atop of the counter and lastly exposed sideways to the glare of our mississ eyeyou ask a boy so sitiwated next time you stop in a hurry at mugby for anything to drink you take particular notice that hell try to seem not to hear you that hell appear in a absent manner to survey the line through a transparent medium composed of your head and body and that he wont serve you as long as you can possibly bear it  thats me  what a lark it is  we are the model establishment we are at mugby other refreshment rooms send their imperfect young ladies up to be finished off by our missis  for some of the young ladies when theyre new to the business come into it mild  ah  our missis she soon takes that out of em  why i originally come into the business meek myself but our missis she soon took that out of me  what a delightful lark it is  i look upon us refreshmenters as ockipying the only proudly independent footing on the line  theres papers for instancemy honourable friend if he will allow me to call him sohim as belongs to smiths bookstall  why he no more dares to be up to our refreshmenting games than he dares to jump a top of a locomotive with her steam at full pressure and cut away upon her alone driving himself at limitedmail speed  papers hed get his head punched at every compartment first second and third the whole length of a train if he was to ventur to imitate my demeanour  its the same with the porters the same with the guards the same with the ticket clerks the same the whole way up to the secretary trafficmanager or very chairman  there aint a one among em on the nobly independent footing we are  did you ever catch one of them when you wanted anything of him making a system of surveying the line through a transparent medium composed of your head and body  i should hope not  you should see our bandolining room at mugby junction  its led to by the door behind the counter which youll notice usually stands ajar and its the room where our missis and our young ladies bandolines their hair  you should see em at it betwixt trains bandolining away as if they was anointing themselves for the combat  when youre telegraphed you should see their noses all agoing up with scorn as if it was a part of the working of the same cooke and wheatstone electrical machinery  you should hear our missis give the word here comes the beast to be fed and then you should see em indignantly skipping across the line from the up to the down or wicer warsaw and begin to pitch the stale pastry into the plates and chuck the sawdust sangwiches under the glass covers and get out theha ha hathe sherryo my eye my eyefor your refreshment  its only in the isle of the brave and land of the free by which of course i mean to say britannia that refreshmenting is so effective so olesome so constitutional a check upon the public  there was a foreigner which having politely with his hat off beseeched our young ladies and our missis for a leetel gloss host prarndee and having had the line surveyed through him by all and no other acknowledgment was a proceeding at last to help himself as seems to be the custom in his own country when our missis with her hair almost acoming unbandolined with rage and her eyes omitting sparks flew at him cotched the decanter out of his hand and said put it down  i wont allow that the foreigner turned pale stepped back with his arms stretched out in front of him his hands clasped and his shoulders riz and exclaimed ah  is it possible this  that these disdaineous females and this ferocious old woman are placed here by the administration not only to empoison the voyagers but to affront them  great heaven  how arrives it  the english people  or is he then a slave  or idiot  another time a merry wideawake american gent had tried the sawdust and spit it out and had tried the sherry and spit that out and had tried in vain to sustain exhausted natur upon butterscotch and had been rather extra bandolined and linesurveyed through when as the bell was ringing and he paid our missis he says very loud and goodtempered i tell yew what tis maarm  i laaf  theer  i laaf  i dew  i oughter ha seen most things for i hail from the onlimited side of the atlantic ocean and i haive travelled right slick over the limited head on through jeerusalemm and the east and likeways france and italy europe old world and am now upon the track to the chief europian village but such an institution as yew and yewer young ladies and yewer fixins solid and liquid afore the glorious tarnal i never did see yet  and if i haint found the eighth wonder of monarchical creation in finding yew and yewer young ladies and yewer fixins solid and liquid all as aforesaid established in a country where the people air not absolute loo naticks i am extra double darned with a nip and frizzle to the innermostest grit  wheerfurtheeri laaf  i dew maarm  i laaf and so he went stamping and shaking his sides along the platform all the way to his own compartment  i think it was her standing up agin the foreigner as giv our missis the idea of going over to france and droring a comparison betwixt refreshmenting as followed among the frogeaters and refreshmenting as triumphant in the isle of the brave and land of the free by which of course i mean to say agin britannia  our young ladies miss whiff miss piff and mrs sniff was unanimous opposed to her going for as they says to our missis one and all it is well beknown to the hends of the herth as no other nation except britain has a idea of anythink but above all of business  why then should you tire yourself to prove what is already proved  our missis however being a teazer at all pints stood out grim obstinate and got a return pass by southeastern tidal to go right through if such should be her dispositions to marseilles  sniff is husband to mrs sniff and is a regular insignificant cove  he looks arter the sawdust department in a back room and is sometimes when we are very hard put to it let behind the counter with a corkscrew but never when it can be helped his demeanour towards the public being disgusting servile  how mrs sniff ever come so far to lower herself as to marry him i dont know but i suppose he does and i should think he wished he didnt for he leads a awful life  mrs sniff couldnt be much harder with him if he was public  similarly miss whiff and miss piff taking the tone of mrs sniff they shoulder sniff about when he is let in with a corkscrew and they whisk things out of his hands when in his servility he is agoing to let the public have em and they snap him up when in the crawling baseness of his spirit he is agoing to answer a public question and they drore more tears into his eyes than ever the mustard does which he all day long lays on to the sawdust  but it aint strong  once when sniff had the repulsiveness to reach across to get the milkpot to hand over for a baby i see our missis in her rage catch him by both his shoulders and spin him out into the bandolining room  but mrs sniffhow different  shes the one  shes the one as youll notice to be always looking another way from you when you look at her shes the one with the small waist buckled in tight in front and with the lace cuffs at her wrists which she puts on the edge of the counter before her and stands a smoothing while the public foams  this smoothing the cuffs and looking another way while the public foams is the last accomplishment taught to the young ladies as come to mugby to be finished by our missis and its always taught by mrs sniff  when our missis went away upon her journey mrs sniff was left in charge  she did hold the public in check most beautiful  in all my time i never see half so many cups of tea given without milk to people as wanted it with nor half so many cups of tea with milk given to people as wanted it without  when foaming ensued mrs sniff would say then youd better settle it among yourselves and change with one another  it was a most highly delicious lark  i enjoyed the refreshmenting business more than ever and was so glad i had took to it when young  our missis returned  it got circulated among the young ladies and it as it might be penetrated to me through the crevices of the bandolining room that she had orrors to reveal if revelations so contemptible could be dignified with the name  agitation become awakened  excitement was up in the stirrups  expectation stood atiptoe  at length it was put forth that on our slacked evening in the week and at our slackest time of that evening betwixt trains our missis would give her views of foreign refreshmenting in the bandolining room  it was arranged tasteful for the purpose  the bandolining table and glass was hid in a corner a armchair was elevated on a packingcase for our mississ ockypation a table and a tumbler of water no sherry in it thankee was placed beside it  two of the pupils the season being autumn and hollyhocks and dahlias being in ornamented the wall with three devices in those flowers  on one might be read may albion never learn on another keep the public down on another our refreshmenting charter  the whole had a beautiful appearance with which the beauty of the sentiments corresponded  on our mississ brow was wrote severity as she ascended the fatal platform  not that that was anythink new  miss whiff and miss piff sat at her feet  three chairs from the waiting room might have been perceived by a average eye in front of her on which the pupils was accommodated  behind them a very close observer might have discerned a boy  myself  where said our missis glancing gloomily around is sniff  i thought it better answered mrs sniff that he should not be let to come in  he is such an ass  no doubt assented our missis  but for that reason is it not desirable to improve his mind  oh nothing will ever improve him said mrs sniff  however pursued our missis call him in ezekiel  i called him in  the appearance of the lowminded cove was hailed with disapprobation from all sides on account of his having brought his corkscrew with him  he pleaded the force of habit  the force said mrs sniff  dont let us have you talking about force for gracious sake  there  do stand still where you are with your back against the wall  he is a smiling piece of vacancy and he smiled in the mean way in which he will even smile at the public if he gets a chance language can say no meaner of him and he stood upright near the door with the back of his head agin the wall as if he was a waiting for somebody to come and measure his heighth for the army  i should not enter ladies says our missis on the revolting disclosures i am about to make if it was not in the hope that they will cause you to be yet more implacable in the exercise of the power you wield in a constitutional country and yet more devoted to the constitutional motto which i see before meit was behind her but the words sounded better somay albion never learn  here the pupils as had made the motto admired it and cried hear  hear hear  sniff showing an inclination to join in chorus got himself frowned down by every brow  the baseness of the french pursued our missis as displayed in the fawning nature of their refreshmenting equals if not surpasses anythink as was ever heard of the baseness of the celebrated bonaparte  miss whiff miss piff and me we drored a heavy breath equal to saying we thought as much  miss whiff and miss piff seeming to object to my droring mine along with theirs i drored another to aggravate em  shall i be believed says our missis with flashing eyes when i tell you that no sooner had i set my foot upon that treacherous shore  here sniff either bursting out mad or thinking aloud says in a low voice feet  plural you know  the cowering that come upon him when he was spurned by all eyes added to his being beneath contempt was sufficient punishment for a cove so grovelling  in the midst of a silence rendered more impressive by the turnedup female noses with which it was pervaded our missis went on  shall i be believed when i tell you that no sooner had i landed this word with a killing look at sniff on that treacherous shore than i was ushered into a refreshment room where there werei do not exaggerateactually eatable things to eat  a groan burst from the ladies  i not only did myself the honour of jining but also of lengthening it out  where there were our missis added not only eatable things to eat but also drinkable things to drink  a murmur swelling almost into a scream ariz  miss piff trembling with indignation called out name  i will name said our missis  there was roast fowls hot and cold there was smoking roast veal surrounded with browned potatoes there was hot soup with again i ask shall i be credited nothing bitter in it and no flour to choke off the consumer there was a variety of cold dishes set off with jelly there was salad there wasmark me fresh pastry and that of a light construction there was a luscious show of fruit there was bottles and decanters of sound small wine of every size and adapted to every pocket the same odious statement will apply to brandy and these were set out upon the counter so that all could help themselves  our mississ lips so quivered that mrs sniff though scarcely less convulsed than she were got up and held the tumbler to them  this proceeds our missis was my first unconstitutional experience well would it have been if it had been my last and worst  but no  as i proceeded farther into that enslaved and ignorant land its aspect became more hideous  i need not explain to this assembly the ingredients and formation of the british refreshment sangwich  universal laughterexcept from sniff who as sangwichcutter shook his head in a state of the utmost dejection as he stood with it agin the wall  well said our missis with dilated nostrils  take a fresh crisp long crusty penny loaf made of the whitest and best flour  cut it longwise through the middle  insert a fair and nicely fitting slice of ham  tie a smart piece of ribbon round the middle of the whole to bind it together  add at one end a neat wrapper of clean white paper by which to hold it  and the universal french refreshment sangwich busts on your disgusted vision  a cry of shame from allexcept sniff which rubbed his stomach with a soothing hand  i need not said our missis explain to this assembly the usual formation and fitting of the british refreshment room  no no and laughter  sniff agin shaking his head in low spirits agin the wall  well said our missis what would you say to a general decoration of everythink to hangings sometimes elegant to easy velvet furniture to abundance of little tables to abundance of little seats to brisk bright waiters to great convenience to a pervading cleanliness and tastefulness positively addressing the public and making the beast thinking itself worth the pains  contemptuous fury on the part of all the ladies  mrs sniff looking as if she wanted somebody to hold her and everbody else looking as if theyd rayther not  three times said our missis working herself into a truly terrimenjious statethree times did i see these shameful things only between the coast and paris and not counting either at hazebroucke at arras at amiens  but worse remains  tell me what would you call a person who should propose in england that there should be kept say at our own model mugby junction pretty baskets each holding an assorted cold lunch and dessert for one each at a certain fixed price and each within a passengers power to take away to empty in the carriage at perfect leisure and to return at another station fifty or a hundred miles farther on  there was disagreement what such a person should be called  whether revolutionise atheist bright i said him or unenglish  miss piff screeched her shrill opinion last in the words a malignant maniac  i adopt says our missis the brand set upon such a person by the righteous indignation of my friend miss piff  a malignant maniac  know then that that malignant maniac has sprung from the congenial soil of france and that his malignant madness was in unchecked action on this same part of my journey  i noticed that sniff was arubbing his hands and that mrs sniff had got her eye upon him  but i did not take more particular notice owing to the excited state in which the young ladies was and to feeling myself called upon to keep it up with a howl  on my experience south of paris said our missis in a deep tone i will not expatiate  too loathsome were the task  but fancy this  fancy a guard coming round with the train at full speed to inquire how many for dinner  fancy his telegraphing forward the number of dinners  fancy every one expected and the table elegantly laid for the complete party fancy a charming dinner in a charming room and the headcook concerned for the honour of every dish superintending in his clean white jacket and cap  fancy the beast travelling six hundred miles on end very fast and with great punctuality yet being taught to expect all this to be done for it  a spirited chorus of the beast  i noticed that sniff was agin arubbing his stomach with a soothing hand and that he had drored up one leg  but agin i didnt take particular notice looking on myself as called upon to stimulate public feeling  it being a lark besides  putting everything together said our missis french refreshmenting comes to this and oh it comes to a nice total  first eatable things to eat and drinkable things to drink  a groan from the young ladies kep up by me  second convenience and even elegance  another groan from the young ladies kep up by me  third moderate charges  this time a groan from me kep up by the young ladies  fourthand here says our missis i claim your angriest sympathyattention common civility nay even politeness  me and the young ladies regularly raging mad all together  and i cannot in conclusion says our missis with her spitefullest sneer give you a completer pictur of that despicable nation after what i have related than assuring you that they wouldnt bear our constitutional ways and noble independence at mugby junction for a single month and that they would turn us to the rightabout and put another system in our places as soon as look at us perhaps sooner for i do not believe they have the good taste to care to look at us twice  the swelling tumult was arrested in its rise  sniff bore away by his servile disposition had drored up his leg with a higher and a higher relish and was now discovered to be waving his corkscrew over his head it was at this moment that mrs sniff who had kep her eye upon him like the fabled obelisk descended on her victim  our missis followed them both out and cries was heard in the sawdust department  you come into the down refreshment room at the junction making believe you dont know me and ill pint you out with my right thumb over my shoulder which is our missis and which is miss whiff and which is miss piff and which is mrs sniff  but you wont get a chance to see sniff because he disappeared that night  whether he perished tore to pieces i cannot say but his corkscrew alone remains to bear witness to the servility of his disposition
