countries on the globe the peculiarities which make it remarkable arise from the fact that it is almost perfectly level throughout and it lies so low a very large portion of it in fact lies below the level of the sea the waters being kept out as every body knows by immense dikes that have stood for ages  these dikes are so immense and they are so concealed by the houses and trees and mills and even villages that cover and disguise them that when the traveller first sees them he can hardly believe that they are dikes some of them are several hundred feet wide and have a good broad public road upon the top with a canal perhaps by the side of it and avenues of trees and roadside inns and immense wind mills on the other hand when riding or walking along upon such a dike on one side down a long slope they have a glimpse of water between the trees on the other at an equal distance you see a green expanse of country with gardens orchards fields of corn and grain and scattered farm houses extending far and wide at first you do not perceive that this beautiful country that you see spreading in every direction on one side of the road is below the level of the water that you see on the other side but on a careful comparison you find that it is so when the tide is high the difference is very great and were it not for the dikes the people would be inundated1  footnote 1 see frontispiece  indeed the dikes alone would not prevent the country from being inundated for it is not possible to make them perfectly tight and even if it were so the soil beneath them is more or less pervious to water and thus the water of the sea and of the rivers would slowly press its way through the lower strata and oozing up into the land beyond would soon make it all a swamp  then besides the interpercolation from the soil there is the rain in upland countries the surplus water that falls in rain flows off in brooks and rivers to the sea but in land that is below the level of the sea there can be no natural flow of either brooks or rivers the rain water therefore that falls on this low land would remain there stagnant except the comparatively small portion of it that would be evaporated by the sun and wind  thus you see that if the people of holland were to rely on the dikes alone to keep the land dry the country would become in a very short time one immense morass  to prevent this result it is necessary to adopt some plan to raise the water as fast as it accumulates in the low grounds and convey it away this is done by pumps and other such hydraulic engines and these are worked in general by wind mills  they might be worked by steam engines but steam engines are much more expensive than wind mills it not only costs much more to make them but the expense of working them from day to day is very great on account of the fuel which they require the necessary attendance on a steam engine too is very expensive there must be engineers with high pay to watch the engine and to keep it always in order and firemen to feed the fires and ashmen to carry away the ashes and cinders whereas a wind mill takes care of itself  the wind makes the wind mills go and the wind costs nothing it is true that the head of the mill must be changed from time to time so as to present the sails always in proper direction to the wind but even this is done by the wind itself there is a contrivance by which the mill is made to turn itself so as to face always in the right direction towards the wind and not only so but the mill is sometimes so constructed that if the wind blows too hard it takes in a part of the sails by its own spontaneous action and thus diminishes the strain which might otherwise be injurious to the machinery  now since the advantages of wind mills are so great over steam engines in respect especially to cheapness perhaps you will ask why steam is employed at all to turn machinery instead of always using the wind the reason is because the wind is so unsteady some days a wind mill will work and some days it will lie still and thus in regard to the time when it will do what is required of it no reliance can be placed upon it this is of very little consequence in the work of pumping up water from the sunken country in holland for if for several days the mills should not do their work no great harm would come of it since the amount of water which would accumulate in that time would not do any harm the ground might become more wet and the canals and reservoirs get fulljust as brooks and rivers do on any upland country after a long rain but then after the calm was over and the wind began to blow again the mills would all go industriously to work and the surplus water would soon be pumped up and discharged over the dikes into the sea again  thus the irregularity in the action of the wind mills in doing such work as this is of comparatively little consequence  but in the case of some other kinds of workas for example the driving of a cotton mill or any other great manufactory in which a large number of persons are employedit would be of the greatest possible consequence for when a calm time came and the wind mill would not work all the hands would be thrown out of employ they might sometimes remain idle thus a number of days at a time at a great expense to their employers or else at a great loss to themselves sometimes for example there might be a fine breeze in the morning and all the hands would go to the mill and begin their work in an hour the breeze might entirely die away and the spinners and weavers would all find their jennies and looms going slower and slower and finally stopping altogether and then perhaps two hours afterwards when they had all given up the days work and gone away to their respective homes the breeze would spring up again and the wind mill would go to work more industriously than ever  this would not answer at all for a cotton mill but it does very well for pumping up water from a great reservoir into which drains and canals discharge themselves to keep a country dry  and this reminds me of one great advantage which the people of holland enjoy on account of the low and level condition of their country and that is it is extremely easy to make canals there there are not only no mountains or rocks in the way to impede the digging of them but what is perhaps a still more important advantage there is no difficulty in filling them with water in other countries when a canal is to be made the very first question is how is it to be filled for this purpose the engineer explores the whole country through which the canal is to pass to find rivers and streams that he can turn into it when the bed of it shall have been excavated and sometimes he has to bring these supplies of water for a great distance in artificial channels which often cross valleys by means of great aqueducts built up to hold them sometimes a brook is in this way brought across a riverthe river itself not being high enough to feed the canal  the people of holland have no such difficulties as these to encounter in their canals the whole country being so nearly on a level with the sea they have nothing to do when they wish for a canal but to extend it in some part to the sea shore and then open a sluice way and let the water in  it is true that sometimes they have to provide means to prevent the ingress of too much water but this is very easily done  it is thus so easy to make canals in holland that the people have been making them for hundreds of years until now almost the whole country is intersected every where with canals as other countries are with roads almost all the traffic and until lately almost all the travel of the country has been upon the canals there are private canals too as well as public a farmer brings home his hay and grain from his fields by water and when he buys a new piece of land he makes a canal to it as a vermont farmer would make a road to a new pasture or wood lot that he had been buying  rollo wished very much to see all these thingsbut there was one question which it puzzled him very much to decide and that was whether he would rather go to holland in the summer or in the winter  i am not certain said he to his mother one day whether it would not be better for me to go in the winter  it is very cold there in the winter said his mother so i am told  that is the very thing said rollo they have such excellent skating on the canals i want to see the boats go on the canals and i want to see the skating and i dont know which i want to see most  yes said his mother i recollect to have often seen pictures of skating on the dutch canals  and i read when i was a boy continued rollo that the women skate to market in holland  rollo here observed that his mother was endeavoring to suppress a smile she seemed to try very hard but she could not succeed in keeping perfectly sober  what are you laughing at mother asked rollo  here mrs holiday could no longer restrain herself but laughed outright  is it about the dutch women skating to market asked rollo  i think they must look quite funny at any rate said mrs holiday  what mrs holiday was really laughing at was to hear rollo talk about when he was a boy but the fact was that rollo had now travelled about so much and taken care of himself in so many exigencies that he began to feel quite like a man and indeed i do not think it at all surprising that he felt so  which would you do mother said rollo if you were i would you rather go in the summer or in the winter  i would ask uncle george said mrs holiday  so rollo went to find his uncle george  rollo was at this time at morleys hotel in london and he expected to find his uncle george in what is called the coffee room the coffee room in morleys hotel is a very pleasant place it fronts on one side upon a very busy and brilliant street and on another upon a large open square adorned with monuments and fountains on the side towards the square is a bay window and near this bay window were two or three small tables with gentlemen sitting at them engaged in writing there were other tables along the sides of the room and at the other windows where gentlemen were taking breakfast mr george was at one of the tables near the bay window and was busy writing  rollo went to the place and standing by mr georges side he said in an under tone  uncle george  every body speaks in an under tone in an english coffee room they do this in order not to interrupt the conversation or the reading or the writing of other gentlemen that may be in the room  wait a moment said mr george till i finish this letter  so rollo turned to the bay window and looked out in order to amuse himself with what he might observe in the street till his uncle george should be ready to talk with him  he saw the fountains in the square and a great many children playing about the basins he saw a poor boy at a crossing brushing the pavement industriously with an old broom and then holding out his hand to the people passing by in hopes that some of them would give him a halfpenny he saw a policeman walking slowly up and down on the sidewalk wearing a glazed hat and a uniform of blue broadcloth with his letter and number embroidered on the collar he saw an elegant carriage drive by with a postilion riding upon one of the horses and two footmen in very splendid liveries behind there was a lady in the carriage but she appeared old and though she was splendidly dressed her face was very plain  i wonder said rollo to himself how much she would give of her riches and finery if she could be as young and as pretty as my cousin lucy  now rollo said mr george interrupting rollos reflections what is the question  why i want to know said rollo whether you think we had better go to holland in the winter or in the summer  is it left to you to decide asked mr george  why no said rollo not exactly but mother asked me to consider which i thought was best and so i want to know your opinion  very well said mr george go on and argue the case after i have heard it argued i will decide  rollo then proceeded to explain to his uncle the advantages respectively of going in the summer and in the winter after hearing him mr george thought it would be decidedly better to go in the summer  you see said he that the only advantage of going in the winter is to see the skating that is very important i know i should like to see the dutch women skating to market myself very much but then in the winter you could see very little of the canals and the wind mills and all the other hydraulic operations of the country every thing would be frozen up solid  father says that he cant go now very well continued rollo but that i may go with you if you would like to go  mr george was just in the act of sealing his letter as rollo spoke these words but he paused in the operation holding the stick of sealing wax in one hand and the letter in the other as if he was reflecting on what rollo had said  if we only had some one else to go with us said mr george  should not we two be enough asked rollo  why you see said mr george when we get into holland we shall not understand one word of the language  what language do they speak asked rollo  dutch said mr george and i do not know any dutch  not a word asked rollo  no said mr george not a word ah yes i know one word i know that dampschiff means steamboat damp i suppose means steam  then rollo laughed outright dampskiff he said was the funniest name for steamboat that he ever heard  now when we dont know a word of the language added mr george we cannot have any communication with the people of the country but shall be confined entirely to each other now do you think that you could get along with having nobody but me to talk to you for a whole fortnight  yes indeed said rollo but then uncle george he continued how are you going to get along at the hotels without knowing how to speak to the people at all  by signs and gestures said mr george laughing could not you make a sign for something to eat  o yes said rollo and he immediately began to make believe eat moving his hands as if he had a knife and fork in them  and what sign would you make for going to bed asked mr george  here rollo laid his head down to one side and placed his hand under it as if it were a pillow and then shut his eyes  that is the sign for going to bed said rollo a deaf and dumb boy taught it to me  i wish he had taught you some more signs said mr george or i wish we had a deaf and dumb boy here to go with us deaf and dumb people can get along excellently well where they do not understand the language because they know how to make so many signs  o we can make up the signs as we go along said rollo  yes said mr george i dont think that we shall have any great difficulty about that but then it would be pleasanter to go in a little larger party two people are apt to get tired of each other when there is nobody else that they can speak a single word to for a whole fortnight i dont think that i should get tired of you what i am afraid of is that you would get tired of me  there was a lurking smile on mr georges face as he said this  o uncle george said rollo that is only your politeness but then if you really think that we ought to have some more company perhaps the parkmans are going to holland and we might go with them  i would not make a journey with the parkmans said mr george if they would pay all my expenses and give me five sovereigns a day  why uncle george exclaimed rollo i thought you liked mr parkman very much  so i do said mr george it is his wife that i would not go with  o uncle george exclaimed rollo again  rollo was very much surprised at hearing this declaration and it was very natural that he should be surprised for mrs parkman was a young and beautiful lady and she was very kindhearted and very amiable in her disposition mr parkman too was very young he had been one of mr georges college classmates he had been married only a short time before he left america and he was now making his bridal tour  mr george thought that mrs parkman was very beautiful and very intelligent but he considered her a very uncomfortable travelling companion i think he judged her somewhat too harshly but this was one of mr georges faults he did not like the ladies very much and the faults which he observed in them from time to time he was prone to condemn much too harshly  illustration     chapter ii  a bad travelling companion   the reason why mr george did not like his friend mr parkmans young wife was not because of any want of natural attractiveness in her person or of amiableness in her dispositionfor she was beautiful accomplished and kindhearted but for all this from a want of consideration not uncommon among young ladies who are not much experienced in the world she was a very uncomfortable travelling companion  it is the duty of a gentleman who has a lady under his charge in making a journey to consult her wishes and to conform to them so far as it is possible in determining where to go and in making all the general arrangements of the journey but when these points are decided upon every thing in respect to the practical carrying into effect of the plans thus formed should be left to the gentleman as the executive officer of the party just as in respect to affairs relating to housekeeping or any thing else relating to a ladys department the lady should be left free to act according to her own judgment and taste in arranging details while in the general plans she conforms to the wishes of her husband for a lady when travelling to be continually making suggestions and proposals about the baggage or the conveyances and expressing dissatisfaction or wish for changes in this that or the other is as much a violation of propriety as it would be for the gentleman to go into the kitchen and there propose petty changes in respect to the mode of cooking the dinneror to stand by his wife at her work table and wish to have her thread changed from this place to thator to have some different stitch to be used in making a seam a lady very naturally feels disturbed if she finds that her husband does not have confidence enough in her to trust her with such details  i will make or mend for you whatever you may desire she might say and i will get for your dinner any thing that you ask for but in the way of doing it you ought to leave every thing to my direction it is better to let me have my own way even if your way is better than mine for in matters of direction there ought always to be only one head even if it is not a very good one  and in the same manner a gentleman might say when travelling with a lady  i will arrange the journey to suit your wishes as far as is practicable and will go at such times and by such conveyances as you may desire i will also at all the places where we stop take you to visit such objects of interest and curiosity as you wish to see but then when it comes to the details of the arrangements to be madethe orders to servants and commissioners the determination of the times for setting out and the bargains to be made with coachmen and innkeepersit is best to leave all those things to me for it always makes confusion to have two persons give directions at the same time  to say this would be right in both casesthere must always be one to command a great many families are kept in continual confusion by there being two or more ladies who consider themselves more or less at the head of itas for instance a wife and a sister or two sisters and a mother napoleon used to say that one bad general was better than two good ones so important is it in war to have unity of command it is not much less important in social life  mrs parkman did not understand this principle mr george had seen an example of her mode of management a day or two before in taking a walk with her and her husband in london they were going to see the tunnel under the thames which was three or four miles down the river from morleys hotel where they were all lodging  which way would you like to go asked mr parkman  is there more than one way asked his wife  yes said mr parkman we can take a hansom cab and drive down through the streets or we can walk down to the river side and there take a boat the boats are a great deal the cheapest and the most amusing but the cab will be the most easy and comfortable and the most genteel we shall have to walk nearly half a mile before we get to the landing of the boats  is there much difference in the price asked mrs parkman  not enough to be of any consequence replied her husband it will make a difference of about one and a half crown for by the boats it would be only two or three pence while by the cab it will be as many shillings but that is of no consequence we will go whichever way you think you would enjoy the most  you may decide for me said mrs parkman ill leave it entirely to you it makes no difference to me  then on the whole i think we will try the boat said mr parkman it will be so much more amusing and we shall see so much more of london life besides we shall often read and hear about the steamers on the thames when we return to america and it will be well for us to have made one voyage in them and mr george will you go with us  yes said mr george  so they all left the hotel together and commenced their walk towards the bridge where the nearest landing stage for the thames boats lay  they had not gone but a very short distance before mrs parkman began to hang rather heavily upon her husbands arm and asked him whether it was much farther that they would have to walk  o yes said mr parkman i told you that we should have to walk about half a mile  then we shall get all tired out said his wife and we want our strength for walking through the tunnel it does not seem to be worth while to take all this trouble just to save half a crown  mr parkman though he had only been married a little more than a month felt something like a sense of indignation rising in his breast that his wife should attribute to him such a motive for choosing the river after what he had said on the subject but he suppressed the feeling and only replied quietly  o let us take a cab then by all means i hope you dont suppose that i was going to take you by the boat to save any money  i thought you said that you would save half a crown rejoined his wife  yes said mr parkman i did it is true  mr parkman was too proud to defend himself from such an imputation supported by such reasoning as this so he only said we will go by a cab we will take a cab at the next stand  mr george instantly perceived that by this change in the plan he was made one too many for the party since only two can ride conveniently in a hansom cab2 so he said at once that he would adhere to the original plan and go by water  footnote 2 a hansom cab is made like an oldfashioned chaise only that it is set very low so that it is extremely easy to step in and out of it and the seat of the driver is high up behind the driver drives over the top of the chaise thus the view for the passengers riding inside is wholly unobstructed and this makes the hansom cab a very convenient and pleasant vehicle for two persons to ride in through the streets of a new and strange town  but first said he i will go with you to the stand and see you safe in a cab  so they turned into another street and presently they came to a stand there was a long row of cabs there of various kinds all waiting to be employed among them were several hansoms  mr parkman looked along the line to select one that had a good horse the distance was considerable that they had to go and besides mr parkman knew that his wife liked always to go fast so when he had selected the best looking horse he made a signal to the driver the driver immediately left the stand and drove over to the sidewalk where mr parkman and his party were waiting  mr parkman immediately opened the door of the cab to allow his wife to go in but she instead of entering began to look scrutinizingly into it and hung back  is this a nice cab said she it seems to me that i have seen nicer cabs than this  let us look she added and see if there is not a better one somewhere along the line  the cabman looking down from his exalted seat behind the vehicle said that there was not a nicer cab than his in london  o of course said mrs parkman they always say that but i can find a nicer one im sure somewhere in the line  so saying she began to move on mr parkman gave the cabman a silver sixpencewhich is equal to a new york shillingto compensate him for having been called off from his station and then followed his wife across the street to the side where the cabs were standing mrs parkman led the way all down the line examining each hack as she passed it but she did not find any one that looked as well as the first  illustration the hansom cab  after all said she we might as well go back and take the first one so she turned and began to retrace her stepsthe two gentlemen accompanying her but when they got back they found that the one which mr parkman had first selected was gone it had been taken by another customer  mr george was now entirely out of patience but he controlled himself sufficiently to suppress all outward manifestation of it only saying that he believed he would not wait any longer  i will go down to the river said he and take a boat and when you get a carriage you can go by land i will wait for you at the entrance to the tunnel  so he went away and as soon as he turned the corner of the street he snapped his fingers and nodded his head with the air of a man who has just made a very lucky escape  i thank my stars said he to himself that i have not got such a lady as that to take care of handsome as she is i would not have her for a travelling companion on any account whatever  it was from having witnessed several such exhibitions of character as this that mr george had expressed himself so strongly to rollo on the subject of joining mr parkman and his wife in making the tour of holland  but notwithstanding mr georges determination that he would not travel in company with such a lady it seemed to be decreed that he should do so for he left london about a week after this to go to holland with rollo alone and though he postponed setting out for several days so as to allow mr and mrs parkman time to get well under way before them he happened to fall in with them several times in the course of the journey the first time that he met with them was in crossing the straits of dover  there are several ways by which a person may go to holland from london the cheapest is to take a steamer by which means you go down the thames and thence pass directly across the german ocean to the coast of holland but that makes quite a little voyage by sea during which almost all persons are subject to a very disagreeable kind of sickness on account of the small size of the steamers and the short tossing motion of the sea that almost always prevails in the waters that lie around great britain  so mr george and rollo who neither of them liked to be seasick determined to go another way they concluded to go down by railway to dover and then to go to calais across the strait where the passage is the shortest mr and mrs parkman had set off several days before them and mr george supposed that by this time they were far on their way towards holland but they had been delayed by mrs parkmans desire to go to brighton which is a great watering place on the coast not far from dover there mr and mrs parkman had spent several days and it so happened that in going from brighton to dover they met at the junction the train that was bringing mr george and rollo down from london and thus though both parties were unconscious of the fact they were travelling along towards dover after leaving the junction in the same train and when they stepped out of the carriages upon the dover platform there they were all together  mr parkman and mr george were very glad to see each other and while they were shaking hands with each other and making mutual explanations mrs parkman went to the door of the station to see what sort of a place dover was  she saw some long piers extending out into the water and a great many ships and steamers lying near them the town lay along the shore surrounding an inner harbor enclosed by the walls of the piers behind the town were high cliffs and an elevated plain above on which a great number of tents were pitched it was the encampment of an army a little way along the shore a vast promontory was seen crowned by an ancient and venerable looking castle and terminated by a range of lofty and perpendicular cliffs of chalk towards the sea  what a romantic place said mrs parkman to herself it is just such a place as i like ill make william stay here today  just then she heard her husbands voice calling to her  louise  she turned and saw her husband beckoning to her he was standing with mr george and rollo near the luggage van as they call it in england while the railway porters were taking out the luggage  mrs parkman walked towards the place  they say louise said mr parkman that it is time for us to go on board the boat she is going to sail immediately  ah but william said mrs parkman let us stay here a little while dover is such a romantic looking place  very well said mr parkman we will stay if you like are you going to stay mr george  yes said mr george rollo and i were going to stay till this afternoon there is a boat to cross at four oclock  it was about eleven oclock in the morning when this conversation occurred the porter stood by all the time with mr parkmans two trunks in his charge waiting to have it decided when they were to go  i should think sir said the porter that as you have a lady with you you would find this boat better this is a tidal steamer but the four oclock is the mail boat and it will be pretty rough this afternoon there is a breeze coming up  o never mind the breeze said mrs parkman we are used to it porter weve crossed the atlantic  very well said mr parkman we will wait until four oclock  then ill put the luggage in the luggage room said the porter and take it to the boat at half past three thats the way to the hotel he added pointing the way  there are several very nice hotels in dover but the one which the porter referred to is one of the finest and most beautifully situated hotels in europe it is a large and handsome edifice built in modern style and it stands close to the railroad station on a point of land overlooking the sea the coffee room which unlike other english coffee rooms is used by both ladies and gentlemen is a very spacious and splendidly decorated apartment with large windows on three sides of it overlooking the sea and the neighboring coasts each sash of these windows is glazed with one single pane of plate glass so that whether they are shut or open there is nothing to intercept the view the room is furnished with a great number of tables each large enough to accommodate parties of four or six and all except two or three in different parts of the room that are reserved for reading and writing are covered with neat white table cloths and other preparations more or less advanced for breakfasts or dinners that may have been ordered while at almost all times of the day a greater or less number of them are occupied by parties of tourists their bags and baskets lying on the neighboring chairs  it was into this room so occupied that our travellers were ushered as they walked from the station into the hotel  mrs parkman walked forward and took her seat near a window the gentlemen attended her  what a magnificent view said she  the view was indeed magnificent across the water was to be seen the coast of france lying like a low cloud close to the horizon ships and steamers and fish boats and every other sort of craft were seen plying to and fro over the watersome going out others coming in through one of the windows in the end of the room mrs parkman could see the castle crowning its bold and lofty promontory and the perpendicular cliffs of chalk with the sea beating against the base of them below through the opposite window which of course was at the other end of the room the view extended down the coast for a great distance showing point after point and headland after headland in dim perspectivewith a long line of surf rolling incessantly upon the beach which seemed in that direction interminable  after looking for some time at the view from the windows mrs parkman turned to observe the company in the room and to watch the several parties of new comers as they successively entered she wished to see if there were any young brides among them while she was thus engaged her husband selected a table that was vacant and ordered breakfast mr george and rollo did the same at another table near  while mr george and rollo were at the table drinking their coffee mr george asked rollo what he supposed the porter meant by saying that the eleven oclock boat was a tidal boat  i know said rollo i read it in the guide book the tidal steamers go at high tide or nearly high tide and if you go in them you embark from the pier on one side and you land at the pier on the other but the mail steamers go at a regular hour every day and then when it happens to be low tide they cannot get to the pier and the passengers have to land in small boats that is what the porter meant when he said that it would not be pleasant for a lady to go in the mail steamer it is very unpleasant for ladies to be landed in small boats when the weather is rough  i dont believe that mrs parkman understood it said mr george  nor i either said rollo  i presume she thought added mr george that when the porter spoke about the rough sea he only referred to the motion of the steamer in going over  yes said rollo but what he really meant was that it would be bad for her to get down from the steamer into the small boat at the landing i am afraid that she will not like it though i think that it will be real good fun  very likely it will be fun for you said mr george  i would a great deal rather go across in a mail steamer at low tide than in any other way said rollo  illustration     chapter iii  the mail steamer   rollos explanation in respect to the mail steamer was correct as has before been stated in some one or other of the volumes of this series the northern coast of france is low and the shore is shelving for almost the whole extent of it and there are scarcely any good harbors immense sandy beaches extend along the coast sloping so gradually outward that when the tide goes down the sands are left bare for miles and miles towards the sea the only way by which harbors can be made on such a shore is to find some place where a creek or small river flows into the sea and then walling in the channel at the mouth of the creek so as to prevent it being choked up by sand in this way a passage is secured by which when the tide is high pretty good sized vessels can get in but after all that they can do in such a case they cannot make a harbor which can be entered at low tide when the tide is out nothing is left between the two piers which form the borders of the channel but muddy flats with a small sluggish stream scarcely deep enough to float a jolly boat slowly meandering in the midst of them towards the sea  the harbor of california is such a harbor as this accordingly in case a steamer arrives there when the tide is down there is no other way but for her to anchor in the offing until it rises again and the passengers if they wish to go ashore must clamber down the side of the vessel into a small boat and be pulled ashore by the oarsmen in smooth weather this is very easily done but in rough weather when both steamer and boat are pitching and tossing violently up and down upon the waves it is not very easy or agreeable especially for timid ladies  after finishing their breakfast mr george and rollo went out and they rambled about the town until the time drew near for the sailing of the boat then they went to the station for the luggage and having engaged a porter to take it to the boat they followed him down to the pier till they came to the place where the boat was lying after seeing the trunk put on board they went on board themselves a short time afterwards mr and mrs parkman came  the steamer like all the others which ply between the coasts of france and england was quite small and the passengers were very few there were only four or five ladies and not far from the same number of gentlemen as the passage was only expected to occupy about two hours the passengers did not go below but arranged themselves on seats upon the decksome along the sides of the deck by the bulwarks and some near the centre around a sort of house built over the passage way which led down into the cabin  soon after mr and mrs parkman came on board mr parkman said to his wife  now louise my dear you will be less likely to be sick if you get some good place where you can take a reclining posture and so remain pretty still until we get over  o i shall not be sick said she i am not at all afraid  so she began walking about the deck with an unconcerned and careless air as if she had been an old sailor  pretty soon mr george saw two other ladies coming with their husbands over the plank the countenances of these ladies were very pleasing and there was a quiet gentleness in their air and manner which impressed mr george very strongly in their favor  as soon as they reached the deck and while their husbands were attending to the disposal of the luggage they began to look for seats  we will get into the most comfortable position we can said one of them and keep still till we get nearly across  yes said the other that will be the safest  so they chose good seats near the companion way and sat down there and their husbands brought them carpet bags to put their feet upon  in about fifteen minutes after this the steamer put off from the pier and commenced her voyage she very soon began to rise and fall over the waves with a short uneasy motion which was very disagreeable the passengers however all remained still in the places which they had severally chosensome reading others lying quiet with their eyes closed as if they were trying to go to sleep  mr parkman himself tried to do this but his wife would not leave him in peace she came to him continually to inquire about this or that or to ask him to look at some vessel that was coming in sight or at some view on the shore all this time the wind and the consequent motion of the steamer increased scudding clouds were seen flitting across the sky from which there descended now and then misty showers of rain these clouds gradually became more frequent and more dense until at length the whole eastern sky was involved in one dense mass of threatening vapor  it began to grow dark too the specified time for sailing was four oclock but there was a delay for the mails and it was full half past four before the steamer had left the pier and now before she began to draw near the french coast it was nearly half past six at length the coast began slowly to appear its outline was dimly discerned among the misty clouds  long before this time however mrs parkman had become quite sick she first began to feel dizzy and then she turned pale and finally she came and sat down by her husband and leaned her head upon his shoulder  she had been sitting in this posture for nearly half an hour when at length she seemed to feel better and she raised her head again  are we not nearly there said she  yes said her husband the lighthouse is right ahead and the ends of the piers in ten minutes more we shall be going in between them and then all the trouble will be over  rollo and mr george were at this time near the bows they had gone there to look forward in order to get as early a glimpse as possible of the boats that they knew were to be expected to come out from the pier as soon as the steamer should draw nigh  here they come said rollo at length  yes said mr george i see them  it was so nearly dark that the boats could not be seen distinctly indeed there was not much to be discerned but a black moving mass slowly coming out from under the walls of the pier  the steamer had now nearly reached the ground where she was to anchor and so the seamen on the forecastle took in the foresail which had been spread during the voyage and the helmsman put down the helm the head of the steamer then slowly came round till it pointed in a direction parallel to the shore this carried the boats and the pier somewhat out of view from the place where mr george and rollo had been standing  now we can see them better aft said rollo  yes said mr george and they will board us aft too so we had better be there ready  accordingly mr george and rollo went aft again and approached the gangway on the side where they supposed the boats would come  in going there they passed round first on the other side of the entrance to the cabin where the two ladies were sitting that have already been described as they went by one of the gentlemen came to them and said  keep up your courage a few minutes longer we are very near the pier in ten minutes we shall be in smooth water and all will be over  the ladies seemed much relieved and rejoiced to hear this and then the gentleman went with mr george and rollo towards the gangway in order that they might make further observations he was joined there a moment afterwards by his companion now these gentlemen as it happened knew nothing about the plan of landing in boats they had made no particular inquiry at dover in respect to the steamer that they had come in but took it for granted that she would go into the harbor as usual and land the passengers at the pier their attention had just been attracted to the singular movement of the steamer when rollo and mr george came up  what said one of them speaking with a tone of surprise and looking about eagerly over the water we are coming to mr waldo what can that mean  just then the little fleet of boats six or seven in number began to come into view from where the gentlemen stood they were dimly seen at a distance and looked like long black animals slowly advancing over the dark surface of the water and struggling fearfully with the waves  what boats can those be said mr waldo beginning to look a little alarmed  he was alarmed not for himself but for his wife who was very frail and delicate in health and ill fitted to bear any unusual exposure  i am sure i cannot imagine replied the other  it looks marvellously as if they were coming out for us said mr waldo  can it be possible mr albert that we are to land in boats such a night as this continued he  it looks like it replied the other yes they are really coming here  the boats were now seen evidently advancing towards the steamer they came on in a line struggling fearfully with the waves  they look like spectres of boats said mr george to rollo  mr albert now went round to the other side of the companion way to the place where the two ladies were sitting  ladies said he i am very sorry to say that we shall be obliged to land in boats  in boats said the ladies surprised  yes said mr albert the tide is out and i suppose we cannot go into port the steamer has come to and the boats are coming alongside  the ladies looked out over the dark and stormy water with an emotion of fear but they did not say a word  there is no help for it continued the gentleman and you have nothing to do but to resign yourselves passively to whatever comes if we had known that this steamer would not go into port we would not have come in her but now that we are here we must go through  very well said the ladies let us know when the boat for us is ready  mr albert then returned to the gangway where rollo and mr george were standing the foremost boat had come alongside and the seamen were throwing the mail bags into it when the mails were all safely stowed in the boat some of the passengers that stood near by were called upon to follow mr george and rollo being near were among those thus called upon  wait a moment said mr george to rollo in a low tone let a few of the others go first that we may see how they manage it  it proved to be rather difficult to manage it for both the steamer and the boat were rocking and tossing violently on the waves and as their respective motions did not at all correspond they thumped against each other continually as the boat rose and fell up and down the side of the steamer in a fearful manner it was dark too and the wind was blowing fresh which added to the frightfulness of the scene  a crowd of people stood about the gangway some of these people were passengers waiting to go down and others officers of the ship to help them the seamen in the boat below were all on the alert too some employed in keeping the boat off from the side of the ship in order to prevent her being stove or swamped while others stood on each side of the place where the passengers were to descend with uplifted arms ready to seize and hold them when they came down  there was a little flight of steps hanging down the side of the steamer with ropes on each side of it in lieu of a balustrade the passenger who was to embark was directed to turn round and begin to go down these steps backward and then when the sea lifted the boat so that the seamen on board could seize hold of him they all cried out vociferously let go and at the same moment a strong sailor grasped him around the waist brought him down into the bottom of the boat in a very safe though extremely unceremonious manner  after several gentlemen and one lady had thus been put into the boat amid a great deal of calling and shouting and many exclamations of surprise and terror the officer at the gangway turned to mr george saying  come sir  there was no time to stop to talk so mr george stepped forward saying to rollo as he went come right on directly after me and in a moment more he was seized by the man and whirled down into the boat he scarcely knew how immediately after he was in there came some unusually heavy seas and the steamer and the boat thumped together so violently that all the efforts of the seamen seemed to be required to keep them apart  push off said the officer  here stop i want to go first exclaimed rollo  no more in this boat said the officer push off  never mind said rollo calling out to mr george ill come by and by  all right said mr george  by this time the boat had got clear of the steamer and she now began to move slowly onward rising and falling on the waves and struggling violently to make her way  i am glad they did not let me go said rollo i would rather stay and see the rest go first  another boat was now seen approaching and rollo stepped back a little to make way for the people that were to go in it when he heard mrs parkmans voice in tones of great anxiety and terror saying to her husband  i cannot go ashore in a boat in that way william i cannot possibly and i will not  why louise said her husband what else can we do  ill wait till the steamer goes into port if i have to wait till midnight replied mrs parkman positively it is a shame such disgraceful management could not they find out how the tide would be here before they left dover  yes replied mr parkman of course they knew perfectly well how the tide would be  then why did not they leave at such an hour as to make it right for landing here  there are boats every day said mr parkman which leave at the right time for that and most passengers take them but the mails must come across at regular hours whether the tide serves or not and boats must come to bring the mails and they of course allow passengers to come in these boats too if they choose we surely cannot complain of that  then they ought to have told us how it was said mrs parkman i think it is a shameful deception to bring us over in this way and not let us know any thing about it  but they did tell us said mr parkman do not you recollect that the porter at the station told us that this was a mail boat and that it would not be pleasant for a lady  but i did not know persisted mrs parkman that he meant that we should have to land in this way he did not tell us any thing about that  he told us that it was a mail boat and he meant by that to tell us that we could not land at the pier it is true we did not understand him fully but that is because we come from a great distance and do not understand the customs of the country that is our misfortune it was not the porters fault  i dont think so at all said mrs parkman and you always take part against me in such things and i think it is really unkind  all this conversation went on in an under tone but though there was a great deal of noise and confusion on every side rollo could hear it all while he was listening to itor rather while he was hearing it for he took no pains to listenthe gentleman who had been talking with mr waldo and whom the latter had called mr albert went round to the two ladies who were waiting to be called and said  now ladies the boat is ready follow me say nothing but do just as you are told and all will go well  illustration landing from the mail boat  so the ladies came one after the other in among the crowd that gathered around the gangway and there before they could bring their faculties at all to comprehend any thing distinctly amid the bewildering confusion of the scene they found their bags and shawls taken away from them and they themselves turned round and gently forced to back down the steps of the ladder over the boiling surges when in a moment more amid loud shouts of let go they were seized by the sailors in the boat and down they went they knew not how for a distance of many feet into the stern of the boat where they suddenly found themselves seated while the boat itself was rocking violently to and fro and thumping against the side of the steamer in a frightful manner  the officer who had charge of the debarkation on the deck of the steamer above immediately called to mrs parkman  come madam said he  no said she i cant possibly go ashore in that way  then you will have to stay on board all night  well id rather stay on board all night said she  and you will have to go back to dover madam continued the officer speaking in a very stern and hurried manner for the steamer is not going into the pier at all  then immediately turning to rollo he said come young man  so rollo marched up to the gangway and was in a moment whirled down into the boat as the others had been immediately afterwards the boat pushed off and the sailors began to row leaving mr and mrs parkman on board the steamer how they were to get to the shore rollo did not know  rollo began to look about over the water it had become almost entirely dark and though the moon which was full had as it happened broken out through the clouds a short time before when they were getting into the boats she had now become obscured again and every thing seemed enveloped in deep gloom still rollo could see at a short distance before him the other boats slowly making their way over the wild and stormy water he could also see the ends of the piers dimly defined in the misty air and the tall lighthouse beyond with a bright light burning in the lantern at the top of it  we shall only be a few minutes now said one of the gentlemen it is not far to the piers  the boat went on pitching and tossing over the waves with her head towards the piers the pilot who steered the boat called out continually to the oarsmen and the oarsmen shouted back to him but nobody could understand such sailor language as they used at length on looking forward again rollo saw that the boats before him instead of going on in a line towards the land were slowly scattering in all directions and that their own boat instead of heading towards the pier as at first gradually turned round and seemed to be going along in a direction parallel to the coast as the steamer had done  what exclaimed mr albert on observing this we are not going towards the piers where can we be going  the other gentleman shook his head and said he did not know  the ladies remained quietly in their places there was evidently nothing for them to do and so they concluded very sensibly to do nothing  the boat slowly turned her head round all the time pitching and tossing violently on the billows until finally she was directed almost towards the steamer again  what can be the matter asked one of the gentlemen addressing the other we are not heading towards the shore then turning towards the pilot he said to him  what is the matter why cannot we go in  the pilot who spoke english very imperfectly answered it is a bar the water is not enough  there is a bar said the gentleman outside the entrance to the harbor and the water is not deep enough even for these boats to go over we can see it  rollo and the others looked in the direction where the gentleman pointed and he could see a long white line formed by the breakers on the bar extending each way as far as the eye could reach along the shore beyond were to be dimly seen the heads of the piers and a low line of the coast on either hand with the lighthouse beyond towering high into the air and a bright and steady light beaming from the summit of it  i hope the tide is not going down said the gentleman for in that case we may have to wait here half the night  is the tide going down or coming up he said turning again to the pilot  it will come up the tide will come up answered the pilot  what does he say asked one of the ladies in a whisper  he says that the tide will come up replied the gentleman whether he means it is coming up now or that it will come up some time or other i do not know we have nothing to do but to remain quiet and await the result  the clouds had been for some time growing darker and darker and now it began to rain so the gentlemen took out their umbrellas and spread them and the party huddled together in the bottom of the boat and sheltered themselves there as well as they could from the wind and rain they invited rollo to come under the umbrellas too but he said that the rain would not hurt his cap and he preferred to sit where he could look out and see what they would do  very well said one of the gentlemen tell us from time to time how we get along  so rollo watched the manoeuvring of the boat and reported from time to time the progress that she was making it was not very easy for him to make himself heard on account of the noise of the winds and waves and the continual vociferations of the pilot and the seamen  we are headed now said he right away from the shore we are pointed towards the steamer i can just see her working up and down in the offing  now the men are backing water he continued we are going stern foremost towards the bar i believe they are going to try to back her over  the boat now rapidly approached the line of breakers moving stern foremost the roar of the surf sounded nearer and nearer at length the ladies and gentlemen under the umbrellas looked out and they saw themselves in the midst of rolling billows of foam on which the boat rose and fell like a bubble presently they could feel her thump upon the bottom the next wave lifted her up and carried her towards the shore and then subsiding brought her down again with another thump upon the sand the pilot shouted out new orders to the seamen they immediately began to pull forward with their oars he had found that the water was yet too shallow on the bar and that it would be impossible to pass over so the sailors were pulling the boat out to sea again  the ladies were of course somewhat alarmed while the boat was thumping on the bar and the boiling surges were roaring so frightfully around them but they said nothing they knew that they had nothing to do and so they remained quiet  we are clear of the bar now said rollo continuing his report i can see the breakers in a long line before us but we are clear of them now the sailors are getting out the anchor i can see a number of the other boats that are at anchor already  the anchor or rather the grapnel which served as an anchor was now thrown overboard and the boat came to head to the wind there she lay pitching and tossing very uneasily on the sea the other boats were seen lying in similar situations at different distances one was very near so near that instead of anchoring herself the seamen threw a rope from her on board the boat where rollo was and so held on by her instead of anchoring herself in this situation the whole fleet of boats remained for nearly an hour rollo kept a good lookout all the time watching for the first indications of any attempt to move  at length he heard a fresh command given by the pilot in language that he could not understand but the sailors at the bows immediately began to take in the anchor  they are raising the anchor said he now we are going to try it again there is one boat gone already she is just coming to the bar she is now just in the breakers i can see the white foam all around her she is going in now she is over i can see the whole line of foam this side of her our boat will be there very soon  in a very few minutes more the boat entered the surf and soon began to thump as before at every rise and fall of the seas but as each successive wave came up she was lifted and carried farther over the bar and at last came to deep water on the other side  it is all over now said one of the gentlemen and besides it has stopped raining so he rose from his place and shut the umbrella the ladies looked around and to their great joy saw that they were just entering between the ends of the piers the passage way was not very wide and the piers rose like high walls on each side of it but the water was calm and smooth within and the boats glided along one after another in a row in a very calm and peaceful manner at length they reached the landing stairs which were built curiously within the pier among the piles and timbers and there they all safely disembarked  on reaching the top of the stairs rollo found mr george waiting for him  uncle george said rollo here i am  have you had a good time asked mr george  yes said rollo excellent  and what became of mr and mrs parkman  i dont know said rollo i left them on board the steamer she declared that she would not come in a small boat  you and i said mr george will go off tomorrow morning by the first train and go straight to holland as fast as we can so as to get out of their way  well said rollo though i dont care much about it either way  mr george however carried his plan into effect the next day they went to antwerp and on the day following they crossed the belgian frontier and entered holland  illustration     chapter iv  entering holland   rollo and mr george went into holland by the railway it was a long time before rollo learned that in travelling from one european country to another he was not to expect any visible line of demarcation to show the frontier boys at school in studying the shape and conformation of different countries on the map and seeing them marked by distinct colored boundaries are very apt to imagine that they will see something when travelling from one country to another to show them by visible signs when they pass the frontier  but there is nothing of the kind the green fields the groves the farmhouse the succession of villages continues unchanged as you travel so that as you whirl along in the railway carriage there is nothing to warn you of the change except the custom house stations where the passports of travellers are called for and the baggage is examined  uncle george said rollo after looking out of the window at a place where the train stopped twenty or thirty miles from antwerp i think we are coming to the frontier  why so asked mr george  because the belgian custom house is at this station and the next will be the dutch custom house  rollo knew that this was the belgian custom house by seeing the word douane over one of the doors of the station and under it the words visite des bagages which means examination of baggage there were besides a great many soldiers standing about which was another indication  how do you know that it is the belgian custom house asked mr george  because all these soldiers are in the belgian uniform said he i know the belgian uniform i dont know the dutch uniform but i suppose i shall see it at the next station  rollo was perfectly right in his calculations the last station on the line of the railway in belgium was the frontier station for belgium and here travellers coming from holland were called upon to show their passports and to have their baggage examined in the same manner the first station beyond which was the first one in holland was the frontier station for that country and there passengers going from belgium into holland were stopped and examined in the same way  after going on a few miles from the belgium station the whistle blew and the train began to stop  here we are said rollo  yes said mr george and now comes the time of trial for the musical box  rollo had bought a musical box at antwerp and he had some fears lest he might be obliged to pay a duty upon it in going into holland mr george had told him that he thought there was some danger but rollo concluded that he would take the risk  they have no business to make me pay duty upon it said he to mr george  why not asked mr george  because it is not for merchandise said rollo it is not for sale i have bought it for my own use alone  that has nothing to do with it said mr george  yes it has a great deal to do with it replied rollo  there might have been quite a spirited discussion between mr george and rollo on this old and knotty question over which tourists in europe are continually stumbling had not the train stopped the moment that the motion ceased the doors of all the carriages were opened and a man passed along the line calling out in french  gentlemen and ladies will all descend here for the examination of passports and baggage  mr george and rollo had no baggage except a valise which they carried with them in the carriage mr george took this valise up and stepped down upon the platform  now rollo said mr george if they find your musical box and charge duty upon it pay it like a man  yes said rollo i will  and dont get up a quarrel with the custom house officer on the subject continued mr george for he has the whole military force of the kingdom of holland at his command and what he says is to be done in this territory must be done  so saying mr george valise in hand followed the crowd of passengers through a door over which was inscribed the dutch word for baggage in the centre of this room there was a sort of low counter enclosing a sort of oblong square within the square were a number of custom house officers ready to examine the baggage which the porters and the passengers were bringing in and laying upon the counter all around the four sides of the square  mr george brought up his valise and placed it on the counter a custom house officer who had just examined and marked some other parcels turned to mr georges just as he had unlocked and opened it  have you any thing to declare said the officer  nothing sir said mr george  the officer immediately shut the valise and marked it on the back with a piece of chalk and mr george locked it and took it away  are you through asked rollo  yes said mr george  mr george then took the valise and followed a crowd of passengers who were going through a door at the end of the room opposite to where they came in there was an officer in uniform on each side of this door these officers examined every bag valise or parcel that the passengers had in their hands to see if they had been marked by the examiners and as fast as they found that they were marked they let them pass  following this company mr george and rollo came soon to another small room where a man was sitting behind a desk examining the passports of the passengers and stamping them mr george waited a moment until it came his turn and then handed his passport too the officer looked at it and then stamped an impression from a sort of seal on one corner of it he also wrote mr georges and rollos name in a big book copying them for this purpose from the passport  he then handed the passport back again and mr george and rollo went out passing by a soldier who guarded the door they found themselves now on the railway platform  now said rollo i suppose that we may go and take our seats again  yes said mr george we are fairly entered within the dominions of his majesty the king of holland  and no duty to pay on my music box said rollo  rollo took a seat by a window where he could look out as the train went on and see as he said how holland looked the country was one immense and boundless plain and there were no fences or other close enclosures of any kind and yet the face of it was so endlessly varied with rows of trees groves farm houses gardens wind mills roads and other elements of rural scenery that rollo found it extremely beautiful the fields were very green where grass was growing and the foliage of the trees and of the little ornamental hedges that were seen here and there adorning the grounds of the farm houses was very rich and full as rollo looked out at the window a continued succession of the most bright and beautiful pictures passed rapidly before his eyes like those of a gayly painted panorama and they all called forth from him continually repeated exclamations of delight mr george sat at his window enjoying the scene perhaps quite as much as rollo did though he was much less ardent in expressing his admiration  see these roads uncle george said rollo they run along on the tops of the embankment like railroads are those dikes  no said mr george the dikes are built along the margin of the sea and along the banks of rivers and canals to take the water out these are embankments for the roads to raise them up and keep them dry  there were rows of trees on the sides of these raised roads which formed beautiful avenues to shelter the carriage way from the sun these avenues could sometimes be seen stretching for miles across the country  now pretty soon said rollo we shall come to the water and then we shall take a steamboat  then we do not go all the way by the train said mr george  no said rollo the railroad stops at a place called moerdyk and there we take a steamer and go along some of the rivers  but i cant find out by the map exactly how we are to go he continued because there are so many rivers  rollo had found by the map that the country all about rotterdam was intersected by a complete network of creeks and rivers this system was connected on the land side with the waters of the rhine by the immense multitude of branches into which that river divides itself towards its mouth and on the other side by innumerable creeks and inlets coming in from the sea this network of channels is so extensive and the water in the various branches of it is so deep that ships and steamers can go at will all about the country it would be as difficult to make a railroad over such a tract of mingled land and water as this as it is easy to navigate a steamer through it and accordingly the owners of the line had made arrangements for stopping the trains at moerdyk and then transferring the passengers to a steamer  i have great curiosity said rollo to see whether when we come to the water we shall go up to it instead of down to it  do you think that we shall go up to it asked mr george  i dont know replied rollo we do in some parts of holland in some places according to what the guide book says the land is twenty or thirty feet below the level of the water and so when you come to the shore you go up an embankment and there you find the water on the other side nearly at the top of it  when at length the train stopped at moerdyk the conductor called out from the platform that all the passengers would descend from the carriages to embark on board the steamer rollo was too much interested in making the change and in hurrying mr george along so as to get a good seat in the steamer to make any observation on the comparative level of the land and water there was quite a little crowd of passengers to go on board and as they walked along the pier towards the place where the steamer was lying all loaded with as many bags cloaks umbrellas or parcels of some sort as they could carry rollo and mr george pressed on before them rollo leading the way the steamer was a long and narrow boat painted black in the english fashion there was no awning over the deck and most of the passengers went below  i dont see what they are all going below for said rollo i should think that they would wish to stay on deck and see the scenery  so rollo chose a seat by the side of a small porch which was built upon the deck over the entrance to the cabin and sat down immediately upon it making room for mr george by his side there was a little table before him and he laid down his guide book and his great coat upon it  now said he this is good we have got an excellent seat and we will have a first rate time looking at holland as we go along  just then a young man dressed in a suit of gray and with a spy glass hanging at his side suspended by a strap from his shoulder and with a young and pretty but rather disdainful looking lady on his arm came by  now emily said he which would you prefer to sit here upon the deck or go below  o george said she let us go below theres nothing to be seen on the deck the country is every where flat and uninteresting  we might see the shores as we go along suggested her husband  o theres nothing to be seen along the shores said she nothing but bulrushes and willows we had better go below  so emily led george below  rollo said mr george if you would like to take a bet i will bet you the prettiest dutch toy that you can find in amsterdam that that is another mrs parkman  i think it very likely she is said rollo but uncle george what do you think they have got down below ive a great mind to go down and see  very well said mr george  and will you keep my place while i am gone asked rollo  yes said mr george or you can put your cap in it to keep it  so rollo put his cap in his seat and went down below in a few minutes he returned saying that there was a pretty little cabin down there with small tables set out along the sides of it and different parties of people getting ready for breakfast  it is rather late for breakfast said mr george it is after twelve oclock  then perhaps they call it luncheon said rollo but id rather stay on deck we might have something to eat here dont you think we could have it on this table  yes replied mr george that is what the table is put here for  well said rollo his eye brightening up at the idea  we can have it here or we can wait and have it at the hotel in rotterdam said mr george you may decide ill do just as you say  rollo finally concluded to wait till they arrived at rotterdam and then to have a good dinner all by themselves at some table by a window in the hotel and in the mean time to devote himself while on board the steamer to observing the shores of the river or arm of the sea whichever it might be on which they were sailing  the steamer had before this time set sail from the pier and after backing out of a little sort of creek or branch where it had been moored it entered a broad channel of deep water and began rapidly to move along the day was pleasant and though the air was cool rollo and mr george were so well sheltered by the little porch by the side of which they were sitting that they were very comfortable in all respects  before long the channel of water in which the steamer was sailing became more narrow and the steamer passed nearer a bank which rollo soon perceived was formed by a dike  see see uncle george said he there are the roofs of the houses over on the other side of the dike we can just see the tops of them the ground that the houses stand upon must be a great deal below the water  yes said mr george and see there are the tops of the tall trees  the dike was very regular in its form and it was ornamented with two rows of trees along the top of it there were seats here and there under the trees and some of these seats had people sitting upon them looking at the passing boats and steamers the water was full of vessels of all kinds coming and going or lying at anchor these vessels were all of very peculiar forms being built in the dutch style and not painted but only varnished so as to show beautifully the natural color of the wood of which they were made they had what rollo called fins on each side which were made to be taken up or let down into the water first on one side and then on the other as the vessel was on different tacks in beating against the wind  opposite to every place where there was a house over beyond the dike there was a line of steps coming down the face of the dike on the hither side towards the water with a little pier and a boat fastened to it below these little flights of steps with the piers and the boats and the seats under the trees on the top of the dike and the roofs of the houses and the tops of the trees beyond all looked extremely pretty and presented a succession of very peculiar and very charming scenes to mr george and rollo as the steamer glided rapidly along the shore  in some places the dike seemed to widen so as to make room for houses upon the top of it there were snug little taverns where the captains and crews of the vessels that were sailing by could stop and refresh themselves when wind or tide bound in their vessels and now and then a shop or store of some kind or a row of pretty though very queerlooking cottages at one place there was a ferry landing the ferry house together with the various buildings appertaining to it was on the top of the dike and a large pier with a snug and pretty basin by the side of it below there was a flight of stairs leading up from the pier to the ferry house and also a winding road for carriages at the time that the steamer went by this place the ferry boat was just coming in with a carriage on board of it  there were a great many wind mills here and there along the dike some were for pumping up water some for sawing logs and some for grinding grain these wind mills were very large and exceedingly picturesque in their forms and in the manner in which they were grouped with the other buildings connected with them rollo wished very much that he could stop and go on shore and visit some of these wind mills so as to see how they looked inside  at length the vessels and ships seemed to increase in numbers and mr george said that he thought that they must be approaching a town rollo looked upon the map and found that there was a large town named dort laid down on the shores of the river or branch on which they were sailing  it is on the other side said he let us go and see  so they both rose from their seats and went round to the other side of the boat and there there suddenly burst upon their view such a maze of masts spires roofs and wind mills all mingled together in promiscuous confusion as was wonderful to behold in the centre of the whole rose one enormous square tower which seemed to belong to a cathedral  this was dort or dordrecht as it is often called  as the steamer glided rapidly along the shores and mr george and rollo attempted to look into the town they saw not streets but canals indeed the whole place seemed just level with the surface of the water and far in the interior of it the masts of ships and the roofs of the houses were mingled together in nearly equal proportion  the steamer threaded its way among the fleets of boats and shipping that lay off the town and at length came to a stop at a pier the passengers destined for this place began to disembark mr george and rollo stood together on the deck looking at the buildings which lined the quay and wondering at the quaint and queer forms which every thing that they saw assumed  i should really like to go ashore here said mr george and see what sort of a place it is  let us do it uncle george said rollo eagerly let us do it  only we have paid to rotterdam said mr george  never mind said rollo it will not make much difference  but before mr george could make up his mind to go on shore the exchange of passengers was effected and the plank was pulled in the ropes were cast off and the steamer once more began to move swiftly along over the water  it is too late said rollo  yes said mr george and on the whole it is better for us to go on  in about an hour more the steamer began to draw near to rotterdam the approach to the town was indicated by the multitude of boats and vessels that were passing to and fro and by the numbers of steamers and wind mills that lined respectively the margins of the water and of the land the wind mills were prodigious in size they towered high into the air like so many lighthouses the tops of the sails as mr george estimated reached as the vanes revolved up to not less than one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet into the air it was necessary to build them high in order that the sails might not be becalmed by the houses  illustration dort  at length the steamer stopped at a pier two policemen stood at the plank as the passengers landed and demanded their passports mr george gave up his passport as he was directed and then he and rollo got into a carriage and were driven to the hotel  illustration     chapter v  walks about rotterdam   the hotel where mr george and rollo were set down was a very magnificent edifice standing on the quay opposite to a line of steamers on entering it both our travellers were struck with the spaciousness of the hall and of the staircase and with the sumptuous appearance in general of the whole interior they called for a chamber the attendants as they soon found all understood english so that there was no occasion at present to resort to the language of signs as mr george had supposed might be necessary in answer to mr georges request to be shown to a room the servant showed him and rollo a very large and lofty apartment with immense windows in front looking down upon the pier on the back side of the room were two single beds  this will do very well for us said mr george  will you dine at the table dhote3 asked the waiter  footnote 3 pronounced tahble dote  the table dhote is the public table  at what time is the table dhote asked mr george  at half past four said the waiter  no said mr george we shall want to be out at that time we will take something now as soon as we can have it can you give us a beefsteak  yes sir said the waiter  very well give us a beefsteak and some coffee and some bread and butter  yes sir said the waiter will you have two beefsteaks or one beefsteak  two said rollo in an under tone to mr george  yes said mr george and coffee for two also  so the waiter left the travellers in their room and went down stairs in about ten minutes mr george and rollo went down too at the foot of the grand staircase they turned into the dining room where they saw several tables set and at one of them near a window were the preparations for their meal  the window looked out upon the quay and rollo could see the men at work getting out hogsheads and bales of goods from a steamer that was moored there besides looking across to the quay rollo could also look up and down the street without putting his head out of the window the way in which he was enabled to do this was by means of looking glasses placed outside these looking glasses were attached to an iron frame and they were placed in an inclined position so as to reflect the whole length of the street in through the window thus a person sitting at his ease within the room could look up and down the street as well as across it at his pleasure  rollo afterwards observed such looking glasses attached to the windows of almost all the houses in town  the dinner was soon brought in and mr george and rollo ate it with excellent appetites just as they had finished their meal a neatlydressed young man came to the table and asked them if they wished for some one to show them about the town  because said he i am a valet de place and i can take you at once to all the places of interest and save you a great deal of time  how much do you ask to do it asked mr george  five francs a day said the man  thats right said mr george thats the usual price but we shall not want you at least for this afternoon we may want you tomorrow we shall stay in town a day or two  the young man said that he should be very happy to serve them if they should require his services and then bowed and went away  after having finished their meal mr george and rollo set out to take a ramble about the town by themselves  we will go in search of adventures said rollo  yes said mr george and if we lose our way we shall be likely to have some adventures for we cannot speak dutch to inquire for it  never mind said rollo im not afraid we will be careful which way we go  so they went out and took quite a long ramble through the town the first aspect of the streets struck them with astonishment the space was now more than half filled with docks and basins and with canals in which ships and boats of every kind were moving to and fro in fact almost every street consisted one half of canal and one half of road way so that in going through it you could have your choice of going in a boat or in a carriage the water part of the streets was crowded densely with vessels some of them of the largest size for the water was so deep in the canals that the largest ships could go all about the town  it was curious to observe the process of loading and unloading these vessels opposite to the houses where the merchants who owned them lived these houses were very large and handsome the upper stories were used for the rooms of the merchant and his family and the lower ones were for the storage of the goods thus a merchant could sit at his parlor window with his family about him could look down upon his ship in the middle of the street before his house and see the workmen unlading it and stowing the goods safely on his own premises in the rooms below  in some of the streets the canal was in the centre and there was a road way along by the houses on each side in others there was a road way only on one side and the walls of the houses and stores rose up directly from the waters edge on the other it was curious in this case to see the men in the upper stories of these stores hoisting goods up from the vessels below by means of cranes and tackles projecting from the windows  there was one arrangement in the streets which rollo at first condemned as decidedly objectionable in his mind and that was that the sidewalks were smooth and level with the pavement of the street differing only from the street by being paved with bricks while the road way was paved with stone  i think that that is a very foolish plan said rollo  i should not have expected so crude a remark as that from so old and experienced a traveller as you said mr george  why uncle george said rollo it is plainly a great deal better to have the sidewalk raised a little for that keeps the wheels of the carts and carriages from coming upon them besides there ought to be a gutter  people that have never been away from home before said mr george are very apt when they first land in any strange country and observe any strange or unusual way of doing things or of making things to condemn it at once and say how much better the thing is in their country but i thought that you had travelled enough to know better than that  how so asked rollo  why you see that after people have travelled more they get their ideas somewhat enlarged and they learn that one way of doing things may be best in one country and another in another on account of some difference in the circumstances or the wants of the two countries so when they see any thing done in a new or unusual manner they dont condemn it or laugh at it until they have had time to find out whether there may not be some good reason for it  but i dont see said rollo what possible good reason there can be for having the sidewalks made so that every cart that comes along can run over you  and because you dont in a moment see every reason does that make it certain that there cannot be any said mr george  why no replied rollo  then if you had travelled to much purpose said mr george you would suspend your judgment until you had inquired  it was not long before rollo saw what the reason was for making the sidewalks in this way indeed with a little reflection he would probably have thought of it himself  the object was to make it easy to wheel and convey the goods from the ships across to the warehouses for as the ships and boats go into almost all the streets in the town goods have to be wheeled across every where from the margin of the quay to the warehouses of the merchants and a range of curbstones and gutter would make an obstacle that would be very much in the way  besides contrary to rollos hastily formed opinion there ought not to be any gutters in such a town as this as far as the streets are perfectly level from end to end if gutters were made the water would not run in them the only way to have the rain water carried off is to form a gentle slope from the houses straight across the quay to the margin of the canal and this requires that the connection between the sidewalk and the road way should be continuous and even so that on every account the plan adopted in rotterdam is the best for that town  i advise all the readers of this book whether old or young if they have not yet had an opportunity to learn wisdom by actual experience in travelling to remember the lesson that rollo learned on this occasion and whenever in their future travels they find any thing that appears unusual or strange not to condemn it too soon simply because it is different from what they have been accustomed to at home but to wait till they have learned whether there may not be some good cause for the difference  rollo wished to stop continually as he and his uncle walked along to watch the operations of loading and unloading that were going on between the ships and the warehouses at one place was a boat loaded with sails which had apparently come from a sail makers the sails were rolled up in long rolls and some people in a loft of a warehouse near were hoisting them up with tackles and pulling them in at the windows  at another place two porters were engaged wheeling something in wheelbarrows across from a slip to the warehouse stopping by the way at a little platform to have every wheelbarrow load weighed one of the porters wheeled the loads from the ship to the platform and the other after they were weighed wheeled them to the warehouse at the platform sat a man with a little desk before him and a big book upon it in which he entered the weight of each load as it came as soon as the load was weighed the warehouse porter would take it from the platform wheel it across the street to the warehouse empty it there and then bring back the empty wheelbarrow and set it down by the side of the platform in the mean time the ship porter would have wheeled another load up to the platform from the ship and by the time that the warehouse porter had come back it would be weighed and all ready for him the ship porter when he brought the loaded wheelbarrow would take back to the ship the empty one the whole operation went on with so much regularity and system and it worked so well in keeping all the men employed all the time without either having to wait at all for the other that it was a pleasure to witness it  at another place mr george himself as well as rollo was much interested in seeing the process of tobacco inspection there were a number of hogsheads of tobacco with a party of porters coopers inspectors and clerks examining them it was curious to see how rapidly they would go through the process the coopers would set a hogshead up upon its end knock out the head loosen all the staves at one end whisk it over upon the platform of the scales and then lift the hogshead itself entirely off and set it down on one side leaving the tobacco alone in a great round pile on the platform then when it was weighed they would tumble it over upon its side and separate it into its layers and the inspectors would take out specimens from all the different portions of it then they would pile up the layers again and put the hogshead on over them as you would put an extinguisher on a candle and finally after turning it over once more they would put it on the head and bind it all up again tight and secure with hoop poles which they nailed in and around it the porters would then roll the hogshead off in order to put it on a cart and take it away the whole operation was performed with a degree of system regularity and promptness that was quite surprising the whole work of opening the hogshead examining it thoroughly weighing it selecting specimens and putting it up again was accomplished in less time than it has taken me here to describe it  there were a great many other operations of this sort that arrested the attention of mr george and rollo as they walked along the streets much of the merchandise which they saw thus landing from the ships or going on board of them was of great value and the ships in which it came were of immense size such as are engaged in the east india trade mr george said that they were the kind that he had often read about in history under the name of dutch east indiamen  rollo was very much amused at the signs over the doors of the shops in those streets where there were shops and in the efforts that he made to interpret them there was one which read scheeps victualij which mr george said must mean victualling for ships he was helped however somewhat in making this translation by observing what was exhibited in the windows of the shop and at the door there was another in which rollo did not require any help to enable him to translate it it was tabak koffy und thee another at first perplexed him it was this huis und scheeps smedery but by seeing that the place was a sort of blacksmiths shop rollo concluded that it must mean house and ship smithery that is that it was a place for blacksmiths work for houses and ships  over one of the doors was oosterhouts und bredas bier huis mr george said that breda was a place not far from rotterdam and that the last part of the sign must mean house for selling breda beer rollo then concluded that the first word must mean something connected with oysters there was another koffer en zadel makerij at first rollo could not make any thing of this but on looking at the window he saw a painting of a horses head with a handsome bridle upon it and a saddle on one side so he concluded it must mean a trunk and saddle makery he was the more convinced of the correctness of this from the fact that the word for trunk or box in french is coffre  rollo amused himself a long time in interpreting in this way the signs that he saw in the streets and he succeeded so well in it that he told mr george that he believed he could learn the dutch language very easily if he were going to stay for any considerable time in holland  another thing that amused rollo very much was to see the wooden shoes that were worn by the common people in the streets these shoes appeared to rollo to be very large and clumsy but even the little children wore them and the noise that they made clattering about the pavements with them was very amusing  in a great many places where the streets intersected each other there were bridges leading across the canals these bridges were of a very curious construction they were all draw bridges and as boats and vessels were continually passing and repassing along the canals it became frequently necessary to raise them in order to let the vessels go through the machinery for raising these bridges and letting them down again was very curious and rollo and mr george were both glad when in coming to the bridge they found it was up as it gave them an opportunity to watch the manoeuvre of passing the vessel through  every boat and vessel that went through had a toll to pay and the manner of collecting this toll was not the least singular part of the whole procedure while the bridge was up and when the boat had passed nearly through the helmsman or helmswoman as the case might befor one half the boats and vessels seemed to be steered by womenwould get the money ready and then the tollman who stood on the abutment of the bridge would swing out to the boat one of the wooden shoes above described which was suspended by a long line from the end of a pole like a fishing pole the tollman would swing out this shoe over the boat that was passing through as a boy would swing his hook and sinker out over the water if he were going to catch fish the helmsman in the boat would take hold of it when it came within his reach and put the money into the toe of it the tollman would then draw it in and taking out the money would carry it to his toll house which was a small building not much bigger than a sentry box that stood on the pier close by  in one case rollo came to a bridge which instead of being made to be raised entirely had only a very narrow part in the centre just wide enough for the masts and rigging of the ship to go through that could be moved when this part was lifted up to let a vessel pass it made only a very narrow opening such as a boy might jump across very easily  in some places where the passing and repassing of ships was very great there was a ferry instead of a bridge in these cases there was a flatbottomed boat to pass to and from one side to the other with a pretty little landing of stone steps at each end rollo was much entertained by these ferries he said it was crossing a street by water and it was exactly that and no more the place where he first crossed one of these ferries was precisely like a broad street of water with ships and boats going to and fro upon it instead of carriages and a very wide brick sidewalk on each side the ferry was at the crossing at the place where another street intersected it  as the houses on each side of these streets were very large and handsome and as there were rows of beautiful trees on the margin of the water and as every thing about the water and the ships and the quays and the sidewalks was kept very neat and clean the whole view as it presented itself to rollo and mr george while they were crossing in the boat was exceedingly attractive and exciting  mr george and rollo remained in rotterdam several days before they were satisfied with the curious and wonderful spectacles which it presented to view in one of their walks they made the entire circuit of the town and mr george agreed with rollo in the opinion that this was one of the most interesting walks they had ever taken  illustration the ferry boat  the way led along a smooth and beautiful road which was neatly paved and kept very nice and clean on the right hand side there extended along the whole length of it a wide canal with boats all the time going to and fro this canal looked brimming full the water in fact came up within a few inches of the level of the road the line of the road was formed by a smooth and straight margin of stonelike the margin of a fountainwith little platforms extending out here and there where neatlydressed girls and women were washing  on the other side of the road down ten feet or more below the level of it was a range of houses with yards gardens and fields about them the way to these houses was by paths leading down from the dike on which the road was built and across little bridges built over a small canal which extended between them and the dike this small canal was for the draining of the land on which the houses stood the water in this canal had a gentle flow towards the end of the street where there was a wind mill to pump it up into the great canal on the other side of the street  as rollo and mr george walked along this road it was very curious to them to see the water on one side so much higher than the land on the other at the intervals between the houses they obtained glimpses of the interior of the country which consisted of level fields lying far below where they were standing and intersected in every direction by small canals which served the purpose at the same time of fences roads and drains there seemed to be no other divisions than these between the lands of the different proprietors and no other roads for bringing home the hay or grain or other produce which might be raised in the fields  in pursuing their walk around the town our travellers were continually coming to objects so curious in their construction and use as to arrest their attention and cause them to stop and examine them at one place they saw a little ferry boat which looked precisely like a little floating room it was square and had a roof over it like a house with seats for the passengers below this boat plied to and fro across the canal by means of a rope fastened to each shore and running over pulleys in the boat  we might take this ferry boat said mr george and go across the canal into the town again see it lands opposite to one of the streets  yes said rollo but i would rather keep on and go all around the town outside  we might go over in the ferry boat just for the fun of it said mr george and then come back again  well said rollo how much do you suppose the toll is  i dont know said mr george it cant be much it is such a small boat and goes such a little way and then besides i know it must be cheap or else there could not so many of these girls and women go back and forth  for while they had been looking at the boat as they gradually approached the spot they had seen it pass to and fro with many passengers who though they were very neatly dressed were evidently by no means wealthy or fashionable people  so mr george and rollo went to the margin of the road where the ferry boat had its little landing place and when it came up they stepped on board the ferryman could only talk dutch and so mr george could not ask him what was to pay the only thing to be done was to give him a piece of silver and let him give back such change as he pleased mr george gave him a piece of money about as big as half a franc and he got back so much change in return that he said he felt richer than he did before  at another place they came to a bridge that led across the canal this bridge turned on a pivot placed out near the middle of the canal so that it could be moved out of the way when there was a boat to go by a man was turning it when mr george and rollo came along they stopped to witness the operation they were quite amused not merely with the manoeuvring of the bridge but with the form and appearance of the boat that was going through it seemed to be half boat and half house there was a room built in it which rose somewhat above the deck and showed several little windows with pretty curtains to them there was a girl sitting at one of these windows knitting and two or three children were playing about the deck at the time that the boat was going through the bridge  farther on the party came to an immense wind mill which was employed in pumping up water this wind mill like most of the others was built of brick it rose to a vast height into the air and there its immense sails were slowly revolving the wind mill was forty or fifty feet in diameter at the base and midway between the base and the summit was a platform built out that extended all around it the sails of the mill as they revolved only extended down to this platform and the platform itself was above the roofs of the fourstory houses that stood near  at the foot of this wind mill mr george and rollo could see the water running in under it through a sluice way which led from a low canal and on the other side they could see it pouring out in a great torrent into a higher one                                       besides making this circuit around the town mr george and rollo one evening took a walk in the environs on a road which led along on the top of a dike the dike was very broad and the descent from it to the low land on each side was very gradual on the slopes on each side and along the margin on the top were rows of immense trees that looked as if they had been growing for centuries the branches of these trees met overhead so as to exclude the sun entirely they made the road a deeplyshaded avenue and gave to the whole scene a very sombre and solemn expression on each side of the road down upon the low land which formed the general level of the country were a succession of country houses the summer residences of the rich merchants of rotterdam these houses were beautifully built and they were surrounded with grounds ornamented in the highest degree there were winding walks and serpentine canals and beds of flowers and pretty bridges and summer houses and groves of trees and every thing else that can add to the beauty of a summer retreat  all these scenes mr george and rollo looked down upon as they sauntered slowly along the smooth sidewalk of the dike under the majestic trees which shaded it the place where they were walking on the dike was on a level with the second story windows of the houses  illustration     chapter vi  doing the hague   and now what is the next place that we shall come to said rollo to mr george one morning after they had been some days in rotterdam  the hague replied mr george  ah yes said rollo that is the capital we shall stop there a good while i suppose because it is the capital  no said mr george i shall go through it just as quick as i can for that very reason i have a great mind not to stop there at all  why uncle george exclaimed rollo surprised what do you mean by that  why the hague rejoined mr george is the place where the king lives and the princes and the foreign ambassadors and all the fashionable people and there will be nothing to see there i expect but palaces and picture galleries and handsome streets and such things all of which we can see more of and better in paris or london  still we want to see what sort of a place the hague is said rollo  yes said mr george and i expect to do that in a very short time and then i shall go on to haarlem where they have had such a time with their pumping  mr george and rollo packed up their valise paid their bill at the hotel and set off for the station  lets go to the station by water said rollo  well said mr george if you will engage a boat  i know a place not far from here where there is a boat station said rollo  so rollo led the way until they came to a bridge and there by the side of the bridge were some stairs leading down to the water there were several boats lying at the foot of the stairs and boatmen near who all called out in dutch do you want a boat at least that was what rollo supposed they said though of course he could not understand their language rollo walked down the steps and got into one of the boats and mr george followed him  i cant speak dutch said rollo to the boatman but that is the way we want to go so saying rollo pointed in the direction which led towards the station the man did not understand a word that rollo had said but still by hearing it he learned the fact that rollo did not speak the language of the country and by his signs he knew that he must go the way that he pointed so he began to row the boat along  we cannot go quite to the station by the boat said rollo but we can go pretty near it and we can walk the rest of the way  how will you find out the way asked mr george through all these canals  i can tell by the map said rollo  so rollo sat down on a seat at the stern of the boat and taking out his map which was printed on a pocket handkerchief he spread it on his knee and began to study out the canals  there said he we are going along this canal now and there a little way ahead from here is a bridge that we shall go under then we shall make a turn continued rollo still studying his map we shall have to go a very roundabout way but that is no matter  so they went on rollo at each turn pointing to the boatman which way he was to go sometimes the boat was stopped for a time by a jam in the boats and vessels before it as a hack might be stopped in broadway in new york sometimes it went under bridges and sometimes through dark archways where rollo could hear carriages rumbling over his head in the streets above  at length the boat reached the point which rollo thought was nearest to the station and the man at a signal which rollo gave him stopped at some steps rollo paid the fare by holding out a handful of money in his hand and letting the man take what was right watching him however to see that he did not take too much  then mr george and rollo both went ashore and walked the rest of the way to the station  in the european railroad stations there are different waiting rooms for the different classes of travellers mr george sometimes took second class carriages and sometimes first for short distances he generally went first class and as it was only a few miles to the hague from rotterdam he now went into the first class waiting room there was a counter for refreshment in one corner of the room and some sofas along the sides mr george sat down upon one of the sofas putting his valise on the floor at the end of it rollo said that he would go out and take a little walk around the station for it was yet half an hour before the train was to go  in a few minutes after rollo had gone there came to the door among other carriages one from which mr george to his great surprise saw mr and mrs parkman get out mr georges first thought was to go out by another door and make his escape but he checked this impulse saying to himself  it would be very ungenerous in me to abandon my old friend in his misfortune so i will stay  mr parkman seemed very much delighted as well as surprised to see mr george again and mrs parkman gave him quite a cordial greeting although she half suspected that mr george did not like her very well  mr george asked her how she liked holland so far as she had seen it  not much said she the towns are not pretty the streets are all full of canals and there is nothing to be seen but boats and ships and what ugly wooden shoes they wear did you ever see any thing so ugly in all your life  they look pretty big and clumsy said mr george i must admit but it amuses me to see them  at the hague i expect to find something worth seeing continued mrs parkman thats where the king and all the great people live and all the foreign ambassadors if william had only got letters of introduction to some of them he might have got them just as well as not our minister at london would have given him some if he had asked for them but he said he did not like to ask for them  strange said mr george  yes rejoined mrs parkman i think it is not only strange but foolish i want to go to some of the parties at the hague but we cant stop william says we can only give one day to the hague  o you can do it up quite well in one day said mr george  if you would only go with us and show us how to do it said mrs parkman  yes said mr parkman do george go with us join us for one day ill put the whole party entirely under your command and you shall have every thing your own way  mr george did not know what to reply to this proposition at last he said that he would go and find rollo and consult him on the subject and if rollo approved of it they would consent to the arrangement  mrs parkman laughed at hearing this why said she is it possible that you are under that boys direction  not exactly that said mr george but then he is my travelling companion and it is not right for one person in such a case to make any great change in the plan without at least first hearing what the other has to say about it  thats very true replied mrs parkman do you hear that william you must remember that when you are going to change the plans without asking my consent  mrs parkman said this in a goodnatured way as if she meant it in joke it was one of those cases where people say what they wish to have considered as meant in a joke but to be taken in earnest  mr george went out to look for rollo he found him lying on the grass by the side of a small canal which flowed through the grounds and reaching down to the water to gather some curious little plants that were growing upon it mr george informed him that mr and mrs parkman were at the station and that they had proposed that he himself and rollo should join their party in seeing the hague  and i suppose you dont want to do it said rollo  why yes said mr george ive taken a notion to accept the proposal if you like it well then do the hague in style and i shall get back into mrs parkmans good graces then we will bid them good by and after that you and i will travel on in our own way  well said rollo i agree to it  mr george accordingly went back into the station and told mr and mrs parkman that he and rollo would accept their invitation and join with them in seeing what there was in the hague  and then after that said mr george we shall come back to delft while you go on to amsterdam  i wish you would go on with us said mr parkman  we cant do that very well said mr george we want to try a dutch canal once and a good place to try it is in going from the hague to delft it is only about four or five miles we are going there by the canal boat and then coming back on foot  mr george had taken care in planning the course which he and rollo were to pursue after leaving the hague to contrive an expedition which he was very sure mrs parkman would not wish to join in  o mr george she exclaimed what pleasure can there be in going on a canal  why the canal boats are so funny said rollo and then we see such curious little places all along the banks of them and we meet so many boats carrying all sorts of things  i dont think it would be very agreeable for a lady said mr george but rollo and i thought we should like to try it  just at this moment the door leading to the platform opened and a man dressed in a sort of uniform denoting that he was an officer of the railroad called out in dutch that the train was coming the ladies and gentlemen that were assembled in the waiting room immediately took up their bags and bundles and went out upon the platform as they went out mr george in passing the man in uniform slipped a piece of money into his hand and said to him in an under tone first in french and then in english  a good seat by a window for this lady  the officer received the money made a bow of assent and immediately seemed to take the whole party under his charge when the train arrived and had stopped before the place there was a great crowd among the new passengers to get in and procure seats the officer beckoned to mr george to follow him but mrs parkman seemed disposed to go another way she was looking eagerly about here and there among the carriages as if the responsibility of finding seats for the party devolved upon her  what shall we do said she the cars are all full  leave it to me said mr george to her in an under tone leave it entirely to me youll see presently  the officer finding the carriages generally full said to mr george in french wait a moment sir so mr george said to the rest of the party  we will all stand quietly here hell come to us presently  yes said mrs parkman when all the seats are taken we shant get seats at all william  youll see said mr george  in a moment more the officer came to the party and bowing respectfully to mrs parkman he said  now madam  he took out a key from his pocket and unlocked the door of a carriage which had not before been opened and standing aside he bowed to let mrs parkman pass  mrs parkman was delighted there was nobody in the carriage and so she had her choice of the seats she chose one next the window on the farther side her husband took the seat opposite to her  ah said she with a tone of great satisfaction how nice this is and what a gentlemanly conductor i never had the conductor treat me so politely in my life  mrs parkman was put in excellent humor by this incident and she said towards the end of the journey that she should have had a delightful ride if the country had not been so flat and uninteresting to mr george and rollo who sat at the other window it appeared extremely interesting there was so much that was curious and novel to be seen the immense green fields with herds of cattle and flocks of sheep feeding every where and separated from each other by straight and narrow canals instead of fences the boats passing to and fro loaded with produce the little bridges built over these canals here and there for the foot paths with the gates across them to keep the cattle from going over the long road ways raised upon dikes and bordered by quadruple rows of ancient and venerable trees stretching to a boundless distance across the plains and now and then a wide canal with large boats or vessels passing to and frothese and a multitude of other such sights to be seen in no other country in the world occupied their attention all the time and kept them constantly amused  at length the train arrived at the station for the hague and the whole party descended from the carriage  now william said mr george give me the ticket for your trunk and you yourself take mrs parkman into the waiting room and wait till i come  no said mr parkman i cannot let you take that trouble  certainly said mr george you said that i should have the entire command give me the ticket  so mr parkman gave him the ticket and mr george went out rollo remained with mr and mrs parkman in a few minutes mr george returned and said that the carriage was ready they all went to the door and there they found a carriage waiting with mr and mrs parkmans trunk upon the top of it a man was holding the door open for the party to get in as soon as they had all entered mr george put a few coppers into the hand of the man at the door and said to him  hotel belview4  footnote 4 in french hotel belle vue but mr george gave it the english pronunciation because the pronunciation of words in holland is much more like the english than like the french  hotel belview shouted the man to the coachman on hearing this command the coachman drove on  the road that led into the town lay along the banks of a canal and after going about half a mile in this direction the horses turned and went over a bridge they were now in the heart of the town but the party could not see much for the night was coming on and the sky was cloudy it was cold too and mrs parkman wished to have the windows closed the carriage went along a narrow street crossing bridges occasionally until at length it came to a region of palaces and parks and grounds beautifully ornamented finally it stopped before a large and very handsome hotel the hotel stood in a street which had large and beautiful houses and gardens on one side and an open park with deer feeding on the borders of a canal on the other  two or three very nicely dressed servants came out when the carriage stopped and opened the door of it in a very assiduous and deferential manner  wait here in the carriage said mr george till i come  so saying he himself descended from the carriage and went into the house followed by two of the waiters that had come to the door  in about two minutes he came out again  yes said he to mrs parkman i think you will like the rooms  so saying he helped mrs parkman out of the carriage and gave her his arm to conduct her into the house at the same time he said to one of the waiters  see that every thing is taken out of the carriage and pay the coachman  very well sir said the waiter  mr george led mrs parkman up a broad and handsome staircase he was preceded by one waiter and followed by two others these waiters had taken every thing from the hands of the party especially from mrs parkman so that they were loaded with bags cloaks and umbrellas while the travellers themselves had nothing to carry  at the head of the staircase the waiter who was in advance opened a door which led to a large drawing room or parlor which was very handsomely decorated and furnished the windows were large and they looked out upon a handsome garden though it was now too dark to see it very distinctly  as mrs parkman turned round again after trying to look out at the window she saw a second waiter coming into the room bringing with him two tall wax candles in silver candlesticks the candles had just been lighted the waiter placed them on the table and then retired  and now said mr george to the other waiter we want a good fire made here and then let us have dinner as soon as you can  illustration the dinner  very well sir replied the waiter and so saying he bowed respectfully and retired  a neatlydressed young woman in a very picturesque and pretty cap had come into the room with the party and while mr george had been ordering the fire and the dinner she had shown mrs parkman to her bedroom which was a beautiful and richly furnished room with two single beds in it opening out of the parlor on the other side of the parlor was another bedroom also with two beds in it for mr george and rollo5  footnote 5 almost all the bedrooms in the hotels on the continent of europe are furnished thus with two single beds instead of one double one it is the custom for every body to sleep alone  mr and mrs parkman remained in their room for a time and when they came out they found the table set for dinner and a very pleasant fire burning in the grate  mr george said she i wish we had you to make arrangements for us all the time  it would be a very pleasant duty said mr george you are so easily satisfied  mrs parkman seemed much pleased with this compliment she did not for a moment doubt that she fully deserved it  about eight oclock that evening mr george asked mrs parkman at what time she would like to have breakfast the next morning  at any time you please said she that is if it is not too early  how would half past nine do asked mr george  i think that will do very well said mrs parkman  we will say ten if you prefer said mr george  o no said she half past nine will do very well  so mr george rang the bell and when the waiter came he ordered a sumptuous breakfast consisting of beefsteaks hot rolls coffee omelet and every thing else that he could think of that was good and directed the waiter to have it ready at half past nine  i shall also want a carriage and a pair of horses tomorrow continued mr george and a commissioner  very well sir said the waiter and what time shall you wish for the carriage  what time mrs parkman repeated mr george turning to the lady shall you be ready by half past ten to go out and see the town  yes said mrs parkman that will be a very good time  very well sir said the waiter and he bowed and retired  the next morning when the different members of the party came out into the breakfast room they found the table set for breakfast at half past nine all were ready except mrs parkman she sent word by her husband that she would come out in a few minutes  there is no hurry said mr george it will be time enough to have breakfast when she comes  in about fifteen minutes she came mr george asked her very politely how she had spent the night and after she had sat a few minutes talking by the fire he said that they would have breakfast whenever she wished  yes said she i am ready any time indeed i was afraid that i should be late and keep you waiting i am very glad that i am in season  so mr george rang the bell when the waiter came he ordered breakfast to be brought up  while the party were at breakfast a very nicelydressed waiter with a white napkin over his arm stood behind mrs parkmans chair and evinced a great deal of alertness and alacrity in offering her every thing that she required when the breakfast was nearly finished mr george turned to him and said  is the commissioner ready john who is to go with us today  yes sir said the waiter  i wish you to go down and send him up said mr george  so the waiter went down stairs to find the commissioner and while he was gone mr george took out a pencil and paper from his pocket  i am going to ask him said mr george to mrs parkman what there is to be seen here and to make a list of the places and then we will go and see them all or you can make a selection just as you please  very well said mrs parkman i should like that  accordingly when the commissioner came in mr george asked him to name in succession the various objects of interest usually visited by travellers coming to the hague and as he named them mr george questioned him respecting them so as to enable mrs parkman to obtain a somewhat definite idea of what they were the commissioner enumerated a variety of places to be seen such as the public museum of painting several private museums the old palace the new palace two or three churches the town hall and various other sights which tourists arriving at the hague usually like to view mr george made a list of all these and opposite to each he marked the time which the commissioner said would be required to see it well after completing this list he said  and there is a great watering place on the sea shore not far from this i believe  yes sir said the commissioner about three miles  is it a pleasant ride there asked mr george  yes sir replied the commissioner it is a very pleasant ride you can go one way and return another it is a very fashionable place the queen and the princesses go there every summer  very well it takes about two hours and a half i suppose to go there and return said mr george  yes sir said the commissioner  very well said mr george have the carriage ready in shall we say half an hour mrs parkman shall you be ready in half an hour  mrs parkman said that she should be ready in half an hour and so mr george appointed that time and then the commissioner went away  mr george added up all the periods of time that the commissioner had said would be required for the several sights and found that there would be time for them to see the whole and yet be ready for the afternoon train for amsterdam where mr and mrs parkman were going next so mrs parkman concluded not to omit any from the list but to go and see the whole  in half an hour the carriage was at the door and in ten or fifteen minutes afterwards mrs parkman was ready just before they went mr george rang the bell again and called for the bill requesting the waiter to see that every thing was chargedcarriage servants commissioner and all when it came mr parkman took out his purse expecting to pay it himself but mr george took out his purse too  the amount said mr george looking at the footing of the bill is fortyfive guilders and some cents your share is say twentytwo guilders and a half  no indeed said mr parkman my share is the exact footing of the bill you have nothing to do with this payment  yes said mr george i have just one half to pay for rollo and me we are four in all and rollo and i are two  mr parkman seemed extremely unwilling to allow mr george to pay any thing at all but mr george insisted upon it and so the bill was paid by a joint contribution  all this time the carriage was ready at the door and the gentlemen attended by two or three waiters conducted mrs parkman down to the door the party then drove in succession to the various places which the commissioner had enumerated there were museums consisting of a great many rooms filled with paintings and palaces where they were shown up grand staircases and through long corridors and into suites of elegant apartments and churches and beautiful parks and gardens and a bazaar filled with curiosities from china and japan and a great many other similar places mr george paid very particular attention to mrs parkman during the whole time and made every effort to anticipate and comply with her wishes in all respects in one case indeed i think he went too far in this compliance and the result was to mortify her not a little it was in one of the museums of paintings mrs parkman like other ladies of a similar character to hers always wanted to go where she could not go and to see what she could not see if when she came into a town she heard of any place to which for any reason it was difficult to obtain admission that was the very place of all others that she wished most to see and if in any museum or palace or library that she went into there were two doors open and one shut she would neglect the open ones and make directly to the one that was shut and ask to know what there was there i do not know as there was any thing particularly blameworthy in this on the contrary such a feeling may be considered in some respects a very natural one in a lady but nevertheless when it manifests itself in a decided form it makes the lady a very uncomfortable and vexatious companion to the gentleman who has her under his care  in one of the rooms where our party went in the museum of paintings there was a door near one corner that was shut all the other doorsthose which communicated with the several apartments where the pictures were hungwere open as soon as mrs parkman came in sight of the closed door she pointed to it and said  i wonder what there is in that room i suppose it is something very choice i wish we could get in  mr parkman paid at first no attention to this request but continued to look at the pictures around him  i wish you would ask some of the attendants she continued whether we cannot go into that room  o no replied her husband if it was any thing that it was intended we should see the door would be open the fact that the door is shut is notice enough that we are not to go in there  im convinced there are some choice pictures in there said mrs parkman something that they do not show to every body mr george i wish you would see if you cant find out some way to get in  certainly said mr george i will try  so mr george walked along towards one of the attendants whom he saw in another part of the roomputting his hand in his pocket as he went to feel for a piece of money he put the piece of money into the attendants hand and then began to talk with him asking various indifferent questions about the building and finally he asked him where that closed door led to  o that is only a closet said the attendant where we keep our brooms and dusters  i wish you would just let us look into it said mr george heres half a guilder for you  the man looked a little surprised but he took the half guilder saying  certainly if it will afford you any satisfaction  mr george then went back to where he had left the rest of his party and said to mrs parkman  this man is going to admit us to that room follow him i will come in a moment  so mr george stopped to look at a large painting on the wall while mrs parkman with high anticipations of the pleasure she was to enjoy in seeing what people in general were excluded from walked in a proud and stately manner to the door and when the man opened it saw only a small dark room with nothing in it but brooms dust pans and lamp fillers she was exceedingly abashed by this adventure and for the rest of that day she did not once ask to see any thing that was not voluntarily shown to her  after visiting all the places of note in the town the coachman was ordered to drive to the watering place on the sea shore it was a very pleasant drive of about three miles just before reaching the shore of the sea the road came to a region of sand hills called dunes formed by the drifting sands blown in from the beach by the winds among these dunes and close to the sea shore was an immense hotel with long wings stretching a hundred feet on each side and a row of bath vans on the margin of the beach before it the beach was low and shelving and it could be traced for miles in either direction along the coast whitened by the surf that was rolling in from the german ocean  after looking at this prospect for a time and watching to see one or two of the bathing vans drive down into the surf in order to allow ladies who had got into them to bathe the party returned to the carriage and the coachman drove them through the village which was very quaint and queer and inhabited by fishermen the fishing boats were drawn up on the shore in great numbers very near the houses rollo desired very much to go and see these boats and the fishermen and learn if he could what kind of fish they caught in them and how they caught them but mrs parkman thought that they had better not stop they were nothing but common fishing boats she said  the carriage returned to the hague by a different road from the one in which it came it was a road that led through a beautiful wood where there were many pleasant walks with curious looking dutch women going and coming as the party approached the town they passed through a region of parks and palaces and splendid mansions of all kinds mrs parkman was curious to know who lived in each house and mr george contrived to communicate her inquiries to the coachman by making signs and by asking questions partly in english and partly in german but though the coachman understood the questions mrs parkman could not understand the answers that he gave for they were dutch namessometimes long and sometimes short but whether they were long or short the sounds were so uncouth and strange that mrs parkman looked terribly distressed in trying to make them out  at length the carriage arrived at the hotel again and there the porters put on the baggage belonging both to mr and mrs parkman and to mr george and rollo it then proceeded to the station mr george and rollo waited there until the train for amsterdam arrived and then took leave of mr and mrs parkman as they went to their seats in the carriage mrs parkman shook hands with mr george very cordially and said  we are very much obliged to you mr george for your company today we have had a very pleasant time i wish that we could have you to travel with us all the time                                       i think she ought to be obliged to you said rollo as soon as the train had gone  not at all said mr george  not at all repeated rollo why not you have done a great deal for her today  no said mr george all that i have done has not been for her sake but for williams william is an excellent good friend of mine and i am very sorry that he has not got a more agreeable travelling companion  illustration     chapter vii  correspondence   one day when mr george and rollo were at the town of leyden it began to rain while they were eating their breakfast  never mind said rollo we can walk about the town if it does rain  yes said mr george we can but we shall get tired of walking about much sooner if it rains than if it were pleasant weather however i am not very sorry for i should like to write some letters  ive a great mind to write a letter too said rollo ill write to my mother dont you think that would be a good plan  whyi dont knowsaid mr george speaking in rather a doubtful tone it seems to me that it would be hardly worth while  why not asked rollo  why the postage is considerable said mr george and i dont believe the letter would be worth what your father would have to pay for it that is if it is such a letter as i suppose you would write  why what sort of a letter do you suppose i should write asked rollo  o you would do as boys generally do in such cases replied his uncle in the first place you would want to take the biggest sheet that you could find to write the letter upon then you would take up as much of the space as possible writing the date and my dear mother then you would go on for a few lines saying things of no interest to any body such as telling what day you came to this place and what day to that perhaps youd say that today is a rainy day and that yesterday was pleasantjust as if your mother when she gets your letter would care any thing about knowing what particular days were rainy and what pleasant in holland a week back then after you had got about two thirds down the page you would stop because you could not think of any thing more to say and subscribe your name with ever so many scrawl flourishes and as many affectionate and dutiful phrases as you could get to fill up the space  and that would be a letter that your father like as not would have to pay one and sixpence or two shillings sterling for to the london postman  rollo laughed at this description of the probable result of his proposed attempt to write a letter but he laughed rather faintly for he well recollected how many times he had written letters in just such a way he secretly resolved however that when they came in from their walk and mr george sat down to his writing he would write too and would see whether he could not for once produce a letter that should be at least worth the postage  after they came in from their walk they asked the landlady to have a fire made in their room but she said they could not have any fire for the stoves were not put up she said it was the custom in holland not to put the stoves up until october and so nobody could have a fire in any thing but foot stoves until that time the foot stoves she said would make it very comfortable for them  so she brought in two foot stoves they consisted of small square boxes with holes bored in the top and a little fire of peat in an earthen vessel within rollo asked mr george to give him two sheets of thin note paper and he established himself at a window that looked out upon a canal he intended to amuse himself in the intervals of his writing in watching the boats that were passing along the canal  he took two sheets of note paper instead of one sheet of letter paper in order that if he should get tired after filling one of them he could stop and so send what he had written without causing his father to pay postage on any useless paper  then thought he if i do not get tired i will go on and fill the second sheet and my mother will have a double small letter a double small letter will be just as good as a single large one  this was an excellent plan  rollo also took great pains to guard against another fault which boys often fall into in writing their letters that is the fault of growing careless about the writing as they go on with the work by which means a letter is produced which looks very neat and pretty at the beginning but becomes an illlooking and almost illegible scrawl at the end  ill begin said he as i think i shall be able to hold out and ill hold out to the end just as i begin  rollo remained over his letter more than three hours he would have become exceedingly tired with the work if he had written continuously all this time but he stopped to rest very often and to amuse himself with observing what was passing before him in the street and on the canal  mr george was occupied all this time in writing his letter and each read what he had written to the other that same evening after dinner the two letters were as follows                              mr georges letter                                           leyden holland september 27    my dear edward6  footnote 6 edward was mr georges brother he was a boy about twelve years old  we have been travelling now for several days in holland and it is one of the most curious and amusing countries to travel in that i have ever seen  we all know from the books of geography which we study at school that holland is a very low countrylower in many places than the ocean and that the water of the ocean is kept from overflowing it by dikes which the people built ages ago along the shores i always used to suppose that it was only from the sea that people had any danger to fear of inundations but i find now that it is not so  the people have to defend themselves from inundations not only on the side towards the sea but also quite as much if not more on the side towards the land from the waters of the river rhine the river rhine rises in switzerland and flows through various countries of europe until it comes to the borders of holland and there it spreads out into innumerable branches and runs every where all over the country it would often overflow the country entirely were it not that the banks are guarded by dikes like the dikes of the sea the various branches of the rivers are connected together by canals which are also higher than the land on each side of them thus the whole country is covered with a great network of canals rivers and inlets from the sea with water in them higher than the land when the tide is low in the sea the surplus water from these rivers and canals flows off through immense sluices at the mouth of them when the tide comes up it is kept from flowing in by immense gates with which the sluices are closed they call the tracts of land that lie lower than the channels of water around them polders that is rather a queer name i suppose it is a dutch name  the polders all have drains and canals cut in them as we ride along in the railway carriages we overlook these polders they look like immense green fields extending as far as you can see with straight canals running through them in every direction and crossing each other at right angles these canals in the bottom of the polders are about six feet wide they are wide enough to prevent the cattle from jumping across them and so they serve for fences to divide the fields from each other they also serve for roads for the dutchmen use boats on their farms to get in their hay and produce instead of carts  the water that collects in these low canals and drains which run across the polders cannot flow out into the large canals which are higher than they are and so they have to pump it out they pump it out generally by means of wind mills so wherever you go throughout all holland you find an immense number of wind mills these wind mills are very curious indeed some of them are immensely large they look like lighthouses the large ones are generally built of brick and some of them are several hundred years old the sails of the big ones are often fifty feet long and sometimes eighty feet this makes a wheel one hundred and sixty feet in diameter when you stand under one of these mills and look up and see these immense sails revolving so high in the air that the lowest point when the sail comes round is higher than the tops of the four story houses the effect is quite sublime  with these wind mills they pump the water up from one drain or canal to another till they get it high enough to run off into the sea in some places however it is very difficult to get the water into the sea even in this way even at low tides the river amstel for instance which comes out at amsterdam and into which a great many canals and channels are pumped is so low at its mouth that the sea is never at the lowest tides more than a foot and a half below it at high tides the sea is a great deal above it the average is about a foot above of course it requires a great deal of management to get the waters of the river out and avoid letting the water of the sea in they do it by immense sluices which are generally kept shut and only opened when the tide is low  in the mean time if it should ever so happen that they could not succeed in letting the water out fast enough it would of course accumulate and rise in the rivers and press against the dikes that run along the banks of it till at last it would break through in some weak place and then unless the people could stop the breach the whole polder on that side would be gradually overflowed the inundation would extend until it came to some other dike to stop it the polder that would first be filled would become a lake the lake would be many miles in extent perhaps but the water in it would not usually be very deepnot more than eight or ten feet perhaps though in some cases the polders are so low that an inundation from the rivers and canals around it would make the lake twenty or thirty feet deep  of course in ancient times when a portion of the country became thus submerged it was for the people to consider whether they would abandon it or try to pump all that water out again by means of the wind mills they would think that if they pumped it out it would be some years before the land would be good again for the salt in the water would tend to make it barren so they would sometimes abandon it and put all their energy into requisition to strengthen the dikes around it in order to prevent the inundation from spreading any farther for water in holland tends to spread and to destroy life and property just as fire does in other countries the lakes and rivers where they are higher than the land are liable to burst their barriers after heavy rains falling in the country or great floods coming down the rivers or high tides rise from the sea and so run into each other and the people have continually to contend against this danger just as in other countries they do against spreading conflagrations  in the case of spreading fire water is the great friend and helper of man and in the case of these spreading inundations of water it is wind that he relies upon the only mode that the dutch had to pump out the water in former times was the wind mills when the rains or the tides inundated the land they called upon the wind to help them lift the water out to where it could flow away again  there was a time two or three hundred years ago when all the wind mills that the people could make seem not to have been enough to do the work and there was one place in the centre of the country where the water continued to spread more and morebreaking through as it spread from one polder to anotheruntil at last it swallowed up such an extent of country as to form a lake thirty miles in circumference this lake at last extended very near to the gates of haarlem and it was called the holland lake you will find it laid down on all the maps of holland except those which have been printed within a few years the reason why it is not laid down now is because a few years ago finding that the wind mills were not strong enough to pump it out the government concluded to try what virtue there might be in steam so they first repaired and strengthened the range of dikes that extended round the lake in fact they made them double all around leaving a space between for a canal they made both the inner and outer of these dikes watertight so that the water should neither soak back into the lake again after it was pumped out nor ooze out into the polders beyond the way they made them watertight was by lining them on both sides with a good thick coating of clay  when the dikes enclosing the lake were completed the engineers set up three very powerful steam engines and gave to each one ten or twelve enormous pumps to work these pumping engines were made on such a grand scale that they lifted over sixty tuns of water at every stroke but yet so large was the lake and so vast the quantity of water to be drained that though there were three of the engines working at this rate and though they were kept at work night and day it took them a year and a half to lay the ground dry the work was however at last accomplished and now what was the bottom of the lake is all converted into pastures and green fields but they still have to keep the pumps going all the time to lift out the surplus water that falls over the whole space in rain you may judge that the amount is very large that falls on a district thirty miles round they calculate that the quantity which they have to pump up now every year in order to keep the land from being overflowed again is over fifty millions of tuns and that is a quantity larger than you can ever conceive of  and yet the piece of ground is so large that the cost of this pumping makes only about fifty cents for each acre of land which is very little  besides these great spreading inundations which holland has always been subject to from the lakes and rivers in the middle of the country there has always been a greater danger still to be feared from the ice freshets of the rhine and other great rivers coming from the interior of the country the rhine you know flows from south to north and often the ice in the spring breaks up in the middle of the course of the river before it gets thawed in holland the broken ice in coming down the stream towards the north is kept within the banks of the stream where the banks are high but when it reaches holland it is not only no longer so confined but it finds its flow obstructed by the ice which there still remains solid and so it gets jammed and forms dams and that makes the water rise very fast at one time when such a dam was formed the water rose seven feet in an hour at such times the pressure becomes so prodigious that the dikes along the bank of the river are burst and water sand gravel and ice all pour over together upon the surrounding country and overwhelm and destroy every thing that comes in its way  some of the inundations caused in holland by these floods and freshets have been terrible in ancient times they were worse than they are now because now the dikes are stronger and are better guarded at one inundation that occurred about sixty years ago eighty thousand persons were drowned at another three hundred years earlier one hundred thousand perished think what awful floods there must have been  but i cannot write any more in this letter i have taken up so much space and time in telling you about the inundations and freshets that i have not time to describe a great many other things which i have seen that are quite as curious and remarkable as they but when i get home i can tell you all about them in the winter evenings and read to you about them from my journal                         your affectionate brother                                            george                               rollos letter                                           leyden tuesday september 27    my dear mother  uncle george and i are having a very fine time indeed in travelling about holland it is such a funny country on account of their being so many canals the water is all smooth and still in all the canals except when the wind blows and so there must be excellent skating every where in the winter  i wish it was winter here now for one day so that uncle george and i could have some dutch skating  there must be good skating every where here in the winter for there is water every where and it is all good water for skating in the fields instead of brooks running in crooked ways and tumbling over rocks there are only long and narrow channels of smooth water just about wide enough to skate upon and reaching as far as you can see  the people here speak dutch and they cannot understand me and i cannot understand them and that is not the worst of it they cant understand that i cant understand them sometimes the woman that comes to make my bed tells me something in dutch and i tell her that i cant understand i know the dutch for i cant understand then she says o and goes on to tell me over again only now she tries to speak plaineras if it could make any difference to me whether she speaks plain or not i shake my head and tell her i cant understand any thing i tell her in french and in english and in dutch but it does not do any good for she immediately begins again and tells me the whole story all over again trying to speak plainer than ever i suppose she thinks that any body can understand dutch if she only speaks it plain enough to them  when i want any thing of them i always tell them by signs the other evening uncle george and i wanted some candles so i rang the bell and a woman came i went to the door of the room and made believe that i had two candlesticks in my hand and that i was bringing them in i made believe put them on the table and then sat down and opened a book and pretended that i was reading by the light of them she understood me immediately she laughed and said ya ya and went off out of the room to get the candles  ya ya means yes yes  another time we wanted a fire so when the woman came in i shivered and made believe that i was very cold and then i went to the fireplace and made believe warm myself then i pointed to the fireplace and made a sign for her to go away and bring the fire to put there but instead of going she told me something in dutch and shook her head and when i said i could not understand it she told me over again and finally she went away and sent the landlady the landlady could speak a little english so she told me that we could not have any fire except in foot stoves for the fireplace stoves were not put up  illustration the boat family  it is very curious to walk about the streets and see the boats on the canals and what the people are carrying back and forth in them i watch them sometimes from the windows of the hotel especially when it rains and we cannot go out they have every thing in these boats they use some of them instead of houses and the man who owns them lives in them with his wife and children and sometimes with his ducks and chickens  i often see the little children playing on the decks of the boat once i saw one that had a dog and he was trying to teach him to cipher on a slate his mother and the other children were on the boat too  the people use their dogs here to draw carts they have three or four sometimes harnessed in together the dogs look pretty poor and lean but they draw like good fellows you would be surprised to see what great loads they draw they draw loads of vegetables to market and then when the vegetables are sold they draw the market women home in the empty carts  only they dont mind very well when they are told which way to go i saw a boy yesterday riding along in a cart with a good big dog to draw him and when he came to a street where he wanted him to turn down the dog would not turn the boy hallooed out to him in dutch a good many times and finally the boy had to jump down out of the cart and run and seize him by the collar and pull him round  it is not a great deal that they use dog carts to bring things to market for generally they bring them in boats they take almost every thing to and fro along the canals in boats and it is very curious to stand on a bridge and look down on the boats that pass under and see how many different kinds of boats there are and how many different kinds of things they have in them this morning i saw one that had the bottom of it divided into three pens for animals in the first pen were two great cows lying down on the straw in the second pen were several sheep and in the third there were as many as a dozen small pigs just big enough to be roasted i suppose it was a farmer bringing in his stock to market  sometimes they row the boats along the canal and sometimes they push them with setting poles they have the longest setting poles in some of the boats that i ever saw there is an iron pike at one end of the pole and a wooden knob at the other when they are pushing the boat by means of one of these poles they run the ironed end of it down to the bottom and then the man puts his shoulder to the little knob at the other end and pushes as the boat goes on he walks along the boat from the bow to the stern pushing all the way as hard as he can push  when they are out of town the men pull the boats along the canals by means of a long cord which is fastened to a strap over their shoulders with this strap they walk along on the towpath of the canal pulling in this wayso that if the cord should break i should think they would fall headlong on the ground  i saw a man and a woman the other day pulling a double boat loaded with hay along a canal the hay was loaded across from one boat to the other it made as much as five or six of the largest cart loads of hay that i ever saw i was surprised to see that a man and a woman could draw so much they drew it by long lines and by straps over their shoulders the womans line was fastened to one of the boats and the mans to the other  the people travel a great deal in boats in these parts of the country where there are no railroads uncle george and i took a little journey in one the other day i wanted to go very much but uncle george was afraid he said that they might take us somewhere where there would be nobody that could talk english and so we might get into some serious difficulty but he said that he would go with me a few miles if i could find a canal boat going to some place that we knew so i found one going to a town called delft we knew that place because we had come through it or close by it by the railway  uncle george said that it was an excellent plan to go there for then if we got tired of the canal boat in going we could come home by a railroad train  so we went and we had a very pleasant time indeed i found the canal boat by going to the place where the boats all were and saying delft delft to the people and then they pointed me to the right boat so we got in when the captain came for the fare i took out a handful of money and said delft and also pointed to uncle george so he took out enough to pay for uncle george and me to go to delft at least i suppose he thought it was enough though i thought it was very little  we had a very pleasant sail to delft the banks of the canal are beautiful they are green and pretty every where and in some places there were beautiful gardens and summer houses and pavilions close upon the shore  but now i begin to be tired of writing i should have been tired a great while ago only i have stopped to rest pretty often and to look out the window and see what is going by on the canal  there is a boat coming now with a mast and i dont see what they are going to do for there is a bridge here and it is not a draw bridge almost all the bridges are draw bridges but this one is not so i dont see how he is going to get by  ah i see how it is the mast is on a hinge so that it can turn down backward and lie along flat on the deck of the boat it is going down now  now it is down and the boat is going under the bridge  but good by mother for it is time for me to stop                    your affectionate and dutiful son                                                  rollo  p s this is the longest letter that i ever wrote     chapter viii  the commissioner   as may well be imagined the best use to which the green fields of holland can be put is the raising of grass to feed cattle for the wetness of the land which makes it somewhat unsuitable to be ploughed causes grass to grow upon it very luxuriantly accordingly as you ride through the country along the great railway lines you see every where herds of cattle and flocks of sheep feeding in the meadows that extend far and wide in every direction  the cattle are kept partly for the purpose of being fatted and sent to market for beef and partly for their milk which the dutch farmers make cheese of dutch cheeses are celebrated in every part of the world  in the neighborhood of amsterdam there are a number of dairy villages where cheeses are made and some of them are almost always visited by travellers they are great curiosities in fact on account of their singular and most extraordinary neatness cleanliness is in all parts of the world deemed a very essential requisite of a dairy and the dutch housewives in the dairy villages of holland have carried the idea to the extreme the village which is most commonly visited by strangers who go to amsterdam is one called broek it lies to the north of amsterdam and at a distance of about five or six miles from it  one day when mr george and rollo arrived in amsterdam mr george just at sundown looked out at the window of the hotel and said  rollo i think it is going to be a superb day tomorrow  so do i said rollo  at least said mr george i should think so if i were in america the wind has all gone down and the western sky is full of golden clouds shining in roseate splendor  mr george enunciated these highsounding words in a pompous and theatrical manner which made rollo laugh very heartily  and to descend from poetry to plain prose said mr george i think we had better take advantage of the fine weather to go to broek tomorrow  very well said rollo that plan suits me exactly  rollo was always ready for any plan which involved the going away from the place where he was to some new place which he had not seen before  but how are we going to find the way there said rollo  i shall take a commissioner said mr george i am going to saandam too where peter the great learned ship carpentry  i have heard something about that said rollo but i dont know much about it  why peter the great was emperor of russia said mr george and he wished to introduce ship building into his dominions so he came to holland to learn about the construction of ships in order that he might be better qualified to take the direction of the building of a fleet in russia saandam was the place that he came to while he was there he lived in a small wooden house near the place where the ship building was going on that house is there now and almost every body that comes to this part of the country goes to see it  how long ago was it that he was there asked rollo  it was more than one hundred and fifty years ago said mr george  i should not think a wooden house would have lasted so long said rollo  it would not have lasted so long replied mr george if they had not taken special pains to preserve it they have built a brick house around it and over it to protect it from the weather and so it has been preserved now i think we had better go tomorrow and see broek and also saandam and i am going to take a commissioner  mr george had employed a commissioner once before as the reader will perhaps recollect namely at the hague and perhaps i ought to stop here a moment to explain more fully what a commissioner is he is a servant hired by the day to conduct strangers about the town where they reside and about the environs if necessary to show them what there is that is curious and wonderful there these men are called sometimes commissioners and sometimes valets de place and in their way they are very useful  if a traveller arrives at a hotel in the morning at any important town in europe before he has been in his room fifteen minutes he generally hears a knock at his door and on bidding the person come in a welldressed looking servant man appears and asks  shall you wish for a commissioner sir today  or if the gentleman after remaining in his room a few minutes takes his wife or his daughter or whomever he may have travelling with him and goes out from the door of the hotel he is pretty sure to be met near the door by one or more of these men who accost him earnestly saying  do you want a commissioner sir or shall i show you the way sir or would you like to see the museum sir  when a traveller intends to remain some days in a place he has generally no occasion for a commissioner since in his rambles about the town he usually finds all the places of interest himself and in such a case the importunities of the commissioners seeking employment are sometimes annoying to him but if his time is very short or if he wishes to make excursions into the neighborhood of a town where he does not understand the language of the people then such a servant is of very great advantage  mr george thought that his proposed excursion to broek and saandam was an occasion on which a commissioner could be very advantageously employed accordingly after he and rollo had finished their dinner which they took at a round table near a window in the coffee room he asked rollo to ring the bell  rollo did so and a waiter came in  send me in a commissioner if you please said mr george  very well sir said the waiter with a bow  the waiter went out and in a few minutes a welldressed and very respectable looking young man came in and advancing towards mr george said  did you wish to see a commissioner sir  yes said mr george i want to make some inquiries about going to broek and to saandam tomorrow i want to know what the best way is to go and what the expenses will be  so saying mr george took out a pencil and a piece of paper from his pocket in order to make a memorandum of what the commissioner should say  in the first place asked mr george what is your name i shall want to know what to call you  my name is james said the commissioner  well now james said mr george i want you to tell me what the best way is to go and what all the expenses will be i want to know every thing beforehand  well sir said james we shall go first by the ferry boat across to the y7 and there we shall take the trekschuyt for a short distance on the canal  footnote 7 the y is the name of the sheet of water which lies before amsterdam it is a sort of harbor  and how much will that cost asked mr george  for the three fortyfive cents said james  he meant of course dutch cents it takes two and a half dutch cents to make one american cent  there continued james we take a carriage  and how much will the carriage be asked mr george  to go to broek and back and then to saandam will be ten guilders  mr george made memoranda of these sums on his paper as james named them  and the tolls continued james will be one guilder and twentyfive cents more  and the driver asked mr george  in most of the countries of europe when you make a bargain for the carriage the drivers services are not included in it he expects a fee besides  the driver fifty cents half a guilder said james  is that enough for him asked mr george  yes sir said james thats enough  we will call it seventyfive cents said mr george so saying he wrote seventyfive  then there will be some fees to pay i suppose said mr george both at broek and at saandam  yes sir said james we pay twentyfive cents at the dairy twentyfive cents at the garden and twentyfive to the hostler that makes seventyfive and the same at saandam to see the hut of peter the great and the house that makes one guilder fifty centimes  is that all asked mr george  there will be fortyfive cents for the ferry coming back said james  mr george added this sum to the column and then footed it up the amount was nearly fifteen guilders  we will call it fifteen guilders said he tomorrow i will give you fifteen guilders and you will pay all expenses and then what shall i have to pay you for your services  my charge is four guilders for the day said james  very well said mr george and at what time in the morning will it be best to set out  there is a boat at nine oclock said james  then we will leave here at half past eight we will have breakfast rollo at eight or perhaps we can have breakfast at broek is there a hotel there james  yes sir said james there is a hotel there  very well then we will wait till we get there before we take breakfast and we will expect you at half past eight our room is number eleven  the arrangement being thus fully made the commissioner promising to be punctual bowed and retired  now rollo said mr george tomorrow we will have a good time after i give the commissioner the fifteen guilders i shall have no further care or responsibility but shall be taken along over the whole ground as if i were a child under the care of his father  illustration     chapter ix  the great canal  the commissioner knocked at mr georges door at the time appointed mr george and rollo were both ready mr george counted out the fifteen guilders on the table and james put them in his pocket the party then set out  mr george wished to stop by the way to put a letter in the post office and to pay the postage of it he desired to do this personally for he wished to inquire whether the letter would go direct so james led them by the way of the post office and conducted mr george into the office where foreign letters were received and the payment of postage taken for them here james served as interpreter indeed it is one of the most important duties of a commissioner to serve as an interpreter to his employer whenever his services are required in this capacity  when the letter was put in the party resumed their walk the commissioner went on before carrying mr georges travelling shawl and the umbrella and mr george and rollo followed the way lay along a narrow street by the side of a canal there were a thousand curious sights to be seen both among the boats on the canal and along the road but rollo could not stop to examine them for the commissioner walked pretty fast  i wish he would not walk so fast said rollo  ah yes said mr george he is right this morning for we want to get to the pier in time for the boat but in walking about the town to see it it would be a great trouble to us  tomorrow we will go about by ourselves said rollo and stop when and where we please  we will said mr george  at last the party came out to what may be called the front of the city where they could look off upon the harbor this harbor is a sheet of water called the y which has been before referred to the morning was bright and beautiful and the water was covered with ships steamers barges boats and vessels of every form and size going to and fro the steamers passed swiftly but the sailing vessels scarcely moved so calm and still was the morning air the sun was shining and the whole scene presented to mr georges and rollos view as they looked out over the water was extremely brilliant and beautiful  the commissioner led the way out over a long pier supported by piles to a sort of landing platform at a distance from the shore this place was quite large it had a tavern upon it and a great many different offices belonging to the different lines of steamers and piers projecting in different directions for the different boats and steamers to land at it stood at some distance from the shore and the whole had the appearance of a little village on an island it would have been an island indeed if there had been any land about it but there was not it was built wholly on piles  here were crowds of people going and coming on this stage some having just landed from the different steamers that had just arrived and some about to embark in others that were going away small boats were coming too over the water with passengers in them among whom were many peasant girls whose foreheads and temples were adorned with a profusion of golden ornaments such as are worn by the ladies of north holland rollo looked this way and that as he passed along the stage and he wished for time to stop and examine what he saw but the commissioner walked rapidly on and led the way to the ferry boat  you will walk on board said james while i get the tickets  so mr george and rollo went over the plank on board the boat while james turned to a little office that stood near to get the tickets  there was a man standing at the end of the plank to collect the tickets as the passengers came on board mr george as he passed pointed back to the office where james had gone the man bowed and he and rollo passed on  how independent we are said mr george i shall have nothing to do with making any payments all day today and it will seem as if we were travelling free  the ferry boat was of a very singular construction and most singular looking people they were who were on board of it it had a great flat deck which was of an oval form and was spreading out very wide at the sides there were seats here and there in different places but no awning or shelter of any kind overhead rollo was glad of this for the morning was so fine and the view on every side was so magnificent that he was very much pleased to have it so wholly unobstructed  as soon as the chimes of the city clocks began to strike for nine the various steamboats began to shoot out in different directions from the piers of the landing and soon the ferry boat began to move too she moved however very slowly  what a slow and clumsy boat said rollo  im glad she is slow replied mr george for i want to look about i should be willing to be an hour in going across this ferry  the prospect on every side was indeed very fine on looking back they could see the buildings of the town extending far and wide for miles with domes and towers and spires and tops of trees and masts of ships rising together every where above the tops of the houses the water of the harbor was covered with ships and steamers passing to and frothose near glittering in the sun while the distant ones were half lost in a smoky haze that every where softened and concealed the horizon mr george and rollo gazed earnestly on this scene looking now in this direction and now in that but not speaking a word  when they were about half across the y james came to mr george and said  this ferry boat connects with a steamer on the canal which goes to the helder and also with various trekschuyts we shall take a trekschuyt to go for a short distanceas far as to the place where we shall get a carriage  very well said mr george arrange it as you think best then we shall go a short distance on the great canal  yes sir said james you will like to see a little of the canal  i shall indeed said mr george  the great canal of which james here spoke is the grandest work of the kind in holland and perhaps in the world if you look at the map you will see that amsterdam stands somewhat in the interior of the country and that the only approach to it by sea is through a great gulf called the zuyder zee now the water in the zuyder zee is shallow there are channels it is true that are tolerably deep but they are very winding and intricate and they are so surrounded with shoals and sand banks as to make the navigation very difficult especially for ships of large size  the people accordingly conceived the plan of digging a canal across the country from amsterdam to the nearest place where there was deep water on the sea this was at a point of land called the helder  the reason why there was deep water there was that that was the outlet for the zuyder zee and the water rushing in there when the tide is rising and out again when it goes down keeps the channel deep and clear  so it was determined to make a canal from the helder to amsterdam but the land was lower almost all the way than the sea this rendered it impossible to construct the canal so as to make it of the same level with the sea without building up the banks of it to an inconvenient height besides it was just as well to make the canal lower than the sea and then to build gates at each end of it to prevent the sea water from coming in  then how were the ships to get in asked rollo when mr george explained this to him  why there were two ways replied mr george by which ships might get in you see although the canal is lower than the sea is generally there is an hour or two every day when the tide goes down in which the two are about on a level accordingly by opening the gates when the tide is low a communication would be made by which the vessels could sail in and out  but that would be inconvenient i should think said rollo not to have the gates open but twice a day  yes said mr george and so to enable them to admit ships at any time they have built locks at each end  like the locks in a common canal in america said rollo  yes said mr george and by means of these locks ships can be taken in and out at any time  i dont exactly understand how they do it said rollo  let me explain it to you then replied mr george listen attentively and picture to your mind precisely what i describe and see if you understand  first continued mr george imagine that you are down by the sea shore where the canal ends the water in the sea is higher than it is in the canal and there are two sets of gates at a little distance from each other near the mouth of the canal which keep the water of the sea from flowing in  yes said rollo i can picture that to my mind but how far apart are the two sets of gates  a little farther apart said mr george than the length of the longest ship of course one pair of these locks is towards the sea and the other towards the canal i will call the first the sea gates and the other the canal gates the space between the two gates is called the lock  yes said rollo i understand all that  now continued mr george a ship comes in we will suppose and is to be taken into the canal first the men open the sea gates the sea can now flow into the lock but it cannot get into the canal because the canal gates are still shut  yes said rollo  and now you see continued mr george that as the water in the lock is high and on a level with the sea the ship can sail into the lock  but it cant get down into the canal said rollo  no replied mr george not yet but now the men shut the sea gates and thus shut the ship in they then open the passages through the canal gates and this lets the water out of the lock until it subsides to the level of that in the canal and the ship settles down with it but the sea cannot come in for the sea gates that are now behind the ship are shut when the water in the lock has gone down to the canal level then they can open the gates and the ship can sail along out of the lock into the canal  thus they lock the ship down into the canal at one end and when she has passed through the canal they lock her up into the y again at the other  yes said rollo i understand it now and shall we go into the canal through the locks in this way  i dont know said mr george ill ask james  so mr george beckoned to james to come to him and asked him whether they should enter the canal through the lock  no said james the ferry boat does not go into the canal at all we go into a little dock or harbor by the side of it and the passengers walk over the dike and down to the canal where they find the boats ready for them that they are to take  why dont they pass from those boats through the locks and let them come across to amsterdam asked rollo and then we might get on board them there and so not have to change from one boat to the other  because it takes some time and some trouble said james to pass any thing through the locks and it is not worth while to do it except in case of large and valuable ships so the boats and steamers that ply along the canal are left inside the lock and the passengers are taken to and from them by the ferry boat  the ferry boat by this time began to approach the shore it entered into a little opening in the land which formed a sort of harbor here the passengers were landed at a wharf which was surrounded by small buildings thence they ascended what was evidently a large dike when they reached the top of the dike they saw below them on the other side of it the beginning of the canal it lay several feet lower than the water of the harbor in which they had left the ferry boat but it was quite wide and it was bordered by broad dikes with avenues of trees upon them on either side on one side under the trees was a tow path and on the other a broad and smoothly gravelled road  two boats were lying moored to the wharves at the side of the canal one was a long sharp and narrow steamer which was going through the whole length of the canal to the helder the other was a trekschuyt or canal boat which was going only a short way to the nearest village  the passengers that came in the ferry boat divided into two parties as they came down the dike one party went to the steamer the other to the trekschuyt mr george and rollo of course went with the last  the trekschuyt was a curious sort of boat it was built like the noahs ark made for children to play with that is it was a broad boat with a house in it the roof of the house which formed the deck of the boat was flat and there were seats along the sides of it and a railing behind them on the margin to keep people from falling off at each end of the house were two flights of steps leading up to the roof or deck and below them another flight which led down to the little cabins below  as soon as rollo got on board he first ran up on the deck he sat down on the seat upon one side and then after looking about a moment he ran over to the other side and sat down there then he got up and said that he was going below to look at the cabins  mr george all the time stood quietly on the deck looking at the canal and at the country around he could see the canal extending in a winding direction across the country but the view of it was soon lost as the winding of its course brought the dikes on the sides of it in the way so that they concealed the water he could however trace its course for some distance by the masts and sails of vessels which he saw at different distances rising among the green trees along the dike on one side was a high road and on the other a tow path different boats were coming and going in the part of the canal that was near they were drawn by long and slender lines that were fastened to a tall mast set up near the bows of the boat some were drawn by men and some by horses  illustration the trekschuyt  before the trekschuyt had gone far after it commenced its voyage a great ship was seen coming on the canal she was coming from the helder it was a ship that had come from the west indies and was going to amsterdam the wind was contrary for her and they could not use their sails and so they were drawing her along by horses there were two teams of horses eight in each team the view of these teams walking along the tow path with the immense ship following them in the canal presented a very imposing spectacle  the trekschuyt started before the helder steamer but it had not gone far before rollo who had now ascended to the deck again saw her coming up behind very rapidly  i tell you what it is uncle george said he i wish you and i were on board that steamer and were going along the whole length of the canal  so do i said mr george  could not we get on board asked rollo  no said mr george we cannot change our plan today very well but now that we have found the way we can come over here any morning we please and take the helder steamer  lets come said rollo eagerly lets come tomorrow  well see about that said mr george see here comes a market boat  yes said rollo the man is towing it and his wife is steering  now we will see how they pass said rollo  there was no difficulty about passing for as soon as the man who was towing the market boat found that the trekschuyt had come up to his line he stopped suddenly and the advance of his boat caused his line to drop into the water the trekschuyt then sailed right over it by this simple manoeuvre boats and vessels could pass each other very easily and generally the manoeuvre was executed in a prompt and very skilful manner but once when they were passing a boat the woman who was steering it put the helm the wrong way and though the captain of the trekschuyt and also the husband of the woman who was on the shore shouted to her repeatedly in a loud and angry manner she could not get it right again in time to avoid a collision the trekschuyt gave the boat a dreadful bump as it went by fortunately however it did no harm except to frighten the poor woman and break their tow line  after going on in this way for fifteen or twenty minutes along the canal the trekschuyt arrived at its place of destination and mr george and rollo disembarked at a little village of very neat and pretty houses built along the dike on one side of the canal  illustration     chapter x  the dairy village   mr george and rollo walked ashore in a very independent manner having the commissioner to attend to the tickets they went up to the top of the dike and waited for the commissioner to come to them  while i am getting the carriage ready said the commissioner when he came perhaps you will like to take a walk on the bridge where there is a very fine view but first perhaps you will look at the carriage and choose the one that you will like  so saying james led the way into a sort of stable where there were a great many very nice and pretty carriages arranged very snugly together mr george was surprised to see so many he asked james how it happened  o there is a great deal of travelling on the roads about here said james the country is very rich and populous and the people of amsterdam come out a great deal  some of the carriages were very elegant one of these an hostler took out and told mr george that he could have it if he chose there was another which was much less elegant but it was more open  let us take the open one said rollo we can see so much better  so they decided upon the open one and then while the hostlers were harnessing the horses mr george and rollo went forward to the bridge  the bridge led over a branch canal which here comes into the main canal the road to it lay along the dike and formed the street of a little village it was paved with bricks placed edgewise and was as neat as a parlor floor the houses were all on one side they were very small but they were so neat and pretty and the forms of them were so strange and queer that they looked like play houses or like a scene in fairy land rather than like the real habitations of men  there were pretty gardens by them which extended down the slope of the dike the slopes of the dikes are always very gradual and very nice gardens can be made on them  mr george and rollo stood on the bridge and looked up and down the canals on either side they saw boats with people in them getting ready to set out on their voyages  i wonder where that canal leads to said rollo  o it goes off into the interior of the country some where said mr george the country is as full of canals as massachusetts is of roads  i should like very much said rollo to get on board that boat with that man and go with him wherever he is going  so should i if i knew dutch said mr george so that i could talk with him as we sailed along  how pretty it is all about here said rollo what a queer villagebuilt on a bank and what a funny road it looks like a play road  the road where it led through the village did indeed present a very singular appearance it was very narrow indeed being barely wide enough for one carriage to pass and leaving scarcely room on the side for a child to crowd up against the house and let it go by on the other side was a row of trees with green grass beneath covering the banks of the canal  after mr george and rollo had been standing a few minutes on the bridge they saw that the carriage was nearly ready so they went back to the place and got in the top of the carriage was turned entirely down so that they could see about them in every direction as they rode along james mounted on the box outside with the driver  now said rollo in a tone of great satisfaction we will have a very first rate ride  the carriage drove along through the little street which has already been described rollo could reach his hand out and almost touch the houses as they rode by there were little shops kept in some of the houses and the things that were for sale were put up at the windows they looked exactly as if children had arranged them for play  after leaving the village the road turned and followed the dike of a branch canal the views on every side were extremely beautiful the canal was carried along between its two banks high above the rest of the country and here and there at moderate distances from each other wind mills were to be seen busy at work pumping up water from the drains in the fields and pouring it into the canal the fields were covered with herds of cattle and flocks of sheep and here and there were parties of men mowing the grass or loading the newmade hay into boats that lay floating in the small canals which bordered the fields  in looking about over the country there were wind mills to be seen in all directions their long arms slowly revolving in the air and interspersed among them were the masts and sails of sloops and schooners that were sailing to and fro along the canals as the water of these canals was often hidden from view by the dikes which bordered them it seemed as if the ships and steamers were sailing on the land in the midst of green fields and trees and smiling villages  after going on in this way for an hour or more the carriage approached the village which mr george and rollo were going to see the village lay on the borders of a canal which was here quite broad and as the road approached it on the other side of the canal it was in full view for mr george and rollo as the party approached it the houses were close to the margin of the water they were very neat and pretty and were most of them painted green many of them had little canals by the side of them like lanes of water leading into the rear of the houses and the prettiest little porticoes and trellises and piazzas and pavilions and summer houses were seen in every part the road went winding round a wide basin and then after crossing a bridge the carriage stopped at an inn  the inn was entirely outside of the village the commissioner said that they must walk through the village for there was no carriage road through it at all  so mr george and rollo dismounted and the hostlers came out from the stable to unharness the horses  now rollo said mr george we will go in and order a breakfast and then we will take our walk through the village while it is getting ready  yes said rollo i should like some breakfast very much  what shall we have asked mr george  what you like replied rollo you always get good breakfasts  well said mr george we will tell them the old story  just at this moment james came up to the door of the hotel where mr george and rollo had been standing during this conversation  you may order breakfast for us james said mr george and let them have it ready for us when we get back from our walk  yes sir said james and what will you have  biftek aux pommes8 said mr george and coffee and let them give us some of their best cheese  footnote 8 pronounced biftekopom this is a very favorite breakfast in france and every where in fact throughout europe mr george liked it better than any thing else not only for his breakfast but also for his dinner it consists of very tender beefsteaks deliciously seasoned and accompanied with sliced potatoes fried in a peculiar manner and arranged all around the margin of the dish  the commissioner went in to give the order  uncle george said rollo i think youll be known all through this country as the beefsteak and fried potato man  mr george laughed  well said he there could not be a more agreeable idea than that to be associated with my memory  the truth is that both mr george and rollo liked the biftek aux pommes better than almost any thing else that they could have whether for breakfast or dinner  after having given the order for the breakfast to a very nice and tidylooking dutch girl whose forehead and temples were adorned with a profusion of golden ornaments after the fashion of the young women of north holland the commissioner came back and the whole party set out to walk through the village there were no streets properly so called but only walks about as wide as the gravel walks of a garden which meandered about among the houses and yards in a most extraordinary manner there were beautiful views from time to time presented over the water of the canal on which the village was situated and there were a great number of small canals which seemed to penetrate every where with the prettiest little bridges over them and landing steps and bowers and pavilions along the borders of them and gaylypainted boats fastened at kitchen doors and a thousand other suchlike objects characteristic of the intimate intermingling of land and water which prevails in this extraordinary country  illustration the dairy village  every thing was however on so small a scale and so scrupulously neat and pretty that it looked more like a toy village than one built for the everyday residence of real men  after walking on for about a quarter of a mile the commissioner said that he would show them the interior of one of the dairy houses where the cheeses were madefor the business of this town was the making of cheeses from the milk of the cows that feed on the green polders that lie all around them  the stalls for the cows said james are in the same house in which the family lives but the cows are not kept there in summer and so we shall find the stalls empty  so saying james turned aside up a little paved walk which led to the door of a very pretty looking house he opened the door without any ceremony and mr george and rollo went in  the door was near one end of the house and it opened into a passage way which extended back through the whole depth of it on one side was a row of stalls or cribs for the cows on the other were doors opening into the rooms used for the family a very nice looking dutch woman who had apparently seen the party from her window came out through this side door into the passage way to welcome them when they came  the stalls for the cows were all beautifully made and they were painted and decorated in such an extraordinary manner that no one could have imagined for what use they were intended the floors for them were made of the glazed tiles so often used in holland and the partitions between them were nicely rubbed as bright as a ladys sideboard the cribs too were now in the absence of the cows occupied with various little étagères and sets of shelves which were covered with fancy cups and saucers china images and curiosities of all sortsthe dutch housewives taking a special pride in the collection of such things  the row of cribs was separated from the floor of the passage way by a sort of trench about a foot and a half wide and ten inches deep and outside this trench and also within it at the entrances to the cribs were arrayed a great number of utensils employed in the work of the dairy such as tubs cans cheese presses moulds and other such things these were all beautifully made and being mounted with brass which had received the highest polish by constant rubbing they gave to the whole aspect of the place an exceedingly gay and brilliant appearance  some of this apparatus was in use there were tubs standing with the curd or whey in them and cheeses in press or in pickle and various other indications that the establishment was a genuine one and was then in active operation the cheeses were of the round kind so often seen for sale at the grocers stores in boston and new york they looked like so many big cannon balls  after walking down the passage way that led by the side of cribs and examining all these things in detail the party returned to the door where they had come in and then turning to the left went into the rooms of the house the first room was the bedroom the second was the parlor these rooms were both completely crowded with antique looking furniture among which were cabinets of chinese ware and ornaments of every kind and all was in such a brilliant condition of nicety and polish as made the spectacle wonderful to behold  the bed was in a recess shut up by doors when the doors were opened the bed place looked precisely like a berth on board ship  after looking at all these things as long as they wished mr george and rollo bade the woman good by and james gave her half a guilder the party then withdrew  well uncle george said rollo and what do you think of that  i think it is a very extraordinary spectacle said mr george and it is very curious to think how such a state of things has come about  and how has it come about asked rollo  why here replied mr george for a thousand years for aught i know the people have been living from generation to generation with no other employment than taking care of the cows that feed on the polders around and making the milk into cheese that is a business which requires neatness every kind of dairy business does so that here is a place where a current was set towards neatness a thousand years ago and it has been running ever since and this is what it has come to  talking in this manner of what they had seen mr george and rollo returned to the inn and there they found an excellent breakfast they were waited upon at the table by the young woman who had so many golden ornaments in her hair and besides the biftek aux pommes and the coffee and the hot milk and the nice butter there was the half of one of the round cheeses such as they had seen in process of making at the dairy  illustration     chapter xi  conclusion   after finishing their breakfast mr george and rollo entered the carriage again and returned by the same way that they came for some miles towards amsterdam until they came to the place where the road turned off to go to saandam after proceeding for some distance upon one of the inland dikes they came at length to the margin of the sea and then for several miles the road lay along the great sea dike which here defends the land from the ingress of the ocean  ah said mr george as soon as they entered upon this portion of the road here we come to one of the great sea dikes how glad i am  so am i said rollo i wanted to see one of the sea dikes  it is very much like the others said mr george only it is much larger  yes said rollo and see how it winds about along the shore  in looking forward in the direction in which rollo pointed the dike could be traced for a long distance in its course like an immense railroad embankment winding in and out in a most remarkable manner in conformity to the indentations of the shore in one respect it differed from a railroad embankment namely in being bordered and overshadowed by avenues of immense trees which showed how many ages ago the dike had been built there is not a railroad embankment in the world that has been built long enough for such immense trees to have had time to grow  the carriage road lay along the top of the dike which was very broad and the slopes of it towards the water on one side and towards the low meadow lands on the other were very gradual men were at work every where along these slopes cutting the second crop of grass and making it into hay where the hay was ready to be got in the men were at work loading it into boats that lay in the little canals that extend along the sides of the dike at the foot of the slopes  wind mills were to be seen every where all about the horizon as the road approached saandam these mills became more and more numerous  i mean to see if i can count them said rollo  you cannot count them i am sure said mr george  rollo began but when he got up to a hundred he gave up the undertaking in despair mr george told him that he read in the guide book that there were four thousand wind mills in that region  some of these wind mills were very small indeed and there were two or three which looked so cunning as rollo said that he wished very much that he had one of them to take with him to america  the use of these very small wind mills was to pump up the water from some very limited tract of land which for some reason or other happened to lie a few inches lower than the rest  at last after an infinite number of turnings and windings by means of which every part of the surrounding country was brought in succession into view before mr george and rollo as they sat in their carriage they arrived at the town of saandam  the town consists of two streets one on each embankment of a great canal the streets are closely built up for many miles along the canal but the town does not extend laterally at all on account of the ground falling off immediately to very low polders  illustration cabin of peter the great  after entering the street the commissioner left the carriage in order that the horses might rest and led mr george and rollo on a walk through the prettiest part of the town they walked about half a mile along the canal on one side and then crossing by a ferry they came back on the other side  in the course of this walk they went to see the hut where peter the great lived while he was in holland engaged in studying ship building in the ship yards of saandam the hut itself was old and dilapidated but it was covered and protected by a good substantial building of brick with open arches all around which allowed the hut to be seen while the roof and walls of the building protected it from the rain the hut was situated in a very pretty little garden  there were two rooms in the hut and one of themthe one shown in the engravinghad a very curiouslooking dutch fireplace in one corner of it and a ladder to go up to the loft above the chairs were very curious indeed the seats being threecornered and the back and arms being constructed in a very singular manner  the walls of the rooms were perfectly covered in every part with the names of visitors who had come from all countries to see the rooms besides these there were a great many volumes of books filled with names these books lay on a great table which stood at one side of the room there was one of the books which was not yet full and this one lay open on the table with a pen and ink near it in order that fresh visitors as fast as they came might enter their names  after looking at this cabin as long as they wished and entering their names in the book mr george and rollo left the hut and returned through one of the main streets of the town to the place where they had left their carriage the carriage was soon ready for them and they set out to go back to amsterdam  they had a delightful drive back going as they came on the top of the great sea dike on one side they could look off over a wide expanse of water with boats and steamers and ships moving to and fro in every direction over it on the other side they overlooked a still wider expanse of low and level green fields intersected every where with canals of water and avenues of trees and with a perfect forest of wind mills in the horizon                                       as they were riding quietly along upon this dike on the return to amsterdam rollo had the opportunity of imparting to mr george some valuable information in respect to peter the great  i am glad that i have had an opportunity to see the workshop of peter the great said mr george it is very curious indeed but i dont know much about peter the great the first opportunity i get i mean to read an account of his life and i advise you to do the same  i have read about him said rollo i found a book about him in a steamboat that we came in and i read all about his coming to holland  then tell me about it said mr george  why you see said rollo he was at war with the turks and he fought them and drove them off to the southward until at last he came to the sea of asoph then he could not fight them any more unless he could get some ships so he made a law for all the great boyars of his kingdom that every one of them must build or buy him a ship what are boyars uncle george  nobles said mr george  i thought it must be something like that replied rollo  the old nobility of those russian countries are called boyars said mr george but i dont know why most of the common people are slaves to them  well at any rate said rollo he made a law that every one of them or at least all that were rich enough should build or buy him a ship but they did not know how to build ships themselves and so they were obliged to send to holland for ship builders they built more and better ships in holland in those days than in any country in the world  yes i suppose so said mr george  the boyars did not like it very well to be obliged to build these ships continued rollo and there was another thing that they disliked still more  what was that asked mr george  why the emperor made them send off their sons to be educated in different foreign countries replied rollo you see in those days russia was very little civilized and peter concluded that it would help to introduce civilization into the country if the sons of the principal men went to other great cities for some years to study sciences and arts so he sent some of them to paris and some to berlin and some to amsterdam and some to rome but most of them did not like to go  thats strange said mr george i should have thought they would have liked to go very much  at least their fathers did not like to send them said rollo perhaps on account of the expense and some of the young men did not like to go there was one that was sent to venice in order that he might see and learn every thing that he could there that would be of advantage to his own country but he was so cross about it that when he got to venice he shut himself up in his house and declared that he would not see or learn any thing at all  he was a very foolish fellow i think said mr george  yes said rollo i think he was but ive seen boys in school act just so they get put out with the teacher for something or other and then they wont try to understand the lesson  that is punishing themselves and not the teacher said mr george but go on about peter  after a while continued rollo peter concluded to make a journey himself his plan was to go to all the most civilized countries and into all the finest cities in europe and see what he could learn that would be of use in his own dominions so he fitted out a grand expedition he took a number of ambassadors and generals and great potentates of all kinds with him these men were dressed in splendid uniforms and travelled in great state and had grand receptions in all the great towns that they came to but peter himself did nothing of the kind he dressed plainly like a common man so that wherever he went he could ramble about at liberty and see what he wanted to see in peace and quietness while all the people were running after the procession of ambassadors and grandees  that was a good plan said mr george  an excellent plan rejoined rollo in some of the seaports that he visited he used to put on a sort of a pea jacket such as the dutch skippers wore and go about in that along the wharves and docks and look at all the shipping  but he was most interested in going to holland continued rollo for that was the country where they built the best ships besides the first vessel that he ever saw happened to be a dutch vessel i forgot to tell you about that  yes replied mr george tell me now  why it was some years before this time said rollotwo or three i believethat he first saw a vessel there was a country place with a handsome house and pleasure grounds belonging to the royal family i forget what the name of it was but that is no matter one time after peter came to the throne he went out to this country place to spend a few days he found on the grounds a sort of artificial winding canal or pond with pretty trees on the banks of it on this canal was a yacht which had been built in holland and brought there for the people to sail in when they came to that palace the yacht had not been used much and was lying neglected at the wharf but peter immediately had it put in order and took a sail in it and he liked it very much indeed  was it the first vessel that he ever saw asked mr george  yes said rollo i believe it was or at least it was the first that he ever particularly noticed he liked sailing in it and then besides there was one of his officers there who had travelled in other countries in europe where people had ships and navies and he told peter what great advantages they gained from them not only in carrying goods from place to place but in transporting armies and fighting their enemies at sea  peter thought a great deal about this and when he went back to moscow which was then the capital he inquired and found that there were some people from holland there he asked them if they knew how to build ships some of them said they did then he asked them if they could not build him some small vessels just like the dutch ships of war they said they could so he made a bargain with them and they built him several  do you know how many asked mr george  not exactly replied rollo there were several small vessels and i remember that there were four frigates and each frigate had four guns i dont suppose the guns were very large  four guns is a very small armament for a frigate said mr george  yes replied rollo very small indeed but you see peter did not want them for real service but only for models as it were  and what did he do with them when they were done asked mr george  they were launched into a lake there was in that part of the country said rollo and there the emperor used to sail about in them and have sham fights  but all this you must understand continued rollo took place two or three years before peter drove the turks off from the southern part of his empire so as to get to the sea and it was not till then that he began to have real ships built of large size and now when he was going to holland he of course remembered the old dutch yacht which he had on his pleasure grounds and the small frigates which they had built him and the large ones too which they had built for the boyars and he felt a great interest in going to see the ship yards he determined that while he was in holland he would spend as much time as he could in learning all about ship building  it is very curious about the emperor and his companys entering amsterdam continued rollo when the government there heard that he was coming they made grand preparations to receive him they got the cannon all ready on the ramparts to fire salutes and drew out the soldiers and all the doors and windows were crowded with spectators they prepared a great number of illuminations too and fireworks for the night but just before the party arrived at amsterdam the emperor slipped away in a plain dress and left the ambassadors and generals and grandees to go in by themselves the people of amsterdam did not know this they supposed that some one or other of the people dressed so splendidly in the procession was peter and so they shouted and waved their flags and their handkerchiefs and fired the cannon and made a great parade generally  and peter himself was not there at all said mr george  no said rollo he slipped away and came in privately with a few merchants to accompany him and instead of going to the great palace which the government of amsterdam had provided and fitted up for him he left that to his ambassadors and went himself to a small house by a ship yard where he could be at liberty and go and come when he pleased  and afterwards i suppose he went to saandam said mr george  yes sir replied rollo saandam was a great place for building ships in those days they say that while he was there he went to work regularly like a ship carpenter as if he wished to learn the trade himself but i dont believe he worked a great deal  no said mr george i presume he did not he probably took the character and dress of a workman chiefly for the purpose of making himself more at home in the ship yards and about the wharves indeed i cant see what useful end could be gained by his learning to do work himself he could not expect to build ships himself when he should return to russia  no said rollo i expect he wanted to see exactly how the ships were built and how the yards were managed and he thought he could do this better if he went among the workmen as one of their number  i presume so said mr george i am very glad you found the book and i am much obliged to you for all this information  soon after this mr george and rollo arrived safely at amsterdam                                       rollo and mr george remained after this some days in amsterdam and they were very much entertained with what they saw there in the streets and with the curious manners and customs of the people                                         publications of  brown taggard  chase  successors to  w j reynolds  co no 24 cornhill boston

most fully my approbation of its plan and execution  on two or three questions of minor importance i might come to different conclusions from the authorbut inasmuch as he has devoted much time to a careful research into the subject of parliamentary rules and practice i am free to admit that i should feel great distrust in any opinions which i have held even on these questions where they differ

the press a new manual of parliamentary practice having examined the manuscript of this work with considerable care we take occasion to say that it will be a valuable accession to the libraries of those who are called upon to preside in deliberative assemblies and we believe the necessity of such a work as this has been very generally felt in our country where almost every citizen is occasionally called upon to exercise the duties of a presiding officer the work is founded upon the wellestablished rules and customs of the british parliament and mr cushing divests himself of all local usages prevailing in different parts of this country maintaining in the outset that no assembly can ever be subject to any other rules than those which are of general application or which it specially adopts for its own government and denying explicitly that the rules adopted and practised upon by a legislative assembly thereby acquire the character of general laws   published by  brown
