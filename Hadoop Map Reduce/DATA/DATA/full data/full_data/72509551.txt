72509551	literary friends and acquaintancescambridge neighbors  by william dean howells    cambridge neighbors  being the wholly literary spirit i was when i went to make my home in cambridge i do not see how i could well have been more content if i had found myself in the elysian fields with an agreeable eternity before me at twentynine indeed one is practically immortal and at that age time had for me the effect of an eternity in which i had nothing to do but to read books and dream of writing them in the overflow of endless hours from my work with the manuscripts critical notices and proofs of the atlantic monthly as for the social environment i should have been puzzled if given my choice among the elect of all the ages to find poets and scholars more to my mind than those still in the flesh at cambridge in the early afternoon of the nineteenth century they are now nearly all dead and i can speak of them in the freedom which is deaths doubtful favor to the survivor but if they were still alive i could say little to their offence unless their modesty was hurt with my praise     i  one of the first and truest of our cambridge friends was that exquisite intelligence who in a world where so many people are grotesquely miscalled was most fitly named for no man ever kept here more perfectly and purely the heart of such as the kingdom of heaven is of than francis j child he was then in his prime and i like to recall the outward image which expressed the inner man as happily as his name he was of low stature and of an inclination which never became stoutness but what you most saw when you saw him was his face of consummate refinement very regular with eyes always glassed by goldrimmed spectacles a straight short most sensitive nose and a beautiful mouth with the sweetest smile mouth ever wore and that was as wise and shrewd as it was sweet in a time when every other man was more or less bearded he was clean shaven and of a delightful freshness of coloring which his thick sunny hair clustering upon his head in close rings admirably set off i believe he never became gray and the last time i saw him though he was broken then with years and pain his face had still the brightness of his inextinguishable youth  it is well known how great was professor childs scholarship in the branches of his harvard work and how especially how uniquely effective it was in the study of english and scottish balladry to which he gave so many years of his life he was a poet in his nature and he wrought with passion as well as knowledge in the achievement of as monumental a task as any american has performed but he might have been indefinitely less than he was in any intellectual wise and yet been precious to those who knew him for the gentleness and the goodness which in him were protected from misconception by a final dignity as delicate and as inviolable as that of longfellow himself  we were still much less than a year from our life in venice when he came to see us in cambridge and in the italian interest which then commended us to so many fine spirits among our neighbors we found ourselves at the beginning of a lifelong friendship with him i was known to him only by my letters from venice which afterwards became venetian life and by a bit of devotional verse which he had asked to include in a collection he was making but he immediately gave us the freedom of his heart which after wards was never withdrawn in due time he imagined a homeschool to which our little one was asked and she had her first lessons with his own daughter under his roof these things drew us closer together and he was willing to be still nearer to me in any time of trouble at one such time when the shadow which must some time darken every door hovered at ours he had the strength to make me face it and try to realize while it was still there that it was not cruel and not evil it passed for that time but the sense of his help remained and in my own case i can testify of the potent tenderness which all who knew him must have known in him but in bearing my witness i feel accused almost as if he were present by his fastidious reluctance from any recognition of his helpfulness when this came in the form of gratitude taking credit to itself in a pose which reflected honor upon him as the architect of greatness he was delightfully impatient of it and he was most amusingly dramatic in reproducing the consciousness of certain ineffectual alumni who used to overwhelm him at commencement solemnities with some such pompous acknowledgment as professor child all that i have become sir i owe to your influence in my college career he did with delicious mockery the oldfashioned intellectual poseurs among the students who used to walk the groves of harvard with bent head and the left arm crossing the back while the other lodged its hand in the breast of the high buttoned frockcoat and i could fancy that his classes in college did not form the sunniest exposure for young folly and vanity i know that he was intolerant of any manner of insincerity and no flattery could take him off his guard i have seen him meet this with a cutting phrase of rejection and no man was more apt at snubbing the patronage that offers itself at times to all men but mostly he wished to do people pleasure and he seemed always to be studying how to do it as for need i am sure that worthy and unworthy want had alike the way to his heart  children were always his friends and they repaid with adoration the affection which he divided with them and with his flowers i recall him in no moments so characteristic as those he spent in making the little ones laugh out of their hearts at his drolling some festive evening in his house and those he gave to sharing with you his joy in his gardening this i believe began with violets and it went on to roses which he grew in a splendor and profusion impossible to any but a true lover with a genuine gift for them like lowell he spent his summers in cambridge and in the afternoon you could find him digging or pruning among his roses with an ardor which few caprices of the weather could interrupt he would lift himself from their ranks which he scarcely overtopped as you came up the footway to his door and peer purblindly across at you if he knew you at once he traversed the nodding and swaying bushes to give you the hand free of the trowel or knife or if you got indoors unseen by him he would come in holding towards you some exquisite blossom that weighed down the tip of its long stem with a succession of hospitable obeisances  he graced with unaffected poetry a life of as hard study of as hard work and as varied achievement as any i have known or read of and he played with gifts and acquirements such as in no great measure have made reputations he had a rare and lovely humor which could amuse itself both in english and italian with such an airy burletta as il pesceballo he wrote it in metastasian italian and lowell put it in libretto english he had a critical sense as sound as it was subtle in all literature and whatever he wrote he imbued with the charm of a style finely personal to himself his learning in the line of his harvard teaching included an early english scholarship unrivalled in his time and his researches in ballad literature left no corner of it untouched i fancy this part of his study was peculiarly pleasant to him for he loved simple and natural things and the beauty which he found nearest life at least he scorned the pedantic affectations of literary superiority and he used to quote with joyous laughter the swelling exclamation of an italian critic who proposed to leave the summits of polite learning for a moment with the cry scendiamo fra il popolo let us go down among the people     ii  of course it was only so hard worked a man who could take thought and trouble for another he once took thought for me at a time when it was very important to me and when he took the trouble to secure for me an engagement to deliver that course of lowell lectures in boston which i have said lowell had the courage to go in town to hear i do not remember whether professor child was equal to so much but he would have been if it were necessary and i rather rejoice now in the belief that he did not seek quite that martyrdom  he had done more than enough for me but he had done only what he was always willing to do for others in the form of a favor to himself he brought into my fife the great happiness of intimately knowing hjalmar hjorth boyesen whom he had found one summer day among the shelves in the harvard library and found to be a poet and an intending novelist i do not remember now just how this fact imparted itself to the professor but literature is of easily cultivated confidence in youth and possibly the revelation was spontaneous at any rate as a susceptible young editor i was asked to meet my potential contributor at the professors two oclock dinner and when we came to coffee in the study boyesen took from the pocket nearest his heart a chapter of gunnar and read it to us  perhaps the good professor who brought us together had plotted to have both novel and novelist make their impression at once upon the youthful subeditor but at any rate they did not fail of an effect i believe it was that chapter where gunnar and ragnhild dance and sing a stev together for i associate with that far happy time the rich mellow tones of the poets voice in the poets verse these were most characteristic of him and it is as if i might put my ear against the ethereal wall beyond which he is rapt and hear them yet  our meeting was on a lovely afternoon of summer and the odor of the professors roses stole in at the open windows and became part of the gentle event boyesen walked home with me and for a fortnight after i think we parted only to dream of the literature which we poured out upon each other in every waking moment i had just learned to know bjornsons stories and boyesen told me of his poetry and of his drama which in even measure embodied the great norse literary movement and filled me with the wonder and delight of that noble revolt against convention that brave return to nature and the springs of poetry in the heart and the speech of the common people literature was boyesens religion more than the swedenborgian philosophy in which we had both been spiritually nurtured and at every step of our mounting friendship we found ourselves on common ground in our worship of it i was a decade his senior but at thirtyfive i was not yet so stricken in years as not to be able fully to rejoice in the ardor which fused his whole being in an incandescent poetic mass i have known no man who loved poetry more generously and passionately and i think he was above all things a poet his work took the shape of scholarship fiction criticism but poetry gave it all a touch of grace and beauty some years after this first meeting of ours i remember a pathetic moment with him when i asked him why he had not written any verse of late and he answered as if still in sad astonishment at the fact that he had found life was not all poetry in those earlier days i believe he really thought it was  perhaps it really is and certainly in the course of a life that stretched almost to half a century boyesen learned more and more to see the poetry of the everyday world at least as the material of art he did battle valiantly for that belief in many polemics which i suppose gave people a sufficiently false notion of him and he showed his faith by works in fiction which better illustrated his motive gunnar stands at the beginning of these works and at the farthest remove from it in matter and method stands the mammon of unrighteousness the lovely idyl won him fame and friendship and the great novel added neither to him though he had put the experience and the observation of his ripened life into it whether it is too late or too early for it to win the place in literature which it merits i do not know but it always seemed to me the very spite of fate that it should have failed of popular effect yet i must own that it has so failed and i own this without bitterness towards gunnar which embalmed the spirit of his youth as the mammon of unrighteousness embodied the thought of his manhood     iii  it was my pleasure my privilege to bring gunnar before the public as editor of the atlantic monthly and to second the author in many a struggle with the strange idiom he had cast the story in the proofs went back and forth between us till the author had profited by every hint and suggestion of the editor he was quick to profit by any hint and he never made the same mistake twice he lived his english as fast as he learned it the right word became part of him and he put away the wrong word with instant and final rejection he had not learned american english without learning newspaper english but if one touched a phrase of it in his work he felt in his nerves which are the ultimate arbiters in such matters its difference from true american and true english it was wonderful how apt and how elect his diction was in those days it seemed as if his thought clothed itself in the fittest phrase without his choosing in his poetry he had extraordinary good fortune from the first his mind had an apparent affinity with what was most native most racy in our speech and i have just been looking over gunnar and marvelling anew at the felicity and the beauty of his phrasing  i do not know whether those who read his books stop much to consider how rare his achievement was in the mere means of expression our speech is rather more hospitable than most and yet i can remember but five other writers born to different languages who have handled english with anything like his mastery two italians ruffini the novelist and gallenga the journalist two germans carl schurz and carl hillebrand and the dutch novelist maarten maartens have some of them equalled but none of them surpassed him yet he was a man grown when he began to speak and to write english though i believe he studied it somewhat in norway before he came to america what english he knew he learned the use of here and in the measure of its idiomatic vigor we may be proud of it as americans  he had least of his native grace i think in his criticism and yet as a critic he had qualities of rare temperance acuteness and knowledge he had very decided convictions in literary art one kind of thing he believed was good and all other kinds less good down to what was bad but he was not a bigot and he made allowances for artinerror his hand fell heavy only upon those heretics who not merely denied the faith but pretended that artifice was better than nature that decoration was more than structure that makebelieve was something you could live by as you live by truth he was not strongest however in damnatory criticism his spirit was too large too generous to dwell in that and it rose rather to its full height in his appreciations of the great authors whom he loved and whom he commented from the plenitude of his scholarship as well as from his delighted sense of their grandeur here he was almost as fine as in his poetry and only less fine than in his more fortunate essays in fiction  after gunnar he was a long while in striking another note so true he did not strike it again till he wrote the mammon of unrighteousness and after that he was sometimes of a wandering and uncertain touch there are certain stories of his which i cannot read without a painful sense of their inequality not only to his talent but to his knowledge of human nature and of american character he understood our character quite as well as he understood our language but at times he seemed not to do so i think these were the times when he was overworked and ought to have been resting instead of writing in such fatigue one loses command of alien words alien situations and in estimating boyesens achievements we must never forget that he was born strange to our language and to our life in gunnar he handled the one with grace and charm in his great novel he handled both with masterly strength i call the mammon of unrighteousness a great novel and i am quite willing to say that i know few novels by born americans that surpass it in dealing with american types and conditions it has the vast horizon of the masterpieces of fictions its meanings are not for its characters alone but for every reader of it when you close the book the story is not at an end  i have a pang in praising it for i remember that my praise cannot please him any more but it was a book worthy the powers which could have given us yet greater things if they had not been spent on lesser things boyesen could toil terribly but for his fame he did not always toil wisely though he gave himself as utterly in his unwise work as in his best it was always the best he could do several years after our first meeting in cambridge he went to live in new york a city where money counts for more and goes for less than in any other city of the world and he could not resist the temptation to write more and more when he should have written less and less he never wrote anything that was not worth reading but he wrote too much for one who was giving himself with all his conscience to his academic work in the university honored by his gifts and his attainments and was lecturing far and near in the vacations which should have been days and weeks and months of leisure the wonder is that even such a stock of health as his could stand the strain so long but he had no vices and his only excesses were in the direction of the work which he loved so well when a man adds to his achievements every year we are apt to forget the things he has already done and i think it well to remind the reader that boyesen who died at fortyeight had written besides articles reviews and lectures unnumbered four volumes of scholarly criticism on german and scandinavian literature a volume of literary and social essays a popular history of norway a volume of poems twelve volumes of fiction and four books for boys  boyesens energies were inexhaustible he was not content to be merely a scholar merely an author he wished to be an active citizen to take his part in honest politics and to live for his day in things that most men of letters shun his experience in them helped him to know american life better and to appreciate it more justly both in its good and its evil and as a matter of fact he knew us very well his acquaintance with us had been wide and varied beyond that of most of our literary men and touched many aspects of our civilization which remain unknown to most americans when he died he had been a journalist in chicago and a teacher in ohio he had been a professor in cornell university and a literary free lance in new york and everywhere his eyes and ears had kept themselves open as a teacher he learned to know the more fortunate or the more ambitious of our youth and as a lecturer his knowledge was continually extending itself among all ages and classes of americans  he was through and through a norseman but he was none the less a very american between norsk and yankee there is an affinity of spirit more intimate than the ties of race both have the commonsense view of life both are unsentimental when boyesen told me that among the norwegians men never kissed each other as the germans and the frenchmen and the italians do i perceived that we stood upon common ground when he explained the democratic character of society in norway i could well understand how he should find us a little behind his own countrymen in the practice if not the theory of equality though they lived under a king and we under a president but he was proud of his american citizenship he knew all that it meant at its best for humanity he divined that the true expression of america was not civic not social but domestic almost and that the people in the simplest homes or those who remained in the tradition of a simple home life were the true americans as yet whatever the future americans might be  when i first knew him he was chafing with the impatience of youth and ambition at what he thought his exile in the west there was to be sure a difference between urbana ohio and cambridge massachusetts and he realized the difference in the extreme and perhaps beyond it i tried to make him believe that if a man had one or two friends anywhere who loved letters and sympathized with him in his literary attempts it was incentive enough but of course he wished to be in the centres of literature as we all do and he never was content until he had set his face and his foot eastward it was a great step for him from the swedenborgian school at urbana to the young university at ithaca and i remember his exultation in making it but he could not rest there and in a few years he resigned his professorship and came to new york where he entered highheartedly upon the struggle with fortune which ended in his appointment in columbia  new york is a mart and not a capital in literature as well as in other things and doubtless he increasingly felt this i know that there came a time when he no longer thought the west must be exile for a literary man and his latest visits to its summer schools as a lecturer impressed him with the genuineness of the interest felt there in culture of all kinds he spoke of this with a due sense of what was pathetic as well as what was grotesque in some of its manifestations and i think that in reconciling himself to our popular crudeness for the sake of our popular earnestness he completed his naturalization in the only sense in which our citizenship is worth having  i do not wish to imply that he forgot his native land or ceased to love it proudly and tenderly he kept for norway the fondness which the man sitting at his own hearth feels for the home of his boyhood he was of good family his people were people of substance and condition and he could have had an easier life there than here he could have won even wider fame and doubtless if he had remained in norway he would have been one of that group of great norwegians who have given their little land renown surpassed by that of no other in the modern republic of letters the name of boyesen would have been set with the names of bjornson of ibsen of kielland and of lie but when once he had seen america at the wish of his father who had visited the united states before him he thought only of becoming an american when i first knew him he was full of the poetry of his motherland his talk was of fjords and glaciers of firs and birches of hulders and nixies of housemen and gaardsmen but he was glad to be here and i think he never regretted that he had cast his lot with us always of course he had the deepest interest in his country and countrymen he stood the friend of every norwegian who came to him in want or trouble and they came to him freely and frequently he sympathized strongly with norway in her quarrel with sweden and her wish for equality as well as autonomy and though he did not go all lengths with the national party he was decided in his feeling that sweden was unjust to her sister kingdom and strenuous for the principles of the norwegian leaders  but as i have said poetry was what his ardent spirit mainly meditated in that hour when i first knew him in cambridge before we had either of us grown old and sad if not wise he overflowed with it and he talked as little as he dreamed of anything else in the vast halfsummer we spent together he was constantly at my house where in an absence of my family i was living bachelor and where we sat indoors and talked or sauntered outdoors and talked with our heads in a cloud of fancies not unmixed with the mosquitoes of cambridge if i could have back the fancies i would be willing to have the mosquitoes with them he looked the poetry he lived his eyes were the blue of sunlit fjords his brown silken hair was thick on the crown which it later abandoned to a scholarly baldness his soft red lips half hid a boyish pout in the youthful beard and mustache he was short of stature but of a stalwart breadth of frame and his voice was of a peculiar and endearing quality indescribably mellow and tender when he read his verse  i have hardly the right to dwell so long upon him here for he was only a sojourner in cambridge but the memory of that early intimacy is too much for my sense of proportion as i have hinted our intimacy was renewed afterwards when i too came to live in new york where as long as he was in this dolce lome he hardly let a week go by without passing a long evening with me our talk was still of literature and life but more of life than of literature and we seldom spoke of those old times i still found him true to the ideals which had clarified themselves to both of us as the duty of unswerving fealty to the real thing in whatever we did this we felt as we had felt it long before to be the sole source of beauty and of art and we warmed ourselves at each others hearts in our devotion to it amidst a misunderstanding environment which we did not characterize by so mild an epithet boyesen indeed outrealisted me in the polemics of our aesthetics and sometimes when an unbeliever was by i willingly left to my friend the affirmation of our faith not without some quaking at his unsparing strenuousness in disciplining the heretic but now that ardent and active soul is elsewhere and i have ceased even to expect the ring which making itself heard at the late hour of his coming i knew always to be his and not anothers that mechanical expectation of those who will come no more is something terrible but when even that ceases we know the irreparability of our loss and begin to realize how much of ourselves they have taken with them     iv  it was some years before the boyesen summer which was the fourth or fifth of our life in cambridge that i made the acquaintance of a man very much my senior who remains one of the vividest personalities in my recollection i speak of him in this order perhaps because of an obscure association with boyesen through their religious faith which was also mine but henry james was incommensurably more swedenborgian than either of us he lived and thought and felt swedenborg with an entirety and intensity far beyond the mere assent of other men he did not do this in any stupidly exclusive way but in the most luminously inclusive way with a constant reference of these vain mundane shadows to the spiritual realities from which they project his piety which sometimes expressed itself in terms of alarming originality and freedom was too large for any ecclesiastical limits and one may learn from the books which record it how absolutely individual his interpretations of swedenborg were clarifications they cannot be called and in that other world whose substantial verity was the inspiration of his life here the two sages may by this time have met and agreed to differ as to some points in the doctrine of the seer in such a case i cannot imagine the apostle giving way and i do not say he would be wrong to insist but i think he might now be willing to allow that the exegetic pages which sentence by sentence were so brilliantly suggestive had sometimes a collective opacity which the most resolute vision could not penetrate he put into this dark wisdom the most brilliant intelligence ever brought to the service of his mystical faith he lighted it up with flashes of the keenest wit and bathed it in the glow of a lambent humor so that it is truly wonderful to me how it should remain so unintelligible but i have only tried to read certain of his books and perhaps if i had persisted in the effort i might have found them all as clear at last as the one which seems to me the clearest and is certainly most encouragingly suggestive i mean the one called society the redeemed form of man  he had his whole being in his belief it had not only liberated him from the bonds of the calvinistic theology in which his youth was trammelled but it had secured him against the conscious ethicism of the prevailing unitarian doctrine which supremely worshipped conduct and it had colored his vocabulary to such strange effects that he spoke of moral men with abhorrence as more hopelessly lost than sinners any one whose sphere tempted him to recognition of the foibles of others he called the devil but in spite of his perception of such diabolism he was rather fond of yielding to it for he had a most trenchant tongue i myself once fell under his condemnation as the devil by having too plainly shared his joy in his characterization of certain fellowmen perhaps a group of bostonians from whom he had just parted and whose reciprocal pleasure of themselves he presented in the image of simmering in their own fat and putting a nice brown on each other  swedenborg himself he did not spare as a man he thought that very likely his life had those lapses in it which some of his followers deny and he regarded him on the aesthetical side as essentially commonplace and as probably chosen for his prophetic function just because of his imaginative nullity his tremendous revelations could be the more distinctly and unmistakably inscribed upon an intelligence of that sort which alone could render again a strictly literal report of them  as to some other sorts of believers who thought they had a special apprehension of the truth he had no mercy upon them if they betrayed however innocently any selfcomplacency in their possession i went one evening to call upon him with a dear old shaker elder who had the misfortune to say that his people believed themselves to be living the angelic life james fastened upon him with the suggestion that according to swedenborg the most celestial angels were unconscious of their own perfection and that if the shakers felt they were of angelic condition they were probably the sport of the hells i was very glad to get my poor old friend off alive and to find that he was not even aware of being cut asunder i did not invite him to shake himself  with spiritualists james had little or no sympathy he was not so impatient of them as the swedenborgians commonly are and he probably acknowledged a measure of verity in the spiritistic phenomena but he seemed rather incurious concerning them and he must have regarded them as superfluities of naughtiness mostly as emanations from the hells his powerful and penetrating intellect interested itself with all social and civil facts through his religion he was essentially religious but he was very consciously a citizen with most decided opinions upon political questions my own darkness as to anything like social reform was then so dense that i cannot now be clear as to his feeling in such matters but i have the impression that it was far more radical than i could understand he was of a very merciful mind regarding things often held in pitiless condemnation but of charity as it is commonly understood he had misgivings he would never have turned away from him that asketh but he spoke with regret of some of his benefactions in the past large gifts of money to individuals which he now thought had done more harm than good  i never knew him to judge men by the society scale he was most human in his relations with others and was in correspondence with all sorts of people seeking light and help he answered their letters and tried to instruct them and no one was so low or weak but he or she could reach him on his or her own level though he had his humorous perception of their foibles and disabilities and he had that keen sense of the grotesque which often goes with the kindliest nature he told of his dining early in life next a fellowman from cape cod at the astor house where such a man could seldom have found himself when they were served with meat this neighbor asked if he would mind his putting his fat on jamess plate he disliked fat james said that he considered the request and seeing no good reason against it consented  he could be cruel with his tongue when he fancied insincerity or pretence and then cruelly sorry for the hurt he gave he was indeed tremulously sensitive not only for himself but for others and would offer atonement far beyond the measure of the offence he supposed himself to have given  at all times he thought originally in words of delightful originality which painted a fact with the greatest vividness of a person who had a nervous twitching of the face and who wished to call up a friend to them he said he spasmed to the fellow across the room and introduced him his written style had traits of the same bold adventurousness but it was his speech which was most captivating as i write of him i see him before me his white bearded face with a kindly intensity which at first glance seemed fierce the mouth humorously shaping the mustache the eyes vague behind the glasses his sensitive hand gripping the stick on which he rested his weight to ease it from the artificial limb he wore     v  the goethean face and figure of louis agassiz were in those days to be seen in the shady walks of cambridge to which for me they lent a weimarish quality in the degree that in weimar itself a few years ago i felt a quality of cambridge agassiz of course was swiss and latin and not teutonic but he was of the continental european civilization and was widely different from the other cambridge men in everything but love of the place he is always an europaen said lowell one day in distinguishing concerning him and for any one who had tasted the flavor of the life beyond the ocean and the channel this had its charm yet he was extremely fond of his adoptive compatriots and no alien born had a truer or tenderer sense of new england character i have an idea that no one else of his day could have got so much money for science out of the general court of massachusetts and i have heard him speak with the wisest and warmest appreciation of the hard material from which he was able to extract this treasure the legislators who voted appropriations for his museum and his other scientific objects were not usually lawyers or professional men with the perspectives of a liberal education but were hardfisted farmers who had a grip of the states money as if it were their own and yet gave it with intelligent munificence they understood that he did not want it for himself and had no interested aim in getting it they knew that as he once said he had no time to make money and wished to use it solely for the advancement of learning and with this understanding they were ready to help him generously he compared their liberality with that of kings and princes when these patronized science with a recognition of the superior plebeian generosity it was on the veranda of his summer house at nahant while he lay in the hammock talking of this that i heard him refer also to the offer which napoleon iii had made him inviting him upon certain splendid conditions to come to paris after he had established himself in cambridge he said that he had not come to america without going over every such possibility in his own mind and deciding beforehand against it he was a republican by nationality and by preference and was entirely satisfied with his position and environment in new england  outside of his scientific circle in cambridge he was more friends with longfellow than with any one else i believe and longfellow told me how after the doctors had condemned agassiz to inaction on account of his failing health he had broken down in his friends study and wept like an europaer and lamented i shall never finish my work some papers which he had begun to write for the magazine in contravention of the darwinian theory or part of it which it is known agassiz did not accept remained part of the work which he never finished after his death i wished professor jeffries wyman to write of him in the atlantic but he excused himself on account of his many labors and then he voluntarily spoke of agassizs methods which he agreed with rather than his theories being himself thoroughly darwinian i think he said agassiz was the first to imagine establishing a fact not from a single example but from examples indefinitely repeated if it was a question of something about robins for instance he would have a hundred robins examined before he would receive an appearance as a fact  of course no preconception or prepossession of his own was suffered to bar his way to the final truth he was seeking and he joyously renounced even a conclusion if he found it mistaken i do not know whether mrs agassiz has put into her interesting life of him a delightful story which she told me about him he came to her beaming one day and demanded you know i have always held such and such an opinion about a certain group of fossil fishes yes yes well i have just been readings new book and he has shown me that there isnt the least truth in my theory and he burst into a laugh of unalloyed pleasure in relinquishing his error  i could touch science at cambridge only on its literary and social side of course and my meetings with agassiz were not many i recall a dinner at his house to mr bret harte when the poet came on from california and agassiz approached him over the coffee through their mutual scientific interest in the last meeting of the geological society upon the stanislow he quoted to the author some passages from the poem recording the final proceedings of this body which had particularly pleased him and i think mr harte was as much amused at finding himself thus in touch with the savant as agassiz could ever have been with that delicious poem  agassiz lived at one end of quincy street and james almost at the other end with an interval between them which but poorly typified their difference of temperament the one was all philosophical and the other all scientific and yet towards the close of his life agassiz may be said to have led that movement towards the new position of science in matters of mystery which is now characteristic of it he was ancestrally of the swiss brahminical caste as so many of his friends in cambridge were of the brahminical caste of new england and perhaps it was the line of ancestral pasteurs which at last drew him back or on to the affirmation of an unformulated faith of his own at any rate before most other savants would say that they had souls of their own he became by opening a summer school of science with prayer nearly as consolatory to the unscientific who wished to believe they had souls as mr john fiske himself though mr fiske as the archapostle of darwinism had arrived at nearly the same point by such a very different road  mr fiske had been our neighbor in our first cambridge home and when we went to live in berkeley street he followed with his family and placed himself across the way in a house which i already knew as the home of richard henry dana the author of two years before the mast like nearly all the other cambridge men of my acquaintance dana was very much my senior and like the rest he welcomed my literary promise as cordially as if it were performance with no suggestion of the condescension which was said to be his attitude towards many of his fellowmen i never saw anything of this in fact and i suppose he may have been a blend of those patrician qualities and democratic principles which made lowell anomalous even to himself he is part of the antislavery history of his time and he gave to the oppressed his strenuous help both as a man and a politician his gifts and learning in the law were freely at their service he never lost his interest in those white slaves whose brutal bondage he remembered as bound with them in his two years before the mast and any luckless seaman with a case or cause might count upon his friendship as surely as the black slaves of the south he was able to temper his indignation for their oppression with a humorous perception of what was droll in its agents and circumstances and i wish i could recall all that he said once about seaetiquette on merchant vessels where the chief mate might no more speak to the captain at table without being addressed by him than a subject might put a question to his sovereign he was amusing in his stories of the pacific trade in which he said it was very noble to deal in furs from the northwest and very ignoble to deal in hides along the mexican and south american coasts every ships master wished naturally to be in the furcarrying trade and in one of danas instances two vessels encounter in midocean and exchange the usual parley as to their respective ports of departure and destination the final demand comes through the trumpet what cargo and the captain so challenged yields to temptation and roars back furs a moment of hesitation elapses and then the questioner pursues here and there a horn  there were other distinctions of which seafaring men of other days were keenly sensible and dana dramatized the meeting of a great swelling east indiaman with a little atlantic trader which has hailed her she shouts back through her captains trumpet that she is from calcutta and laden with silks spices and other orient treasures and in her turn she requires like answer from the sail which has presumed to enter into parley with her what cargo the trader confesses to a mixed cargo for boston and to the final question her master replies in meek apology only from liverpool sir and scuttles down the horizon as swiftly as possible  dana was not of the cambridge men whose calling was in cambridge he was a lawyer in active practice and he went every day to boston one was apt to meet him in those horsecars which formerly tinkled back and forth between the two cities and which were often so full of ones acquaintance that they had all the social elements of an afternoon tea they were abusively overcrowded at times of course and one might easily see a prime literary celebrity swaying from a strap or hanging uneasily by the handrail to the lower steps of the back platform i do not mean that i ever happened to see the author of two years before the mast in either fact but in his celebrity he had every qualification for the illustration of my point his book probably carried the american name farther and wider than any american books except those of irving and cooper at a day when our writers were very little known and our literature was the only infant industry not fostered against foreign ravage but expressly left to harden and strengthen itself as it best might in a heartless neglect even at home the book was delightful and i remember it from a reading of thirty years ago as of the stuff that classics are made of i venture no conjecture as to its present popularity but of all books relating to the sea i think it is the best the author when i knew him was still richard henry dana jr his father the aged poet who first established the name in the public recognition being alive though past literary activity it was distinctively a literary race and in the actual generation it has given proofs of its continued literary vitality in the romance of espiritu santo by the youngest daughter of the dana i knew     vii  there could be no stronger contrast to him in origin education and character than a man who lived at the same time in cambridge and who produced a book which in its final fidelity to life is not unworthy to be named with two years before the mast ralph keeler wrote the vagabond adventures which he had lived i have it on my heart to name him in the presence of our great literary men not only because i had an affection for him tenderer than i then knew but because i believe his book is worthier of more remembrance than it seems to enjoy i was reading it only the other day and i found it delightful and much better than i imagined when i accepted for the atlantic the several papers which it is made up of i am not sure but it belongs to the great literature in that fidelity to life which i have spoken of and which the author brought himself to practise with such difficulty and under so much stress from his editor he really wanted to fake it at times but he was docile at last and did it so honestly that it tells the history of his strange career in much better terms than it can be given again he had been as he claimed a cruel uncles ward in his early orphanhood and while yet almost a child he had run away from home to fulfil his hearts desire of becoming a clogdancer in a troupe of negro minstrels but it was first his fate to be cabinboy and bootblack on a lake steamboat and meet with many squalid adventures scarcely to be matched outside of a spanish picaresque novel when he did become a dancer and even a danseuse of the sort he aspired to be the fruition of his hopes was so little what he imagined that he was very willing to leave the floating palace on the mississippi in which his troupe voyaged and exhibited and enter the college of the jesuit fathers at cape girardeau in missouri they were very good to him and in their charge he picked up a good deal more latin if not less greek than another strolling player who also took to literature from college keeler went to europe and then to california whence he wrote me that he was coming on to boston with the manuscript of a novel which he wished me to read for the magazine i reported against it to my chief but nothing could shake keelers faith in it until he had printed it at his own cost and known it fail instantly and decisively he had come to cambridge to see it through the press and he remained there four or five years with certain brief absences then during the cuban insurrection of the early seventies he accepted the invitation of a new york paper to go to cuba as its correspondent  dont go keeler i entreated him when he came to tell me of his intention theyll garrote you down there  well he said with the air of being pleasantly interested by the coincidence as he stood on my study hearth with his feet wide apart in a fashion he had and gayly flirted his hand in the air thats what aldrich says and hes agreed to write my biography on condition that i make a last dying speech when they bring me out on the plaza to do it if i had taken the advice of my friend t b aldrich author of marjorie daw and other people i should not now be in this place  he went and he did not come back he was not indeed garroted as his friends had promised but he was probably assassinated on the steamer by which he sailed from santiago for he never arrived in havana and was never heard of again  i now realize that i loved him though i did as little to show it as men commonly do if i am to meet somewhere else the friends who are no longer here i should like to meet ralph keeler and i would take some chances of meeting in a happy place a soul which had by no means kept itself unspotted but which in all its consciousness of error cheerfully trusted that the almighty was not going to scoop any of us the faith worded so grotesquely could not have been more simply or humbly affirmed and no man i think could have been more helplessly sincere he had nothing of that false selfrespect which forbids a man to own himself wrong promptly and utterly when need is and in fact he owned to some things in his checkered past which would hardly allow him any sort of selfrespect he had always an essential gaiety not to be damped by any discipline and a docility which expressed itself in cheerful compliance why do you use bias for opinion i demanded in going over a proof with him oh because im such an asssuch a biass  he had a philosophy which he liked to impress with a vivid touch on his listeners shoulder put your finger on the present moment and enjoy it its the only one youve got or ever will have this light and joyous creature could not but be a pariah among our brahmins and i need not say that i never met him in any of the great cambridge houses i am not sure that he was a persona grata to every one in my own for keeler was framed rather for mens liking and mr aldrich and i had our subtleties as to whether his mind about women was not so chinese as somewhat to infect his manner keeler was too really modest to be of any rebellious mind towards the society which ignored him and of too sweet a cheerfulness to be greatly vexed by it he lived on in the house of a suave old actor who oddly made his home in cambridge and he continued of a harmless bohemianism in his daily walk which included lunches at boston restaurants as often as he could get you to let him give them you if you were of his acquaintance on a sunday he would appear coming out of the postoffice usually at the hour when all cultivated cambridge was coming for its letters and wave a glad hand in air and shout a blithe salutation to the friend he had marked for his companion in a morning stroll the stroll was commonly over the flats towards brighton i do not know why except perhaps that it was out of the beat of the better element and the talk was mainly of literature in which he was doing less than he meant to do and which he seemed never able quite to feel was not a branch of the show business and might not be legitimately worked by like advertising though he truly loved and honored it  i suppose it was not altogether a happy life and keeler had his moments of amusing depression which showed their shadows in his smiling face he was of a slight figure and low stature with hands and feet of almost womanish littleness he was very blonde and his restless eyes were blue he wore his yellow beard in whiskers only which he pulled nervously but perhaps did not get to droop so much as he wished     viii  keeler was a native of ohio and there lived at cambridge when i first came there an indianian more accepted by literary society who was of real quality as a poet forceythe willson whose poem of the old sergeant doctor holmes used to read publicly in the closing year of the civil war was of a western altitude of figure and of an extraordinary beauty of face in an oriental sort he had large dark eyes with clouded whites his full silken beard was of a flashing persian blackness he was excessively nervous to such an extreme that when i first met him at longfellows he could not hold himself still in his chair i think this was an effect of shyness in him as well as physical for afterwards when i went to find him in his own house he was much more at ease  he preferred to receive me in the dim large hall after opening his door to me himself and we sat down there and talked i remember of supernatural things he was much interested in spiritualism and he had several stories to tell of his own experience in such matters but none was so good as one which i had at second hand from lowell who thought it almost the best ghost story he had ever heard the spirit of willsons father appeared to him and stood before him willson was accustomed to apparitions and so he said simply wont you sit down father the phantom put out his hand to lay hold of a chairback as some people do in taking a seat and his shadowy arm passed through the framework ah he said i forgot that i was not substance  i do not know whether the old sergeant is ever read now it has probably passed with other great memories of the great war and i am afraid none of willsons other verse is remembered but he was then a distinct literary figure and not to be left out of the count of our poets i did not see him again shortly afterwards i heard that he had left cambridge with signs of consumption which must have run a rapid course for a very little later came the news of his death     ix  the most devoted cantabrigian after lowell whom i knew would perhaps have contended that if he had stayed with us willson might have lived for john holmes affirmed a faith in the virtues of the place which ascribed almost an aseptic character to its air and when he once listened to my own complaints of an obstinate cold he cheered himself if not me with the declaration well one thing mr howells cambridge never let a man keep a cold yet  if he had said it was better to live in cambridge with a cold than elsewhere without one i should have believed him as it was cambridge bore him out in his assertion though she took her own time to do it  lowell had talked to me of him before i met him celebrating his peculiar humor with that affection which was not always so discriminating and holmes was one of the first cambridge men i knew i knew him first in the charming old colonial house in which his famous brother and he were born it was demolished long before i left cambridge but in memory it still stands on the ground since occupied by the hemenway gymnasium and shows for me through that bulk a phantom frame of continental buff in the shadow of elms that are shadows themselves the genius loci was limping about the pleasant mansion with the rheumatism which then expressed itself to his friends in a resolute smile but which now insists upon being an essential trait of the fulllength presence to my mind a short stout figure helped out with a cane and a grizzled head with features formed to win the heart rather than the eye of the beholder  in one of his own eyes there was a cast of such winning humor and geniality that it took the liking more than any beauty could have done and the sweetest shy laugh in the world went with this cast  i long wished to get him to write something for the magazine and at last i prevailed with him to review a history of cambridge which had come out  he did it charmingly of course for he loved more to speak of cambridge than anything else he held his native town in an idolatry which was not blind but which was none the less devoted because he was aware of her droll points and her weak points he always celebrated these as so many virtues and i think it was my own passion for her that first commended me to him i was not her son but he felt that this was my misfortune more than my fault and he seemed more and more to forgive it after we had got upon the terms of editor and contributor we met oftener than before though i do not now remember that i ever persuaded him to write again for me once he gave me something and then took it back with a selfdistrust of it which i could not overcome  when the holmes house was taken down he went to live with an old domestic in a small house on the street amusingly called appian way he had certain rooms of her and his own table but he would not allow that he was ever anything but a lodger in the place where he continued till he died in the process of time he came so far to trust his experience of me that he formed the habit of giving me an annual supper some days before this event he would appear in my study and with divers delicate and tentative approaches nearly always of the same tenor he would say that he should like to ask my family to an oyster supper with him but you know he would explain i havent a house of my own to ask you to and i should like to give you the supper here when i had agreed to this suggestion with due gravity he would inquire our engagements and then say as if a great load were off his mind well then i will send up a few oysters tomorrow or whatever day we had fixed on and after a little more talk to take the strangeness out of the affair would go his way on the day appointed the fishman would come with several gallons of oysters which he reported mr holmes had asked him to bring and in the evening the giver of the feast would reappear with a lank oilcloth bag sagged by some bottles of wine there was always a bottle of red wine and sometimes a bottle of champagne and he had taken the precaution to send some crackers beforehand so that the supper should be as entirely of his own giving as possible he was forced to let us do the cooking and to supply the coldslaw and perhaps he indemnified himself for putting us to these charges and for the use of our linen and silver by the vast superfluity of his oysters with which we remained inundated for days he did not care to eat many himself but seemed content to fancy doing us a pleasure and i have known few greater ones in life than in the hospitality that so oddly played the host to us at our own table  it must have seemed incomprehensible to such a cantabrigian that we should ever have been willing to leave cambridge and in fact i do not well understand it myself but if he resented it he never showed his resentment as often as i happened to meet him after our defection he used me with unabated kindness and sparkled into some gaiety too ethereal for remembrance the last time i met him was at lowells funeral when i drove home with him and curtis and child and in the revulsion from the stress of that saddest event had our laugh as people do in the presence of death at something droll we remembered of the friend we mourned  my nearest literary neighbor when we lived in sacramento street was the rev dr john g palfrey the historian of new england whose chimneytops amid the pinetops i could see from my study window when the leaves were off the little grove of oaks between us he was one of the first of my acquaintances not suffering the great disparity of our ages to count against me but tactfully and sweetly adjusting himself to my youth in the friendly intercourse which he invited he was a most gentle and kindly old man with still an interest in liberal things which lasted till the infirmities of age secluded him from the world and all its interests as is known he had been in his prime one of the foremost of the new england antislavery men and he had fought the good fight with a heavy heart for a brother long settled in louisiana who sided with the south and who after the civil war found himself disfranchised in this temporary disability he came north to visit doctor palfrey upon the doctors insistence though at first he would have nothing to do with him and refused even to answer his letters of course the doctor said i was not going to stand that from my mothers son and i simply kept on writing so he prevailed but the fiery old gentleman from louisiana was reconciled to nothing in the north but his brother and when he came to return my visit he quickly touched upon his cause of quarrel with us i cant vote he declared but my coachman can and i dont know how im to get the suffrage unless my physician paints me all over with the iodine hes using for my rheumatic side  doctor palfrey was most distinctly of the brahminical caste and was long an eminent unitarian minister but at the time i began to know him he had long quitted the pulpit he was so far of civic or public character as to be postmaster at boston when we were first neighbors but this officiality was probably so little in keeping with his nature that it was like a return to his truer self when he ceased to hold the place and gave his time altogether to his history it is a work which will hardly be superseded in the interest of those who value thorough research and temperate expression it is very just and without endeavor for picture or drama it is to me very attractive much that has to be recorded of new england lacks charm but he gave form and dignity and presence to the memories of the past and the finer moments of that great story he gave with the simplicity that was their best setting it seems to me such an apology in the old sense as new england might have written for herself and in fact doctor palfrey was a personification of new england in one of the best and truest kinds he was refined in the essential gentleness of his heart without being refined away he kept the faith of her puritan tradition though he no longer kept the puritan faith and his defence of the puritan severity with the witches and quakers was as impartial as it was efficient in positing the puritans as of their time and rather better and not worse than other people of the same time he was himself a most tolerant man and his tolerance was never weak or fond it stopped well short of condoning error which he condemned when he preferred to leave it to its own punishment personally he was without any flavor of harshness his mind was as gentle as his manner which was one of the gentlest i have ever known  of as gentle make but of more pensive temper with unexpected bursts of lyrical gaiety was christopher pearse cranch the poet whom i had known in new york long before he came to live in cambridge he could not only play and sing most amusing songs but he wrote very good poems and painted pictures perhaps not so good i always liked his venetian pictures for their poetic unsentimentalized veracity and i printed as well as liked many of his poems during the time that i knew him more than his due share of troubles and sorrows accumulated themselves on his fine head which the years had whitened and gave a droop to the beautiful whitebearded face but he had the artist soul and the poet heart and no doubt he could take refuge in these from the cares that shadowed his visage my acquaintance with him in cambridge renewed itself upon the very terms of its beginning in new york we met at longfellows table where he lifted up his voice in the yankee folksong on springfield mountain there did dwell which he gave with a perfectly killing mockgravity     xi  at cambridge the best society was better it seems to me than even that of the neighboring capital it would be rather hard to prove this and i must ask the reader to take my word for it if he wishes to believe it the great interests in that pleasant world which i think does not present itself to my memory in a false iridiscence were the intellectual interests and all other interests were lost in these to such as did not seek them too insistently  people held themselves high they held themselves personally aloof from people not duly assayed their civilization was still puritan though their belief had long ceased to be so they had weights and measure stamped in an earlier time a time surer of itself than ours by which they rated the merit of all comers and rejected such as did not bear the test these standards were their own and they were satisfied with them most americans have no standards of their own but these are not satisfied even with other peoples and so our society is in a state of tolerant and tremulous misgiving  family counted in cambridge without doubt as it counts in new england everywhere but family alone did not mean position and the want of family did not mean the want of it money still less than family commanded one could be openly poor in cambridge without open shame or shame at all for no one was very rich there and no one was proud of his riches  i do not wonder that turguenieff thought the conditions ideal as boyesen portrayed them to him and i look back at my own life there with wonder at my good fortune i was sensible and i still am sensible this had its alloys i was young and unknown and was making my way and i had to suffer some of the penalties of these disadvantages but i do not believe that anywhere else in this illcontrived economy where it is vainly imagined that the material struggle forms a high incentive and inspiration would my penalties have been so light on the other hand the good that was done me i could never repay if i lived all over again for others the life that i have so long lived for myself at times when i had experienced from those elect spirits with whom i was associated some act of friendship as signal as it was delicate i used to ask myself how i could ever do anything unhandsome or ungenerous towards any one again and i had a bad conscience the next time i did it  the air of the cambridge that i knew was sufficiently cool to be bracing but what was of good import in me flourished in it the life of the place had its lateral limitations sometimes its lights failed to detect excellent things that lay beyond it but upward it opened illimitably i speak of it frankly because that life as i witnessed it is now almost wholly of the past cambridge is still the home of much that is good and fine in our literature one realizes this if one names colonel thomas wentworth higginson mr john fiske mr william james mr horace e scudder not to name any others but the first had not yet come back to live in his birthplace at the time i have been writing of and the rest had not yet their actual prominence one in deed among so many absent is still present there whom from time to time i have hitherto named without offering him the recognition which i should have known an infringement of his preferences but the literary cambridge of thirty years ago could not be clearly imagined or justly estimated without taking into account the creative sympathy of a man whose contributions to our literature only partially represent what he has constantly done for the humanities i am sure that after the easy heroes of the day are long forgot and the noisy fames of the strenuous life shall dwindle to their essential insignificance before those of the gentle life we shall all see in charles eliot norton the eminent scholar who left the quiet of his books to become our chief citizen at the moment when he warned his countrymen of the ignominy and disaster of doing wrong     etext editors bookmarks     coldslaw    collective opacity    expectation of those who will come no more    felt that this was my misfortune more than my fault    found life was not all poetry    he had no time to make money    intellectual poseurs    no time to make money    nyc a city where money counts for more and goes for less    one could be openly poor in cambridge without open shame    put your finger on the present moment and enjoy it    standards were their own and they were satisfied with them    wonderful to me how it should remain so unintelligible
