25319395	a tale of three lions  by h rider haggard     chapter i the interest on ten shillings  most of you will have heard that allan quatermain who was one of the party that discovered king solomons mines some little time ago and who afterwards came to live in england near his friend sir henry curtis he went back to the wilderness again as these old hunters almost invariably do on one pretext or another they cannot endure civilization for very long its noise and racket and the omnipresence of broadclothed humanity proving more trying to their nerves than the dangers of the desert i think that they feel lonely here for it is a fact that is too little understood though it has often been stated that there is no loneliness like the loneliness of crowds especially to those who are unaccustomed to them what is there in the world old quatermain would say so desolate as to stand in the streets of a great city and listen to the footsteps falling falling multitudinous as the rain and watch the white line of faces as they hurry past you know not whence you know not whither they come and go their eyes meet yours with a cold stare for a moment their features are written on your mind and then they are gone for ever you will never see them again they will never see you again they come up out of the unknown and presently they once more vanish into the unknown taking their secrets with them yes that is loneliness pure and undefiled but to one who knows and loves it the wilderness is not lonely because the spirit of nature is ever there to keep the wanderer company he finds companions in the windsthe sunny streams babble like natures children at his feet high above them in the purple sunset are domes and minarets and palaces such as no mortal man has built in and out of whose flaming doors the angels of the sun seem to move continually and there too is the wild game following its feedinggrounds in great armies with the springbuck thrown out before for skirmishers then rank upon rank of longfaced blesbuck marching and wheeling like infantry and last the shining troops of quagga and the fierceeyed shaggy vilderbeeste to take as it were the place of the cossack host that hangs upon an armys flanks        this of course was written before mr quatermains      account of the adventures in the newlydiscovered country of      zuvendis of himself sir henry curtis and capt john good      had been received in englandeditor  oh no he would say the wilderness is not lonely for my boy remember that the further you get from man the nearer you grow to god and though this is a saying that might well be disputed it is one i am sure that anybody will easily understand who has watched the sun rise and set on the limitless deserted plains and seen the thunder chariots of the clouds roll in majesty across the depths of unfathomable sky  well at any rate we went back again and now for many months i have heard nothing at all of him and to be frank i greatly doubt if anybody will ever hear of him again i fear that the wilderness that has for so many years been a mother to him will now also prove his grave and the grave of those who accompanied him for the quest upon which he and they have started is a wild one indeed  but while he was in england for those three years or so between his return from the successful discovery of the wise kings buried treasures and the death of his only son i saw a great deal of old allan quatermain i had known him years before in africa and after he came home whenever i had nothing better to do i used to run up to yorkshire and stay with him and in this way i at one time and another heard many of the incidents of his past life and most curious some of them were no man can pass all those years following the rough existence of an elephanthunter without meeting with many strange adventures and in one way and another old quatermain has certainly seen his share well the story that i am going to tell you in the following pages is one of the later of these adventures though i forget the exact year in which it happened at any rate i know that it was the only trip upon which he took his son harry who is since dead with him and that harry was then about fourteen and now for the story which i will repeat as nearly as i can in the words in which hunter quatermain told it to me one night in the old oakpanelled vestibule of his house in yorkshire we were talking about goldmining  goldmining he broke in ah yes i once went goldmining at pilgrims rest in the transvaal and it was after that that we had the business about jimjim and the lions do you know pilgrims rest well it is or was one of the queerest little places you ever saw the town itself was pitched in a stony valley with mountains all about it and in the middle of such scenery as one does not often get the chance of seeing many and many is the time that i have thrown down my pick and shovel in disgust clambered out of my claim and walked a couple of miles or so to the top of some hill then i would lie down in the grass and look out over the glorious stretch of countrythe smiling valleys the great mountains touched with goldreal gold of the sunset and clothed in sweeping robes of bush and stare into the depths of the perfect sky above yes and thank heaven i had got away from the cursing and the coarse jokes of the miners and the voices of those basutu kaffirs as they toiled in the sun the memory of which is with me yet  well for some months i dug away patiently at my claim till the very sight of a pick or of a washingtrough became hateful to me a hundred times a day i lamented my own folly in having invested eight hundred pounds which was about all that i was worth at the time in this goldmining but like other better people before me i had been bitten by the gold bug and now was forced to take the consequences i bought a claim out of which a man had made a fortunefive or six thousand pounds at leastas i thought very cheap that is i gave him five hundred pounds down for it it was all that i had made by a very rough years elephanthunting beyond the zambesi and i sighed deeply and prophetically when i saw my successful friend who was a yankee sweep up the roll of standard bank notes with the lordly air of the man who has made his fortune and cram them into his breeches pockets well i said to himthe happy vendorit is a magnificent property and i only hope that my luck will be as good as yours has been  he smiled to my excited nerves it seemed that he smiled ominously as he answered me in a peculiar yankee drawl i guess stranger as i aint the one to make a man quarrel with his food more especial when there aint no more going of the rounds and as for that there claim well shes been a good nigger to me but between you and me stranger speaking man to man now that there aint any filthy lucre between us to obscure the features of the truth i guess shes about worked out  i gasped the fellows effrontery took the breath out of me only five minutes before he had been swearing by all his godsand they appeared to be numerous and mixedthat there were half a dozen fortunes left in the claim and that he was only giving it up because he was downright weary of shovelling the gold out  dont look so vexed stranger went on my tormentor perhaps there is some shine in the old girl yet anyway you are a downright good fellow you are therefore you will i guess have a real a1 opportunity of working on the feelings of fortune anyway it will bring the muscle up upon your arm for the stuff is uncommon stiff and what is more you will in the course of a year earn a sight more than two thousand dollars in value of experience  then he went just in time for in another moment i should have gone for him and i saw his face no more  well i set to work on the old claim with my boy harry and half a dozen kaffirs to help me which seeing that i had put nearly all my worldly wealth into it was the least that i could do and we worked my word we did workearly and late we went at itbut never a bit of gold did we see no not even a nugget large enough to make a scarfpin out of the american gentleman had secured it all and left us the sweepings  for three months this went on till at last i had paid away all or very near all that was left of her little capital in wages and food for the kaffirs and ourselves when i tell you that boer meal was sometimes as high as four pounds a bag you will understand that it did not take long to run through our banking account  at last the crisis came one saturday night i had paid the men as usual and bought a muid of mealie meal at sixty shillings for them to fill themselves with and then i went with my boy harry and sat on the edge of the great hole that we had dug in the hillside and which we had in bitter mockery named eldorado there we sat in the moonlight with our feet over the edge of the claim and were melancholy enough for anything presently i pulled out my purse and emptied its contents into my hand there was a halfsovereign two florins ninepence in silver no coppersfor copper practically does not circulate in south africa which is one of the things that make living so dear therein all exactly fourteen and ninepence  there harry my boy i said that is the sum total of our worldly wealth that hole has swallowed all the rest  by george said master harry i say father you and i shall have to let ourselves out to work with the kaffirs and live on mealie pap and he sniggered at his unpleasant little joke  but i was in no mood for joking for it is not a merry thing to dig like anything for months and be completely ruined in the process especially if you happen to dislike digging and consequently i resented harrys lightheartedness  be quiet boy i said raising my hand as though to give him a cuff with the result that the halfsovereign slipped out of it and fell into the gulf below  oh bother said i its gone  there dad said harry thats what comes of letting your angry passions rise now we are down to four and nine  i made no answer to these words of wisdom but scrambled down the steep sides of the claim followed by harry to hunt for my little all well we hunted and we hunted but the moonlight is an uncertain thing to look for halfsovereigns by and there was some loose soil about for the kaffirs had knocked off working at this very spot a couple of hours before i took a pick and raked away the clods of earth with it in the hope of finding the coin but all in vain at last in sheer annoyance i struck the sharp end of the pickaxe down into the soil which was of a very hard nature to my astonishment it sunk in right up to the haft  why harry i said this ground must have been disturbed  i dont think so father he answered but we will soon see and he began to shovel out the soil with his hands oh he said presently its only some old stones the pick has gone down between them look and he began to pull at one of the stones  i say dad he said presently almost in a whisper its precious heavy feel it and he rose and gave me a round brownish lump about the size of a very large apple which he was holding in both his hands i took it curiously and held it up to the light it was very heavy the moonlight fell upon its rough and filthencrusted surface and as i looked curious little thrills of excitement began to pass through me but i could not be sure  give me your knife harry i said  he did so and resting the brown stone on my knee i scratched at its surface great heavens it was soft  another second and the secret was out we had found a great nugget of pure gold four pounds of it or more its gold lad i said its gold or im a dutchman  harry with his eyes starting out of his head glared down at the gleaming yellow scratch that i had made upon the virgin metal and then burst out into yell upon yell of exultation which went ringing away across the silent claims like shrieks of somebody being murdered  be quiet i said do you want every thief on the fields after you  scarcely were the words out of my mouth when i heard a stealthy footstep approaching i promptly put the big nugget down and sat on it and uncommonly hard it was as i did so i saw a lean dark face poked over the edge of the claim and a pair of beady eyes searching us out i knew the face it belonged to a man of very bad character known as handspike tom who had i understood been so named at the diamond fields because he had murdered his mate with a handspike he was now no doubt prowling about like a human hyæna to see what he could steal  is that you unter quatermain he said  yes its i mr tom i answered politely  and what might all that there yelling be he asked i was walking along ataking of the evening air and athinking on the stars when i ears owl after owl  well mr tom i answered that is not to be wondered at seeing that like yourself they are nocturnal birds  owl after owl he repeated sternly taking no notice of my interpretation and i stops and says thats murder and i listens again and thinks no it aint that owl is the owl of hexultation some ones been and got his fingers into a gummy yeller pot ill swear and gone off is ead in the sucking of them now unter quatermain is i right is it nuggets oh lor and he smacked his lips audiblygreat big yellow boysis it them that you have just been and tumbled across  no i said boldly it isntthe cruel gleam in his black eyes altogether overcoming my aversion to untruth for i knew that if once he found out what it was that i was sitting onand by the way i have heard of rolling in gold being spoken of as a pleasant process but i certainly do not recommend anybody who values comfort to try sitting on iti should run a very good chance of being handspiked before the night was over  if you want to know what it was mr tom i went on with my politest air although in agony from the nugget underneathfor i hold it is always best to be polite to a man who is so ready with a handspikemy boy and i have had a slight difference of opinion and i was enforcing my view of the matter upon him thats all  yes mr tom put in harry beginning to weep for harry was a smart boy and saw the difficulty we were in that was iti halloed because father beat me  well now did yer my dear boydid yer well all i can say is that a playedout old claim is a wonderful queer sort of place to come to for to argify at ten oclock of night and whats more my sweet youth if ever i should ave the argifying of yerand he leered unpleasantly at harryyer wont oller in quite such a jolly sort o way and now ill be saying goodnight for i dont like disturbing of a family party no i aint that sort of man i aint goodnight to yer unter quatermaingoodnight to yer my argified young one and mr tom turned away disappointed and prowled off elsewhere like a human jackal to see what he could thieve or kill  thank goodness i said as i slipped off the lump of gold now then do you get up harry and see if that consummate villain has gone harry did so and reported that he had vanished towards pilgrims rest and then we set to work and very carefully but trembling with excitement with our hands hollowed out all the space of ground into which i had struck the pick yes as i hoped there was a regular nest of nuggets twelve in all running from the size of a hazelnut to that of a hens egg though of course the first one was much larger than that how they all came there nobody can say it was one of those extraordinary freaks with stories of which at any rate all people acquainted with alluvial goldmining will be familiar it turned out afterwards that the american who sold me the claim had in the same way made his pilea much larger one than ours by the wayout of a single pocket and then worked for six months without seeing colour after which he gave it up  at any rate there the nuggets were to the value as it turned out afterwards of about twelve hundred and fifty pounds so that after all i took out of that hole four hundred and fifty pounds more than i put into it we got them all out and wrapped them up in a handkerchief and then fearing to carry home so much treasure especially as we knew that mr handspike tom was on the prowl made up our minds to pass the night where we werea necessity which disagreeable as it was was wonderfully sweetened by the presence of that handkerchief full of virgin goldthe interest of my lost halfsovereign  slowly the night wore away for with the fear of handspike tom before my eyes i did not dare to go to sleep and at last the dawn came i got up and watched its growth till it opened like a flower upon the eastern sky and the sunbeams began to spring up in splendour from mountaintop to mountaintop i watched it and as i did so it flashed upon me with a complete conviction which i had not felt before that i had had enough of goldmining to last me the rest of my natural life and i then and there made up my mind to clear out of pilgrims rest and go and shoot buffalo towards delagoa bay then i turned took the pick and shovel and although it was a sunday morning woke up harry and set to work to see if there were any more nuggets about as i expected there were none what we had got had lain together in a little pocket filled with soil that felt quite different from the stiff stuff round and outside the pocket there was not another trace of gold of course it is possible that there were more pocketfuls somewhere about but all i have to say is i made up my mind that whoever found them i should not and as a matter of fact i have since heard that this claim has been the ruin of two or three people as it very nearly was the ruin of me  harry i said presently i am going away this week towards delagoa to shoot buffalo shall i take you with me or send you down to durban  oh take me with you father begged harry i want to kill a buffalo  and supposing that the buffalo kills you instead i asked  oh never mind he said gaily there are lots more where i came from  i rebuked him for his flippancy but in the end i consented to take him    chapter ii what was found in the pool  something over a fortnight had passed since the night when i lost halfasovereign and found twelve hundred and fifty pounds in looking for it and instead of that horrid hole for which after all eldorado was hardly a misnomer a very different scene stretched away before us clad in the silver robe of the moonlight we were campedharry and i two kaffirs a scotch cart and six oxenon the swelling side of a great wave of bushclad land just where we had made our camp however the bush was very sparse and only grew about in clumps while here and there were single flattopped mimosatrees to our right a little stream which had cut a deep channel for itself in the bosom of the slope flowed musically on between banks green with maidenhair wild asparagus and many beautiful grasses the bedrock here was red granite and in the course of centuries of patient washing the water had hollowed out some of the huge slabs in its path into great troughs and cups and these we used for bathingplaces no roman lady with her baths of porphyry or alabaster could have had a more delicious spot to bathe herself than we found within fifty yards of our skerm or rough inclosure of mimosa thorn that we had dragged together round the cart to protect us from the attacks of lions that there were several of these brutes about i knew from their spoor though we had neither heard nor seen them  our bath was a little nook where the eddy of the stream had washed away a mass of soil and on the edge of it there grew a most beautiful old mimosa thorn beneath the thorn was a large smooth slab of granite fringed all round with maidenhair and other ferns that sloped gently down to a pool of the clearest sparkling water which lay in a bowl of granite about ten feet wide by five feet deep in the centre here to this slab we went every morning to bathe and that delightful bath is among the most pleasant of my hunting reminiscences as it is also for reasons which will presently appear among the most painful  it was a lovely night harry and i sat to the windward of the fire where the two kaffirs were busily employed in cooking some impala steaks off a buck which harry to his great joy had shot that morning and were as perfectly contented with ourselves and the world at large as two people could possibly be the night was beautiful and it would require somebody with more words on the tip of his tongue than i have to describe properly the chastened majesty of those moonlit wilds away for ever and for ever away to the mysterious north rolled the great bush ocean over which the silence brooded there beneath us a mile or more to the right ran the wide oliphant and mirrorlike flashed back the moon whose silver spears were shivered on its breast and then tossed in twisted lines of light far and wide about the mountains and the plain down upon the riverbanks grew great timbertrees that through the stillness pointed solemnly to heaven and the beauty of the night lay upon them like a cloud everywhere was silencesilence in the starred depths silence on the bosom of the sleeping earth now if ever great thoughts might rise in a mans mind and for a space he might forget his littleness in the sense that he partook of the pure immensity about him  hark what was that  from far away down by the river there comes a mighty rolling sound then another and another it is the lion seeking his meat  i saw harry shiver and turn a little pale he was a plucky boy enough but the roar of a lion heard for the first time in the solemn bush veldt at night is apt to shake the nerves of any lad  lions my boy i said they are hunting down by the river there but i dont think that you need make yourself uneasy we have been here three nights now and if they were going to pay us a visit i think that they would have done so before this however we will make up the fire  here pharaoh do you and jimjim get some more wood before we go to sleep else the cats will be purring round you before morning  pharaoh a great brawny swazi who had been working for me at pilgrims rest laughed rose and stretched himself then calling to jimjim to bring the axe and a reim started off in the moonlight towards a clump of sugarbush where we cut our fuel from some dead trees he was a fine fellow in his way was pharaoh and i think that he had been named pharaoh because he had an egyptian cast of countenance and a royal sort of swagger about him but his way was a somewhat peculiar way on account of the uncertainty of his temper and very few people could get on with him also if he could find liquor he would drink like a fish and when he drank he became shockingly bloodthirsty these were his bad points his good ones were that like most people of the zulu blood he became exceedingly attached if he took to you at all he was a hardworking and intelligent man and about as daredevil and plucky a fellow at a pinch as i have ever had to do with he was about fiveandthirty years of age or so but not a keshla or ringed man i believe that he had got into trouble in some way in swaziland and the authorities of his tribe would not allow him to assume the ring and that is why he came to work at the goldfields the other man or rather lad jimjim was a mapoch kaffir or knobnose and even in the light of subsequent events i fear i cannot speak very well of him he was an idle and careless young rascal and only that very morning i had to tell pharaoh to give him a beating for letting the oxen stray which pharaoh did with the greatest gusto although he was by way of being very fond of jimjim indeed i saw him consoling jimjim afterwards with a pinch of snuff from his own earbox whilst he explained to him that the next time it came in the way of duty to flog him he meant to thrash him with the other hand so as to cross the old cuts and make a pretty pattern on his back  well off they went though jimjim did not at all like leaving the camp at that hour even when the moonlight was so bright and in due course returned safely enough with a great bundle of wood i laughed at jimjim and asked him if he had seen anything and he said yes he had he had seen two large yellow eyes staring at him from behind a bush and heard something snore  as however on further investigation the yellow eyes and the snore appeared to have existed only in jimjims lively imagination i was not greatly disturbed by this alarming report but having seen to the makingup of the fire got into the skerm and went quietly to sleep with harry by my side  some hours afterwards i woke up with a start i dont know what woke me the moon had gone down or at least was almost hidden behind the soft horizon of bush only her red rim being visible also a wind had sprung up and was driving long hurrying lines of cloud across the starry sky and altogether a great change had come over the mood of the night by the look of the sky i judged that we must be about two hours from daybreak  the oxen which were as usual tied to the disselboom of the scotch cart were very restlessthey kept snuffling and blowing and rising up and lying down again so i at once suspected that they must wind something presently i knew what it was that they winded for within fifty yards of us a lion roared not very loud but quite loud enough to make my heart come into my mouth  pharaoh was sleeping on the other side of the cart and looking beneath it i saw him raise his head and listen  lion inkoos he whispered lion  jimjim also jumped up and by the faint light i could see that he was in a very great fright indeed  thinking that it was as well to be prepared for emergencies i told pharaoh to throw wood upon the fire and woke up harry who i verily believe was capable of sleeping happily through the crack of doom he was a little scared at first but presently the excitement of the position came home to him and he grew quite anxious to see his majesty face to face i got my rifle handy and gave harry hisa westley richards falling block which is a very useful gun for a youth being light and yet a good killing rifle and then we waited  for a long time nothing happened and i began to think that the best thing we could do would be to go to sleep again when suddenly i heard a sound more like a cough than a roar within about twenty yards of the skerm we all looked out but could see nothing and then followed another period of suspense it was very trying to the nerves this waiting for an attack that might be developed from any quarter or might not be developed at all and though i was an old hand at this sort of business i was anxious about harry for it is wonderful how the presence of anybody to whom one is attached unnerves a man in moments of danger i know although it was now chilly enough i could feel the perspiration running down my nose and in order to relieve the strain on my attention employed myself in watching a beetle which appeared to be attracted by the firelight and was sitting before it thoughtfully rubbing his antennæ against each other  suddenly the beetle gave such a jump that he nearly pitched headlong into the fire and so did we allgave jumps i mean and no wonder for from right under the skerm fence there came a most frightful roara roar that literally made the scotch cart shake and took the breath out of me  harry made an exclamation jimjim howled outright while the poor oxen who were terrified almost out of their hides shivered and lowed piteously  the night was almost entirely dark now for the moon had quite set and the clouds had covered up the stars so that the only light we had came from the fire which by this time was burning up brightly again but as you know firelight is absolutely useless to shoot by it is so uncertain and besides it penetrates but a very little way into the darkness although if one is in the dark outside one can see it from far away  presently the oxen after standing still for a moment suddenly winded the lion and did what i feared they would dobegan to skrek that is to try and break loose from the trektow to which they were tied to rush off madly into the wilderness lions know of this habit on the part of oxen which are i do believe the most foolish animals under the sun a sheep being a very solomon compared to them and it is by no means uncommon for a lion to get in such a position that a herd or span of oxen may wind him skrek break their reims and rush off into the bush of course once there they are helpless in the dark and then the lion chooses the one that he loves best and eats him at his leisure  well round and round went our six poor oxen nearly trampling us to death in their mad rush indeed had we not hastily tumbled out of the way we should have been trodden to death or at the least seriously injured as it was harry was run over and poor jimjim being caught by the trektow somewhere beneath the arm was hurled right across the skerm landing by my side only some paces off  snap went the disselboom of the cart beneath the transverse strain put upon it had it not broken the cart would have overset as it was in another minute oxen cart trektow reims broken disselboom and everything were soon tied in one vast heaving plunging bellowing and seemingly inextricable knot  for a moment or two this state of affairs took my attention off from the lion that had caused it but whilst i was wondering what on earth was to be done next and how we should manage if the cattle broke loose into the bush and were lostfor cattle frightened in this manner will so straight away like mad thingsmy thoughts were suddenly recalled to the lion in a very painful fashion  for at that moment i perceived by the light of the fire a kind of gleam of yellow travelling through the air towards us  the lion the lion holloaed pharaoh and as he did so he or rather she for it was a great gaunt lioness half wild no doubt with hunger lit right in the middle of the skerm and stood there in the smoky gloom lashing her tail and roaring i seized my rifle and fired it at her but what between the confusion my agitation and the uncertain light i missed her and nearly shot pharaoh the flash of the rifle however threw the whole scene into strong relief and a wild sight it was i can tell youwith the seething mass of oxen twisted all round the cart in such a fashion that their heads looked as though they were growing out of their rumps and their horns seemed to protrude from their backs the smoking fire with just a blaze in the heart of the smoke jimjim in the foreground where the oxen had thrown him in their wild rush stretched out there in terror and then as a centre to the picture the great gaunt lioness glaring round with hungry yellow eyes roaring and whining as she made up her mind what to do  it did not take her long however just the time that it takes a flash to die into darkness for before i could fire again or do anything with a most fiendish snort she sprang upon poor jimjim  i heard the unfortunate lad shriek and then almost instantly i saw his legs thrown into the air the lioness had seized him by the neck and with a sudden jerk thrown his body over her back so that his legs hung down upon the further side then without the slightest hesitation and apparently without any difficulty she cleared the skerm face at a single bound and bearing poor jimjim with her vanished into the darkness beyond in the direction of the bathingplace that i have already described we jumped up perfectly mad with horror and fear and rushed wildly after her firing shots at haphazard on the chance that she would be frightened by them into dropping her prey but nothing could we see and nothing could we hear the lioness had vanished into the darkness taking jimjim with her and to attempt to follow her till daylight was madness we should only expose ourselves to the risk of a like fate        i have known a lion carry a twoyearold ox over a stone      wall four feet high in this fashion and a mile away into      the bush beyond he was subsequently poisoned by strychnine      put into the carcass of the ox and i still have his claws      editor  so with scared and heavy hearts we crept back to the skerm and sat down to wait for the dawn which now could not be much more than an hour off it was absolutely useless to try even to disentangle the oxen till then so all that was left for us to do was to sit and wonder how it came to pass that the one should be taken and the other left and to hope against hope that our poor servant might have been mercifully delivered from the lions jaws  at length the faint dawn came stealing like a ghost up the long slope of bush and glinted on the tangled oxens horns and with white and frightened faces we got up and set to the task of disentangling the oxen till such time as there should be light enough to enable us to follow the trail of the lioness which had gone off with jimjim and here a fresh trouble awaited us for when at last with infinite difficulty we had disentangled the great helpless brutes it was only to find that one of the best of them was very sick there was no mistake about the way he stood with his legs slightly apart and his head hanging down he had got the redwater i was sure of it of all the difficulties connected with life and travelling in south africa those connected with oxen are perhaps the worst the ox is the most exasperating animal in the world a negro excepted he has absolutely no constitution and never neglects an opportunity of falling sick of some mysterious disease he will get thin upon the slightest provocation and from mere maliciousness die of poverty whereas it is his chief delight to turn round and refuse to pull whenever he finds himself well in the centre of a river or the waggonwheel nicely fast in a mud hole drive him a few miles over rough roads and you will find that he is footsore turn him loose to feed and you will discover that he has run away or if he has not run away he has of malice aforethought eaten tulip and poisoned himself there is always something with him the ox is a brute it was of a piece with his accustomed behaviour for the one in question to break outon purpose probablywith redwater just when a lion had walked off with his herd it was exactly what i should have expected and i was therefore neither disappointed nor surprised  well it was no use crying as i should almost have liked to do because if this ox had redwater it was probable that the rest of them had it too although they had been sold to me as salted that is proof against such diseases as redwater and lungsick one gets hardened to this sort of thing in south africa in course of time for i suppose in no other country in the world is the waste of animal life so great  so taking my rifle and telling harry to follow me for we had to leave pharaoh to look after the oxenpharaohs lean kine i called them i started to see if anything could be found of or appertaining to the unfortunate jimjim the ground round our little camp was hard and rocky and we could not hit off any spoor of the lioness though just outside the skerm was a drop or two of blood about three hundred yards from the camp and a little to the right was a patch of sugar bush mixed up with the usual mimosa and for this i made thinking that the lioness would have been sure to take her prey there to devour it on we pushed through the long grass that was bent down beneath the weight of the soaking dew in two minutes we were wet through up to the thighs as wet as though we had waded through water in due course however we reached the patch of bush and by the grey light of the morning cautiously and slowly pushed our way into it it was very dark under the trees for the sun was not yet up so we walked with the most extreme care half expecting every minute to come across the lioness licking the bones of poor jimjim but no lioness could we see and as for jimjim there was not even a fingerjoint of him to be found evidently they had not come here  so pushing through the bush we proceeded to hunt every other likely spot but with the same result  i suppose she must have taken him right away i said at last sadly enough at any rate he will be dead by now so god have mercy on him we cant help him whats to be done now  i suppose that we had better wash ourselves in the pool and then go back and get something to eat i am filthy said harry  this was a practical if a somewhat unfeeling suggestion at least it struck me as unfeeling to talk of washing when poor jimjim had been so recently eaten however i did not let my sentiment carry me away so we went down to the beautiful spot that i have described to wash i was the first to reach it which i did by scrambling down the ferny bank then i turned round and started back with a yellas well i might for almost from beneath my feet there came a most awful snarl  i had lit nearly upon the back of the lioness that had been sleeping on the slab where we always stood to dry ourselves after bathing with a snarl and a growl before i could do anything before i could even cock my rifle she had bounded right across the crystal pool and vanished over the opposite bank it was all done in an instant as quick as thought  she had been sleeping on the slab and oh horror what was that sleeping beside her it was the red remains of poor jimjim lying on a patch of bloodstained rock  oh father father shrieked harry look in the water  i looked there floating in the centre of the lovely tranquil pool was jimjims head the lioness had bitten it right off and it had rolled down the sloping rock into the water    chapter iii jimjim is avenged  we never bathed in that pool again indeed for my part i could never look at its peaceful purity fringed round with waving ferns without thinking of that ghastly head which rolled itself off through the water when we tried to catch it  poor jimjim we buried what was left of him which was not very much in an old breadbag and though whilst he lived his virtues were not great now that he was gone we could have wept over him indeed harry did weep outright while pharaoh used very bad language in zulu and i registered a quiet little vow on my account that i would let daylight into that lioness before i was fortyeight hours older if by any means it could be done  well we buried him and there he lies in the breadbag which i rather grudged him as it was the only one we had where lions will not trouble him any morethough perhaps the hyænas will if they consider that there is enough on him left to make it worth their while to dig him up however he wont mind that so there is an end of the book of jimjim  the question that now remained was how to circumvent his murderess i knew that she would be sure to return as soon as she was hungry again but i did not know when she would be hungry she had left so little of jimjim behind her that i should scarcely expect to see her the next night unless indeed she had cubs still i felt that it would not be wise to miss the chance of her coming so we set about making preparations for her reception the first thing that we did was to strengthen the bush wall of the skerm by dragging a large quantity of the tops of thorntrees together and laying them one on the other in such a fashion that the thorns pointed outwards this after our experience of the fate of jimjim seemed a very necessary precaution since if where one goat can jump another can follow as the kaffirs say how much more is this the case when an animal so active and so vigorous as the lion is concerned and now came the further question how were we to beguile the lioness to return lions are animals that have a strange knack of appearing when they are not wanted and keeping studiously out of the way when their presence is required of course it was possible that if she had found jimjim to her liking she would come back to see if there were any more of his kind about but still it was not to be relied on  harry who as i have said was an eminently practical boy suggested to pharaoh that he should go and sit outside the skerm in the moonlight as a sort of bait assuring him that he would have nothing to fear as we should certainly kill the lioness before she killed him pharaoh however strangely enough did not seem to take to this suggestion indeed he walked away much put out with harry for having made it  it gave me an idea however  by jove i said there is the sick ox he must die sooner or later so we may as well utilize him  now about thirty yards to the left of our skerm as one stood facing down the hill towards the river was the stump of a tree that had been destroyed by lightning many years before standing equidistant between but a little in front of two clumps of bush which were severally some fifteen paces from it  here was the very place to tie the ox and accordingly a little before sunset the sick animal was led forth by pharaoh and made fast there little knowing poor brute for what purpose and we began our long vigil this time without a fire for our object was to attract the lioness and not to scare her  for hour after hour we waited keeping ourselves awake by pinching each otherit is by the way remarkable what a difference of opinion as to the force of pinches requisite to the occasion exists in the mind of pincher and pinchedbut no lioness came at last the moon went down and darkness swallowed up the world as the kaffirs say but no lions came to swallow us up we waited till dawn because we did not dare to go to sleep and then at last with many bad thoughts in our hearts we took such rest as we could get and that was not much  that morning we went out shooting not because we wanted to for we were too depressed and tired but because we had no more meat for three hours or more we wandered about in a broiling sun looking for something to kill but with absolutely no results for some unknown reason the game had grown very scarce about the spot though when i was there two years before every sort of large game except rhinoceros and elephant was particularly abundant the lions of whom there were many alone remained and i fancy that it was the fact of the game they live on having temporarily migrated which made them so daring and ferocious as a general rule a lion is an amiable animal enough if he is left alone but a hungry lion is almost as dangerous as a hungry man one hears a great many different opinions expressed as to whether or no the lion is remarkable for his courage but the result of my experience is that very much depends upon the state of his stomach a hungry lion will not stick at a trifle whereas a full one will flee at a very small rebuke  well we hunted all about and nothing could we see not even a duiker or a bush buck and at last thoroughly tired and out of temper we started on our way back to camp passing over the brow of a steepish hill to do so just as we climbed the crest of the ridge i came to a stand for there about six hundred yards to my left his beautiful curved horns outlined against the soft blue of the sky i saw a noble koodoo bull strepsiceros kudu even at that distance for as you know my eyes are very keen i could distinctly see the white stripes on its side when the light fell upon it and its large and pointed ears twitch as the flies worried it  so far so good but how were we to get at it it was ridiculous to risk a shot at that great distance and yet both the ground and the wind lay very ill for stalking it seemed to me that the only chance would be to make a detour of at least a mile or more and come up on the other side of the koodoo i called harry to my side and explained to him what i thought would be our best course when suddenly without any delay the koodoo saved us further trouble by suddenly starting off down the hill like a leaping rocket i do not know what had frightened it certainly we had not perhaps a hyæna or a leoparda tiger as we call it therehad suddenly appeared at any rate off it went running slightly towards us and i never saw a buck go faster i am afraid that forgetting harrys presence i used strong language and really there was some excuse as for harry he stood watching the beautiful animals course presently it vanished behind a patch of bush to emerge a few seconds later about five hundred paces from us on a stretch of comparatively level ground that was strewn with boulders on it went clearing the boulders in its path with a succession of great bounds that were beautiful to behold as it did so i happened to look round at harry and perceived to my astonishment that he had got his rifle to his shoulder  you young donkey i exclaimed surely you are not going toand just at that moment the rifle went off  and then i think i saw what was in its way one of the most wonderful things i ever remember in my hunting experience the koodoo was at the moment in the air clearing a pile of stones with its forelegs tucked up underneath it all of an instant the legs stretched themselves out in a spasmodic fashion it lit on them and they doubled up beneath it down went the noble buck down upon his head for a moment he seemed to be standing on his horns his hindlegs high in the air and then over he rolled and lay still  great heavens i said why youve hit him hes dead  as for harry he said nothing but merely looked scared as well he might for such a marvellous i may say such an appalling and ghastly fluke it has never been my lot to witness a man let alone a boy might have fired a thousand such shots without ever touching the object which mind you was springing and bounding over rocks quite five hundred yards away and here this ladtaking a snap shot and merely allowing for speed and elevation by instinct for he did not put up his sightshad knocked the bull over as dead as a doornail well i made no further remark as the occasion was too solemn for talking but merely led the way to where the koodoo had fallen there he lay beautiful and quite still and there high up about halfway down his neck was a neat round hole the bullet had severed the spinal marrow passing through the vertebræ and away on the other side  it was already evening when having cut as much of the best meat as we could carry from the bull and tied a red handkerchief and some tufts of grass to his spiral horns which by the way must have been nearly five feet in length in the hope of keeping the jackals and aasvögels vultures from him we finally got back to camp to find pharaoh who was getting rather anxious at our absence ready to greet us with the pleasing intelligence that another ox was sick but even this dreadful bit of intelligence could not dash harrys spirits the fact of the matter being incredible as it may appear i do verily believe that in his heart of hearts he set down the death of the koodoo to the credit of his own skill now though the lad was a pretty shot enough this of course was ridiculous and i told him so plainly  by the time that we had finished our supper of koodoo steaks which would have been better if the koodoo had been a little younger it was time to get ready for jimjims murderess accordingly we determined again to expose the unfortunate sick ox that was now absolutely on its last legs being indeed scarcely able to stand all the afternoon pharaoh told us it had been walking round and round in a circle as cattle in the last stage of redwater generally do now it had come to a standstill and was swaying to and fro with its head hanging down so we tied him up to the stump of the tree as on the previous night knowing that if the lioness did not kill him he would be dead by morning indeed i was afraid that he would die at once in which case he would be of but little use as a bait for the lion is a sportsmanlike animal and unless he is very hungry generally prefers to kill his own dinner though when that is once killed he will come back to it again and again  then we again went through our experience of the previous night sitting there hour after hour till at last harry fell fast asleep and though i am accustomed to this sort of thing even i could scarcely keep my eyes open indeed i was just dropping off when suddenly pharaoh gave me a push  listen he whispered  i was awake in a second and listening with all my ears from the clump of bush to the right of the lightningshattered stump to which the sick ox was tied came a faint crackling noise presently it was repeated something was moving there faintly and quietly enough but still moving perceptibly for in the intense stillness of the night any sound seemed loud  i woke up harry who instantly said where is she where is she and began to point his rifle about in a fashion that was more dangerous to us and the oxen than to any possible lioness  be quiet i whispered savagely and as i did so with a low and hideous growl a flash of yellow light sped out of the clump of bush past the ox and into the corresponding clump upon the other side the poor sick creature gave a sort of groan staggered round and then began to tremble i could see it do so clearly in the moonlight which was now very bright and i felt a brute for having exposed the unfortunate animal to such agony as he must undoubtedly be undergoing the lioness for it was she passed so quickly that we could not even distinguish her movements much less fire indeed at night it is absolutely useless to attempt to shoot unless the object is very close and standing perfectly still and then the light is so deceptive and it is so difficult to see the foresight that the best shot will miss more often than he hits  she will be back again presently i said look out but for heavens sake dont fire unless i tell you to  hardly were the words out of my mouth when back she came and again passed the ox without striking him  what on earth is she doing whispered harry  playing with it as a cat does with a mouse i suppose she will kill it presently  as i spoke the lioness once more flashed out of the bush and this time sprang right over the doomed and trembling ox it was a beautiful sight to see her clear him in the bright moonlight as though it were a trick which she had been taught  i believe that she has escaped from a circus whispered harry its jolly to see her jump  i said nothing but i thought to myself that if it was master harry did not quite appreciate the performance and small blame to him at any rate his teeth were chattering a little  then came a longish pause and i began to think that the lioness must have gone away when suddenly she appeared again and with one mighty bound landed right on to the ox and struck it a frightful blow with her paw  down it went and lay on the ground kicking feebly she put down her wickedlooking head and with a fierce growl of contentment buried her long white teeth in the throat of the dying animal when she lifted her muzzle again it was all stained with blood she stood facing us obliquely licking her bloody chops and making a sort of purring noise  nows our time i whispered fire when i do  i got on to her as well as i could but harry instead of waiting for me as i told him fired before i did and that of course hurried me but when the smoke cleared i was delighted to see that the lioness was rolling about on the ground behind the body of the ox which covered her in such a fashion however that we could not shoot again to make an end of her  shes done for shes dead the yellow devil yelled pharaoh in exultation and at that very moment the lioness with a sort of convulsive rush halfrolled halfsprang into the patch of thick bush to the right i fired after her as she went but so far as i could see without result indeed the probability is that i missed her clean at any rate she got to the bush in safety and once there began to make such a diabolical noise as i never heard before she would whine and shriek with pain and then burst out into perfect volleys of roaring that shook the whole place  well i said we must just let her roar to go into that bush after her at night would be madness  at that moment to my astonishment and alarm there came an answering roar from the direction of the river and then another from behind the swell of bush evidently there were more lions about the wounded lioness redoubled her efforts with the object i suppose of summoning the others to her assistance at any rate they came and quickly too for within five minutes peeping through the bushes of our skerm fence we saw a magnificent lion bounding along towards us through the tall tambouki grass that in the moonlight looked for all the world like ripening corn on he came in great leaps and a glorious sight it was to see him when within fifty yards or so he stood still in an open space and roared the lioness roared too then there came a third roar and another great blackmaned lion stalked majestically up and joined number two till really i began to realize what the ox must have undergone  now harry i whispered whatever you do dont fire its too risky if they let us be let them be  well the pair marched off to the bush where the wounded lioness was now roaring double tides and the three of them began to snarl and grumble away together there presently however the lioness ceased roaring and the two lions came out again the blackmaned one firstto prospect i supposewalked to where the carcass of the ox lay and sniffed at it  oh what a shot whispered harry who was trembling with excitement  yes i said but dont fire they might all of them come for us  harry said nothing but whether it was from the natural impetuosity of youth or because he was thrown off his balance by excitement or from sheer recklessness and devilment i am sure i cannot tell you never having been able to get a satisfactory explanation from him but at any rate the fact remains he without word or warning entirely disregarding my exhortations lifted up his westley richards and fired at the blackmaned lion and what is more hit it slightly on the flank  next second there was a most awful roar from the injured lion he glared around him and roared with pain for he was badly stung and then before i could make up my mind what to do the great blackmaned brute clearly ignorant of the cause of his hurt sprang right at the throat of his companion to whom he evidently attributed his misfortune it was a curious sight to see the astonishment of the other lion at this most unprovoked assault over he rolled with an angry snarl and on to him sprang the blackmaned demon and began to worry him this finally awoke the yellowmaned lion to a sense of the situation and i am bound to say that he rose to it in a most effective manner somehow or other he got to his feet and roaring and snarling frightfully closed with his mighty foe  then ensued a most tremendous scene you know what a shocking thing it is to see two large dogs fighting with abandonment well a whole hundred of dogs could not have looked half so terrible as those two great brutes as they rolled and roared and rent in their horrid rage they gripped each other they tore at each others throat till their manes came out in handfuls and the red blood streamed down their yellow hides it was an awful and a wonderful thing to see the great cats tearing at each other with all the fierce energy of their savage strength and making the night hideous with their heartshaking noise and the fight was a grand one too for some minutes it was impossible to say which was getting the best of it but at last i saw that the blackmaned lion though he was slightly bigger was failing i am inclined to think that the wound in his flank crippled him anyway he began to get the worst of it which served him right as he was the aggressor still i could not help feeling sorry for him for he had fought a gallant fight when his antagonist finally got him by the throat and struggle and strike out as he would began to shake the life out of him over and over they rolled together a hideous and aweinspiring spectacle but the yellow one would not loose his hold and at length poor blackmane grew faint his breath came in great snorts and seemed to rattle in his nostrils then he opened his huge mouth gave the ghost of a roar quivered and was dead  when he was quite sure that the victory was his own the yellowmaned lion loosed his grip and sniffed at the fallen foe then he licked the dead lions eye and next with his forefeet resting on the carcass sent up his own chant of victory that went rolling and pealing down the dark paths of the night and at this point i interfered taking a careful sight at the centre of his body in order to give the largest possible margin for error i fired and sent a570 express bullet right through him and down he dropped dead upon the carcass of his mighty foe  after that fairly satisfied with our performances we slept peaceably till dawn leaving pharaoh to keep watch in case any more lions should take it into their heads to come our way  when the sun was well up we arose and went very cautiouslyat least pharaoh and i did for i would not allow harry to cometo see if we could find any trace of the wounded lioness she had ceased roaring immediately upon the arrival of the two lions and had not made a sound since from which we concluded that she was probably dead i was armed with my express while pharaoh in whose hands a rifle was indeed a dangerous weapon to his companions had an axe on our way we stopped to look at the two dead lions they were magnificent animals both of them but their pelts were entirely spoiled by the terrible mauling they had given to each other which was a sad pity  in another minute we were following the blood spoor of the wounded lioness into the bush where she had taken refuge this i need hardly say we did with the utmost caution indeed i for one did not at all like the job and was only consoled by the reflection that it was necessary and that the bush was not thick well we stood there keeping as far from the trees as possible searching and looking about but no lioness could we see though we saw plenty of blood  she must have gone somewhere to die pharaoh i said in zulu  yes inkoos he answered she has certainly gone away  hardly were the words out of his mouth when i heard a roar and starting round saw the lioness emerge from the very centre of a bush in which she had been curled up just behind pharaoh up she went on to her hindlegs and as she did so i noticed that one of her forepaws was broken near the shoulder for it hung limply down up she went towering right over pharaohs head as she did so lifting her uninjured paw to strike him to the earth and then before i could get my rifle round or do anything to avert the oncoming catastrophe the zulu did a very brave and clever thing realizing his own imminent danger he bounded to one side and swinging the heavy axe round his head brought it down right on to the back of the lioness severing the vertebræ and killing her instantaneously it was wonderful to see her collapse all in a heap like an empty sack  my word pharaoh i said that was well done and none too soon  yes he answered with a little laugh it was a good stroke inkoos jimjim will sleep better now  then calling harry to us we examined the lioness she was old if one might judge from her worn teeth and not very large but thickly made and must have possessed extraordinary vitality to have lived so long shot as she was for in addition to her broken shoulder my express bullet had blown a great hole in her middle that one might have put a fist into  well that is the story of the death of poor jimjim and how we avenged it it is rather interesting in its way because of the fight between the two lions of which i never saw the like in all my experience and i know something of lions and their manners  and how did you get back to pilgrims rest i asked hunter quatermain when he had finished his yarn  ah we had a nice job with that he answered the second sick ox died and so did another and we had to get on as best we could with three harnessed unicorn fashion while we pushed behind we did about four miles a day and it took us nearly a month during the last week of which we pretty well starved  i notice i said that most of your trips ended in disaster of some sort or another and yet you went on making them which strikes one as a little strange  yes i dare say but then remember i got my living for many years out of hunting besides half the charm of the thing lay in the dangers and disasters though they were terrible enough at the time another thing is my trips were not all disastrous some time if you like i will tell you a story of one which was very much the reverse for i made several thousand pounds out of it and saw one of the most extraordinary sights a hunter ever came across it was on this trip that i met the bravest native woman i ever knew her name was maiwa but it is too late now and besides i am tired of talking about myself pass the water will you
