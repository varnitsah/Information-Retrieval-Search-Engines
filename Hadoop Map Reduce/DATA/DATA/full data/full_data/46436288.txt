46436288	the lifeboat by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the beginningin which several important personages are introduced  there existed not many years ago a certain street near the banks of old father thames which may be described as being one of the most modest and retiring little streets in london  the neighbourhood around that street was emphatically dirty and noisy there were powerful smells of tallow and tar in the atmosphere suggestive of shipping and commerce  narrow lanes opened off the main street affording access to wharves and warehouses and presenting at their termini segmentary views of ships hulls bowsprits and booms with a background of muddy water and smoke  there were courts with unglazed windows resembling doors and massive cranes clinging to the walls  there were yards full of cases and barrels and great anchors and chains which invaded the mud of the river as far as was consistent with safety and adventurous little warehouses which stood on piles up to the knees as it were in water totally regardless of appearances and utterly indifferent as to catching cold  as regards the population of this locality rats were perhaps in excess of human beings and it might have been observed that the former were particularly frolicsome and fearless  farther back on the landward side of our unobtrusive street commercial and nautical elements were more mingled with things appertaining to domestic life  elephantine horses addicted to good living drew through the narrow streets wagons and vans so ponderous and gigantic that they seemed to crush the very stones over which they rolled and ran terrible risk of sweeping little children out of the upper windows of the houses  in unfavourable contrast with these donkeys of the most meagre and starved aspect staggered along with cartloads of fusty vegetables and dirtylooking fish while the vendors thereof howled the nature and value of their wares with deliberate ferocity  low pawnbrokers chiefly in the slop line obtruded their seedy wares from doors and windows halfway across the pavement as if to tempt the naked and equally low pastrycooks spread forth their stale viands in unglazed windows as if to seduce the hungry  here the population was mixed and varied  busy men of business and of wealth porters and wagoners clerks and warehousemen rubbed shoulders with poor squalid creatures men and women whose business or calling no one knew and few cared to know except the policeman on the beat who with stern suspicious glances looked upon them as objects of special regard and as enemies except also the earnestfaced man in seedy black garments with a large bible evidently in his pocket who likewise looked on them as objects of special regard and as friends the rats were much more circumspect in this locality  they were what the yankees would call uncommonly cute and much too deeply intent on business to indulge in play  in the lanes courts and alleys that ran still farther back into the great hive there was an amount of squalor destitution violence sin and misery the depth of which was known only to the people who dwelt there and to those earnestfaced men with bibles who made it their work to cultivate green spots in the midst of such unpromising wastes and to foster the growth of those tender and beautiful flowers which sometimes spring and flourish where to judge from appearances one might be tempted to imagine nothing good could thrive  here also there were rats and cats too besides dogs of many kinds but they all of them led hard lives of it and few appeared to think much of enjoying themselves existence seemed to be the height of their ambition  even the kittens were depressed and sometimes stopped in the midst of a faint attempt at play to look round with a scared aspect as if the memory of kicks and blows was strong upon them  the whole neighbourhood in fact teemed with sad yet interesting sights and scenes and with strange violent contrasts  it was not a spot which one would naturally select for a ramble on a summer evening after dinner nevertheless it was a locality where time might have been profitably spent where a good lesson or two might have been learned by those who have a tendency to consider the poor  but although the neighbourhood was dirty and noisy our modest street which was at that time known by the name of redwharf lane was comparatively clean and quiet  true the smell of tallow and tar could not be altogether excluded neither could the noises but these scents and sounds reached it in a mitigated degree and as the street was not a thoroughfare few people entered it except those who had business there or those who had lost their way or an occasional street boy of an explorative tendency which last on finding that it was a quiet spot invariably entered a protest against such an outrageous idea as quietude in the city by sending up a series of hideous yells and retiring thereafter precipitately  here in redwharf lane was the office of the firm of denham crumps and company  mr denham stood with his back to the fire for it was a coldish autumn day with his coattails under his arms  he was a big bald man of fiveandforty with selfimportance enough for a man of fivehundredandforty  mr crumps sat in a small backoffice working so diligently that one might have supposed he was endeavouring to bring up the arrears of forty years neglect and had pledged himself to have it done before dinner  he was particularly small excessively thin very humble rather deaf and upwards of sixty  company had died of lockjaw two years previous to the period of which we write and is therefore unworthy of farther notice  a confidential clerk had taken and still retained his place  messrs denham crumps and company were shipowners  report said that they were rich but report frequently said what was not true in those days  whether it has become more truthful in the present days remains an open question  there can be no question however that much business was done at the office in redwharf lane and that while denham lived in a handsome mansion in russell square and crumbs dwelt in a sweet cottage in kensington company had kept a pony phaeton and had died in a snug little villa on hampstead heath  the office of denham crumps and company was small and unpretending as was the street in which it stood  there was a small green door with a small brass plate and a small brass knocker all of which when opened by their attendant a small tiger in blue with buttons gave admittance to a small passage that terminated in a small room  this was the outer office and here sat the four clerks of the establishment on four tall stools writing in four monstrous volumes as furiously as if they were decayed authors whose lives depended on the result  their salaries did poor fellows and that was much the same thing  a glass door with scratches here and there through which the head of the firm could gaze unseen separated the office from denhams room and a wooden door separated that from crumps room beyond which there was a small closet or cell which had been companys room before that gentleman died  it was now used as a repository for ancient books and papers  very odd said mr denham and as he said so he touched a small silver bell that stood on his writingtable  the tiger in blue and buttons instantly appeared  here peekins post these letters  has no one called this afternoon i mean no one resembling a sailor  the boy in blue started and his face became very red  why whats the matter boy  what do you mean by staring at me instead of answering my question  please sir stammered peekins meekly i didnt mean no arm sir but you see sir his face was so drefful fierce and he looked sich a wild  boy are you mad interrupted mr denham advancing and seizing the tiger by his blue collar what are you talking about  now answer my question at once else ill shake the little life you have out of your body  did any sailorlike man call at the office this afternoon  oh sir yes siriithought he was drunk and wouldnt let im in sir hes bin a standin stampin at the door for more than  the end of the sentence was cut short by mr denham suddenly ejecting the boy from the room and shouting let him in  in a few seconds a heavy tread was heard in the outer office and the boy ushered in a tall young man of unusually large proportions with extremely broad shoulders and apparently about twentythree years of age whose rough pilotcoat wide pantaloons and glazed hat bespoke him a sailor  his countenance was flushed and an angry frown contracted his brow as he strode into the room pulled off his hat and stood before the head of the house of denham crumps and company  i beg pardon sir began the sailor somewhat sharply yet without disrespect when i am asked to come  yes yes bax interposed mr denham i know what you would say pray calm yourself  it is a pity you should have been kept waiting outside but the fact is that my boy is a new one and apparently he is destitute of common sense  sit down  i sent for you to say that i wish you to take the nancy to liverpool  you will be ready to start at once no doubt  before the schooner is overhauled inquired bax in surprise  of course said denham stiffly i see no occasion for another overhaul  that schooner will cost us more than she is worth if we go on repairing at the rate we have been doing the last two years  she needs it all sir rejoined bax earnestly  the fact is mr denham i feel it to be my duty to tell you that there aint a sound plank or timber in her from stem to stern and im pretty sure that if she costs you money shes likely to cost me and the men aboard of her our lives  i strongly advise you to strike her off the books and get a new one  mr bax said denham pompously you are too young a man to offer your advice unless it is asked  i believe the engineer employed by me to examine into the condition of my vessels is quite competent to judge in these matters and i have unbounded confidence in him  when i placed you in command of the nancy i meant you to navigate not to criticise her but if you are afraid to venture  afraid cried the young sailor reddening  is anxiety about the lives of your men and the safety of your property to be called fear i am willing to sail in the nancy as long as a plank of her will hold to her ribs but  bax paused and bit his lip as if to keep back words which had better not be spoken  well then rejoined mr denham affecting to disregard the pause let me hear no more about repairs  when these require to be done they shall be done  meanwhile go and make preparation to sail by the morning tides which serves aboutwhat hour think you  flood at half after six said bax curtly  very well come up here at halfpast five one of the clerks will see you  you will have to run down to dover in the first place and when there my agent will give you further instructions  good afternoon  bax rose and quitted the room with a stern good day sir  as he passed through the outer office he was arrested by one of the clerks laying a hand on his shoulder  well mr foster said bax a bright smile chasing the frown from his face it seems were to swim if we can or sink if we cant this winterbut what want ye with me  you are to call me guy not mister foster said the lad gaily  i want to know where you are to be found after six this evening  at the three jolly tars answered bax clapping on his glazed hat  all right ill look you up  goodday  guy foster shouted mr denham from the inner room  yes uncle and in another moment the youth was standing pen in hand in the august presence of his relative who regarded him with a cold stare of displeasure  there could scarcely have been conceived a stronger contrast in nature than that which existed between the starched proud and portly uncle and the tall handsome and hearty young nephew whose age was scarcely twenty years  how often am i to tell you sir said mr denham that yes uncle is much too familiar and unbusinesslike a phrase to be used in this office in the hearing of your fellowclerks  i beg pardon uncle im sure i had no intention of  there that will do i want no apology i want obedience and attention to my expressed wishes  i suppose that you expect to get away for a few days holiday  well unc sir i mean if it is quite convenient i should  it is not quite convenient interrupted the uncle  it cannot possibly at any time be convenient to dispense with the services of a clerk in a house where no supernumeraries are kept to talk slang and read the newspapers  i see no reason whatever in young men in ordinary health expecting as a right two or three weeks leave each year without deduction of salary  i never go to the country or to the seaside from one years end to the other  youd be much the better for it if you did uncle interposed guy  that sir retorted denham with emphasis is your opinion and you will allow me to say that it is erroneous as most of your opinions i am sorry to find are  i find that no change is necessary for my health  i am in better condition than many who go to margate every summer  i thrive on town air sir and on city life  there was much truth in these observations  the worthy merchant did indeed seem to enjoy robust health and there could be no question that as far as physical appearances went he did thrive on high living foul air and coining money  tallow and tar sent forth delicious odours to him and thick smoke was pleasant to his nostrils for he dealt largely in coal and all of these with many kindred substances were productive of the one great end and object of his lifegold  however pursued mr denham leaning back on the mantlepiece as the tyrannical customs of society cannot be altogether set at nought i suppose i must let you go  thank you uncsir said guy who having been chained to the desk in the office of redwharf lane for the last eleven months felt his young heart bounding wildly within him at the prospect of visiting even for a brief period his mothers cottage on the coast of kent  you have no occasion to thank me retorted mr denham you are indebted entirely to the tyrannical customs and expectations of society for the permission  goodbye you may convey my respects to your mother  i will sir  have you anything further to say asked mr denham observing that the youth stood looking perplexedly at the ground and twirling his watchkey  yes uncle i have answered guy plucking up courage  the fact is that is to sayyou know that wrecks are very common off the coast of kent  certainly i do said denham with a frown  i have bitter cause to know that  the loss occasioned by the wreck of the seagull last winter was very severe indeed  the subject is not a pleasant one have you any good reason for alluding to it  i have uncle as you say the loss of the seagull was severe for besides the loss of a fine vessel and a rich cargo there was the infinitely more terrible loss of the lives of twentytwo human beings  as mr denham had not happened to think of the loss of life that occurred on the occasion and had referred solely to the loss of ship and cargo which by a flagrant oversight on the part of one of his clerks had not been insured he made no rejoinder and guy after a moments pause went on  the effect of this calamity was so powerful on the minds of the people of deal and walmer near which the wreck took place that a public meeting was called and a proposal made that a lifeboat should be established there  well said mr denham  well continued the youth my mother gave a subscription but being poor she could not give much  well well said mr denham impatiently  andand i gave a little a very little towards it too said guy  your salary is not large it was very foolish of you to waste your money in this way  waste it uncle  come sir what does all this tend to said denham sternly  i thoughti hopedindeed i felt assured said guy earnestly that you would give something towards this good object  oh did you said the merchant cutting him short then sir allow me to say that you were never more mistaken in your life  i never give money in charity  i believe it to be a false principle which tends to the increase of beggars and criminals  you can go now  but consider uncle entreated guy this is no ordinary charity  a lifeboat there might be the means of saving hundreds of lives and oh if you could have seen as i did the despairing faces of these poor people as they clung to the rigging scarcely a stonescast from the shore on which the waves beat so furiously that no boat except a lifeboat could have lived for a moment if you could have heard as i did the wild shriek of despair as the masts went by the board and plunged every living soul into the raging sea i am certain that you would gladly give a hundred pounds or more towards this philanthropic object  nephew said denham i will not give a sixpence  your inexperience and enthusiasm lead you astray sir in this matter  lifeboats are capable of being upset as well as ordinary boats and there are cases on record in which the crews of them have been drowned as well as the people whom they recklessly went out to save  my opinion is that persons who devote themselves to a seafaring life must make up their minds to the chances and risks attending such a life  now you have my answergoodbye and give my best regards to your sister  i will expect you back next saturday week  i have still another favour to ask sir said guy after some hesitation  has it anything to do with what you are pleased to term a philanthropic object  it has  then said mr denham save me the trouble of refusing and yourself the pain of a refusal by holding your tongueand retiring  guy coloured and was about to turn away in disgust but repressing his indignation by a powerful effort he advanced with a cheerful countenance and held out his hand  well goodbye uncle  if ever you go to the coast and happen to see a storm and a shipwreck youll change your mind i think in regard to this matter  mr denham did go to the coast and did see a storm and a shipwreck but whether this prediction ever came true is a point that shall not be revealed at this part of our narrative    chapter two  in which more important personages are introduced and display their characters by their actions more or less  the three jolly tars was one of those low taverns where seamen were wont to congregatenot because it was a low tavern but because there was no other sort of tavernhigh or lowin that neighbourhood  the world that is to say the delicatelynurtured and carefullytended world is apt to form erroneous opinions in regard to low taverns and degradation and sin in generalarising from partial ignorance and absolute inexperience which it is important that we should correct in order that the characters of our story may not be falsely judged  god forbid that it should be for a moment supposed that we have a word to say in favour of low taverns  our aim just now is not to consider these but to convince the reader if possible that every man who enters one of them is not necessarily a lost or utterly depraved creature  it is undoubtedly true that these low taverns are moral pigsties  nay we owe an apology to the pigs for the comparison  sties appear to be places of abode suited to the nature and tastes of their occupants and the grumps who inhabit them seem not only to rejoice in them for this alone would be no argument inasmuch as the same may be affirmed of men who rejoice in low taverns but to be utterly incapable of higher enjoyment out of them  let a pig out of his stye afford him every conceivable opportunity of intellectual and physical improvement and he will carefully search out the nearest mudholeunhappy until he finds itwill thrust not only his nose but his body into it and will find supreme enjoyment in wallowing in the mire and no blame to him for this he is grumpish by nature  yes a low tavern is beneath the level of a pigstye  nevertheless as it is possible that for a time man may through sin or circumstances or both be reduced to such a condition as to take shelter in a pigstye without exposing himself to the charge of being a pig so it is possible that a man may frequent a low tavern not without detriment but without becoming thereby worthy of being classed with the lowest of the low  do not misunderstand us gentle reader  we do not wish in the slightest degree to palliate the coarse language the debasement the harsh villainy which shock the virtuous when visiting the haunts of poverty  our simple desire is to assure the sceptical that goodness and truth are sometimes found in strange questionable places although it is undoubtedly true that they do not deliberately search out such places for an abode but prefer a pure atmosphere and pleasant companionship if they can get it  it must not be supposed then that our friend john baxsometimes called captain sometimes skipper not unfrequently mister but most commonly bax without any modificationwas a hopeless castaway because he was found by his friend guy foster in a room full of careless foulmouthed seamen eating his bread and cheese and drinking his beer in an atmosphere so impregnated with tobacco smoke that he could scarcely see and so redolent of gin that he could scarcely smell the smoke  in those days there were not so many sailors homes and temperance coffeehouses as there are now  in the locality about which we write there were none  if jack wanted his lunch or his dinner he found the low tavern almost the only place in which he could get it comfortably tobacco smoke was no objection to himhe rather liked it  swearing did not shock himhe was used to it  gentle folk are apt to err here too  being shocked at gross sin does not necessarily imply goodness of heart it implies nothing more than the being unused to witness gross sin  goodness of heart may go along with this capacity of being shocked so equally may badness of heart but neither of them is implied by it  what a grand thing is truthsimple abstract truth and yet how little do we appreciate it in regard to the inconceivably important matter of reasoning  we analyse our chemicals and subject them to the severest tests in order to ascertain their true propertiestruth is all we aim at but how many of us can say that we analyse our thoughts and subject our reasoning to the test of logic in order simply to ascertain the truth  smoke for ever  i say bill open that there port a bit else well be choked cried a stentorian voice as guy entered the little apartment where some dozen of noisy sailors were creating the cloud which was a little too strong for them  for some moments guy glanced round inquiringly unable to pierce the dim curtain that enshrouded everything as with a veil of dirty gauze  lost your reckoning i guess drawled a yankee skipper  never mind let go your anchor my lad cried a voice from the densest quarter of the smoke its not a bad berth and good holdin ground  whatll you take to drink my boy supposin you gits the offer inquired another man giving him a facetious poke in the ribs  is john bax here inquired guy  hallo messmatehere you are port your helm and heave aheadsteady rocks to leeward starboard hard ah i knew youd never clear these rocks without touchin said bax as his young friend tripped over three or four spittoons and plunged into the corner from which the sailors deep bass voice issued  there now sit down whatll you have  nothing bax what a horrible hole to feed in  couldnt you come out and talk with me in the fresh air  it must indeed have been a wonderfully impure place when guy could venture by contrast to speak of the air outside as being fresh  couldnt do it my lad replied bax with his mouth full  i havent had a bit since six oclock this morning and im only half through  the fact was evident for a large plate of biscuit and cheese stood on the small table before the seaman with a tumbler of hot gin and water so guy sat down and observing that the waiter stood at his elbow ordered half a pint of stout  guy did not drink spirits but he had no objection to beer so he took occasion to remonstrate with bax on his tendency to drink gin and recommended beer instead as it would do him more good  it did not occur to guy that a young man in robust health does not require physical good to be done to him at all beyond what food and rest and exercise can achieve and that therefore artificial stimulant of any kind is unnecessary  skipper ahoy shouted a gruff voice in the doorway  ay ay cried several of the party in reply  is john bax in this here port  here you are replied the man in request port your helm old boy rocks on the lee bow look out  steady so said a fat burly seaman as he steered in obedience to these sailing directions and finally cast anchor beside our two friends  how are ye captain bluenose said bax holding out his hand  same to you lad replied the captain seizing the offered hand in his own enormous fist which was knotty and fleshy seamed with old cuts and scars and stained with tar  hallo  guy is this you he added turning suddenly to the youth  why whod a thought to see you here  i do blieve i hant seen ye since the last time down at the coast  but i say guy my boy you hant took to drinkin have ye  no captain said guy with a smile nothing stronger than beer and not much of that  i merely came here to meet bax  captain bluenosewhose name by the way had no reference to his nose for that was small and redscratched his chin and stared into vacancy as if he were meditating  why boy he said at length seems to me as if youd as good cause to suspec me of drinkin as i have to suspec you cause were both here dye see  howsever ive been cruisin after the same craft an so weve met dye see an thats natral so it is  well and now you have found me what dye want with me said bax finishing the bread and cheese and applying to the gin and water  shipmet im goin home and wants a berth aboard the nancy said bluenose  couldnt do it captain said bax shaking his head gainst rules  ill go as a hextra handa suppernummerary urged the captain  why captain said guy is it not strange that i should have come here to make the very same request  come bax youre a good fellow and will take us both  i will guarantee that my uncle will not find fault with you  ah that alters the case said bax if you choose to take the responsibility on your own shoulders guy youre welcome to the best berth aboard the old nancy  dye know ive a fondness for that old craft though she is about as unseaworthy a schooner as sails out o the port of london  you see shes the only craft bigger than a deal lugger that i ever had command of  shes my first love is the old nancy and i hope we wont have to part for many a day  quite right young man said captain bluenose nodding his head approvingly and filling his pipe from a supply of tobacco he always carried in the right pocket of his capacious blue waistcoat  the captain gazed with a look of grave solemnity in the manly countenance of the young sailor for whom he entertained feelings of unbounded admiration  he had dandled bax on his knee when he was a baby had taught him to make boats and to swim and row when he became a boy and had sailed with him many a time in the same lugger when they put off in wild storms to rescue lives or property from ships wrecked on the famous goodwin sands  quite right young man repeated the captain as he lighted his pipe your sentiments does you credit  wen a mans got his first love dye see an finds as how shes all trim and shipshape and taut and well ballasted and all that sort o thing stick to her to the last through thick and thin  thats wot i say dye see  theres no two ways about it for wots right cant be wrong  if it can show me how and then ill knock under but not before  certainly not captain cried bax laughing never give inthats my motto  there said bluenose gravely youre wrongcause why  youre not right an wen a mans not right he ought always to give in  but how is a fellow to know when hes right and when hes wrong asked bax  consideration said bluenose  bravo  captain cried guy with a laugh if it be true that brevity is the soul of wit you must be the wittiest fellow on deal beach  i dunknow retorted the captain slowly whether its the soul or the body o wit an wots more i dont care but its a fact dye see that considerationll do it leastwise if consideration wont nothin will  see now here it ishe became very earnest at this pointwen a thing puzzles people wot does people do why they begins right off to talk about it an state their opinions afore they hant got no opinions to state  praps they takes the puzzler up by the middle an talks wild about that part of it then they give a look at the end of it an mayhap theyll come back and glance at the beginnin mayhap they wont and then theyll tell you as grave as owls that theyve made up their minds about it and so nail their colours to the mast  at this stage in the elucidation of the knotty point bluenose observed that his pipe was going out so he paused pulled at it vigorously for a few seconds and then resumed his discourse  now lads wot ought you for to do wen youve got hold of a puzzler why you ought to sit down and consider of it which means you should begin at the beginnin an let me tell you its harder to find the beginnin of a puzzler than praps you suppose  havin found the beginnin you should look at it well and then go on lookin inch by inch and fut by fut till you comes to the end of it then look it back oncommon slow to the beginnin again after which turn it outside in or inside outit dont much matter which wayand go it all over once more after which cram your knuckles into yer two eyes an sit for halfanhour or threequarters if its tremendous deep without movin  if that dont do and you hant got time to try it over again give in at once an haul your colours down but on no occasion wotiver nail them to the mastxceptin always wen youre cocksure that youre right for then of coorse ye cant go far wrong  this little touch of philosophy convinced bax that if he did not wish to sit there half the night the sooner he changed the subject the better so he called the waiter and paid his bill saying to his companions that it was time to go aboard if they wanted a snooze before tripping the anchor  what have you had sir said the waiter turning to bluenose  the man said this with a sneer for he knew that the captain had taken nothing since he entered the house and was aware moreover that he was a waterdrinker  ive had nothin replied the captain nor dont want any thank ee  oh beg pardon sir the waiter bowed and retired impressively  the house couldnt keep goin long with some customers stammered a roughlooking halftipsy fellow who had overheard these remarks  might do something for the good of the house said another who was equally drunk  who bade you put in your oar cried the first speaker fiercely for he had reached that condition of intoxication which is well known as the fighting stage  the other man was quite ready to humour him so almost before one could understand what had been said a savage blow was given and returned oaths and curses followed and in two seconds one of the combatants had his opponent by the throat threw him on his back with his neck over the fender and his head thrust into the ashes  instantly the room was a scene of wild confusion as some of the friends of both men endeavoured to separate them while others roared in drunken glee to let em have fair play and fight it out  the result of this quarrel might have been serious had not bax thrust the yelling crowd aside and exerting to the utmost the extraordinary muscular power with which he had been endowed tore the combatants asunder by main force and hurled them violently to opposite sides of the room  shame on you lads said he can you not drink your grog without quarrelling about nothing  the towering size and the indignant look of bax as he said this were sufficient to quell the disturbance although some of the more irascible spirits could not refrain from grumbling about interference and the yankee roundly asserted that before hed go into a public and sit down and smoke his pipe without doin somethin for the good o the ouse hed like to see himself chawed up pretty slick he would  waiter ahoy shouted captain bluenose sternly on hearing this  yessir  bring me a tumbler o gin and a pot o cold water  tumleroginsiranaporocol war sir  yessir  the waiter stopped suddenly and turned back  mixed sir  no not mixed sir replied bluenose with a look and tone of withering sarcasm contrairywise wery much separated  when the gin and water were placed on the table the captain quietly took up the former and cast it glass and all under the grate after which he raised the pot of water to his lips and looking round on the company with a bland smile said  there ive took somethin for the good of the house and now lads ill drink to your better health and happiness in my favourite tipple the wich i heartily recommend to you  bluenose drained the pot flung a halfcrown on the table and swaggered out of the house with his hands deep in the pockets of his rough peajacket  the fact was that the worthy captain felt aggrieved and his spirit was somewhat ruffled at the idea of being expected to drink in a house where he had oftentimes for years past regaled himself with and expended his money upon bread and cheese and gingerbeer    chapter three  in which the introduction of important personages is continued in rather exciting circumstances  where aways the boat lad said captain bluenose to bax on recovering his equanimity  close at hand mind the fluke of that anchor  the owner of this spot should be put in limbo for settin mantraps  have a care of your shins guy its difficult navigation here on a dark night  all right bax replied guy ill keep close in your wake so if you capsize we shall at least have the comfort of foundering together  the place through which the three friends were groping their way was that low locality of mud and old stores which forms the border region between land and water and in which dwelt those rats which have been described as being frolicsome and numerous  hold hard roared bluenose as he tripped over the shank of an anchor why dont you set up a lighthouse or a beacon o some sort on these here shoals  starboard old boy starboard hard steady cried bax  with seamanlike promptitude the captain obeyed and thus escaped tumbling off the end of the wharf at which they had arrived  nancy ahoy cried bax in a subdued shout  a juvenile ay ay sir instantly came back in reply from the dark obscurity that overhung the river  the sound of oars followed  smart little fellow that nephew of yours hell do you credit some day said bax turning towards bluenose who although close at his side was scarcely visible so dark was the night  the captains rejoinder was cut short by the boy in question sending the bow of the boat crash against the wharf an exploit which had the effect of pitching him heels over head into the bottom of it  why didnt you give us a hail uncle remonstrated the boy as he rose and rubbed his elbows  good practice my lad its good practice replied bluenose chuckling as he stepped in  a few seconds sufficed to take them alongside of the nancy in two narrow berths of which the captain and guy were quickly stowed away and sound asleep while bax paced the deck slowly overhead having relieved the watch and sent him below  just half an hour or so before dawnthat mysterious unreal and solemn period of the night or morningcaptain bluenose came on deck minus his coat and shoes in order to have a look at how things were getting onas if the general operations of nature had been committed to his charge and he were afraid lest the sun should not be able to rise without his assistance  light air westsouwest muttered the captain as he stepped on deck cast a glance up at the vane on the masthead and then swept his eye round the imaginary horizon  there was not much to be seen except the numerous lights of the shipping and the myriad lamps of the great city whose mighty hum of life had not yet begun to awaken  it was the deadest hour of night if we may use the expression although advanced towards morning  the latest of late sittersup had gone to bed and got to sleep and the earliest of early risers had not yet been aroused  none save nightworkers and nightwatchers were astir and these did not disturb in any appreciable degree the deep quiet of the hour  while bax and his friend were conversing in subdued tones near the binnacle they were startled by a piercing shriek followed by a heavy plunge in the water which from the sound appeared to be not far distant  they sprang to the bow which was pointing down the river the floodtide was running strong up at the time  on reaching it they heard a gurgling cry not twenty yards ahead of the vessel  hold on cried bax to bluenose sharply at the same time fastening the end of a rope round his waist with the speed of thought and plunging over the side headforemost  the cry and the plunge brought guy foster on deck instantly  he found the captain holding on with all his might to the end of the rope on which there seemed to be a tremendous strain  take a turn round that belayin pin gasped the captain  guy obeyed and the moment his companion was relieved he shouted all hands ahoy  it was unnecessary  the four men who formed the crew of the nancy were already springing up the forehatch  there was bustle among the shipping too  lights danced about the sound of oars was heard in various directions and sharp eager shouts as of men who felt that life was in danger but knew not where to hasten in order to afford aid  haul now lads with a will cried the captain so steady avast heaving  ah thats a smart lad  while the men were hauling on the rope little tommy had bounded over the side into the boat which he quickly brought close to the rope and seizing it guided his craft to the end to which bax was fastened  he found him buffeting the strong current stoutly and supporting a head on his shoulder in such a way that the mouth should not get below water  all right tommy said bax quietly  dont get excited my lad lend a hand to raise her a bit out o the water  now can you hold her there for one moment  yes if you just give me the end of that shawl in my teethso  tommy could say no more for he was squeezed flat against the gunwale of the boat with his stout little arms tight round the neck and waist of a female figure the fingers of his left hand grasping her hair and his legs twisted in a remarkable manner round the thwart to keep him from being dragged out of the boat besides which his mouth was full of the shawl  bax at once grasped the gunwale and moved hand over hand to the stern where by a powerful effort he raised himself out of the water and sprang inboard  a few minutes more sufficed to enable him to drag the female a young girl into the boat and place her in safety on the schooners deck  the whole thing was done in much less time than is required to tell it only one of the boats that were out searching discovered the schooner just as the female was got on board  all right inquired one of the men  all rightsaved was the answer and the boat pulled away into the obscurity of the morning mist with a cheer of congratulation  then all was again silent and the sluggish tide glided slowly past the dark hulls that rested on the bosom of the thames  on carrying the girl into the small cabin of the nancy it was found that she was still in a state of insensibility  the dim light of the swinging lamp fell on her pale face and revealed to the surprised and sympathetic beholders features of great beauty and delicate form over which masses of dark brown hair straggled in wild confusion  now lads clear out o the way cried captain bluenose pulling off his coat energetically  leave this here little craft to me  i know xactly wots got to be done dye see  turn her on her facethere never go for to put a drownded body on its back be it man or woman stick that coat under her breast and her arm under her forehead  so now well go to work  there is no doubt that the worthy captain understood precisely what he meant to do and was working on a systematic plan but what the result of his labours might have been it is impossible to say for at that moment he was interrupted by the tread of hurried footsteps on deck and the sudden entrance of a silveryhaired man whose black coat vest and pantaloons contrasted strangely with his heavy oilskin coat and souwester and tended to puzzle the beholder as to whether he was a landsman in nautical outer garments or a seaman clothed partly in what jack calls shoregoing toggery  there was an expression of wild anxiety on the mans face as he sprang towards the prostrate form of the girl fell on his knees and seizing her hand exclaimed lucy dearest lucy  he stopped suddenly as if he had been choked and bending his ear close to lucys lips listened for a few seconds with knitted brow and compressed lips  at that moment there was a flutter on the eyelids of the girl and a broken sigh escaped her  the man kneeling at her side sprang convulsively to his feet raised his hands high above his head and exclaimed o god in christs name i thank thee in tones so fervent as almost to approach to a shout  with this irrepressible cry of gratitude every trace of strong emotion appeared to vanish from the countenance and the manner of the stranger turning to bluenose who had been gazing at this scene in much surprise not unmingled with anxiety he said in a calm but quick voice  my friend this child is my daughter  pray leave me alone with her for a few minutes  excuge a oldish man sir said the captain praps youd better let me stay cause why i knows how to treat drownded  thank you it is unnecessary said the stranger  besides i myself am acquainted with the rules of the humane society  but you can aid me by getting hot blankets and warm coffee  come along captain cried bax seizing his friend by the arm and dragging him out of the cabin  guy had quitted it followed by tommy the instant the old man had expressed a wish to be left alone with his child  there now you obstinate man cried bax relaxing his grasp on gaining the foot of the companion ladder up with you and send tommy to look after coffee and blankets  he knows where to get em  ill go and put on dry toggery the best thing that you can do is to keep out of peoples way  this latter piece of advice was not very agreeable to one whose heart was tender and his desire to engage in works of active benevolence very strong  but feeling that the advice was good and thoroughly appreciating the fact that having shipped as a suppernummerary hand he was bound to obey his young commander he went on deck without remonstrance walked aft to the binnacle and began to fill his pipe  guy and tommy were already there engaged in earnest conversation  the ruddy light of the binnacle lamp streamed up in the face of the latter and revealed his curly fair hair clustering in wild disorder over his flushed brow as with fire gleaming in his blue eyes he stared up in his companions face and related how that bax in the coolest manner possible had kept treading water with the girl in his arms knowing quite well that not even his strength great though it was could enable him to pull himself by the rope to the ship against the tide and knowing that in a few minutes some one would get into the boat and pick them up  and so some one did and very cleverly and bravely done it was tommy said guy laying his hand kindly on the boys shoulder  well i dont think much o that replied tommy  it dont call for much courage to jump into a boat of a fine night twist your legs round a thort and hold on to a girl by claws and teeth till somebody comes to yer help  it was all very well for tommy to disclaim credit for what he had done but the glad triumphant expression of his face and his firm erect gait proved that he was very much satisfied indeed with the share he had had in that nights adventure  ah sir continued the boy there never was a man like bax  you appear to admire him very much said guy and from the little that i have seen of him i think you have good reason  admire him cried tommy with a look of scorn no i dont  i like him  hes a trump  whos a trump inquired bluenose coming up at that moment  bax replied the boy with the air of one who takes up an impregnable position and defies the whole world in arms to overthrow him  so he is so he is a reglar trump said the captain an wots more there aint no more of them there trumps in the pack for hes the king of arts he is  an youre a trump too tommy youre the knave of arts you are ye little beggar  go and git blankets and hot coffee for that gal and look sharp my lad  i have heard you speak once or twice of bax and his exploits said guy foster when the boy left them but this is the first time i have seen him perform  i did not see much of him when down on the coast last summer but i saw enough to make me like him  is he really the wonderful fellow that tommy makes him out to be  wonderful echoed the captain puffing his pipe vigorously as was his wont when a little puzzled for an expression or an idea  no he aint wonderful thats not the word  hes a lifepreserver thats wot he is  none o your hinflated injinrubber or cork affairs but a reglar hanimated walkin selfactin lifepreserver  why ive knowd him off and on since he was the length of a marline spike dye seean ive seed him save dozens ay dozens of livesmen women and childrenin lifeboats an in luggers an swimmin  why he thinks no more o that wot hes done tonight than he does of eatin salt junk  hes got a silver medal from the royal lifeboat institution an another from the queen of spain and a gold un from some other king or queen i dont xactly know whobesides no end o thanks written on paper also on wot they calls wellum in beautiful german text and smallhandho you know nobody knows wot that fellers been adoin of all his life  if he was hung round with all the gold and silver medals he deserves to have hed go to the bottomlifepreserver though he islike the sheetanchor of a seventyfour he would  whats that about going to the bottom said bax who came aft at the moment  thats just wot youve got nothin to do with replied bluenose resuming his pipe which in the ardour of his discourse he had removed from his lips and held out at arms length before him  well i have not much to do with going to the bottom said bax laughing  but wheres tommyoh here you are  have you attended to orders  blankits hot just bin sent in  coffee hot follers in five minits  brayvo ejaculated bluenose with an approving smile  i wonder who the old man is said guy  he neither looks like a landsman nor a seaman but a sort of mixture of both  so he is said bax  i happen to know him though he does not know me  he is a scripture reader to sailors burton by name and has spent many years of his life at work on the coast in the neighbourhood of ramsgate  i suppose he was goin down the coast in the vessel out of which his daughter tumbled  i didnt know he had a daughter  by the way shes not a bad one to begin with tommy a regular beauty continued bax with a smile  youve often wondered whether the first would be a man or a woman or a child  the point is settled now  yes replied the boy with a grave meditative look  i suppose i may say shes my first for you know you could not have done it without me  there was something ludicrous as well as sublime in this little chip of humanity gravely talking of poor lucy burton being his first as if he had just entered on a new fishingground and were beginning to take account of the creatures he had the good fortune to haul out of the sea  and in very truth reader this was the case  under the training of a modest lionhearted british sailor the boy was beginning to display in unusual vigour those daring enthusiastic selfsacrificing qualities which although mingled with much that is evil are marked characteristics of our seamen qualities which have gone far to raise our little island to her present high position of commercial prosperity and political importance and which with gods blessing will continue to carry our flag our merchandise and our bibles to the ends of the earth and guard our shores as in days of old from the foot of every foreign foe  england can never fully appreciate how much she owes to her seamen  the thousands of our inland population have a very inadequate conception of the race of heroes by which our coasts are peopled  bax is no exaggerated specimen got up in these sensation days for effect  it is a glorious factproved by the hard and bare statistics furnished annually by the board of trade and from other sourcesthat his name is legion and that the men of whom he is a type swarm all round our coasts from the old ultima thule to the lands end  yes tommy was in good training  he had begun well  he was evidently a chip of the elder block  it did not indeed occur to his young imagination to suppose that he could ever become anything in the most distant degree resembling his idol bax  neither did he entertain any definite idea as to what his young heart longed after but he had seen life saved he had stood on the seashore when storms cast shattered wrecks upon the sands and had witnessed the exploits of boatmen in their brave efforts to save human life he had known what it was to weep when the rescuer perished with those whom he sought to save and he had helped to swell with his tiny voice the bursting cheer of triumph when men women and children were plucked as if by miracle from the raging sea  to take part in those deeds of heroism was the leading desire in the boys life and now it seemed as if his career were commencing in earnest and the daydreams in which he had so long indulged were at last about to become waking realities    chapter four  in which introductions still go on and coming events cast their shadows before  mrs maria fosterthe widow of james foster formerly captain in the merchant service the mother of guy foster clerk in the firm of denham crumps and company and the promoter or supporter of every good causewas a little woman of fiveandforty or thereabouts with mild blue eyes a philanthropic heart and pale blue ribbons in her cap  mrs foster may be said to have been in easy circumstances  that is to say she had sufficient being a thrifty and economical lady to make the two ends meet even to overlap somewhat though notas a friend of ours once observedto tie in a handsome bow so that she had a little to spare for charitable purposes  it must not be supposed however that the good lady was possessed of a small fortune  the circumstances which were easy to her would have proved remarkably uneasy to many but she possessed the rare and tailorly quality of being able and willing to cut her coat according to her cloth  there was no deeper mystery than that in the ease with which we have characterised her circumstances  the coast of kent was her locality the environs of the town of deal her neighbourhood and a smallalmost miniature but prettycottage her habitation  the cottage stood in the middle of a little garden close to that wide extent of waste land lying to the north of deal which is known by the name of the sandhills and on the seaward edge of which formerly stood the pileand now lie the remainsof sandown castle  everything in and around the cottage was remarkably neatincluding its mistress who on the evening of the day in which her son sailed with bax in the nancy was seated at a little table in her small parlour summing up an account on a sheet of notepaperan operation which appeared to cause her much perplexity if one might judge from her knitted brows her deep sighs and her frequent remarks of it wont do and what can it be  these observations were apparently addressed to the cat which sat in front of the fire watching the teakettle and the buttered toast but although the good lady was addicted to talking to her cat in a general way about her love for it and its state of health we cannot suppose that she really appealed to it on such a grave subject as arithmetical calculation  if she did she got no answer from the catnot even a sign of recognition but she did from a brightfaced fairhaired girl of about eighteen who at that moment entered the room with a teapot in one hand and a creamjug in the other  what is it that puzzles you mamma said the girl setting down the pot and jug and preparing to attend to the duties of the teatable  to this mrs foster replied in an absent way that she didnt know that it was quite beyond her comprehension and that she was utterly perplexed but that she would find it out if she should sit all night over it  whereupon she proceeded to state that three and two made five and seven mademadeshe wasnt quite sure how much that made until her companion told her it made twelve which piece of information she received with anoh of course it does  dear me amy how silly i amjust as if she had known the fact all her life and had only forgotten it at that moment unaccountably for the first time  mrs foster then went on to add a variety of other figures to thiswith an occasional word of assistance from amyuntil the whole amounted to the sum of one hundred and thirtythree  there said mrs foster with a pleased expression as she put the figures down now how many twelves are in thateh let me see  twelve times twelve are a hundred and fortyno thats too much twelve times elevenhow much is twelve times eleven  mrs foster did not ask this of amy no she gazed up at the ceiling where an uncommonly large spider was affixing its webwith the design no doubt of lowering itself down to the teatableand demanded the solution of the problem apparently from that creature  i think it is a hundred and thirtytwo mamma said amy pouring out the tea  oh of course how stupid said mrs foster who was quite struck with the obviousness of the facton being told it  there now that comes to eleven shillings and one penny which settles the soup kitchen one pound two does the hospital for the blind and theres one pound due to the sailors home  but still continued mrs foster with a return of the perplexed expression that does not get me out of my difficulty  come to tea dear said amy and we will try to clear it up together afterwards  impossible child  i could not eat with appetite while this is puzzling my brain  let me see there were fifteen pounds apparently spent last year when i put it on paper and yet here is a sovereign over said mrs foster holding up the coin and looking at it reproachfully as if the blame lay with it and not with herself  well mamma said amy laughing but where is your difficulty  dont you see child by rights i ought to give fifteen pounds away well my book tells me that fifteen pounds have been given and yet here is a sovereign left over to give  then dont give it mamma just put it back into your purse and that will make the thing right wont it  no dear it wont because you see the money must be right so the book must be wrong oh here it is  i declare i have forgot to carry one  there thats right  now dear we shall have tea  it may be necessary to explain here that although amy called mrs foster mamma she was in fact not related to her at all being only an adopted daughter  poor amy russell was a child of the sea  two years previous to the time of which we write she with her father and mother had been wrecked on the coast of kent while returning from a long residence in new zealand  their vessel filled the moment she struck and the seas buried the hull so completely that passengers and crew were obliged to take to the rigging  here they remained all night exposed to the fury of the storm  many of the unfortunates unable to withstand the exposure of that terrible night fell or were washed out of the rigging and perished  among these were amys father and mother amy herself was taken care of by the captain with whom she was a great favourite and along with those who remained until the morning was saved by one of the lifeboats stationed on that coast  they had a narrow escape from drowning even after being taken into the boat for just as they were approaching the entrance to the harbour where crowds of the inhabitants of the town were anxiously watching them a tremendous sea completely filled the boat swept away the starboard oars and carried several of the wrecked passengers overboard amy being one of them  this happened close under the head of the pier all the passengers were recovered by the lifeboats crew in a few seconds with the exception of amy who being exhausted by previous exposure began to sink at once  the boatmen in the turmoil of raging water and howling wind did not observe this and a cry of consternation was uttered by the people on the pier who saw the whole thing clearly from their elevated position but the cry was either drowned by the noise of the tempest or not understood by the boatmen  at that moment a tall stripling on the pier raced to the edge of it shot like a rocket headforemost into the sea and in a second or two reappeared with the young girl in his arms  they were both dragged into the lifeboat amid ringing cheers of delight and admiration  the stripling who did this brave deed was none other than our friend guy foster who chanced to be lodging with his mother in the neighbouring town at that time  guy insisted on having amy conveyed to his mothers place of abode  mrs foster soon discovered that the poor orphan had neither relations nor friends in england and having taken a fancy to her adopted her as a daughter  thus did she come to call mrs foster mamma and to preside at the teatable in sandhill cottage  but to return from this digressionmrs foster was congratulating herself on having discovered the error in her accounts when the door opened and a stout florid woman of fifty or thereabouts with a shiny red skin presented herself and said  please maam heres a gentleman as wants to see you and wont go away though i told him you was at tea wich is a fact though it had no impression whatever on him such is his imprence goin for to reflect on my character for truth as never told a lie since i was a baby in long frocks so i didnt but its always the way with these men that go taxgatherin though i dont know that hes that neether so i dont what shall i say maam  mrs laker having uttered the foregoing without pause or inflection of voice from beginning to end came to an abrupt stop  whether from want of breath or ideas it is difficult to say perhaps from both  show the gentleman in laker said mrs foster no doubt he has good reason for wishing to see me  laker vanished  she was impulsive in her actions as well as in her words  she was her mistresss factotumher cook housemaid sempstress and confidential adviser in addition to which she was somewhat of a bore being stubborn and opinionated but a good and faithful servant on the whole  the individual who was presently introduced was a bustling little old gentleman with a shining bald head and a cheerful countenance  excuse my rudenessmadam he began bowing low as he advanced with a hesitating stepthis intrusion really  do not mention it sir pray be seated said mrs foster you are welcomesurely i have met with you before  she put on a pair of gold spectacles as she said this and looked earnestly at her visitor who having placed his hat on the floor and bowed to amy sat down and pulled out a bundle of papers  you have madam replied the visitor  my name is summersdavid summers maam at your service  i had the pleasure of being introduced to you at a meeting in a town not far distant where an effort was being made to raise contributions towards the establishment of a lifeboat  oh  i recollect cried mrs foster whose sympathetic heart at once opened to the man who had made as she had thought such an eloquent appeal at the meeting in question i am delighted to see you mr summers  if i mistake not i invited you to come and see me when you should visit this part of the coast  you were kind enough to do so madam hence my venturing to call at this hour  i quit deal tomorrow early and i am anxious to replead my old cause with you but indeed i know this to be unnecessary your own sympathies being already enlisted in my favour  mrs foster assured mr summers that he was right but begged of him notwithstanding to plead with her as if she were an enemy in order that she might hear all he had to say on the subject adding that she hoped he would stay and have a cup of tea  hereupon mr summers bowed drew in his chair remarked to amy that the lifeboat service was one of the most interesting and important topics of the day and the national lifeboat institution one of the most valuable institutions in the kingdom and at once launched into his favourite theme with all the gusto of an enthusiast who has gained the ear of a sympathetic audience  we will however spare the reader the details and statistics which afforded so much pleasure to mrs foster and her adopted daughter knowing full well that there is an immense difference between these when set down in hard type and when poured forth in rich energetic tones backed by twinkling eyes and a beaming countenance  do you really mean to tell me mr summers said mrs fosterwhen the old gentleman came to the end of a long statement that about a thousand ships are wrecked and nearly a thousand lives lost besides more than a million pounds worth of property on the shores of this country every year  it is a sad but incontrovertible fact replied mr summers  official lists are drawn up annually by the board of trade which give the number and positions of wreckscold dry lists they are too  matteroffact columns and figures without a touch of softness about them  they are not meant to appeal to the feelings they are a mere record of facts so many vessels went ashore in such and such a galethey were sunk dismasted dashed to pieces  so many persons were saved so many drownedthat is all  ah who can picture to himself the awful realities that are condensed in those brief accounts  when a magnificent steamer after a fine voyage from the antipodes comes within hail of port is caught in a fearful hurricane cast ashore and dashed to pieces leaving hundreds of passengers men women and children to perish in the dark night grasping the very rocks of their native land the event is too awful to escape notice  so numerous are the crushed and broken hearts in the land that their cry awakens public attention and the newspapers teem for a time with graphic details of the wreck details which graphic though they be fall inconceivably short of the dread reality but no notice is taken except in the way of brief record of the dozens of small coasting vessels that shared the fate of that steamer in the same terrific gale  no one reads the fate of yonder little schooner one mast of which is seen just peeping out of the sea under that frowning cliff and yet there is a terrible tale connected with it  who shall tell or conceive of the agonies endured before the morning light came by the skipper and his crew of four men and a boy as their little ship was lifted and flung upon the rocks by each succeeding wave  and who can conceive their feelings when the longed for light did come at last and daring fishermen on the shore sought to render aid in vain for their boats were overturned and cast back upon the beach and themselves barely escaped with their lives and so the perishing men stood in helpless misery and gazed landward in despair until a mighty wave carried away the mast to which they clung and with a last wild shriek they sank in sight of friends and home because there was no lifeboat there  can this be true said mrs foster in a tone of deep sympathy  true echoed mr summers would god that it were not  i have mentioned but one case yet it is a fact that for every gale that blows dozens of wrecks take place on our coasts each with its more or less tragic history  you remember the last gale  it is not three weeks since it blew  no fewer than one hundred and ninetyfive wrecks took place on the shores of the united kingdom on that night and the following day and six hundred and eightyfour lives were lost many of which would undoubtedly have been saved had there been a sufficient number of lifeboats stationed along our shores for you must bear in remembrance that although hundreds of lives are annually saved by ordinary shore boats and by ships boats hundreds also are saved by lifeboats in circumstances in which ordinary boats would be utterly useless  here is a newspaper paragraph continued the old gentleman unfolding a paper and preparing to read which shows the brief way in which the public prints at times notice events of the most stirring and heroic natureon the morning of the 3rd december last after a stormy and rainy night the wind shifted to the north west and blew a hurricane many vessels got on shore near holyhead from various causes  the lifeboat of the national lifeboat institution was launched and proceeded to their assistance  she got ahead of one a schooner and anchored but the intense violence of the wind blew her to leeward anchor and all and she was unable to communicate and had great difficulty in returning ashore  she again put off to the schooner elizabeth of whitehaven which had a signal of distress flying having parted one chain and brought her crew of four men on shore  the hurricane continued unabated well into the night  the weather having moderated the lifeboat was despatched at 2 am and brought on shore twentythree men from the confiance of liverpool then again put off and brought ashore nineteen men from the barque elizabeth morrow of glasgow next proceeded to the schooner lesperance of nantes and saved two men making altogether a total of fortyeight lives saved by the lifeboat in this hurricane only  dear madam observed mr summers looking at mrs foster over his spectacles surely it is unnecessary for me to point out that this brief narrative does not give us the most distant conception of the terrors the endurance the heroism incident to that night  permit me to read you another paragraph  it is given more in detail and does better justice to the scene  the old gentleman selected another paper opened it and read as follows  the sum of 9 pounds has recently been given by the national lifeboat institution to a boats crew in appreciation of their gallant conduct in putting off in a salmoncoble during a heavy gale of wind and rescuing at great risk of life the crew of four men of the schooner thankful of sunderland which was totally wrecked off burghead nb on the 19th july  every moment the position of the ship was becoming more dangerous as the advancing tide drove her in among the small rocks at the back of the seawall and no boat could live in the terrible surge that was fast breaking up the vessel  the crew four in number along with the pilot took to the forerigging and in a short time the beach was strewn with pieces of the wreckthe bulwarks were nearly all destroyedthe boat washed overboardand the deck broken up  though only forty yards from the pier not the least assistance could be rendered to the crew whose faces were quite distinguishable as they clung to the swaying rigging  at twenty minutes past six the foremast cracked and its living freight had hardly time to crawl down to the only bulwark above water for the schooner now lay on her beamends with her bilge towards the sea when it fell by the board  in about five minutes more the maintopmast was snapped by the gale as if it had been a reed while the bowsprit and other gear were carried away leaving nothing but the gutted hull with the mainmast standing  another hour of awful suspense passed during which the five men lashed themselves to the bulwark the sea every other minute breaking over their heads in huge masses  at halfpast seven one of the sailors a young man was washed from the wreck but fortunately succeeded in catching the floating rigging by which he was able to regain his former position another young heroic sailor seemed to be the life of the whole company in this trying emergency and his efforts to keep up the spirits of his companions were signally successful  about eight oclock the waves broke over the ship with renewed violence but still those on the shore could return no answer in the affirmative to the piercing cry that came from the wreck cant we get a boat  the voice was that of the gallant sailor already referred to the others were too much exhausted to utter a word  mcintosh the pilot from burghead expired from sheer cold and exhaustion  none who saw him perish soon forgot the fearful agony of his daughter as she bade her father farewell from the parapet of the breakwater  after renewed efforts a boat was got over the breakwater and at great risk succeeded in saving the other men who were in a very exhausted condition  and now dear madam pursued the old gentleman tying up his papers i will not run the risk of wearying you with more details but come to the point at once by soliciting from you a contribution towards the establishment of a lifeboat on the coast here where i am sure you must be well aware there is very great need for one  i am sure there is said mrs foster opening her box alas  i fear the wind is rising even now  the rattling of the windowframes will bring what you have told me to remembrance ever after this night  how much does it require to establish a lifeboat  between five and six hundred pounds replied mr summers  after which about twenty pounds annually will suffice to maintain it in working order  so much exclaimed mrs foster  i fear that you will find it difficult to raise so large a sum  i trust not but if we raise a pretty large proportion of it the lifeboat institution will make up the balance  perhapshere the old gentleman paused and looked dubiously at mrs fosterperhaps you would like to know the precise nature of the objects for which the lifeboat institution has been founded  will you do me the favour to listen for five minutes longer  the operations of the institution are of deep importance to the national welfare  mrs foster at once expressed her willingness to listen and the old gentleman reopening his bundle of papers selected one from which he read sundry interesting details regarding the national lifeboat institution  it need scarcely be said that with such a sympathetic mind to address as that of mrs foster mr summers prolonged his visit for another hour and it is perhaps equally unnecessary to say that the worthy lady found a suitable object on which to bestow the sovereign which had perplexed her so much at an earlier part of the evening  she not only gave the money with the air of a cheerful giver but she begged mr summers to send her as many papers on the subject of lifeboats and wrecks as he happened to be possessed of and promised to become an active agent in pleading with her friends in behalf of the object he had in view  the wind was rising while the party in sandhill cottage were thus engaged  it came in ominous and heavy gusts rattling the windowframes and moaning in the chimneys to such an extent that mrs laker who was of a timid and superstitious nature was fain to sit outside the parlour door in order to be near the other inmates of the cottage  about a thousand lives lost in each year on the shores of this kingdom thought mrs foster as she lay in bed that night listening to the rising storm with feelings of awe and solemnity which she had never before experienced  if mrs foster had been acquainted with the subject in detail she might have had further food for solemn reflection in the fact that the greater part of those lives were lost unnecessarily that their loss was owing not nearly so much to the direct providence of god as to the incompetence the ignorance the false economy and the culpable carelessness of man  mrs fosters head lay on a soft pillow while the tempest raged around her humble dwelling  she little thought that one around whom her heartstrings were entwined was out on the wild sea that night exposed to its utmost fury and in urgent need of the aid of that species of boat which had filled her thoughts that evening and still continued to influence her dreams    chapter five  the galefalse economy and its resultsa wreck on the goodwin sands  what seamen style a whole gale seemed to be brewing when the nancy tripped her anchor and shook out her sails  sailors have a quiet matteroffact and professional way of talking about the weather  landsmen would be surprised perhaps something more if exposed to what jack calls a stiff breeze or a capful of wind  a whole gale may sound peculiar to some ears but if the said gale were to sound in the same ears the hearers would be apt to style it in consternation a most tremendous hurricane  on board the nancy bax and bluenose had some suspicion that something was brewing but whether a whole gale or half a gale or a stiff breeze they could not be expected to divine not being possessed of supernatural gifts  had they been possessed of a good barometer they would have been able to foretell what was coming without supernatural gifts but messrs denham crumps and company were economical in their tendencies and deemed barometers superfluous  being to some extent ignorant of nautical affairs as well as of scientific and being to a large extent indifferent to the warning voices of those who knew better they thought fit to intrust the nancy to the unaided wisdom of the intelligent young seaman who commanded her  of course being acute men of business they took every needful precaution and being men of experience they were not blind to the fact that many vessels were annually lost they therefore insured schooner and cargo to their full value  having done so messrs denham crumps and company felt at ease  if the nancy should happen to go downno matter it would perhaps be a more rapid and satisfactory way of terminating a doubtful venture  it was just possible that in the event of the nancy going down lives might be lost and other lives rendered desolate  what then  the firm had nothing to do with that the lives embarked in the nancy did not belong to denham crumps and company  if they should go to the bottom there would be nothing to lose and nothing to pay perhaps a trifle to the widows and children that was all  in regard to this also they felt quite at ease  on the strength of such views and opinions the tackling of the nancy was allowed to become rotten the cables and the anchors of the nancy were economically weak and insufficient the charts of the nancy were old and inaccurate and the nancy herself was in all respects utterly unseaworthy  it could scarcely be expected however that the operations of nature were to be suspended because of the unprepared condition of this vessel not to mention hundreds of others in similar condition  the gale continued to brew  a stiff breeze carried the nancy down the thames towards the open sea then a sudden calm left her to float without progressive motion on the water  as evening approached the breeze sprang up again and freshened  then it chopped round to the east and when night fell it began to blow hard right in the teeth of the little vessel  bax was a good and a bold seaman  he knew the coast well and hoped in due course to double the north foreland and find shelter in the downs he knew the channels and buoys thoroughly and had often run the same course in stormy weather  but the gale which now began to buffet the little schooner was of more than ordinary violence  it was one of those fierce hurricanes which once in a year or it may be once in three or four years bursts upon our island strews the coast with wrecks fills many homes and hearts with desolation and awakens the inhabitants of the inland counties to a slight sense of the terrible scenes that are of constant occurrence on the shores which form the bulwark of their peaceful homes  we shall have rough weather tonight i fear observed mr burton coming on deck some time after sunset and addressing bax doubtless you know the channels well young sir  i do replied the sailor with a peculiar smile  twelve years experience has not been altogether thrown away on me  i have sailed these waters in old jephs lugger since i was a little boy  is that old jeph the smuggler sometimes called the mad philosopher from the circumstance of his mind being much taken up with odd notions about lifeboats inquired the missionary  the same replied bax though ill go bound for it theres not an honester man in deal than old jeph is now whatever he may have done in the smuggling way when he was young  i have known him only as a good old man and in regard to these same notions he has about lifeboats its my firm belief that well see his plans or something like them carried out before long  hes not so mad as folk think and certainly not half so mad as the people who give no thought whatever to these subjects  bax said this warmly for there was a strong bond of sympathy between him and his old friend whom he could not bear to hear mentioned in a slighting manner  i meant not to say a word against old jeph replied mr burton quickly  i merely spoke of him in the way in which seamen in these parts commonly refer to him  it pleases me much to hear so good a character of him from one who i have no doubt has had good opportunity of judging  here guy foster who was standing near the binnacle turned round and said earnestly  i can testify to the fact that old jeph is a good christian man at least if love to our saviour and anxiety for the salvation of souls is to be accepted as evidence  the missionary said that there was no better evidence than that and was about to question bax further in regard to the old man who bore such a peculiar character when a loud peal of thunder drew the attention of all to the threatening aspect of the weather  heave the lead bill cried bax to one of the men  ha thats wot ive been lookin for observed bluenose spitting his quid over the lee bulwarks and replacing it with a fresh one  ive never got no confidence in a skipper as dont keep his lead agoin in shoal water  specially in sich waters as them ere wot shifts more or less with every gale  the command to heave the lead was followed by an order to reduce sail and as the gale freshened and the night closed in this order was repeated more than once until the schooner was beating to windward under the smallest possible amount of canvas  an anxious expression rested on baxs face as he stood by the steersman glancing alternately at the sails and at the horizon where clouds of the blackest kind were gathering  does your barometer indicate very bad weather inquired mr burton  i have no barometer replied bax bitterly  the missionary looked surprised and guy foster bit his lip for he felt that this piece of false economy was a blot on the firm to which he belonged  in order to change the subject he inquired for lucy who since the time of her rescue had remained in bed  my daughter does well thanks be to god said burton  i think that no evil will flow from her accident for she was but a short time in the water thanks to you friend bax  and to my prentice tommy bogey said bax with an arch smile which was peculiar to him when he felt humorously disposed  the smile fled however and was replaced by an anxious look as tommy himself came aft and reported that the schooner had sprung a leak  bax instantly went below and returned with the assurance that the leak was trifling  the nancy is a sorry old hulk said he but half an hour more on this tack and ill bout ship and run for the downs where we will be comparatively safe  the gale had by this time increased so much that the little craft lay over with her lee bulwarks almost under water at times  little fear would her gallant commander have felt had she been tight and trim and sound but he knew that her rigging was old and one of her masts unsound and he felt that the best seamanship could be of no avail whatever against her numerous defects  his experienced eye told him that a storm of no ordinary severity was coming and he trembled for the life of the young girl who had been so unexpectedly placed under his care  had the dangers attendant upon an unseaworthy vessel and the difficulty of navigating the channels of these celebrated sands been all that bax had to fear he would have felt comparatively at ease but the economical spirit of denham crumps and company had supplied him with anchors and chains which he feared were neither new enough nor sufficiently powerful to hold his vessel after she had gained her anchorageground  in these circumstances he resolved to run for the shelter of ramsgate harbour  before he could carry out his intentions the wind chopped round to the north and for some time blew so hard as to threaten the capsizing of the schooner  the cross sea also rendered her almost unmanageable so that ere long she was driven to leeward of the outer lightship that marks the north end of the goodwins  again the wind shifted a few points to the eastward and soon the nancy was flying like a racehorse towards the shore  pilots and seamen alone can properly comprehend the peculiar dangers that attend the navigation of this part of our coast  it would only perplex a landsman to be told in detail the proceedings of the nancy and her crew after this point  suffice it to say that bax handled her with consummate skill and did all that man could do for the safety of his vessel and the human lives that were dependent on his knowledge and care  is your daughter dressed inquired bax of mr burton as a fiercer gust than usual nearly laid the schooner on her beamends and deluged the decks with water  no she sleeps soundly and i am loth to disturb her  do you think we are in much danger  in none if the schooner were seaworthy but in much seeing that she has not got a sound plank or spar  go down sir and get her dressed at once and harkee let her put on every wrap she happens to have with her  the missionary needed no second bidding  he went below to rouse and assist lucy while bluenose guy and the rest of those on board held on to ropes and belaying pins and awaited the result in silence  the noise of the wind and the peals of thunder that seemed to tear the heavens asunder rendered conversation impossible  they all felt that a few minutes would decide whether this terrible rush landward would terminate in safety or disaster and they knew that everything as far as human skill had to do with it depended on bax  with a look of calm sober gravity the young seaman stood grasping the weathershrouds of the mainmast and looking intently towards the lightship called the gull light which is anchored off the northsandhead  during this period of suspense the lead was kept constantly going and reported almost every halfminute  precious significant halfminutes those as much so as are the last few grains of sand in the hourglass  keep her away two points cried bax  ay ay sir answered the steersman  at that moment a violent gust snapped the topsailyard and the sail was instantly blown to ribbons the dashing of this spar about carried away the foretopmast and almost as a necessary consequence the jib with the jibboom went along with it  the schooner instantly became unmanageable and was driven bodily to leeward  seizing an axe bax with the prompt assistance of the crew and his friends soon cleared away the wreck and once more got the head of his vessel round towards the gull light the lanterns of which were seen faintly gleaming through the murky atmosphere  but it was too late the breakers of the northsandhead were already roaring under their lee and also right ahead of them  port port hard aport shouted bax  port it is replied the steersman with that calm professional singsong tone peculiar to seamen  at that instant the schooner struck the sand passed over the first line of breakers and rushed onwards to certain destruction  bring lucy on deck cried bax  mr burton ran below to obey but the words had scarce been spoken when guy foster entered the cabin and seizing the trembling girl in his arms bore her gently but swiftly to the deck  here the scene that met her gaze was truly awful  it seemed as if above and below there were but one wild chaos of waters over which brooded a sky of ebony  the schooner had by this time got into the hideous turmoil of shallow water the lurid whiteness of which gleamed in the dark like unearthly light  as yet the vessel was rushing fiercely through it the rudder had been carried away by the first shock and she could not be steered  just as lucy was placed by bax in a position of comparative shelter under the lee of the quarterrails the nancy struck a second time with fearful violence she remained hard and fast on the sands and the shock sent her foremast overboard  if the condition of the little vessel was terrible before its position now was beyond description awful  the mad seas unable to hurl her onward broke against her sides with indescribable fury and poured tons of water on the deck so that no one could remain on it  having foreseen this bax had prepared for it  he had warned all on board to keep close by the main shrouds and take to the mast when the schooner should strike  he himself bore lucy aloft in his strong arms as if she had been a little child and placed her on the main crosstrees  here she clung with a convulsive grasp to the maintopmast while guy secured her in her position with a rope  sitting down on the crosstrees and holding on to them by his legsa matter of no little difficulty as the vessel was rolling violently from side to side bax began to strip off his thick pilotcoat intending to cover the girl with it  but he was arrested by the boy tommy bogey  hold on he shouted into his commanders ear i fetched up this un i knowd yed want it for er  tommy had thoughtfully carried up one of baxs spare coats and now handed it to his master who assisted by mr burton wrapped it carefully round lucy and then descended the rigging to examine the state of the vessel  she heeled very much over to leeward but the form of the bank on which she lay fortunately prevented her being thrown altogether on her beamends  had this happened the crosstrees would have been buried in water and all must have perished  when bax reascended the mast bluenose put his mouth close to his ear and shouted  couldnt ye send up a rocket  hant got any replied bax  there had been a signalgun aboard but at the first shock it tore its fastenings out of the old planks and went crashing through the lee bulwarks into the sea  couldnt we get up a glim nohow pursued bluenose  ay couldnt that be done cried guy who clambered towards them in order to take part in the consultation for the shrieking of the storm rendered every voice inaudible at the distance of anything more than an inch or two from the ear  the matches were in the cabin and thats flooded now said bax  guy replied by taking a tin box from his pocket in which were a few matches  ha thatll do cried bax eagerly theres a can of turpentine just under the forehatch which cant have been damaged by water  ill go and fetch it  stay i will go  do you look after lucy and her father said guy and without waiting for a reply he slid down one of the backstays and gained the deck  to traverse this was an act involving great danger and difficulty  the waves broke over it with such force that guys arms were nearly torn out of their sockets while he held to the bulwarks  he attained his object however and in a short time returned to the crosstrees with the can bax had in the meantime cut off some of the drier portions of his clothing  these with a piece of untwisted rope were soaked in turpentine and converted hastily into a rude torch but it was long before a light could be got in such a storm  the matches were nearly exhausted before this was accomplished  only those who have been in similar circumstances can adequately appreciate the intense earnestness with which each match was struck the care with which it was guarded from the wind and the eager anxiety with which the result was watched also the sinking of heart that followed each effort as one by one they flared for an instant and went out  at last the saturated mass caught fire and instantly a rich flame of light flashed over the wild scene and clearly revealed to them the appalling circumstances in which they were placed  poor lucy shuddered and covering her eyes cast herself in prayer on him who is mighty to save  bax raised the burning mass high over his head and waved it in the black air  he even clambered to the top of the broken mast in order to let it be seen far and wide over the watery waste  the inflammable turpentine refused to be quenched by the raging storm and in a few seconds they had the comfort of seeing the bright flame of a rocket shoot up into the sky  at the same moment a flash in the distance showed that their signal had been observed by the lightship  the sound of the gun was not heard by those on the wreck but both it and the rocket were observed from the shore where many a hardy seaman and pilot knowing full well the dangers of such a night kept watch and ward in order to render prompt assistance to their fellowmen in distress  it would be a matter of some interest to ascertain how many of the inhabitants of this busy thicklypopulated isle are aware of the fact that during every storm that blows while they are slumbering perchance in security and comfort in their substantial dwellings there are hundreds ay thousands of hardy seamen all round our coasts standing patiently in such sheltered spots as they can find encased in oilskin and gazing anxiously out into the dark sea regardless of the pelting storm indifferent to the bitter cold intent only on rendering aid to their fellowmen and ready at a moments notice to place life and limb in the most imminent jeopardyfor what  can any one suppose that they do this for the sake of the silver medal or the ten or twenty shillings awarded to those who thus act by the lifeboat institution  do men in other circumstances hold their lives so cheap  assuredly there is a higher a nobler motive that prompts the heroes of our coast to their deeds of selfsacrifice and daring  to those who clung to the maintop of the nancy these signals were a bright gleam of hope with the exception of lucy whose spirit sank when she endeavoured in vain to penetrate the thick darkness that followed suspecting this bluenose who clung to the crosstrees beside the missionary and assisted him to shelter his daughter from the storm shouted in her ear to keep her mind easy for the people on shore would be sure to send off the lifeboat and there would be no danger if the mast held on  if the mast held on  ha little did lucy know how much anxiety filled the heart of bax in regard to the mast holding on  with much difficulty he had persuaded denham crumps and company about a year before the events we are now relating that the mainmast of the nancy was utterly useless and obtained their unwilling consent to have it renewed  but for this it would have shared the fate of the foremast and those who now clung to it would have been in eternity  but although the mast was strong its step and holdfasts bax knew were the reverse of sound and while he stood there cheering his companions with hopeful remarks he alone knew how frail was the foundation on which his hopes were founded  fortunately for lucy and her father they looked to a higher source of comfort than the young skipper of the nancy  they knew that it was no uncommon thing for men women and children to be saved on the coasts of britain as if by miracle and they felt themselves to be in the hands of him whom the winds and the sea obey  guy held on to the weathershrouds close to bax  speaking so as not to be heard by the others he said  is there much chance of a boat putting off to us  not much replied bax  a lugger could scarcely live in such a sea certainly it could not come near us in this shoal water  i doubt even if the lifeboat could come here  for two hours after this they remained silently in their exposed position their limbs stiffening with cold drenched continually with spray and occasionally overwhelmed by the crest of a monstrous wave sometimes a rocket from the lightship shot athwart the dark sky and at all times her lights gleamed like faint stars far away to windward when the sea broke around them in whiter sheets than usual they could see the head of the broken foremast drawn against it like a black line to leeward  everything else above and below was thick darkness  one of the seamen who had been for some time in bad health was the first to give way  without uttering a word he loosened his hold of the shrouds and fell backwards  guy saw him falling and making a desperate grasp at him caught him by the breast of his shirt but the garment gave way and next moment he was down in the boiling flood guy with an impulse that was natural to him was about to leap off to his rescue but bluenose caught him by the collar and held him forcibly back  in another moment the man was gone for ever  so silently did all this pass and so furious was the tumult of the storm that lucy and her father were not aware of what had occurred  our brave little friend tommy bogey was the next who failed  whether it was that witnessing the seamans death had too powerful an effect on his spirit or that the cold acted more severely on his young muscles than on those of his companions it is impossible to say but soon after the loss of the man the boy felt his strength giving way  turning with instinctive trust to his friend in this extremity he shouted  bax give us a hand  before his friend could do so his grasp relaxed and he fell back with a piercing shriek that rose above even the howling wind  almost an instant after he struck the water bax dived headforemost into it and came up with him in his arms  both man and boy went to leeward instantly  the former had counted on this  the fate of the seaman who had just perished had led him to reflect that a vigorous effort might have enabled him to gain the stump of the foremast which still stood as we have said to leeward of the mainmast  acting on this thought he had plunged without hesitation when the moment for action came although it did come unexpectedly  a faint shout soon told his horrorstricken companions that he had gained the point of safety  it wont do to leave em there cried bluenose starting up and clambering as far out on the crosstrees as he dared venture even if the mast holds on them seas would soon wash away the stoutest man living  oh save my preserver cried lucy who regardless of the storm had sprung wildly up and now stood clinging to a single rope while her garments were almost torn from her limbs by the fury of the hurricane  can nothing be done to save them cried the missionary as he kindly but firmly dragged his daughter back to her former position  nothin sir said one of the sailors  there aint a cask nor nothin to tie a rope to an heave to windardan its as like as not it wouldnt fetch em if there wos  theyd never see a rope if it wos veered to emmoreover it wouldnt float  hallo  master guy wot are ye up to  guy had hauled in the slack of one of the numerous ropes attached to the mainmast that were floating away to leeward and was fastening the end of it round his waist  bluenose and the missionary turned quickly on hearing the seamans shout but they were too late to prevent the bold youth from carrying out his design even if they had wished to do so  taking a vigorous spring to windward guy was in the sea in a moment in another instant he was lost to view in darkness  bluenose seized the end of the rope and awaited the result in breathless suspense presently a shout so faint that it seemed miles away was heard to leeward and the rope was jerked violently  now lads all hands ahoy cried bluenose in wild excitement  just give em time to haul in the slack and tie it round em and then pull with a will  the incident and the energy of the captain seemed to act like a spell on the men who had up to this time clung to the shrouds in a state of halfstupor  they clustered round bluenose and each gaining the best footing possible in the circumstances seized hold of the rope  again the rope was shaken violently and a heavy strain was felt on it the men pulled it in with difficulty hand over hand and in a short time bax guy and tommy were once more safe in their former position on the crosstrees  terrible indeed their danger when such a position could be spoken of as one of safety  another hour passed away  to those who were out on that fatal night the minutes seemed hoursthe hours days  still no succour came to them  the storm instead of abating seemed to be on the increase  had it not been for the peculiar form of the shoal on which they lay the old vessel must have been dashed to pieces in the first hour of that terrible gale  gradually bax ceased to raise his encouraging voiceindeed the whistling wind would have rendered it inaudibleand the party on the crosstrees clung to their frail spar almost in despair  as the gale increased so did the danger of their position  no chance of deliverance seemed left to them no prospect of escape from their dreadful fate the only ray of hope that came to them fitfully through the driving storm was the faint gleaming of the lightship that guards the goodwin sands    chapter six  heroes of the kentish coastthe lifeboatthe rescue  deal beach is peculiar in more respects than one  there are a variety of contradictory appearances about it which somewhat puzzle a visitor especially if he be accustomed to seacoast towns and villages in other parts of the country  for one thing all the boats seem hopelessly high and dry on the beach without the chance and apparently without any intention of ever being got off again  then there is at certain seasons of the year nothing whatever doing  great hardfisted fellows with nautical garments and bronzed faces are seen lounging about with their hands in their pockets and with a heavy slowness in their gait which seems to imply that they are elephantine creatures fit only to be looked at and wondered at as monuments of strength and laziness  if the day happens to be fine and calm when the stranger visits the beach he will probably be impressed with the idea that here is an accumulation of splendid seagoing materiel which has somehow got hopelessly stranded and become useless  of course in the height of summer there will be found bustle enough among the visitants to distract attention from the fact to which i allude but in spring before these migratory individuals arrive there is marvellously little doing on deal beach in fine weather  the pilots and boatmen lounge about apparently amusing themselves with pipes and telescopes they appear to have no object in life but to kill time they seem a set of idle hulking fellowsnevertheless i should say speaking roughly that at least the half of these men are heroes  the sturdy oak in fine weather bends only its topmost branches to the light wind and its leaves and twigs alone are troubled by the summer breeze but when the gale lays low the trees of the forest and whirls the leaves about like ocean spray then the oak is stirred to wild action tosses its gnarled limbs in the air and moves the very earth on which it stands  so the heroes on deal beach are sluggish and quiescent while the sun shines and the butterflies are abroad but let the storm burst upon the sea let the waves hiss and thunder on that steep pebbly shore let the breakers gleam on the horizon just over the fatal goodwin sands or let the night descend in horrid blackness and shroud beach and breakers alike from mortal view then the man of deal bestirs his powerful frame girds up his active loins and claps on his souwester launches his huge boat that seemed before so hopelessly high and dry hauls off through the raging breakers and speeds forth on his errand of mercy over the black and stormy sea with as much hearty satisfaction as if he were hasting to his bridal instead of as is too often the case to his doom  near the north end of deal beach not very far from the ruins of sandown castle there stood an upturned boat which served its owner as a hut or shelter whence he could sit and scan the sea  this hut or hovel was a roomy and snug enough place even in rough weather and although intended chiefly as a place of outlook it nevertheless had sundry conveniences which made it little short of a veritable habitation  among these were a small stove and a swinging oil lamp which when lighted filled the interior with a ruddy glow that quite warmed one to look at  a low door at one end of the hovel faced the sea and there was a small square hole or window beside it through which the end of a telescope generally protruded for the owners of the hovel spent most of their idle time in taking observations of the sea  there was a bench on either side of the hut which was lumbered with a confused mass of spars sails souwesters oilskin coats and trousers buoys seachests rudders tarbarrels and telescopes  this hovel belonged jointly to old jeph and captain bluenose  bax had shared it with them before he was appointed to the command of the nancy  in the olden time the owners of these nautical huts dwelt in them hence the name of hoveller which is used at the present day but with the progress of civilisation the hovellers have come to reside in cottages and only regard the hovels as their places of business hovellers as a class do little else than go off to ships in distress and to wrecks in which dangerous occupation they are successful in annually saving much property and many human lives  their livelihood from salvage as may be supposed is very precarious  sometimes they are flush of cash at other times reduced to a low enough ebb  in such circumstances it almost invariably follows that men are improvident  not many years ago the hovellers were notorious smugglers  many a bold deed and wild reckless venture was made on deal beach in days of old by these fellows in their efforts to supply the country with french lace and brandy and tobacco at a low price  most of the old houses in deal are full of mysterious cellars and invisible places of concealment in walls and beams and chimneys showing the extent to which contraband trade was carried on in the days of our fathers  rumour says that there is a considerable amount of business done in that way even in our own days but everybody knows what a storyteller rumour is  the only thing that gives any colour to the report is the fact that there is still a pretty strong coastguard force in that region and one may observe that whenever a boat comes to the beach a stout fellow in the costume of a manofwars man goes up to it and pries into all its holes and corners pulling about the ballastbags and examining the same in a cool matterofcourse manner that must be extremely irritating one would imagine to the owner of the boat  at night too if one chances to saunter along deal beach by moonlight he will be sure to meet ere long with a portly personage of enormous breadth enveloped in many and heavy garments with a brace of pistols sticking out of his breast pockets and a short cutlass by his side but whatever these sights and symptoms may imply there can be no question that smuggling now is not by any means what it was thirty or forty years ago  on the night of the storm described in the last chapter the only individual in old jephs hovel was old jeph himself  he was seated at the inner end of it on a low chest near the stove the light of which shone brightly on his thin old face and long white locks and threw a gigantic black shadow on the wall behind  the old man was busily engaged in forming a model boat out of a piece of wood with a clasp knife  he muttered to himself as he went on with his work occasionally pausing to glance towards the door the upper half of which was open and revealed the dark storm raging without  on one of these occasions old jephs eyes encountered those of a man gazing in upon him  is that you long orrick  come in its a cold night to stand out i the gale  he said this heartily and then resumed his work as if he had forgotten the presence of the other in an instant  it is not improbable that he had for jeph was very old  he could not have been far short of ninety years of age  long orrick entered the hovel and sat down on a bench opposite the old man  he was a very tall rawboned illfavoured fellow of great muscular strength and with a most forbidding countenance  he was clad in oiled roughweather garments  you seem busy old man said he abruptly  ay i had need be busy said old jeph without looking up there are many lives to save many lives bein lost this very night and no means of savin em leastwise not sufficient  humph yere eternally at that bit o humbug  its bam old man all bam bosh and gammon said orrick  itll never come to no good i tell ye  who knows replied the old man meekly but going on with his work not the less diligently because of these remarks  jeph said orrick leaning forward until his sharp features were within a few inches of his companions face jeph will ye tell me where the hide is in yer old house  no long orrick i wont replied the old man with an amount of energy of which he seemed a few seconds before quite incapable  the reply did not seem to please long orrick neither did the steady gaze with which it was accompanied  you wont said orrick between his set teeth  no replied the old man dropping his eyes on the little boat and resuming his work  why not continued the other after a pause you dont require the hide why wont you lend it to a chum as is hard up  because i wont encourage smugglin said jeph  youve smuggled enough in yer young days yerself you old villain you might help a friend a bit it wont be you as does it  its because i have smuggled wen i was young that i wont do it now that im old nor help anyone else to retorted jeph besides youre no friend o mine  what if i turn out to be an enemy cried orrick fiercely see here said he drawing out a long knife and holding it up so that the light of the stove glittered on its keen blade what if i give you a taste of this old man  you wont said jeph calmly  no why not  because youre a coward replied jeph with a quiet chuckle you know that you wouldnt like to be hanged ha ha and you know that bax would be down on you if you touched my old carcase  long orrick uttered a savage oath and said im brave enough anyhow to let you taste the cold steel tonightor desperate enough if ye prefer it  he seized jeph by the throat as he spoke and pressed the blade of the knife against his breast  the old man did not shrink neither did he struggle  he knew that he was in the hands of one whose type is but too common in this world a bully and a coward and knowing this felt that he was safe  it seemed however as if the very elements scorned the man who could thus raise his hand against unprotected age for the wind shrieked louder than usual in its fury and a blinding flash of lightning accompanied by a deep crash of thunder added to the horror of the scene  just then an exclamation was heard at the door of the hovel  long orrick released his hold hastily and turning round observed a round ruddy visage scowling at him and the glittering barrel of a pistol levelled at his head  ha ha he laughed hoarsely endeavouring to pass it off as a jest so youve caught us jokin colemanactin a bitand took it for arnest eh  well if it is actin its oncommon ugly actin i tell ye a deal too natral for my tastes so id advise ye to drop it here an carry yer talents to a theaytre where youll be paid according to your desarts long orrick  ah the night air dont agree with ye coleman so ill bid ye goodbye said the other rising and quitting the hut  wots he bin a doin of old man inquired coleman who was a huge ruddy goodhumoured coastguardsman with the aspect of a lion and the heart of a lamb whose garments were of the roughest and largest kind and who was to adopt a timehonoured phrase armed to the teeththat is to say provided with a brace of pistols a cutlass and a portfire which last could on being struck against a rock burst into flame and illuminate the region for many yards around him  oh hes bin actin replied the old man with a quiet chuckle as he resumed his work on the boat hes bin actin thats all  at this moment the boom of a gun fired by the gull lightship broke on the ears of the men of deal and a moment later the bright flash of a rocket was seen  it was the wellknown signal that there was a ship in distress on the sands  instantly the hardy boatmen were at work  one of their largest boats was launched through the wild surf as if by magic and its stout crew were straining at the oars as if their lives depended on the result  the boat happened to be the one belonging to captain bluenose and his comrades and the first man who leaped into her as she was driven down into the sea was long orrick for bad man though he was he was not without his redeeming points and coward though he was before the face of man he was brave enough in facing the dangers of the sea  it was a fearful struggle in which the deal lugger engaged that night the sea threatened to bury her altogether as she pushed off through the breakers and some of the men seemed to think it would be too much for them  a man named davis took the helm he had saved many a life on that coast in his day  the intense darkness of the night coupled with the fury of the winds and waves were such that no men save those who were used to such scenes would have believed it possible that any boat could live in so wild a storm  in addition to this the cold was excessive and the spray broke over them so continuously that the pump had to be kept going in order to prevent their getting filled altogether  it was a long weary pull to the gull lightship  when they reached it they hailed those on board and asked where away the wreck was  right down to leeward on the sandhead was the reply  away went the lugger before the gale with just a corner of the foresail hoisted  it was not long before they came in sight of the breakers on the sands  here they were obliged to put out the oars and exercise the utmost caution lest they should incur the fate from which they had come out to rescue others  davis knew the shoals and channels well and dropped down as far as he dared but no wreck of any kind was to be seen  dye see anything shouted davis to long orrick who was in the bow  orricks reply was inaudible for the shrieking of the gale and the roar of breakers drowned his voice  at that moment a huge wave broke at a considerable distance ahead of them and against its white crest something like the mast of a vessel was discerned for an instant  god help them muttered davis to himself if theyre as far as that on the sands theres no chance for them unless indeed the broadstairs or ramsgate lifeboat finds em out  let go the anchors he shouted look sharp lads  the anchor was let go and the lugger was veered down by its cable as far in the direction of the wreck as possible but the boat was so large and drew so much water that they could not even get within sight of the wreck  in these circumstances the men nestled as they best might under the lee of the boats sides and prepared to ride out the storm or at least to remain at anchor there until daylight should enable them to act with more precision and safety  fortunately for all parties concerned other eyes and ears had been on the watch that night  at broadstairs which lies a little to the north of deal the crew of the lifeboat had been on the lookout and no sooner did they see the rocket and hear the gun than they launched their boat and put off to the rescue  it is generally found that there are more men to man the lifeboats on many parts of our coasts than are required and this is specially the case on the kentish coast  hence when the signalrocket goes up on a stormy night many eager eyes are on the watch and there is a rush to the boat in order to secure a place  on this occasion there were one or two men who rather than wait to pull on their oilskin coats and pantaloons had run down just as they happened to be clothed at the time and in a very unfit state to face the inclemency of a night which might involve hours of unremitting and exhaustive labour  these jumped into their places however and their less fortunate comrades who arrived too late supplied them with garments  in five minutes the lifeboat was flying under sail towards the goodwin sands  seldom had the broadstairs boat faced so wild a storm as that which blew on this occasion  the sea broke over her in cataracts  again and again she was more than halffilled with water but this was speedily got rid of and in the course of an hour she was beside the lugger  where away shouted the coxswain of the lifeboat as they passed  right ahead not two cables lengths roared davis  the sails of the lifeboat had already been lowered and the oars were out in a second  gradually and slowly they dropped down towards the breakers and soon caught sight of the mast of the nancy still towering up in the midst of the angry waters  the danger to the lifeboat was now very great for there was such a wild chopping sea on the sands that it ran great risk of being upset  the boat was one of the oldfashioned stamp which although incapable of being sunk was not secure against being overturned and it did not possess that power of righting itself which characterises the lifeboats of the present day  in a few minutes they were near enough to see the mast of the nancy dimly in the dark  the coxswain immediately gave the order to let go the anchor and veer down towards the wreck  just as he did so a terrific sea came rolling towards them like a black mountain  look out men he shouted  every man let go his oar and throwing himself on the thwart embraced it with all his might  the wave went right over them sweeping the boat from stem to stern but as it had met the sea sternon it was not overturned  it was completely filled however and some time was necessarily lost in freeing it of water  the oars being attached to the sides of the boat by lanyards were not carried away  in a few minutes they had veered down under the lee of the wreck  the crew and passengers of the nancy were still clinging to the crosstrees benumbed and almost unable to speak or move when the lifeboat approached  with the exception of bax and bluenose they were all so thoroughly exhausted as to have become comparatively indifferent to and therefore ignorant of all that was going on around them  all their energies were required to enable them simply to retain their position on the rigging  at first the sight of the rockets from the lightship and her lanterns gleaming in the far distance had aroused feelings of hope but as hour after hour passed away the most of the unhappy people fell into a sort of stupor or indifference and the lights were no longer regarded with hopeful looks  when the lugger came towards them and anchored outside the sands it was so dark that none but sharp eyes could make her out through the blinding spray  bax and bluenose descried her but both of them were so well aware of the impossibility of a large boat venturing among the shoals and breakers that they tacitly resolved not to acquaint their comrades with its presence lest they should raise false hopes which when disappointed might plunge them into still deeper despair  very different however were the feelings with which they beheld the approach of the lifeboat which the practised eye of bax discerned long before she came alongside  the lifeboat said bax sharply in the ear of bluenose who was close beside him  look am i right  so tis i do believe cried the captain staring intently in the direction indicated by his friends outstretched hand  lifeboat ahoy shouted bax in a voice that rang loud and strong above the whistling winds like the blast of a brazen trumpet  wreck ahoy cried the coxswain of the boat and the cry borne towards them by the gale fell upon the ears of those on the mast like the voice of hope shouting victory over the demon despair  cheer up lucy  ho comrades look alive here comes the lifeboat  bax accompanied these words with active preparations for heaving a rope and otherwise facilitating their anticipated escape  guy was the first to respond to the cry  having placed himself in a very exposed position in order that his person might shelter lucy burton he had been benumbed more thoroughly than his comrades but his blood was young and it only wanted the call to action to restore him to the full use of his powers and faculties  not so with the missionary  he had become almost insensible and but for the effort to protect his child which animated and sustained him must certainly have fallen into the sea  some of the men too were utterly helpless  their stiffened hands indeed maintained a deathlike gripe of the ropes but otherwise they were quite incapable of helping themselves  as for lucy she had been so well cared for and protected from the bitter fury of the wind that although much exhausted terrified and shaken she was neither so benumbed nor so helpless as some of her less fortunate companions  presently the lifeboat was close on the lee side of the mast and a cheer burst from her crew when they saw the number of survivors on the crosstrees  look out cried the man in the bow of the boat as he swung a heavilyloaded stick round his head and flung it over the mast  the light line attached to this was caught by bax and by means of it a stout rope was drawn from the boat to the mast of the nancy and made fast  and now came the most dangerous and difficult part of the service besides the danger of the mast being broken by the violence of the increasing storm and hurled upon the lifeboat an event which would have insured its destruction there was the risk of the boat herself being stove against the mast by the lashing waves which spun her on their white crests or engulfed her in their black hollows as if she had been a cork  the greatest care was therefore requisite in approaching the wreck and when this was accomplished there still remained the difficulty of getting the exhausted crew into the boat  had they all been young and strong like bax or guy they could have slid down the rope at the risk of nothing worse than a few bruises but with several of them this method of escape was impossiblewith lucy and her father it was in any circumstances out of the question  a block and tackle was therefore quickly rigged up by bluenose by which they were lowered  poor lucy had not the courage to make the attempt until one or two of the seamen had preceded her it seemed so appalling to be swung off the mast into the black raging chaos beneath her feet where the lifeboat shrouded partially in darkness and covered with driving spray appeared to her more like a phantom than a reality  come miss lucy said bax tenderly ill fasten the rope round myself and be swung down with you in my arms  lucy would not hear of this  no said she firmly i will conquer my silly fears here put the rope round me  at that moment a wave tossed the boat so high that it came up almost to the level of the masthead and an involuntary cry rose from some of the men who thought she must infallibly be dashed against it and upset one of the men on the mast seeing the boat at his very feet made a sudden spring towards it but it plunged into the hollow of the passing wave and missing his grasp he fell with a wild shriek into the water he was swept away instantly  this so unnerved lucy that she almost fainted in her fathers arms  come cried bax putting the end of the rope round his waist we must not trifle thus  the rope wont bear ye both said bluenose  youre too heavy lad  true interrupted guy let me do it  im light and strong enough  bax at once admitting the force of the argument undid the rope without hesitation and fastened it quickly round guys waist  the latter seized lucy in his arms and in a moment they were both swinging in the air over the wild sea  every incident in this thrilling scene now passed with the speed almost of thought  the boat rose under them  bax at once let the rope run down they went but a swirl in the treacherous waves swept the boat two or three fathoms to leeward  instantly they were both in the sea but guy did not loosen his hold or lose his presence of mind for a moment bax hauled on the rope and raised him half out of the water for a few seconds the boat made a wild sheer towards them and the missionary uttered a cry of agony as he fancied his child was about to be run down perhaps killed before his eyes but the cry was transformed into a shout of joy and thanksgiving when he saw one of the lifeboats crew seize guy by the hair and another catch his daughter by a portion of her dress  they were quickly pulled into the boat  to save the remainder was now a matter of less difficulty  the missionary was the only one left on the mast who was not able more or less to take care of himself but the joy consequent on seeing his daughter saved infused new vigour into his frame  he and the others were finally got offbax being the last to quit the wreckand then the lifeboat pulled away from the dangerous shoals and made for the land  finding it impossible to reach broadstairs owing to the direction of the gale they pulled in an oblique direction and after narrowly escaping an upset more than once gained deal beach not far from sandown castle where the boat was run ashore  here there was a large concourse of boatmen and others awaiting them the men in the luggerseeing the lifeboat come up and feeling that the storm was almost too much for them and that their services were not now requiredhad returned to the shore and spread the news  the instant the lifeboat touched the shingle a huge block and tackle were hooked on to her the capstan connected with these was already manned and the boat was run up high and dry with the crew in her  the cheers and congratulations that followed were checked however when the discovery was made that guy foster was lying in a state of insensibility  when the boat sheered towards him and lucy as already described he had seen the danger and warded it away from the girl by turning his own person towards it  no one knew that he had been hurt  indeed he himself had scarcely felt the blow but a deep cut had been made in his head which bled so copiously that he had lain down and gradually became insensible  his head was bandaged by bluenose in a rough and ready fashion a couple of oars with a sail rolled round them were quickly procured and on this he was borne off the beach followed by his friends and a crowd of sympathisers  where to inquired one of the men who supported the litter  to sandhill cottage said bax its his mothers house and about as near as any other place  step out lads  before they were off the beach the dull report of a cannonshot was heard  it came from the lightship and immediately after a rocket flew up indicating by the direction in which it sloped that another vessel was in distress on the shoals  all thought of those who had just been rescued was forgotten by the crew of the lifeboat  those of them who had not been too much exhausted by previous toil and exposure leaped into their seats  the places of those who were unable to go off again were instantly filled by eager boatmen dozens of stout arms thrust hercrew and all seated as they weredown into the lashing surf  there was a short sharp struggle between the sturdy men and the heavy rollers which threatened not only to swamp the boat but to hurl her back stem over stern upon the shingle and in a few minutes more she was forcing her way through wind and waves and spray on this her second errand of mercy that night to the goodwin sands    chapter seven  the widows cottage  about a thousand ships are wrecked and nearly a thousand lives are lost on the shores of this country every year was still the burden of mrs fosters dreams when she was aroused by a loud knocking at the door of her cottage and the sound of confused voices and trampling of many feet outside  ho goodness gracious me maam cried worthy mrs laker bursting into her mistresss apartmentif here aint a thousand robbers as is come for to pillidge the ouse an trample down the garding  its from the hattic winder i see em with the moon if want the lightenin a glanshin on their orrid faces as is never shaved nor washed and its bin my dream from the years of unsuspectious hinfancy as is come for to pass now in the days of my womanhood with dead bodies carryin too wich is wuss  ho dear wot shall i do  go and put on your clothes while i open the door said amy russell entering hastily at the moment in a state of comparative dishabille with a shawl thrown round her  dear mamma dont be alarmed it must be a mistake  they cannot mean us any harm i am certain  may i go and open the door  open the door shrieked mrs laker in the tone of one almost paralysed by astonishment open the door to a thousand robbers with swords and guns and blood and dead bodies  as mrs laker was robed in her nightgown and stood erect with her arms extended and her hair dishevelled she looked dreadfully tragic and awful while these fearful words flowed from her pale lips  hush laker said mrs foster hastily throwing on her garments with trembling hands while she made a strong effort to restrain her agitation go dear amy and ask what they want but dont open the door  she followed amy to the landing outside leaving mrs laker glaring in sceptical amazement in the middle of the room  presently amy was heard downstairs speaking through the keyhole  a mans voice replied there was a suppressed scream and immediately the outer door was unlocked the chain removed and the bolts withdrawn  this was followed by the heavy tramp of men in the passage below and a wild shriek from mrs foster  mrs laker still standing with uplifted arms in the middle of the bedroom and livid with terror glared round in search of a place of refuge and gasped horribly  her eye fell on the bed from which her mistress had issued  with a spring that would have done her credit in the days of her girlhood she plunged into it head first and rolled herself tight up in the clothes where she lay quaking and listening intently  its only a cut on the head and a little blood maam dont be alarmed said the gruff voice of bluenose as the footsteps ascended the stair and approached the bedroom  cut and blood were the only words in this speech which made any impression on poor mrs laker who trembled so violently that the curtains around her shook again  lay him in my bed said mrs foster in an agitated voice  wy the beds all aliveo exclaimed bluenose in surprise  o laker what are you doing there get out quick  mercy good men mercy i  the sentence was cut short by a wild yell as her eye fell on the pale and bloody face of guy  she tumbled clothes and all over the side of the bed in a dead faint and rolled in a confused white heap to the very feet of her astounded brother captain bluenose  well if this dont beat trafalgar all to sticks exclaimed the captain  come attend to guy said bax in a deep commanding voice  he lifted up mrs laker and the bedclothes as if she had been a large washing and carried her down to her own apartmentguided by tommy bogey who knew the waywhere he placed her in bed and left her to recover as she best might  bax had taken the precaution to despatch a messenger for a doctor before they left the beach so that guys hurt was soon examined dressed and pronounced to be a mere trifle which rest would heal in a few days indeed guy recovered consciousness soon after being brought into the cottage and told his mother with his own lips that he was quite well this and the doctors assurances so relieved the good lady that she at once transferred much of her anxious care to the others who had been wrecked along with her son  lucy was placed in the hands of the sympathetic amy russell and conducted by her to her own room where she obtained dry clothing  as for the others they dried themselves by the kitchen fire which was stirred up vigorously by the now restored and repentant laker who also busied herself in spreading a repast for the shipwrecked men  mrs foster did the same for a select few whom she meant to entertain in the parlour  who is that handsome sailor said amy as she assisted lucy burton to dress the one i mean who came up with guy  there were four who came up with guy replied lucy smiling  true said amy blushing she blushed easily but i mean the very tall dark man with the black curling hair  ah you mean the man who carried good mrs laker downstairs in a bundle said lucy with a merry laugh  yes cried amy echoing the laugh who is he  why you ought to know him said lucy with a look of surprise he resides near you at least he was one of the boatmen of your own coast before he became captain of the nancy  his name is bax  bax echoed amy  is he bax  oh i know bax well by name  he is a friend of guy and a celebrated man on this coast  he is sometimes called the stormy petrel because he is always sure to be found on the beach in the wildest gales sometimes he is called the life preserver on account of the many lives he has saved  strange said amy musingly that i should have pictured him to myself so like what he turns out to be  he is my beauideal of a hero  he is a hero said lucy with such sudden enthusiasm that her new friend looked up in her face in surprise  you do not know continued lucy in some confusion that he saved my life not much more than twentyfour hours ago  amy expressed deep interest in this matter and begged to hear all about it  lucy nothing loath related the event circumstantially and amy gazing earnestly in her beautiful animated countenance sighed and regarded her with an expression of sad interestalso with feelings which she herself could not understand  but how comes it that you have never seen bax till tonight inquired lucy when she had finished her narrative  because i have not been very long here said amy and bax had ceased to dwell regularly on the coast about the time i was saved and came to live with mrs foster  savedmrs foster exclaimed lucy  yes mrs foster is not my mother  and guy is not your brother said lucy with a glance so quick and earnest that amy felt a little confused  no he is not said she but he saved my life at the end of ramsgate pier and ever since then i have lived with his mother  it was now lucys turn to express deep interest  she begged to have the circumstances related to her and amy nothing loath told her how guy had plunged into the sea when no one else observed her danger and caught her just as she was sinking  as amy told her story with animation and spoke of guy with sparkling eyes and a rich glow on her fair cheek lucy gazed at her with grave interest and felt sensations in her breast which were quite new to her and altogether incomprehensible  three times had mrs laker been sent to knock at amys door and inform the young ladies that supper awaited them before they completed their toilet and descended to the drawingroom  laker called it supper because she could not conscientiously give the name of breakfast to a meal extemporised about four oclock in the morning  mr burton and bluenose were already seated at the table  bax stood near the fireplace bending down to mrs foster who was looking up in his face shaking his hand and thanking him with tears in her eyes for having saved her sons life  bax was much perplexed by this view of the matter taken and obstinately held to by the widow  really maam said he with a deprecatory smile you are mistaken i assure you  i did not save guys lifeon the contrary he saved mine this night for if he had not jumped well to windard with the line and caught hold of the old foremast where tommy and i were perched like two birds  ha interrupted bluenose bluntly youd boths bin in davy jones locker by this time for i seed the old stick myself not three minits arter go by the board like the stem of a baccy pipe  it was just as bluenose concluded this speech that the young ladies entered the room  come cried bax turning quickly towards lucy who advanced first here is another witness to the fact  do try miss burton to convince mrs foster that i did not  bax paused for his glance fell at that moment on amy russell whom he had not observed in the confusion of their first appearance in the cottage  my adopted daughter said mrs foster taking amy by the hand and leading her forward shake hands with mr bax darling who has saved guys life tonight  bax held amys white little hand for one moment as tenderly as if he were afraid his own iron muscles might injure it  i see said he with a smile that i must submit to be misrepresented until guy himself comes to defend me  amy glanced at lucy and blushed  lucy glanced at amy and looked confused then the whole party laughed and bluenose said that for his part he didnt see no savin o life one way or other xcepting as regarded the lifeboat which he wos bound for to say had saved the whole lot of em and that was all about it whereupon they all sat down to supper and the missionary asked a blessing thanking god for their recent deliverance and praying in a few earnest words for continued favour  bluenose was a man of peculiar and decided character  he did not at all relish his position in the drawingroom when he thought of his sister mrs laker supping in the kitchen  being an impulsive man he seized his cap and said abruptly to his hostess  ill tell ee wot it is marm i aint used to this ere sort o thing if youll excudge me marm ill go an ave my snack with bess i the kitchen  bax there hes a sort o genleman by natur as well as hedication but as for me im free to say as i prefers the fogsl to the cabinno offence meant  come along tommy and bring yer pannikin along with ee lad youre like a fish out o water too  so saying captain bluenose bowed to the company with what he meant to be an affable and apologetic air and quitted the room without waiting for a reply  ah bluenose said mrs laker as her brother entered cap in hand and seated himself among the men of the nancy who were doing full justice to mrs fosters hospitality i thought ye wouldnt be long in the parlour for you aint bin used to igh life an wy should you as was born of poor but respectible parients not but that the parients of the rich may be respectible also i dont go for to impinge no one sit down tommy my dear child only think ees bin alf drownded an is mother dead only two year next whitsuntide sit down tommy wotll ye ave  tommy said he would have a bit of beefsteak piegot it and set to work immediately  it may be as well to state here that mrs laker was not a married woman but having reached a certain age she deemed it advisable in order to maintain the dignity of her character and personal appearance which latter was stout and matronly to dub herself mrslaker being her maiden name  this statement involves a further explanation inasmuch as it establishes the fact that bluenose ought in simple justice and propriety to have gone by the name of laker also  but on the beach of deal justice and propriety in regard to names are not necessarily held in great repute  at least they were not so a few years ago  smuggling as has been said was rather prevalent in days gone by  indeed the man who was not a smuggler was an exception to the rule if such a man ever existed  during their night expeditions boatmen were often under the necessity of addressing each other in hoarse whispers at times and in circumstances when coastguard ears were uncommonly acute  hence in order to prevent inconvenient recognition the men were wont to give each other nicknames which nicknames descended frequently to their offspring  the father of captain bluenose and of mrs laker had been a notorious scamp about the beginning of this century at which period deal may be said to have been in full swing in regard to smuggling and the french war  the old smuggler was uncommonly well acquainted with the towns of calais gravelines dunkerque nieuport and ostendenotwithstanding that they lay in the enemys country  he had also enough of bad french to enable him to carry on his business and was addicted to french brandy  it was the latter circumstance which turned his nose purple procuring for him as well as entailing on his son the name of bluenose a name which our captain certainly did not deserve seeing that his nose was fiery red in colourperhaps a little too fat to be styled classic but on the whole a most respectable nose  few of the boatmen of deal went by their right names but such soubriquets as doey jack onion skyslyard dick mackerel trappy rodney nick sugarplum etcetera were common enough  perchance they are not obsolete at the present day  while the crew of the nancy were making merry in the kitchen the parlour bell rang violently and laker disappeared from the scene  youre wanted tommy darling said the worthy woman returning promptly  tommy rose and was ushered into the parlour  little boy said mrs foster my son guy has sent a message requiring your attendance  i tried to prevent him seeing you but he insists on it  come i will take you to his room  you must try child and not encourage him to talk  it will be bad for him i fear  leave us mother dear said guy as they entered i wish to be alone with tommy only for ten minutesnot longer  mrs foster tried to remonstrate but an impatient gesture from her son induced her to quit the room  you can write tommy  yes sir  ii hope you aint much hurt sir  oh noa mere scratch  its only the loss of blood that weakens me ill be all right in a few days  now sit down at that table and take a pen  are you ready  tommy said that he was and guy foster dictated the following note to mr denham of the house of denham crumps and company  deal  dear uncleim sorry to have to inform you that the nancy has become a total wreck on the goodwin sands  the cargo has been entirely lostalso two of the hands  i am at present disabled from the effects of a blow on the head received during the storm  no doubt bax will be up immediately to give you particulars  the cause of the loss of your schooner was in my opinion unseaworthiness of vessel and stores  your affectionate nephew guy foster  hallo thought tommy thats a stinger  there said guy as he attached his signature fold and address that and be off with it as fast as you can to the post  tommy vanished in an instant and was quickly at the postoffice which stood at that time near the centre of the town  he dropped the letter in and having thus fulfilled his mission relapsed into that easy swagger or roll that seems to be the natural and characteristic gait of jack when ashore  he had not proceeded far when the sound of voices in dispute attracted his ear  the gale was still at its height and the noise occasioned by its whistling among the chimneys and whirling round street corners was so great that the words uttered by the speakers were not distinguishable  still there was some peculiarity in the tone which irresistibly attracted the boy  perhaps tommy was unusually curious that night perhaps he was smitten like haroun alraschid with a desire for adventure but whatever was the truth in regard to this it is certain that instead of passing on as most people would naturally have done tommy approached the place whence the sounds proceeded with cautious stepskeeping as much in the shade of the houses as possible although owing to the darkness of the night this latter precaution was unnecessary    chapter eight  the living left among the deada wild chase on a wild night stopped by a ghost  on turning the corner of one of those houses on the beach of deal which stand so close to the sea that in many cases they occupy common ground with the boats tommy found himself suddenly close to a group of men one of whom a very tall man was addressing the others in an excited tone  ill tell ee wot it is lads lets put im in a sack an leave him in the great chapel field to cool hisself  the great chapel field was the name formerly applied by the boatmen to saint georges churchyard  sarve him right the beggar said another man with a low laugh hes spoilt our game many a night  what say boys heave im shoulder high  the proposal was unanimously agreed to and the party went towards an object which lay recumbent on the ground near to one of those large capstans which are used on this part of the kentish coast to haul up the boats  the object turned out to be a man bound hand and foot and with a handkerchief tied round the mouth to insure silence  tommy was so near that he had no difficulty in recognising in this unfortunate the person of old coleman the member of the coastguard who had been most successful in thwarting the plans of the smugglers for some years past rendered somewhat desperate by his prying disposition they had seized him on this particular night during a scuffle and were now about to dispose of him in a timehonoured way  tommy also discovered that the coastguardmans captors were long orrick rodney nick and a few more of his boatmen acquaintances  he watched them with much interest as they enveloped colemans burly figure in a huge sack tied it over his head and raising him on their shoulders bore him away  tommy followed at a safe distance but he soon stopped observing that two of the party had fallen behind the rest engaged apparently in earnest conversation  they stood still a few minutes under the lee of a lowroofed cottage  tommy crept as close to them as possible and listened  come rodney nick said one of the two whose height proclaimed him to be long orrick a feller cant talk in the teeth o sich a gale as this  lets stand in the lee o this old place here and ill tell ye in two minits wot i wants to do  you see that old sinner jeph refuses pintblank to let me use his hide hes become such a hypocrite that he says he wont encourage smugglin  well wot then inquired rodney nick  wy i means to make im give in returned long orrick  an spose he wont give in suggested rodney  then ill cut his throat replied orrick fiercely  then ill have nothin to do with it  stop cried the other seizing his comrade by the arm as he was turning to go away  a feller might as well try to joke with a jackass as with you  in coorse i dont mean that but ill threaten the old hypocrite and terrify him till hes half dead and then hell give in  hes a frail old man said rodney suppose he should die with fright  then let him die retorted long orrick  humph and spose he cant be terrified  oh get along with yer sposin  will ye go or will ye not thats the question as shuksperes ghost said to the hemperer o sweden  just you an me inquired rodney  aint we enough for an old man  more nor enough replied rodney with a touch of sarcasm in his tone if the old boy hant got friends with him  dont ye think bax might have took a fancy to spend the night there  no said long orrick bax is at supper in sandhill cottage and he aint the man to leave good quarters in a hurry  but if yer afraid well go with our chums to the churchyard and take them along with us  rodney nick laughed contemptuously but made no reply and the two immediately set off at a run to overtake their comrades  tommy bogey followed as close at their heels as he prudently could  they reached the walls of saint georges church or the great chapel almost at the same moment with the rest of the party  the form of the old church could be dimly seen against the tempestuous sky as the smugglers halted under the lee of the churchyard wall like a band of black ghosts that had come to lay one of their defunct comrades on a congenial night  at the north end of the buryingground of saint georges church there is a spot of ground which is pointed out to visitors as being the last restingplace of hundreds of the unfortunate men who fell in the seafights of our last war with france  a deep and broad trench was dug right across the churchyard and here the gallant tars were laid in ghastly rows as close together as they could be packed  near to this spot stands the tomb of one of lord nelsons young officers and beside it grows a tree against which nelson is said to have leaned when he attended the funeral  it was just a few yards distant from this tree that the smugglers scaled the wall and lifted over the helpless body of poor coleman  they did it expeditiously and in dead silence  carrying him into the centre of the yard they deposited the luckless coastguardman flat on his back beside the tomb of george philpot a man who had done good service in his day and generationif headstones are to be believed  the inscription which may still be seen by the curious runs thus                             a tribute to the                      skill and determined courage                         of the boatmen of deal                            and in memory of                             george philpot                        who died march 22 1850                         full many lives he saved                        with his undaunted crew                     he put his trust in providence                       and cared not how it blew  in the companionship of such noble dead the smugglers left coleman to his fate and set off to finish their nights work at old jephs humble cottage  tommy bogey heard them chuckle as they passed the spot where he lay concealed behind a tombstone and he was sorely tempted to spring up with an unearthly yell well knowing that the superstitious boatmen would take him for one risen from the dead and fly in abject terror from the spot but recollecting the importance of discretion in the work which now devolved on him he prudently restrained himself  the instant they were over the wall tommy was at colemans side  he felt the poor man shudder and heard him gasp as he cut the rope that tied the mouth of the sack for coleman knew well the spot to which they had conveyed him and his face when it became visible was ghastly white and covered with a cold sweat caused by the belief that he was being opened out for examination by some inquisitive but unearthly visitor  its only me said tommy with an involuntary laugh  hold on ill set you free in no time  hah coughed coleman when the kerchief was removed from his mouth wot a orrible sensation it is to be choked alive  it would be worse to be choked dead said tommy  cut the lines at my feet first lad said coleman theyve amost sawed through my ankle bones  there thats it now help me to git up an shake myself  a few minutes elapsed before he recovered the full use of his benumbed limbs  during this period the boy related all he had heard and urged his companion to look alive  but coleman required no urging  the moment he became aware of what was going on he felt for his cutlass which the smugglers had not taken the trouble to remove and slapping tommy on the back stumbled among the tombs and over the graves towards the wall which he vaulted with a degree of activity that might have rendered a young man envious  tommy followed like a squirrel and in a very few minutes more they were close at the heels of long orrick and his friends  while they hurried on in silence and with cautious tread coleman matured his plans  it was absolutely necessary that the utmost circumspection should be used for a man and a boy could not hope to succeed in capturing six strong men  run tommy to the beach and fetch a friend or two  there are sure to be two of the guard within hail  tommy was off as he himself would have said like a shot and on gaining the beach almost ran into the arms of a young coastguardman named supple rodger to whom he breathlessly told his tale  stop ill call out the guard said rodger drawing a pistol from the breastpocket of his overcoat  but tommy prevented him explained that it was very desirable to catch the villains in the very act of breaking into old jephs cottage and hurried him away  at the back of the cottage they found coleman calmly observing the proceedings of the smugglers one of whom was calling in a hoarse whisper through the keyhole  apparently he received no reply for he swore angrily a good deal and said to his comrades more than once i do blieve the old sinners dead  come ill burst in the door said the voice of long orrick savagely  the words were followed by a crash and the trampling of feet in the passage proved that the slender fastenings of the door had given way  now lads cried coleman have at em  he struck a species of portfire or bluelight against the wall as he spoke it sprang into a bright flame and the three friends rushed into the cottage  the smugglers did not wait to receive them  bursting the fastenings of the front window long orrick leaped out into the street  supple rodger dashed aside the man who was about to follow and leaped after him like an avenging spirit  all the men but two were over the window before coleman gained it  he seized the man who was in the act of leaping by the collar but the treacherous garment gave way and in a moment the smuggler was gone leaving only a rag in colemans grasp  meanwhile tommy flung himself down in front of the only man who now remained as he made a dash for the window  the result was that the man tumbled over the boy and fell to the ground  having accomplished this feat tommy leaped up and sprang through the window to aid in the chase as the smuggler rose the disappointed coleman turned round flourished the rag in the air with a shout of defiance and hit his opponent between the eyes with such force as to lay him a second time flat on the floor  a fierce struggle now ensued during which the light was extinguished  the alarmed neighbours found them there a few minutes later writhing in each others arms and punching each others heads desperately coleman however being uppermost  when tommy bogey leaped over the window as has been described all the smugglers had disappeared and he was at a loss what to do but the faint sound of quick steps at the north end of the street led him to run at the top of his speed in that direction  tommy was singularly fleet of foot  he ran so fast on this occasion that he reached the end of the street before the fugitive had turned into the next one  he saw distinctly that two men were running before him and concluding that they were long orrick and supple rodger he did his best to keep them in view  long orrick and his pursuer were well matched as to speed  both were good runners but the former was much the stronger man  counting on this he headed for the wild expanse of waste ground lying to the north of deal already mentioned as the sand hills  here he knew that there would be no one to interfere between him and his antagonist  tommy bogey thought of this too as he sped along and wondered not a little at the temerity of supple rodger in thus as it were placing himself in the power of his enemy  he chuckled however as he ran at the thought of being there to render him assistance to the best of his power  ha thought he for long orrick to wollop supple rodger out on the sandhills is one thing but for long orrick to wallop supple rodger with me dancin round him like a big wasp is quite another thing  tommy came as he thought thus upon an open space of ground on which were strewn spare anchors and chain cables  tumbling over a fluke of one of the former he fell to the earth with a shock that wellnigh drove all the wind out of his stout little body  he was up in a moment however and off again  soon the three were coursing over the downs like hares  it was difficult running for the ground was undulating and broken besides being covered in a few places with gorse and the wind and rain beat so fiercely on their faces as almost to blind them  about a mile or so beyond the ruins of sandown castle there is an old inn called the checkers of the hope or the checkers named after it is said and corrupted from chaucers inn at canterbury  it stands in the midst of the solitary waste a sort of halfway house between the towns of sandwich and deal far removed from either however and quite beyond earshot of any human dwelling  this so says report was a celebrated resort of smugglers in days gone by and of men of the worst character and as one looks at the irregular old building standing one might almost say unreasonably in that wild place one cannot help feeling that it must have been the scene of many a savage revelry and many a deed of darkness in what are sometimes styled the good old times  some distance beyond this farther into the midst of the sandhills there is a solitary tombstone well known both by tradition and by the inscription upon it as mary baxs tomb  here long orrick resolved to make a stand knowing that no shout that rodger might give vent to could reach the checkers in the teeth of such a gale  the tale connected with poor mary bax is brief and very sad  she lived about the end of the last century and was a young and beautiful girl having occasion to visit deal she set out one evening on her solitary walk across the bleak sandhills  here she was met by a brutal foreign seaman a lascar who had deserted from one of the ships then lying in the downs  this monster murdered the poor girl and threw her body into a ditch that lies close to the spot on which her tomb now stands  the deed as may well be supposed created great excitement in deal and the neighbourhood for mary bax being young beautiful and innocent was well known and much loved  there was at the time this murder was perpetrated a youth named john winter who was a devoted admirer of poor mary  he was much younger than she being only seventeen while she was twentythree  he became almost mad when he heard of the murder  a little brother of john winter named david happened to be going to the checkers inn at the time the murder was committed and witnessed it  he ran instantly to his brother to tell him what he had seen  it was chiefly through the exertions of these two that the murderer was finally brought to justice  john winter rested neither night nor day until he tracked the lascar down and david identified him  he was hanged on a gallows erected close to the spot where he murdered his innocent victim  on the exact spot where the murder took place marys grave was dug and a tombstone was put up which may be seen there at the present time with the following inscription upon it                               on this spot                          august the 25th 1782                           mary bax spinster                             aged 23 years                             was murdered by                        martin lash a foreigner                     who was executed for the same  poor john winter left the country immediately after and did not return until thirty years had elapsed when the event was forgotten and most of his old friends and companions were dead or gone abroad  his little brother david was drowned at sea  this mary bax was cousin to the father of john bax who figures so conspicuously in our tale  at the tomb of mary bax then as we have said long orrick resolved to make a stand  tommy bogey had by taking a short cut round a piece of marshy ground succeeded in getting a little in advance of orrick and observing that he was running straight towards the tombstone he leaped into the ditch the water in which was not deep at the time and coursing along the edge of it reached the rear of the tomb and hid himself there without having formed any definite idea as to what course he meant to pursue  whatever the intentions of the smuggler were they were effectually frustrated by an apparition which suddenly appeared and struck terror alike to the heart of pursuer and pursued  as long orrick approached the tomb there suddenly arose from the earth a tall gaunt figure with silver hair streaming wildly in the gale  to tommy who crouched behind the tomb and rodger and orrick who approached in front it seemed as if the spirit of the murdered girl had leaped out of the grave  the effect on all three was electrical  orrick and rodger diverging right and left fled like the wind in opposite directions and were out of sight in a few seconds while tommy crouching on the ground behind the tomb trembled in abject terror  the spirit if such it was did not attempt to pursue the fugitives but turning fiercely towards the boy seized him by the collar and shook him  oh mercy mercy cried poor tommy whose heart quaked within him  hallo  tommy bogey is it you boy said the spirit releasing the lad from a grasp that was anything but gentle  what old jeph can it be you exclaimed tommy in a tone of intense surprise as he seated himself on the tombstone and wiped the cold perspiration from his forehead with the cuff of his coat  ay it is me replied the old man sadly although i do sometimes doubt my own existence  it aint often that im interruptedbut what brings ye here lad and who were these that i saw running like foul fiends across the sandhills on such a night as this  they were supple rodger and long orrick replied tommy and a foul fiend is one of em anyhow as youd have found out old jeph if yed bin at home this evenin  as for bein out on sich a night as this it seems to me ye hant got much more sense to boast of in this respect than i have  youll ketch your death o cold old man  old man echoed jeph with a peculiar chuckle  ha yes i am an old man and ive bin used to such nights since i wos a young man but come away lad ill go home with ye now  old jeph took the boys hand as he said this and the two went over the moor togetherslowly for the way was rough and broken and silently for the howling of the gale rendered converse almost impossible  it is not to be supposed that tommy bogey had such command over himself however as altogether to restrain his curiosity  he did make one or two attempts to induce old jeph to explain why he was out in such a stormy night and on such a lonely spot but the old man refused to be communicative and finally put a stop to the subject by telling tommy to let other peoples business alone and asking him how it happened that long orrick came to make an attempt on his house and how it was he failed  tommy related all he knew with alacrity and for a time secured old jephs attention as was plain from the way in which he chuckled when he heard how his enemy had been outwitted but gradually the narrative fell on uninterested ears and before they regained the town the old mans countenance had become grave and sad and his mind was evidently wandering among the lightsmayhap among the shadowsof other days    chapter nine  unbusinesslike proceedings in the officepeekins grows desperate and takes refuge in the three jolly tars  mr denham stood in front of his office fire with a coattail as usual under each arm his feet planted on two little roses that grew on each side of a large bouquet which flourished perennially on his rug and his eyes fixed on the ceiling  he had just arrived at redwharf lane and looked quite fresh and ruddy from the exercise of walking for denham was a great walker and frequently did the distance between his house and his office on foot  mr crumps sat shivering in his own room looking the reverse of ruddy for crumps was old and his blood was thin and there was no fire in his room  it is but justice to say however that this was no fault of denhams for the apartment of his junior partner did not possess a fireplace and it could not be expected that a fire should be lit a la red indian on the middle of the floor  at all events crumps did not expect it  he was not therefore liable to disappointment in his expectations  he contented himself poor old man with such genial gusts of secondhand warmth as burst in upon him from time to time from denhams room when the door was open or poured in upon him in ameliorating rivulets through the keyhole like a little gulfstream when the door was shut  the letters sir said peekins the meek blue tiger in buttons entering at that moment and laying a pile of letters on the table  had peekins been a little dog without a soul capable of wagging his tail and fawning denham would have patted him but being only a boy in blue with a meek spirit the great man paid no attention to him whatever  he continued to gaze at the ceiling as if he were reading his destiny there  perhaps he would have looked as blank as the ceiling had he known what that destiny was to be but he did not know fortunately or unfortunately if the reader chooses hence he turned with a calm undisturbed countenance to peruse his letters after the boy had retired  we do not say that denham was a hard man by no means he was only peculiar in his views of things in general that was all  for some time denham broke seals read contents and made jottings without any expression whatever on his countenance  presently he took up an illfolded epistle addressed to mister denham in a round and rather rugged hand  begging he muttered with a slight frown  dear uncle eh he exclaimedturned over the leaf in surprise read the signature and turned back to the beginning again with the least possible tinge of surprise still remaining im sorry humph to have to inform you that the nancy has become a total wreck indeed on the goodwin sands  amazing sands these  what a quantity of wealth they have swallowed up the cargo has been entirely lostah it was insured to its full value also two of the hands  hm their lives wouldnt be insured  these rough creatures never do insure their lives wonderfully improvident i am at present disabled from the effects of a blow on the head received during the storm  very awkward particularly so just now no doubt bax will be up immediately to give you particulars humph  the cause of the loss of your schooner was in my opinion mr denhams eyebrows here rose in contemptuous surprise unseaworthiness of vessel and stores  mr denham made no comment on this part of the epistle  a dark frown settled on his brow as he crumpled the letter in his hand dropped it on the ground as if it had been a loathsome creature and set his foot on it  denham was uncommonly gruff and forbidding all that day  he spoke harshly to old mr crumps found fault with the clerks to such an extent that they began to regard the office as a species of pandemonium which ought to have smelt sulphurous instead of musty and rendered the life of peekins so insupportable that the poor boy occupied his few moments of leisure in speculating on the average duration of human life and wondering whether it would not be better on the whole to make himself an exception to the general rule by leaping off london bridge at high waterbluetights buttons and all  things continued in this felicitous condition in the office until five in the afternoon when there was a change not so much in the moral as in the physical atmosphere  it came in the form of a thick fog which rolled down the crooked places of redwharf lane poured through keyholes curled round the cranes on the warehouses and the old anchors cables and buoys in the lumberyards travelled over the mudflats and crept out upon the muddy river among the colliers rendering light things indistinct black things blacker dark places darker and affording such an opportunity for unrestrained enjoyment to the rats that these creatures held an absolute carnival everywhere  about this period of the day mr denham rose put on his hat and greatcoat and prepared to go  peekins observed this through a private scratch in the glass door and signalised the gladsome news in dumbshow to his comrades  hope at once took the place of despair in the office for lads and very young men are happily furnished with extremely elastic spirits  the impulse of joy caused by the prospect of denhams departure was so strong in the breast of one youth with red hair a red nose red cheeks large red lips blue eyes and red hands ruggles by name that he incontinently seized a sheet of blottingpaper crumpled it into a ball and flung it at the head of the youngest clerk a dark little boy who sat opposite to him on a tall stool and who being a new boy was copying letters painfully but diligently with a heavy heart  the missile was well aimed  it hit the new boy exactly on the point of the nose causing him to start and prolong the tail of a y an inch and a quarter beyond its natural limits  this little incident would not have been worth mentioning but for the fact that it was the hinge so to speak on which incidents of a more important nature turned  mr denham happened to open his door just as the missile was discharged and saw the result though not the thrower he had no difficulty however in discovering the offender for each of the other clerks looked at their comrade in virtuous horror as though to say oh how could youplease sir it wasnt me it was him while ruggles applied himself to his work with an air of abstraction and a face of scarlet that said plainly its of no use staring in that fashion at me for im as innocent as the unborn babe  denham frowned portentously and that peculiarly dead calm which usually precedes the bursting of a storm prevailed in the office  before the storm burst however the outer door was opened hastily and our friend bax stood in the room  he was somewhat dishevelled in appearance as if he had travelled fast  to the clerks in that small office he appeared more fierce and gigantic than usual  peekins regarded him with undisguised admiration and wondered in his heart if jack the giantkiller would have dared to encounter such a being supposing him to have had the chance  im glad i am not too late to find you here sir said bax puffing off his hat and bowing slightly to his employer  humph ejaculated denham step this way  they entered the inner office and the door being shut ruggles internally blessed bax and breathed freely  under the influence of reaction he even looked defiant  so you have lost your schooner began denham sitting down in his chair of state and eyeing the seaman sternly  bax returned the gaze so much more sternly that denham felt disconcerted but did not allow his feelings to betray themselves  the schooner has been lost said bax and i am here to report the fact and to present these letters one from the seamens missionary at ramsgate the other from your nephew both of which will show you that no blame attaches to me  i regret the loss deeply but it was un  bax was going to have said unavoidable but he felt that the expression would have been incorrect and stopped  finish your remark said denham  i merely wished to say that it was out of my power to prevent it  oh interjected denham sarcastically as he read the letters  the seamens missionary is one of whom i know nothing  his opinion therefore carries no weight  as to my nephew his remarks are simply unworthy of notice  but you say that no blame attaches to you  to whom then does blame attach if not to the skipper of the vessel  do you mean to lay it at the door of providence  no sir i do not replied bax  have you then the presumption to insinuate that it lies with me  bax was silent  am i to expect an answer said denham  i make no insinuations said bax after a short pause i do but state facts  if the nancy had been fitted with a new topslyard and jibboom as i advised last summer i would have carried her safe into the downs  so said denham in a tone of increasing sarcasm you have the hardihood to insinuate that it was my fault  bax reddened with indignation at the tone of insult in which these words were uttered  his bass voice grew deeper and sterner as he said  if you insist on plain speaking sir you shall have it  i do think the blame of the loss of the nancy lies at your door and worse than that the loss of two human lives lies there also  there was not a sound timber or a seaworthy article aboard of the schooner from stem to stern  you know well enough that i have told you thisin more civil language it may beagain and again and i hope that the telling of it now flatly will induce you to consider the immense responsibility that lies on your shoulders for there are other ships belonging to your firm in much the same conditionships with inferior charts and instruments unsound spars not enough of boats and with anchors and chains scarce powerful enough to hold a deal lugger in a moderate gale  mr denham was not prepared for this sudden and wholesale condemnation of himself and his property  he gazed at the seamans flushed countenance for a few seconds in mute surprise  at last he recovered selfpossession and said in a calm voice  you applied last year if i remember rightly for the situation of mate aboard our ship the tridentnow on her second voyage from australia  i did said bax shortly not knowing how to take this sudden change of subject  do you suppose said denham with a peculiar curl of his lip that this interview will tend to improve your chance of obtaining that situation  denham put the question with the full expectation of humbling bax and with the further intention of following up his reply with the assurance that there was much greater probability of the moon being turned into green cheese than of his promotion taking place but his intentions were frustrated by bax starting and in a voice of indignation exclaimingsir do you suppose i have come here to beg  if you were to offer me the command of the trident or any other ship that you possess i would refuse it with scorn  it is bad enough to risk ones life in the rotten craft you send to sea but that would be nothing compared with the shame of serving a house that thinks only of gain and holds human life cheaper than the dirt i tread under my feet  no sir i came here to explain how the nancy was lost  having done so i take my leave  stay said denham as bax turned to go  perhaps you will do me one more service before we part  will you kindly inform my nephew that he need not be in a hurry to come back here  i extend his leave  he may continue to absent himself as long as he pleasesto all eternity if it suits him  mr denham flushed up with anger as he said the last words  bax without deigning a reply turned on his heel and strode out of the room slamming the glassdoor behind him with such violence that every panel in it was shivered to atoms  he wheeled round and reentered the room denham grew pale supposing that the roused giant was about to assault him but bax only pointed to the door and said sternlypart of the wages due me will pay for that  you can keep the balance and buy yourself a bible with it  next moment he was gone and peekins stood staring at his master through the shattered door trembling from head to foot  immediately afterwards denham took his hat and stick and passed through the office  pausing at the door he looked back  ruggles  yes sir  there are five or six foreign letters in my desk for tomorrows post copy them out tonight  see that you do it tonight  peekins will remain with you and lock up after you have done  ruggles who knew that this involved work till near midnight humbly replied yes sir  having thus secured the misery of at least two human beings denham went home somewhat relieved to dinner  bax unconsciously but naturally followed his example  he also went to dinner but having no home in that quarter he went to the three jolly tars and found the landlord quite willing to supply all his wants on the shortest possible notice namely threequarters of an hour  in a snug box of that celebrated place of entertainment he found tommy bogey whom he had brought with him awaiting his appearance  the precocious youth was deeply immersed in a threedaysold copy of the times  hallo  bax youve been sharp about it said tommy laying down the paper and pulling a little black pipe out of his pocket which he proceeded coolly and quietly to fill just as if he had been a bearded and greyheaded tar for tommy being a worshipper of bax imitated as all worshippers do the bad as well as the good qualities of his hero ignorant of as well as indifferent to the fact that it would have been more noble to imitate the good and avoid the bad  ay weve settled it all slick off in no time said bax sitting down beside his young companion and proceeding also to fill his pipe  an wot about the widders and horphans inquired tommy beginning to smoke and using his extremely little finger as a tobaccostopper in a way that might have surprised a salamander  the widows exclaimed bax  ay the widdersalso the horphans repeated tommy with a grave nod of the head  i ope hes come down andsome  tommy said bax with a disconcerted look ive forgot em altogether  forgot em  bax  its a fact said bax with much humility but the truth is that we got to loggerheads an of course you know it was out of the question to talk on such a subject when we were in that state  in course it was said tommy  but its a pity  the fact was that bax had intended to make an appeal to mr denham in behalf of the widows and children of the poor men who had been drowned on the night when the nancy was wrecked but the unexpected turn which the conversation took had driven that subject utterly out of his mind  well tommy it cant be helped now and after all i dont think the widows will come by any loss by my forgetfulness for certain am i that denham would as soon supply a bestbower anchor to the trident as give a sovereign to these poor people  bax and his young friend here relapsed into a state of silent fumigation from which they were aroused by the entrance of dinner  this meal consisted of beefsteaks and porter  but it is due to bax to say that he advised his companion to confine his potations to water which his companion willingly agreed to as he would have done had bax advised him to drink buttermilk or cider or to go without drink altogether  they were about done with dinner when a weak small voice in the passage attracted their attention  is there one of the name of bax ere said the meek voice  here i am shouted bax come in what dye want with me  peekins entered in a state of great agitation  oh sir please sirill never do it again but i couldnt help it indeed indeedi was dyin i was  its a great sin i knows but  here peekins burst into tears and sat down on the seat opposite  wot a green un muttered tommy as he gazed at the tiger in blue through a volume of tobacco smoke  whats the matter boy inquired bax in some surprise  anything wrong at redwharf lane  yeesthats to say not exactly only ive rund away  you hant run far then said bax smiling  how long ist since you ran away  just ten minutes  tommy burst into a laugh at this and peekins feeling somewhat relieved smiled idiotically through his tears  well now my lad said bax leaning forward in a confidential way which quite won the affection of the tiger and patting him on the shoulder i would advise you strongly to go back  oh sir but i cant said peekins dolefully  i dursnt  my life is miserable there  mr denham is so ard on me that i feels like to die every time i sees im  it aint o no use here peekins became wildly desperate i wont go back cause if i do im sure to die slow an id rather die quick at once and be done with it  bax opened his eyes very wide at this  it revealed a state of things that he had never before imagined  tommy bogey puffed so large a cloud that his face was quite concealed by it and muttered you air a rum un  where dye stop boy inquired bax  in lodgins in fenchurch street  dye owe em anything at the office  no nothin they owes me seventeen and six  dye want it very much  o no i dont mind that bless ye said peekins earnestly  what dye mean to do inquired bax  go with youto sea replied the tiger promptly  but im not going to sea  then ill go with you wherever you please  i like you said the boy springing suddenly to his side and grasping his hand ive no one in the world to care for but you  i never heard any one speak like you if youll only let me be your servant ill go with you to the end of the world andand  here poor peekins was again overcome  brayvo shouted tommy bogey in admiration  youre not such a bad fellow after all  poor boy said bax stroking the tigers head you are willing to trust too easily to a weak and broken reed  but come ill take you to the coast  better to go there after all than stop with such a tenderhearted christian as mr denham  here take a bit of dinner  having tasted no food since breakfast peekins gladly accepted the invitation and ate heartily of the remnants of the meal to the great satisfaction of his companions especially of tommy who regarded him as one might regard a pet canary or rabbit which requires to be fed plenteously and handled with extreme gentleness and care    chapter ten  the hovel on deal beacha storm brewingplans to circumvent the smugglers  on a calm soft beautiful evening about a week after the events narrated in the last chapter guy foster issued from sandhill cottage and took his way towards the beach of deal  it was one of those inexpressibly sweet motionless evenings in which one is inclined if in ordinary health to rejoice in ones existence and in which the christian is led irresistibly to join with the psalmist in praising god for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men  young fosters thoughts ran for a considerable time in this latter channel for he was one of those youthful christians whose love to our saviour does not easily grow cold  he was wont to read the bible as if he really believed it to be the word of god and acted in accordance with its precepts with a degree of bold simplicity and trustfulness that made him a laughingstock to some and a subject of surprise and admiration to others of his companions and acquaintance  in short he was a christian of a cheerful straightforward stamp  yet guys course was not all sunshine neither was his conduct altogether immaculate  he was not exempt from the general rule that through much tribulation men shall enter into the kingdom  as he walked along rejoicing in his existence and in the beauty of that magnificent evening a cloud would rise occasionally and call forth a sigh as he recollected the polite intimation of his uncle that he had extended his leave of absence ad infinitum  he could not shut his eyes to the fact that a brilliant mercantile career on which he had recently entered and on which he might naturally look as the course cut out for him by providence was suddenly closed against him for ever  he knew his uncles temper too well to expect that he would relent and he felt that to retract a statement which he knew to be true or to express regret for having boldly told the truth as he had done was out of the question  besides he was well aware that such a course would not now avail to restore him to his lost position  it remained therefore that being without influential friends he must begin over again and carve his own way in the world  but what then  was this not the lot of hundreds of thousands  little time had been lost he was young and strong and hearty  god had written commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass  whatever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might as unto the lord and not unto men  under the influence of such thoughts the clouds cleared away from guys brow and he raised his eyes which for some minutes had been cast down with a hopeful gaze to the heavens  there he soon became lost in admiration of the clouds that were floating in masses of amber and gold rising over each otherpiled up mass upon massgrotesque sometimes in form solid yet soft in aspect and inexpressibly grand as a whole in their towering magnificence  there were signs however among the gorgeous beauties of this cloudland that were significant to eyes accustomed to read the face of the sky  various lurid and luminous clouds of grey and indianred hues told of approaching storm and the men of deal knew that the sea which just then pictured every cloud in its glassy depths as clearly as if there had been another cloudland below its surface would ere long be ruffled with a stiffish breeze perhaps be tossed by a heavy gale  men in general are not prone to meditate very deeply on what is going on around them beyond the reach of their own vision  this is natural and right to some extent  if we were to be deeply touched by the joys sorrows calamities and incidents that at all times affect humanity we should cease to enjoy existence  life would become a burden  the end of our creation would not be attained  yet there is an evil of an opposite kind which often mars our usefulness and makes us unconsciously participators in acts of injustice  this evil is partial ignorance of and indifference to much that goes on around us beyond the range of our vision but which nevertheless claims our attention and regard  every one who reflects will admit that it is pleasant to think when we retire to rest that a splendid system of police renders our home a place of safety and that although there are villains more than enough who would do their best to get at our purses and plate we need not make ourselves uneasy so long as the stout guardians of the night are on the beat  do we not congratulate ourselves on this and do we not pay the policetax without grumbling or at least with less grumbling than we vent when paying other taxes  should it good reader be less a subject of pleasant contemplation that when the midnight storm threatens to burst upon our shores there are men abroad who are skilled in the perilous work of snatching its prey from the raging sea that when the howling gale rattles our windows and shakes our very walls inducing us perchance to utter the mental prayer god have mercy on all who are on the sea this night that thenat that very timethe heroes of our coast are abroad all round the kingdom strong in the possession of dauntless hearts and iron frames and ready to plunge at any moment into the foaming sea to the rescue of life or property  who can say during any storm that he may not be personally interested in the efforts of those heroes  we knew a family the members of which like those of all the other families in the land listened to the howling of that fearful storm which covered our shores with wrecks on the 25th of november 1859 their thoughts were sad and anxious as must be the case more or less with all who reflect that in such nights hundreds of human beings are certainly perishing on our shores  but ah what would the feelings of that family have been had they knownas they soon came to knowthat two stalwart brothers of their own went down that night among the 450 human beings who perished in the wreck of the royal charter  in regard to the royal charter it may be truly said that there was no necessity for the loss of that vessel  god did not send direct destruction upon her  the engines were too weak to work her off the land in the face of the gale and the cables could not hold her  these were among the causes of her loss  and when she did get ashore every life might have been saved had there been a lifeboat or rocket apparatus at hand  we know not why there were neither but may it not have been because lifeboats and rockets are not sufficiently numerous all along our shores  how many bleeding hearts there were that would have given drops of their lifeblood to have provided the means of saving life on the coast of anglesea on that terrible night  a few small coins given at an earlier date might have saved those lives  no individual in the land however far removed from the coast can claim exemption from the dangers of the sea  his own head may indeed lie safe from the raging billow but at any moment the sea may grasp some loved one and thus wreck his peace of mind or engulf his property and wreck his fortune why then should not the whole nation take the affairs of the coast nearer to its heart  the lifeboat institution is not supported by taxation like our police force  it depends on the charity of the people  dont you think reader that it has a strong claim on the sympathies the prayers and the purse of every living soul in the kingdom  but to return with many apologies from this digression  guy foster noted the peculiar appearance of the clouds and concluded that something was brewing  all along the shores stout men in glazed and tarry garments noted the same appearances and also concluded that it would be dirty weather before long  the lifeboat men too were on the qui vive and doubtless the coxswain of each boat from john o groats to the landsend was overhauling his charge to see that all was right and in readiness for instant service  its going to blow tonight bax said guy on entering the hovel of the former  so tis replied bax who was standing beside his friends bluenose and tommy bogey watching old jeph as he busied himself with the model of his lifeboat  jeph said that in his opinion it was going to be a regular noreaster and bluenose intimated his adherence to the same opinion with a slap on his thigh and a huge puff of smoke  youre long about that boat jeph said bluenose after a pause during which he scanned the horizon with a telescope  so i am  it aint easy to carry out the notion  an wot may the notion be inquired bluenose sitting down on a coil of rope and gazing earnestly at the old man  to get lifeboats to right themselves wen theyre upset replied jeph regarding his model with a look of perplexity  you see its all very well to have em filled with airchambers which prevents em from sinkin but wen theyre upset dye see they aint o no use till they gets on their keels again and that aint easy to manage  now ive bin thinkin that if we wos to give em more sheer and raise the stem and stern a bit theyd turn over naturallike of their own accord  i do believe they would said bax  why what put that into yer head old man  well it aint altogether my own notion said jeph for ive heard when i was in the port o leith many years ago that a clergyman o the name of bremer had made a boat o this sort in the year 1792 that answered very well but somehow or other it never came to anything theres nothin that puzzles me so much as that said the old man looking up with a wondering expression of countenance  i dont understand how wen a good thing is found out it aint made the most of at once  i never could discover exactly what mr bremers plan was so im tryin to invent one  as he said this jeph placed the model on which he was engaged in a small tub of water which stood at his elbow  guy who was much interested in the old mans idea bent over him to observe the result of the experiment  tommy bogey sat down beside the tub as eagerly as if he expected some wonderful transformation to take place  bax and bluenose also looked on with unusual interest as if they felt that a crisis in the experimental labours of their old comrade had arrived  it floats firstrate on an even keel cried tommy with a pleased look as the miniature boat moved slowly round its little ocean now then capsize it  old jeph quietly put his finger on the side of the little boat and turned it upside down  instead of remaining in that position it rolled over on one side so much that the onlookers fully expected to see it right itself and tommy gave vent to a premature cheer but he cut it suddenly short on observing that the boat remained on its side with one of the gunwales immersed unable to attain an even keel in consequence of the weight of water inside of it  i tell ye wot it is jeph said bluenose with emphasis youll do it yet if you dont ill eat my souwester without sauce so i will  as the noospapers says youll inaggerate a new era in lifeboats old boy thats a fact and ill live to see it too  having delivered himself of this opinion in tones of much fervour the captain delivered his mouth of a series of cloudlets and gazed through them at his old friend with unfeigned admiration  guy and bax were both impressed with the partial success of the experiment as well as with jephs idea and said to him encouragingly that he had very near hit it but jeph himself only shook his head and smiled sadly  lads said he very near is sometimes a long way farther off than folk suppose  perpetual motion has bin very nearly discovered ever since men began to try their hands at engineerin but it aint discovered yet nor never will because why it aint possible  aint possble echoed bluenose youre out there old man  i diskivered it years ago  just you go up to sandhill cottage and inquire for one mrs laker a hupright and justifiable sister o mine open that oomans mouth an look in she wont bite if ye dont bother her too much and lyin in that there cavern yell see a thing called a tongueif that aint an engine of perpetooal motion shiver my timbers thats all  just as the captain made this reckless offer to sacrifice his timbers peekinsformerly the blue tigerentered the hovel and going hastily to bluenose whispered in his ear  a very remarkable transformation had taken place in the outward man of poor peekins  after coming with bax to deal he had been adopted as it were by the copartners of the hovel and was so to speak shared equally by bax bluenose old jeph and tommy  the wonderfully thin and spiderlike appearance which he presented in his bluetights and buttons on his arrival created such a howl of derisive astonishment among the seminautical boys of deal that his friends became heartily ashamed of him  bax therefore walked him off at once to a slopshop where seastores of every possible or conceivable kind could be purchased at reasonable prices from a cotton kerchief with the union jack in the middle of it to the old anchor of a seventyfour gun ship with a wooden stock big enough to make a canoe  here peekins was disrobed of his old garments and clad in canvas trousers pilotcloth jacket and vest with capacious pockets and a souwester all of which fitted him so loosely that he felt persuaded in his own mind he could easily have jumped out of them with an upward bound or have slipped out of them downwards through either leg of the pantaloons  he went into that store a blue spider he came out a reasonablelooking seafaring boy rather narrow and sloping about the shoulders it is true but smart enough and baggy enoughespecially about the nether garmentsto please even bax who in such matters was rather fastidious  the whispered communication above referred to had the effect of causing bluenose to spring up from the coil of rope and exclaimyou dont say so  then checking himself and looking mysterious he said he wanted to have a word with bax in private and would be obligated if hed go with him a bit along shore  well whats the news inquired bax when they were alone  weve heerd of long orrick said bluenose eagerly  thats not much news said bax you told me there wasnt enough witnesses to swear to him or something o that sort and that it would be no use attempting to put him in limbo didnt you  ay replied the other striking his clenched right hand into the palm of his left but the villain dont the less deserve to be tied up and get twelve dozen for all that  id content myself with knocking out both his daylights for his cowardly attempt to badger an old man but that wouldnt be safe besides i knowd well enough hed take to smugglin again an soon give us a chance to nab him at his old tricks so coleman and i have been keepin a lookout on him and weve found that small yard o pumpwater peekins oncommon clever in the way o watchin  hes just brought me word that he heard long orrick talkin with his chum rodney nick an plannin to run their lugger tonight into pegwell bay as the coast at the fiddlers cave would be too well watched so im goin down to fiddlers cave tonight and i wants you to go with me  well get coleman to help us for hes savage to get hold of long orrick ever since the night they put him in a sack an left him to air his timbers in the great chapel field  but if said bax long orrick said he would run to pegwell bay which is three or four miles to the norard o this and resolved that he would not go to fiddlers cave which is six miles to the suthard why should you go to the very place hes not likely to be found at  because i knows the man replied bluenose with a wink of deep meaning i knows him better than you do  wen long orrick is seen bearin away due north with flying colours you may take your davy that his true course lies south or thereby  bax smiled and suggested that they should take guy foster with them and when tommy bogey heard what they were about he volunteered his services which were accepted laughingly  being of a sociable disposition tommy deemed it prudent to press peekins into the service and peekins albeit not pugnacious by nature was quite willing and ready to follow wherever his sturdy little friend chose to lead  so they all set off along the road that skirts the beach towards saint margarets bay  the sun was just sinking as they started and the red clouds were beginning to deepen in their colour and look ominous though the sea was still quiet and clear like a sheet of glass  after following the road for some time they diverged into the footpath that leads to and winds along the giddy edge of the chalk cliffs which rise abruptly from the shore at this part of the kentish coast to the height of several hundred feet  the path being narrow they were obliged to walk in single file bax leading bluenose and guy following and tommy with his meek friend bringing up the rear  the view seawards was indescribably magnificent from the elevated ridge along which they hastened  the downs was crowded with hundreds of vessels of every form and size as well as of every country all waiting for a favourable breeze to enable them to quit the roadstead and put to sea  pilot luggers and other shoreboats of various kinds were moving about among these some on the lookout for employment others intent on doing a stroke of business in the smuggling way if convenient  far away along the beach men of the coastguard might be seen like little black specks with telescopes actively employed ready to pounce on and overhaul more or less stringently according to circumstances every boat that touched the shingle  everything in nature seemed silent and motionless with the exception of the seamews that wheeled round the summits of the cliffs or dived into the glassy sea  all these things were noted and appreciated in various degrees by the members of the party who hastened towards saint margarets bay but none of them commented much on the scenery  they were too well accustomed to the face of nature in every varying mood to be much struck with her face on the present occasion  perhaps we may except guy foster who being more of a city man than his companions besides being more highly educated was more deeply impressed by what he saw that evening  but guy was too much absorbed by the object of the expedition to venture any remark on the beautiful aspect of nature  dye see that lugger bax said bluenose pointing to a particular spot on the sea  between the yankee and the frenchman said bax i see it well enough what then  thats long orricks boat replied the captain id know it among a thousand  depend on it well nab him tonight with a rich cargo of baccy and brandy aboard  the two bs are too much for him  hed sell his soul for baccy and brandy  thats not such an uncommon weakness as you seem to think observed guy  every day men sell their souls for more worthless things  dye think so said bluenose with a philosophical twist in his eyebrows  i know it returned guy men often sell both body and soul as far as we can judge for a mere idea  here bax who had been examining the lugger in question with a pockettelescope said that he had no doubt whatever bluenose was right and hastened forward at a smarter pace than before  in less than two hours they descended the steep cliffs to the shingle of saint margarets bay and at the same time the wind began to rise while the shades of night gradually overspread the scene  saint margarets bay is one of those small quiet secluded hamlets which are not unfrequently met with along our coasts and in regard to which the stranger is irresistibly led to ask mentally if not really why did people ever come to build cottages and dwell here and what do they do  how do they make a livelihood  no stranger ever obtains a satisfactory answer to these questions for the very good reason that short though they be the answers to them would involve almost a volume or a speech equal in length to that with which the chancellor of the exchequer introduces his annual budget there would be various classes to describe numerous wants to apprehend peculiar circumstances and conditions of social life to explain in short the thing is a mystery to many and we merely remark on the fact without having any intention of attempting to clear the mystery away  so narrow is the strip of shingle that lies between the sea and the cliffs in saint margarets bay that the cottages have been built close up to the lattermuch too close we venture to think for safety but perhaps men who live in constant peril of their lives count the additional risk of being crushed along with their families under twenty or thirty tons of chalk unworthy of consideration  on descending to the beach the first thing our party saw was the burly figure of coleman seated on his donkey by the sad sea waves  it must not be supposed that the coastguardman was literally astride of a live ass  no his donkey was an exceedingly ingenious contrivance invented specially for the use of a class of men who being human cannot avoid becoming fatiguedyet who being sentinels must not on any account whatever be permitted to encourage sleep  the men of the coastguard are subject to prolonged and frequent periods of watching by night as well as by day hence they are liable to become wearied  it has been wisely considered that the most selfdenying mortal alive will when hard pressed sit down on a rock or on the ground if need be just to relieve his legs a little  the same wise consideration has recalled the fact that when men do this they become helplessly incapable of resisting the drowsy god and will assuredly go to sleep against their will and their judgment  to meet this case some truly great mind invented the donkey  this contrivance is simply a stool with one leg  the top of the stool is not round but oblong and very small  a hole in the centre receives the solitary leg which is attached to it by a piece of cord and can be pulled out when occasion requires and the machine thrown over the arm as one would throw a cloak or scarf  the beauty of the donkey is that it forms an excellent seat on which a man can balance himself and rest with great comfort as long as he keeps awake but should he fall asleep even for one instant he infallibly comes to the ground with a shock so severe that he is quite certain to remain wakeful during the remainder of his vigil  what ho  coleman cried bax as he and his friends drew near have you actually acquired the art of sleeping on a donkey  coleman rose and turned round with a goodhumoured smile on his ruddy visage  nay not quite that said he but the hiss of the waves is apt to dull the hearin a bit an one dont naturally look for enemies from landard dye see  mayhap not said bluenose taking a fresh quid of tobacco out of a brass box which he carried at all times in his waistcoat pocket but i expect an enemy from seaward tonight wholl be oncommon glad to make your acquaintance no doubt  here the captain chuckled engulfed his fresh quid and proceeded to explain the nature of their errand  having done so he asked coleman what he thought of it  the worthy coastguardman scratched his nose and stared at the shingle for some minutes before venturing to reply  i think said he at length that well cook his goose tonight thats wot it is  coleman paused and looked thoughtfully at bluenose  the captain nodded his head pleasantly but said nothing and coleman proceeded  hell come in with the floodtide no doubt if the gale dont drive him in sooner an run ashore as near to the cave as possible but hell be scared away if he sees anything like unusual watchin on the shore so youd better get out o sight as fast as ye can and keep there  dont you think it would be as well that you also should keep out of sight and so leave the coast clear for him suggested bax  not so said coleman with a grin hed see that id done it for an object  long orrick keeps his weather eye too wide open to be caught so easy as that comes to  well but come up for halfanhour and have a glass of beer while we talk over the business said bax  coleman shook his head cant quit my post besides i dont drink no beer  brayvo old feller cried bluenose give us your flipper  water cold for ever say i as the whale remarked to the porpoise  but lets go under the lee o the boatouse an talk it out for we shant nab long orrick this night if we doesnt go at im like a cat at a mouse  just listen to that old codfish said tommy bogey to peekins takin credit to hisself for not drinkin though he smokes like a steamtug an chews likelikeim a dutchman if i know what unless it be like the bosun of a seventyfour gun ship  do bosuns of seventyfour gun ships chew very bad inquired peekins  oh dont they exclaimed tommy opening his eyes very wide and rounding his mouth so as to express his utter inability to convey any idea of the terrific powers of bosuns in that particular line  but bluenose beats em all  hed chew oakum i do believe if he didnt get baccy and yet he boasts of not drinkin  seems to me hes just as bad as the rest of us  dyou think so said peekins with a doubtful look dont you think the man who does only two nasty things is better off than the one that does three  nasty things exclaimed tommy in a tone of amazement  dont bax drink and smoke and dye think hed do one or tother if they was nasty  peekins you small villian as was a blue spider only a week since if you ever talks of them things being nasty again ill wop you  you hear that bax said guy foster who being only a few paces ahead of the boys had overheard the remark spoken as it was in rather a loud key  bax nodded his head and smiled but made no reply  it is but just to say that tommys threat was uttered more than half in jest  he would as soon have thought of wopping a little girl as of maltreating his meek companion  but peekins was uncertain how to take his threat so not being desirous of a wopping he held his tongue and humbly followed his comrades  the party walked for some time at the foot of the cliffs under the lee of a boathouse engaged in earnest conversation as to the best mode of proceeding in the meditated enterprise  it was evident to all of them that the hour for action could not now be far distant for the gale increased every moment the light on the south foreland was already sending its warning rays far and wide over the angry sea whence the floating lights that mark the sands sent back their nightly greeting while dark thunderous clouds mantled over the sky and deepened the shades of night which ere long completely overspread land and sea    chapter eleven  the smugglers cavea surprise a deception a fight and an escape  the fiddlers cave alias canterbury cave alias the smugglers cave is a cavern of unknown extent situated under the high chalk cliffs at the southern extremity of saint margarets bay  tradition informs us that its first appellation was bestowed in consequence of a fiddler having gone into it with his dog many years ago and never having come out again  four days afterwards the dog crept out in a dying condition  it is supposed that the man must have wandered too far into the cavern and been overpowered by foul air tradition also says that there is a passage from it underground all the way to canterbury a distance of eighteen miles hence its second name  no one however seems to have verified this report  the kentish smugglers from whom the cave derives its last title have undoubtedly made much use of it in days of old  at the period of our story the entrance to fiddlers cave was so much obstructed by rubbish and sand that a man had to stoop low on entering the passage which led to the interior  at the present day the entrance is so nearly closed up that a man could not creep along it even on his hands and knees  here on the threatening night of which we are writing a boatman stood on the watch close under the rocks that overhung the entrance to the cavern  the man was habited like most of his brethren of the coast in rough garments with long boots souwester cap and oiled tarred and greased upper garments suitable to the stormy night in which he had seen fit to hold his vigil  a feeble ray of light that struggled in the cavern showed that the man clutched a pistol in his right hand and with a frown on his brow glanced alternately out to sea where all was darkness and along shore where the only visible living object was the figure of old coleman seated on his donkey  it need scarcely be added that the sight of the coastguardman was the cause of the smugglers frown  the gale was now blowing stiffly and rolling black clouds so covered the sky that the moon was entirely obscured by them save when an occasional break permitted a few rays to stream down and reveal the elemental strife that was going on below  coleman regardless of the storm maintained his position on his onelegged companion and bending his body to the blast endeavoured to pierce the gloom that enshrouded everything seaward beyond the large breakers that sent their foam hissing up to his very feet  while he sat there he thought or muttered thus  its odd now id ha thought hed have run ashore afore this seein that ive sat on this here donkey for more nor an hour apurpose to let him see that im only watchin here and nowhere else  he cant but see theres a goodish lump o the coast free to him so long as i sit here  but hes a sly feller praps he suspects somethin  an yet ill go bound he dont guess that theres six or seven of his worst enemies hidin all along the coast with eyes like needles and ears on full cock  howsever it wont do to sit much longer  if he dont come in five minutes ill git up an walk along in an easy unsuspectin way dear me wot a set o hypocrites weve got to be in the hexecution of our dooty  while coleman moralised thus in utter ignorance of the near proximity of an eyewitness the smuggler at the mouth of the cave who was no other than orricks friend rodney nick muttered some remarks between his teeth which were by no means complimentary to the other  what are ye sittin there for ye old idiot said he savagely  i do blieve yeve larned to sleep on the donkey  ha theres two of ye together an the wooden ones the best  wouldnt i just like to be yer leftenant my boy an id come to know why you dont go on your beat why there may be no end o cats and galleys takin the beach wi baccy an lush enough to smother you up alive an you sittin there snuffin the east wind like an old ass as ye are  the smuggler uttered the last sentence in deep exasperation for the time appointed for signalising his comrades at sea had arrived and yet that stolid coastguardman sat there as if he had become fastened to the shingle  ive a good mind to run out an hit ye a crack over yer figurehead he continued grasping his pistol nervously and taking a step forward hallo one would amost think youd heard me speak he added and shrank back as coleman rose from his seat the five minutes having expired and sauntered with a careless air straight towards the cave  on reaching it he paused and looked into it  rodney nick crouched in the shadow of a projecting rock and grasped his pistol tightly for a moment under the impression that he was about to be discovered  he was one of those fierce angry men who are at all times ready to risk their lives in order to gratify revenge  old coleman had more than once thwarted rodney nick in his designs besides having in other ways incurred his dislike and there is no doubt that had the coastguardman discovered him at that moment he would have paid for the discovery with his life  fortunately for both of them coleman turned after standing a few seconds at the mouth of the cave and retraced his steps along the beach  he prolonged his walk on this occasion to the extremity of his beat but long before reaching that point his figure was lost to the smugglers view in darkness  at last exclaimed rodney nick taking a dark lantern from his breast and peering cautiously in every direction  now then long orrick if ye look sharp well cheat em again and chew our quids and drink our grog free of dooty  as he muttered his words the smuggler flashed the lantern for an instant in such a manner that its brilliant bullseye was visible far out at sea  again he let its light shine out for one instant then he closed the lid and awaited the result  out upon the sea not far from the wild breakers that thundered and burst in foam on the south end of the goodwin sands a boat of the size and form styled by men of the coast a cat was tossing idly on the waves  the men in her were employed in the easy task of keeping her head to the wind and in the anxious occupation of keeping a bright lookout on the shore  times up said one of the men turning suddenly towards his companions and allowing the light of a dark lantern to fall on the face of a watch which he held in his hand  dowse the glim you lubber cried the angry voice of long orrick and keep a sharp lookout for the signal  if it dont come well run for old stairs bay an if theyre too sharp for us there well make for pegwell bay and drop the tubs overboard with sinkers at em  for nearly quarter of an hour the party in the boat watched in silence it was evident that long orrick was becoming impatient from the way in which he turned now to windward to scan the threatening sky and then to landward to look for the expected signal  he felt on the one hand that if the gale continued to increase it would be necessary to run for the nearest place of safety and he felt on the other hand that if he did not succeed in landing the goods at fiddlers cave there would be small chance of his getting them ashore at all  theres the glim cried one of the men  all right up with a bit o the sail said long orrick seizing the tiller from the man who held it  in a second or two they were driving before the wind straight for the shore  with such a stiff breeze the boat was soon close to the breakers and now the utmost care was necessary in order to prevent it from broachingto and being capsized  no anxiety was felt however by the crew of the little craft  deal boatmen are noted for their expertness in beaching their boats and in putting off to sea in rough weather and the man who held the tiller of the little boat which danced on the white crests of the waves that night had many and many a time come through such trifling danger scatheless  look out bill cried orrick as the thunder of the waves on the beach sounded in his ears and the great chalk cliffs rose up ghostlike and dim before him  to one unaccustomed to such scenes it might have appeared an act of madness to run ashore on such a night  but the danger was not so great as it seemed  the man at the bow stood ready with a boathook  in a moment the keel grated on the shingle  instantly the men were over the side and the boat was hauled up the beach  now then for the tubs  make for the cave straight  rodney nick will be here in a minute  ah here he comes  well rodney weve done it pretty smart said long orrick wading with a keg of brandy towards a figure which approached him from the beach  here you are theres lots more of em  were in luck  look alive  the coasts clear i suppose  hall right said the dark figure in a hoarse whisper which terminated in a low chuckle as long orrick placed the keg innocently in the arms of old coleman and returned to the boat for more  it may be as well to remark herein order to clear up this mystery that although coleman had not observed the flash of rodney nicks lantern his sharp eye had observed the gleam of the light in the boat when one of the men as already mentioned threw it on the face of his timepiece  supposing erroneously that this latter was a signal to the shore coleman nevertheless came to the correct conclusion that some one must be awaiting long orrick near at hand and felt convinced that the smugglers cave must needs be the rendezvous  hastening cautiously to bax whose station was not far distant from the cave he communicated his suspicions and they went together towards the place  ill go in first said coleman cause i know the place better than you do  very good assented bax ill stand by to lend a hand  arrived at the cavern bax waited outside and coleman went in so stealthily that he was at rodney nicks side before that worthy had the smallest suspicion of his presence  indeed coleman would certainly have run against the smuggler in the dark had not the latter happened to have been muttering savage threats against wind and tide friends and foes alike in consequence of the nonappearance of the boat  seizing him suddenly from behind coleman placed his knee in the small of his back forced him almost double and then laid him flat on the ground  at the same moment bax knelt by his side put one of his strong hands on the smugglers right armthereby rendering it powerlessand placed the other on his mouth  so quickly was it all done that rodney was bound and gagged in less than two minutes  coleman then ran out just in time to receive the first instalment of the brandy as already related  being much the same in build and height with rodney nick he found no difficulty in passing for him in the darkness of the night and violence of the wind which latter rendered his hoarse whispers almost unintelligible  in this way several kegs of brandy boxes of cigars and bundles of tobacco were landed and conveyed to the cavern by coleman who refused to allow bax to act as an assistant fearing that his great size might betray him  on the fifth or sixth trip he found long orrick waiting for him somewhat impatiently  you might have brought a hand with ye man said the latter testily  couldnt git one said coleman taking the keg that was delivered to him  what say cried orrick  couldnt git one repeated the other as loudly and hoarsely as he could whisper  speak out man cried long orrick with an oath you aint used to have delicate lungs  i couldnt git nobody to come with me said coleman in a louder voice  the tone was not distinct but it was sufficient to open the eyes of the smuggler  scarcely had the last word left his lips when coleman received a blow between the eyes that laid him flat on the beach fortunately the last wave had retired  there was only an inch or so of foam around him  long orrick knelt on his foe and drew a knife from his girdle  before the next wave came up coleman with one hand caught the uplifted arm of his adversary and with the other discharged a pistol which he had drawn from his breast  in another instant they were struggling with each other in the wave which immediately swept over the beach and bax was standing over them uncertain where to strike as the darkness rendered friend and foe alike undistinguishable  the men in the boat at once rushed to the rescue omitting to take weapons with them in their haste  seeing this bax seized the struggling men by their collars and exerting his great strength to the utmost dragged them both high upon the beach  he was instantly assailed by the crew the first and second of whom he knocked down respectively with a right and left hand blow but the third sprang on him behind and two others came up at the same momentone on each side and seized his arms  had bax been an ordinary man his case would have been hopeless but having been endowed with an amount of muscular power and vigour far beyond the average of strong men he freed himself in a somewhat curious manner  bending forward he lifted the man who grasped him round the neck from behind quite off his legs and by a sudden stoop threw him completely over his head  this enabled him to hurl his other assailants to the ground where they lay stunned and motionless  he then darted at coleman and long orrick who were still struggling together with tremendous fury  seeing his approach the smuggler suddenly gave in relaxed his hold and exclaimed with a laugh as bax laid hold of him  well well i see its all up with me so its o no use resistin  no that it aint my friend said coleman rising and patting his foe on the back  i cant tell ye how pleased i am to meet with ye  youre gettin stouter i think  smugglin seems to agree with yehey  he said this with a leer and bax laughed as he inspected long orrick more narrowly  the fact was that the smugglers clothing was so stuffed in all parts with tobacco that his lanky proportions had quite disappeared and he had become so ludicrously rotund as to be visibly altered even in a dark night  well it does agree with me thats a fact said long orrick with a savage laugh in the tone of which there was mingled however quite as much bitterness as merriment  just at this moment the rest of colemans friends including tommy bogey and peekins appeared on the scene in breathless haste having been attracted by the pistolshot  in the eager question and answer that followed long orrick was for a moment not sufficiently guarded  he wrenched himself suddenly from the loosened grasp of bax and darting between several of the party one of whom he floored in passing with a lefthanded blow he ran along the shore at the top of his speed  bax blazing with disappointment and indignation set off in fierce pursuit and old coleman bursting with anger followed as fast as his short legs and shorter wind would permit him  guy foster and several of the others joined in the chase while those who remained behind contented themselves with securing the men who had been already captured    chapter twelve  the stormthe wreck of the homeward boundthe lifeboat  a stern chase never was and never will be a short one  old coleman in the course of quarter of a miles run felt that his powers were limited and wisely stopped short bax guy and tommy bogey held on at full speed for upwards of two miles along the beach following the road which wound along the base of the chalk cliffs and keeping the fugitive well in view  but long orrick was as we have seen a good runner  he kept his ground until he reached a small hamlet named kingsdown lying about two and a half miles to the north of saint margarets bay  here he turned suddenly to the left quitted the beach and made for the interior where he was soon lost sight of and left his disappointed pursuers to grumble at their bad fortune and wipe their heated brows  the strength of the gale had now increased to such an extent that it became a matter not only of difficulty but of danger to pass along the shore beneath the cliffs  the spray was hurled against them with great violence and as the tide rose the larger waves washed up with a magnificent and overwhelming sweep almost to their base  in these circumstances guy proposed to go back to saint margarets bay by the inland road  its a bit longer said he as they stood under the lee of a wall panting from the effects of their run but we shall be sheltered from the gale besides i doubt if we could pass under the cliffs now  bax made no reply but placing his hand on his friends arm stood for a few seconds in the attitude of one who listens with profound attention  there it is said he at last  do ye hear that guy  i hear it cried tommy bogey with some excitement  i hear nothing but the howling of the wind said guy and the roaring of the sea  hush listen the minutegun said bax in a low voice it comes from saint margarets bay there did you not  ah  i heard it cried the other come let us run down along the beach a bit and see if we can make out whereabouts she is  guy spoke as if he had no doubt whatever of the cause of the sounds which had attracted the attention of himself and his friends  without another word they all bent their heads to the storm and forced their way out upon the exposed beach where they found some fishermen assembled in the lee of a boathouse looking eagerly towards the direction whence the sounds came  im afeard shes got on the rocks to the norard o the bay said one of the men as bax and his companions ran towards them there goes another gun  a faint flash was seen for an instant away to the southward  it was followed in a few seconds by the low boom of a distant gun  almost at the same moment the black heavens seemed to be cleft by a sheet of vivid flame which towered high into the sky and then went out leaving the darkness blacker than before  thats a rocket cried the fishermen  heaven help them said bax as he hastily buttoned his oilskin coat close up to his chin  come guy well away and do what we can  will any of you lads join us  most of the younger men on the ground at once volunteered  stop cried one of the older men the tides too high ye cant pass the cliff i tell ye  the man was left abruptly by the whole party for they knew well enough that if they took the inland road they might be too late to render effectual assistance and any needless delay in attempting the beach road could only make matters worse  there was no lifeboat on this part of the kentish coast at that time and the great distance of the spot from ramsgate or broadstairs rendered it highly improbable that either of the lifeboats belonging to these ports could be in time to render effectual assistance  besides the men knew well that on such a night the crews of these boats would have enough of work to do in attending to the wrecks in their own immediate neighbourhood  they followed bax therefore at a steady trot until they reached a part of the perpendicular cliff which projected somewhat towards the sea  at the foot of this the waves which on this coast roll to the shore with tremendous volume and power burst with a loud roar and rushed up in thick foam  dont any of you come on that dont feel up to it cried bax as he awaited the retreat of a wave and prepared to make a dash  at that moment he wheeled round with the look and air of one who had forgotten something  tommy said he laying his hand on the boys head go back lad round by the land road  no bax i wont replied tommy with a fervour of determination that would at any other time have raised a laugh in those who heard it  come along then you obstinate beggar said bax sternly seizing the boy by the arms and throwing him over his shoulder as if he had been a lamb  tommys dignity was hurt  he attempted to struggle but he might as well have hoped to free himself from the hug of a brown bear as to escape from the vicelike grip of his big friend  in another moment bax was whelmed in spray and kneedeep in rushing water  it was a short dangerous passage but the whole party got round the cliff in safety and hastened as rapidly as possible towards the scene of the wreck  we must now beg the reader to follow us to another scene and to go back a few hours in time  shortly after the sun set that night and before the full fury of the storm broke forth a noble ship of two thousand tons burden beat up the channel and made for the downs  she was a homeward bound ship just arrived from australia with a valuable cargo and between two and three hundred passengers many of whom were golddiggers returning to their native land and nearly all of whom were possessed of a considerable sum in nuggets and golddust  the ship was owned by the house of denham crumps and company  her arrival had been already telegraphed to the firm in redwharf lane  there was rejoicing that evening on board the trident  men and women and children crowded the high sides of the weatherworn ship and holding on by shrouds ratlines and stays standing on tiptoe clambering on carronades and peeping through holes gazed long and ardently at the white cliffs of dear old england  some of them had not set eyes on the old country as it is affectionately called in our colonies for many years  some there were who had gone out as boys and were returning baldheaded and greybearded men  there were others who had been out only a few years but who happening to be on the spot when the goldfields were discovered had suddenly made fortunes  they were returning to surprise and gladden the hearts of those who perchance had sent them off to seek their fortunes with the sad feeling that there was little chance of seeing them again in this world  there were ladies also who had gone out to the distant land with an unbelieving almost despairing hope of finding employment for those talents which they had alas found to be of but little value at home these were in some cases returning with lucky golddiggers and blooming children to their native land  in other cases they were merely about to visit home to induce some parent or sister perhaps to venture out to the land of gold  but all whether young or old male or female gentle or simple were merry and glad of heart that night as they clustered on the bulwarks of the trident and gazed at the longedfor and much loved shore  there was no distinction of ranks now  the cabin and the tweendeck passengers mingled together and tried to relieve the feelings of their hearts by exchanging words of courtesy and goodwill  the stormy and threatening aspect of the sky had no terrors now for the passengers on board the trident  for weeks and months they had tossed on the bosom of the great deep  they were familiar with the varied moods of wind and wave they had faced the dangers of the sea so often that they scarce believed that any real dangers could exist  the very children had become sailors they were precociously weatherwise and rather fond of being tossed on the waves than otherwise  the prospect of a storm no longer filled them with alarm as it used to do at the beginning of the voyage for they had encountered many storms and weathered them all  yes they had experienced all the dangers of the sea but it was reserved for that nightthat last night of the long long voyageto teach them the dangers of the land the terrors of a storm in narrow waters among shallows and on a leeshoreand to convince them that for man there is no real safety whatever in this life save only in the favour and love of god  there were some on board the trident however who knew the danger of their position full well but who were too considerate of the feelings of the women and children to let their knowledge appear even in their looks  the sailors knew the danger of a leeshore but sailors are to a large extent a reckless and hopeful class of men whose equanimity is not easily upset  the captain too and the pilot were alive to their critical position but both were sanguine and hoped to get into the downs before the storm should break  a few of the male passengers also seemed to be aware of the fact that approaching the downs on such a night was anything but matter of gratulation  one in particular a tall strong man of about forty with a bushy black beard and a stern aspect walked about the quarterdeck with a frown on his countenance that betokened a mind ill at ease  going up to the captain who stood near the wheel this man asked him what he thought of the weather  it dont look well we shall have a dirty night i fear replied the captain  do you expect to make the downs before the storm breaks inquired the passenger  well i hope so said the captain  supposing you do continued the dark man do you consider your cables and groundtackle strong enough to hold the ship in the face of an easterly gale  why do you ask that said the captain in surprise  because replied the passenger i have my doubts on the point  well to tell you the truth said the other in a low tone i confess that my mind is more uneasy on that score than on any other  the cables are fit enough to hold her in ordinary weather but if we were obliged to anchor off a leeshore in a heavy gale on an exposed coast like this i would be somewhat anxious  why is the ground tackle not strong enough asked the passenger  well its not easy to answer that replied the captain with a smile and yet it aint difficult to conceive that it would cost a good deal to supply new and heavier chains and anchors to the ship  ay the old storyeconomy said the passenger bitterly almost fiercely a set of selfish landlubbers who know nothing whatever about the sea and care for nothing on earth but their own pockets and bellies are allowed by the government of this land to send ships loaded with human beings to sea in such a state that it almost calls for the performance of a miracle to secure their safe arrival in port  this is pointed out again and again to them without effect  the sea throws its dead by dozens on our shores every gale that blows crying out look here at the result of economy and selfishness  goods to the extent of thousands of pounds are destroyed annually and the waves that swallow them belch out the same complaint  even the statistics that stare in the face of our legislators and are published by their own authority tell the same taleyet little or nothing is done to prevent misers from sending ships to sea in a totally unfit condition to face even ordinary dangers  bah the thing is past remedy for the men who should act are deaf and blind  mark my words captain if we dont weather the south foreland before ten o the clock this night the trident will be a total wreck before morning  the passenger turned on his heel with an angry fling and went below while the captain who was somewhat overawed by his vehemence walked aft to converse with the pilot  the gale soon burst on the ship sending nearly all the passengers below and compelling the captain to reduce sail  darkness overspread the scene and as the night wore on the gale increased to such a degree that the ship laboured heavily  soon the lights on the south foreland were descried and passed in safety  get the anchors clear said the pilot  ready about there  no one ever knew the reason of the order given at that time  perhaps the pilot thought he was a little too near the land and meant to haul off a little but whatever the reason might have been the command was only half carried out when the sheet of the jib gave way the loosened sail flapped itself to shreds in a second and the ship missing stays fell off towards the shore  better wear ship cried the captain springing in alarm to the pilots side  too late for that  shores close under our lee  let go the anchors  the shout with which the command was given proved the necessity of its being instantly obeyed but the men needed no urging for at that moment a temporary lull in the furious blast allowed them to hear the roaring of the breakers at the foot of the cliffs  two anchors were at once let go and the ship was brought up with a tremendous shock  and now commenced that prolonged struggle for life which is alas too often the lot of those who venture out upon the stormy sea  yet it was some time before the passengers of the trident could be brought fully to realise their danger  it was hard to believe that after weathering the cyclones of the southern seas and the gales of the atlantic they had reached home at last to be cast a wreck upon their own threshold and to perish within hail almost of relatives and friends  for a long time they refused to credit the appalling truth that their case was all but hopelessanchored as they were close to a lee shore with inadequate ground tackle and an increasing gale  when the chain of the smaller anchor snapped and the captain ordered the minutegun to be fired and rockets to be thrown up then the wail of terror began    then shrieked the timid and stood still the brave  youd better order the boats to be lowered said the dark passenger to the captain with a sneer that seemed unnatural as well as unfeeling in the circumstances  the captain who was standing by the starboard mizzen shrouds at the time glanced angrily at him for a moment and said  ha  you know well enough that there aint boats enough in the ship to carry all the passengers and if there were they could not live for a moment in such a sea  yes replied the dark man vehemently i know that well enough and i know too that theres no lifeboat of any kind aboard nor lifejackets nor lifebuoys beyond what would suffice to float some half dozen men and the owners knew this before sending their ship to sea and knowing it they cared not a rap because they had insured ship and cargo to the full value  human life not being counted part of the cargo is of no value whatever to them  come mr clelland said the captain reproachfully is this a time for a christian man to encourage bitter feelings against his fellows because of systems and customs bad or good  ay it is the time answered the other at least if i dont let out my mind now its not likely ill find a fitter time to do it in this world  he said this somewhat sadly and turned away just as the captain gave orders to throw up another rocket  far along that stormy coast the rocket was seen by hundreds who knew well what the signal meant and many of whom no doubt offered up prayer to god for those who were in danger  most of them however felt that they could do nothing in the way of affording aid  our friend bax and his companions were not of this mind as we have seen  some of the stouthearted boatmen of deal also thought that something might be done and launched their luggers but were in some cases obliged to desist owing to the everincreasing fury of the storm  the rockets were seen also by another party of seamen who stood grouped under the lee of a boathouse far away to the southward  this was the crew of a small lifeboat which stood ready to be launched  the boat was quickly run out of its house by command of its coxswain and the crew hastily equipped themselves for their dangerous work  they put on lifejackets made of a number of pieces of cork sewed on canvas in such a way as to cover their bodies from shoulder to waist without interfering with the play of the arms  some of the men objected to put these on at first feeling afraid lest their courage should be called in question in consequence of their using a contrivance which was not in such general use at that time as it is now  their objections were overcome however except in the case of one young man who exclaimed no no none o yer floats for me  when my time comes i must go and them things wont save me  the poor man did not see that the same argument if correct would have justified his going off in a coble instead of a lifeboat  the want of perception on this point and false pride cost him his life  several young women wives of some of the men had assembled there to dissuade their husbands from going out on such a terrible night  these were so alarmed at the terrific thunder of the surf on the shores of the little bay and the howling of the wind that they clung to the men and entreated them with tears not to venture  is it a matter of wonder that these bold fellows who could not be appalled by the storm found it difficult to resist the power of womans tears  they wavered for a few seconds but when the coxswain who was a cool intrepid old manofwars man cried in a hearty voice now then lads look alive shove off and jump in every man sprang to his post and the lifeboat was afloat in an instant  through some mismanagement however she turned broadside to the sea was overturned instantly and rolled over on the beach  the women shrieked the men on shore ran to the rescue and fortunately saved every man with the exception of the one who had refused to put on the lifejacket and who being less able to support himself than his companions when washed back into deep water by each retiring wave became at length exhausted and ceased to struggle for life  when he was at last laid hold of and dragged ashore he was dead  while some of the men were engaged in fruitless efforts to save this man the rest of the crew having suffered little were about to launch the boat a second time when the women again rushed forward and clung to them with such eager entreaties that they began at last to entertain the idea of the storm being too wild for them to venture off  lest the reader should unjustly censure these men we must remind him of the fact that the selfrighting principle not having at that time been discovered the danger incurred in case of an upset was very great and the boat about which we are writing being small ran considerable risk of being capsized by the heavy seas  in fact almost the only difference between lifeboats and ordinary boats at this time was the incapacity of the former to sink when filled with water owing to the buoyancy of the airchambers fitted round their sides  if filled by a sea much valuable time had to be lost in baling out the water before the oars could be effectively resumed and if overturned it was a matter of the greatest difficulty for the men in the water to right them again in some cases it had proved impossible  all these defects are remedied nowadays but more on this head hereafter  while the men were in this undecided state of mind regardless alike of the commands and the taunts of the coxswain two men were seen to leap down the slope that lay between the cliffs and the sea and make for the group of boatmen at full speed  as they drew near they were recognised to be mr hamilton a young midshipman then on leave of absence and his friend thompson an old college companion  they ran straight to the boat the former shouting as he came up  ho get her off lads a large ship ashore in saint margarets bay now then all together and with a will  so powerful was the influence of the young middys clear voice and prompt action that the men with one accord shoved the lifeboat into the sea succeeded in keeping her stern to the waves until they were beyond the roughest of the breakers and then laying to their oars manfully pulled away for the scene of the wreck  they were soon lost in darkness and the poor women returned weeping to their homes there to throw on some additional covering and hasten towards the same spot by land    chapter thirteen  saving the passengers and crewour heroes distinguish themselves  when bax and his party arrived at saint margarets bay the scene of wreck and death had already begun  the vessel was just discernible in the midst of the turmoil of warring elements that filled the dark air with misty spray  a boat had tried to reach the shore with a number of passengerschiefly menin her  her fate was quickly sealed  a huge breaker upset her and six of the dead bodies of her crew had already been plucked from the sea and laid on the shingle  the rest were being hurled on the land and swept back by the force of the returning waves until the people assembled there caught and dragged them also beyond their reach  messengers had already been sent to the nearest lifeboat stations and the people who remained behind were either occupied in attempting to recover the bodies of the drowned as above described or in suggesting impossible plans for conveying a line on board the illfated vessel  ha here comes the man asll tell us wots to be done and do it too cried one of the boatmen wot say bax can we git a line off think ee  bax stood on the edge of the roaring sea silent and motionless with his arms crossed on his broad chest and his bold gaze directed to the wreck  no said he after standing a few moments thus it cant be done  no mortal man could cross the surf on the inner rocks but theres a point o rocks not far to the norard does any one know how far the tide may cover em just now  about half answered several voices eagerly  ay sot does observed a coastguardman but with sich a surf beatin on em there aint a rock on the whole pint above water this minute  come lets go see cried bax snatching a coil of light rope from the hand of a man who stood close by and hastening away with it in the direction of the rocky point referred to  in a few seconds he stood on its outer extremity with guy foster coleman and a few of the more courageous men at his side  the point on which bax stood was indeed a position of great danger besides being whelmed in driving spray so that it was a matter of extreme difficulty to see more than a few yards in any direction the waves at times rushed up to and over them with such violence as to reach the knees of those who stood there and threatened to wash them off nevertheless from this point bax thought it possible that the end of the line might be conveyed on board the trident which could be seen looming high and black in the murky air lifting and falling with a heavy crash as each successive billow broke under and over her carrying on with irresistible violence the work of destruction  both chains had given way and she was now rolling a helpless wreck on the rocks  dye mean to try it said guy anxiously as he observed his friend fastening the line round his waist  hold the end of it guy and pay out said bax mind you dont haul in unless youre sure im goin down  with this caution bax plunged into the surf and struck out for the wreck having previously placed an open claspknife between his teeth  a cheer broke from the nearest group on the rocks when they witnessed this bold act  it was taken up and reechoed by those farther up the beach who knew that some hopeful effort was being made although they were unable to perceive the precise nature of it  the people on the wreck also heard the cheer and looked eagerly landward  but to them all was shrouded in darkness  even guy quickly lost sight of his friend and was only made aware of his safety and onward progress by the continued running out of the line  suddenly it stopped  hes aboard cried coleman  he would jerk on it if he was said guy with a doubtful shake of the head  hes sunk cried one of those who stood by and held the slack of the rope  a panic seemed to seize the others who stood by  haul im in cried one  look alive shouted another hes a gone man  before guy could interfere they acted on the impulse and drew in two or three fathoms  twisting his left arm suddenly round the rope guy planted his foot on a rock and stopped it at the same time he raised his right hand and threatened to fell the man nearest to him  the result was that the men desisted from hauling but when the rope was again felt it became evident that there was no weight at the farther end of it  guys heart sank with horror as the empty line was drawn in  for a moment he felt all the agony of despair but a gleam of hope rushed in upon him on observing that the end of the rope was cut as if with a sharp knife not by the edge of a rock  animated by this hope he hastened back to the beach in quest of another line resolved himself to attempt to carry it to the wreck  guy was right in his conjecture that bax had cut the rope  on nearing the ship the latter had come unexpectedly on a large rock under the lee of which he paused to recover breath before making the last gallant struggle towards the wreck  it was this pause that caused the alarm of those on shore  when bax felt himself dragged violently back to the land he at once divined the cause and knowing that there was no other resource he seized the claspknife and cut the rope  a few minutes later he swam under the lee of the wreck and catching hold of the rigging of the foremast which had gone by the board when the ship struck he clambered up the side and soon stood on the quarterdeck  the hope raised among the passengers by the sudden appearance of the gigantic stranger in the midst of them was quickly dispelled when he told them how he had failed in the main object of his effort  but it revived somewhat when they observed the active and energetic way in which bax set about preparations for returning to the shore with a line from the ship  his first act was to ask for a bluelight which after a few minutes was produced  this he set fire to and springing into the main rigging held it aloft and sent a bright glare for a few minutes far and wide over the scene  the effect of this was twofold  it revealed to the shipwrecked people the dangers by which they were surrounded and the active efforts that were being made by land and water for their deliverance  on shore they saw crowds of men and women surrounding an instrument which bax after giving vent to a hopeful cheer explained was a rocket apparatus scarcely had they learned this when bax shouted and waved his hand seaward  on turning their eyes in that direction they beheld a lifeboat bearing down towards them her whitepainted sides gleaming like the wings of an angel of light in the midst of the dark tempest  the lifeboat was also seen by the people on shore and guy who at once recognised the figure and the vigour of his friend with the bluelight lent able assistance to those who managed the rocket  dennetts rocket apparatus which was being placed in position on the rocks is an invention by which many human lives are saved on our coasts every year  like manbys mortar apparatus it is simple in its action and most effective in operation  the grand difficulty in the case of a wreck near shore is to establish a communication by means of a rope between the wreck and the land and this difficulty is of course much increased when the wreck occurs off a coast lined with rocks or steep cliffs  to swim off from the shore to the wreck or vice versa is in most cases an absolute impossibility  the rocket apparatus has been devised for the purpose of overcoming this difficulty  by means of it a light line as it is called or rope the thickness of the point of ones little finger can be thrown over a wreck lying at a distance of several hundred yards from the beach  this line when caught is the means by which many a life has been saved from the devouring sea  the modus operandi will be seen in the sequel  the apparatus consists of five parts the rocket the stand the line the whip and the hawser  the rocket is a strong metal cylinder of about eighteen inches in length and more than two in diameter  when about to be used a long stick is attached to it and the principle on which it acts is precisely similar to that of the small rockets used in our pyrotechnic displays  the stand is a tripod supporting a rest for the rocket  the line which is made of the best material is coiled in a large box in a zigzag manner on a number of pegs these pegs when withdrawn in a mass by removing the bottom of the box to which they are attached leave the line loose and free to fly out with the utmost rapidity  the end of the line is fastened to the head of the rocket  any one who has stood near an ordinary rocket when it was being fired can form some conception of the force and furor with which this iron monster springs into the air and dashes out to sea in the teeth of the wildest storm  so tremendous is the gush of fire and smoke that it has to be let off by means of a lock the trigger of which is pulled by a man standing some yards distant with a cord attached to it in his hand  before the rocket was quite ready for action the lifeboat had approached the wreck a hundred yards or so to windward of her  here they cast anchor in such a position that by paying out cable they could veer down towards her slowly and endeavour to range up under her lee every different operation the lifeboat had to perform was fraught with extreme danger  the mere being overwhelmed by the furious sea and filled was comparatively a trifling risk  this it had been twice already and but for the time lost in bailing out it would have been much earlier on the scene  while paying out cable there was the fear of the rope breaking or the anchor dragging then on nearing the wreck there was the risk of being dashed to pieces on the rocks and after getting under her lee the surging of the waves kept them constantly on the verge of being hurled against the rigging  the wreck of the foremast too which still lay rolling alongside was a source of constant anxiety and the rolling of the ship itself rendered it probable that one or both of the remaining masts would give way and fall over the side in which case the destruction of the boat would be almost inevitable  add to this the intense darkness the terrible uproar of wind and water and the difficulty of acting effectively in a boat that pitched and swooped wildly on the broken seas like the plungings of a fiery chargerand some faint idea may be formed of the horrors as well as the dangers of the lifeboat service  gradually but surely the boat dropped nearer and nearer to the doomed ship under the guidance of her able coxswain  as it passed under the stern a cheer burst from the crowd of eager faces that gazed over the side of the trident  yet there were many hearts there that grew faint and chill when they beheld the little white speck that seemed to be their only hope of rescue in that dark hour  what hope was there that such a nutshell should save them all they thought perchance on seeing it approach  they little knew the wonderful vitality of a lifeboat  just as it passed under the quarter a sea swept it right up into the mizzenchains  the utmost efforts of the crew to fend off were unavailing  as the billow rolled on the boat dropt swiftly scraping against the ships side as it fell into the trough of the sea and escaping an upset almost by a miracle  throw a line aboard shouted bax who stood on the lee bulwarks high above the crowd holding on by the mizzenshrouds  the middy caught up the instrument used for this purpose and threw a line on board at once  this steadied the boat a little and watching their opportunity they succeeded in lowering three women and a child into it by means of a bowline  in this way one by one the females and children were placed in the boat until it was full  then there was a cry to shove off and a rush was made by the more timid and ignorant among the passengers who thought they were about to be forsaken  bax had foreseen this  he and several of the sailors met and checked the crowd and before any mischief could be done the boat was away  it made straight for the shore where hundreds of stout arms were ready to seize it  the midshipman stood on the bow with a rope in his hand the sea through which they rushed was milk white with foam  to prevent the boat broachingto and being rolled over on the beach was now the main effort of the coxswain  on they went steadily  a wave broke under them carried them on its boiling crest with lightning speed and launched them with a roar like thunder on the shingle  the rope was thrown before they touched  it was seized and manned and before the retiring wave could suck them back the lifeboat with her living freight was run high upon the beach  she was soon emptied and relaunched for there was no time to waste many lives were still in danger and the trident could not be expected to hold together long  it was just as the boat quitted the side of the wreck as above described that the rocket was got in readiness to act  stand by to fire said the coastguardman who had been engaged for some minutes in adjusting it carefully  keep back clear out o the road cried several of the seamen as they pushed back the more curious among the crowd  there was a flash a mighty burst of flame and smoke as the rocket trembled for an instant on its stand then with an impulse that seemed irresistible and a hissing shriek that rose above the storm it sprang into the air and described a bright curved line of light against the black sky  its own wild blaze served to show that it had been well aimed and that the line had fallen across the wreck  this was all that could be done by the people on shore until those on the wreck had performed their part of the work  but while they stood anxiously awaiting the result they had no cause to fear that the ignorance of those whom they sought to rescue would render their efforts useless as has unfortunately been the case more than once for it was known now that bax was on board  the ignorance of some seamen as to what should be done with the line when it is caught has been the cause of loss of life several times  on one occasion five men the crew of a small vessel being ignorant on this point tied the rocketline round them and leaped together into the sea  of course those on shore could do nothing but haul them to land as quickly as possible when they had done so all were found to be drowned except one  on the present occasion bax seized the line as soon as it fell on the wreck and began to haul it inboard  guy had attached to it a pulley or block with a stoutish rope rove through it and soon those on shore had the satisfaction of seeing this second and double line named the whip hauled out by the people on the wreck  after a time it ceased to run out and then they knew that bax had got hold of the pulley and would quickly attach it to the ship  this was soon done  bax fastened the pulley to the mainmast and then caused a lantern to be shown for a moment to indicate that all was ready  still those on shore delayed to act for a minute in order to make quite sure that ample time had been allowed for the fastening of the pulley and now the allimportant operation of conveying a thick hawser to the wreck was begun  with the tackle already fast to the ship this was comparatively easy  the whip being rove through a pulley both ends were kept on shore and fastened together  it thus became a sort of endless rope by which things could be passed to the wreck and back again  even without any hawser at all many lives might have been saved by this rope but being small it was liable to get broken therefore the end of the thick hawser was sent out and received by bax who bound it also securely to the mainmast close to the pulley about fifteen feet above the deck  the reader will understand that two ropes were now fastened to the mainmast of the trident their other ends being fixed to a heavy anchor buried in the sand on shore  one of these ropes was the thick hawser the other the whip but as this whip was an endless or revolving rope as has been explained to an onlooker it appeared that there were three ropes stretched between the vessel and the shore two of them thin and one thick  these preliminary arrangements having been made much more rapidly than the description of them might lead one to suppose the purpose for which they had been fixed soon began to be carried out  just as the lifeboat arrived with its first cargo of passengers a large block or pulley was run out along the hawser by means of the whip having attached to it a circular lifebuoy with a canvas bag hanging from it  this was the contrivance into which one individual at a time was placed and drawn ashore  two holes in the bag allowed the legs of the occupant to hang down and as the belt reached almost up to the neck there was not much chance of his being tossed out of it  it was in order to prevent this however that bax had fastened the end of the hawser high on the mainmast so that the travelling bag was raised sufficiently above the water except when it neared the shore  then indeed it was frequently immersed in the towering waves but then too it was so near the land that a few seconds sufficed to draw it beyond the reach of the sea see note 1  for two hours did these men of the coast toil in this arduous labour of love  more than a hundred persons had been saved but nearly a hundred still remained on board the wreck  the storm was now at its height and the vessel rolled over on her bilge so violently that the lifeboat was more than once on the point of being crushed under her massive sides  on her last trip she came close up under the quarter as on former occasions but before any one could be taken off a monstrous wave lifted the hull right over the rocks on which she lay and let her fall with fearful violence on a bed of sand in such a position that one of her large timbers snapped across with a report like a cannon shot  the lifeboat got entangled in the wreck and could not get clear  to make matters worse it grounded on a sandbank that rose close to the side of the trident and could not be hauled out of the dangerous position in which it was thus suddenly placed  the topgallant masts of the ship were swaying wildly over it the yards were swinging to and fro threatening each moment to strike it and the ragged sails flapped over it with a noise like thunder  haul off haul off shouted bax who observed the extreme danger in which the boat was placed  the crew attempted to do so but for some minutes were unsuccessful  at last they got into deep water but just as this was accomplished the mainyard struck it on the side and overturned it in an instant  not being constructed on the selfrighting principle the boat remained keel up but the men buoyed up by their lifejackets succeeded in climbing on board the wreck  a cry of despair arose from those still on board the illfated trident when this catastrophe happened  during the next halfhour the rocket apparatus was plied with great success but although most of the women and children were saved by it and by the boat before it was disabled there were still upwards of fifty men on board the wreck  dyou think the ship will hold together long said bax going aft to the captain who clung to the mizzenshrouds superintending the operations of the men  not long i fear he replied  if she had been thoroughly repaired before starting on this voyage she might have weathered the gale but but  but interposed mr clellandthe dark passenger who during the whole of the proceedings which we have narrated had stood calmly beside the captain looking onbut messrs denham crumps and company being penny wise and pound foolish thought that the ships were strong enough for their purpose both ship and cargo being fully covered by insurance  there was a spice of bitterness in this mans tone and manner which displeased bax  he was about to administer a rebuke to him when a larger wave than usual lifted the ship up and let her fall with such force that another of her large timbers broke across like a pipestem and the two remaining masts went by the board sweeping several of the passengers and crew into the sea along with the wreck of spars and cordage  just under the quarter a child fell into the water  it had been wrenched from its mothers arms by the coil of a flying rope  the mother leaped frantically on the bulwarks and would have plunged into the sea had not bax seized her  at that moment mr clelland passed a rope round his waist tied it in that swift and perfect manner peculiar to seamen and sprang into the sea  he seized the child in his arms the captain of the trident had caught the rope as clelland sprang over the side  bax assisted him and in a few minutes both were hauled safely on board  youre better stuff than i gave you credit for said bax as the dark passenger delivered the child to its mother  indeed said mr clelland with a touch of sarcasm in his tone i hope that i may be able to return you the like compliment at a more fitting season  at present there is other work for us to do  come lads we must try to right the lifeboat who will help me  mr clelland sprang into the sea as he spoke and swam towards the boat which still lay under the lee of the wreck with its keel uppermost  bax followed instantly and so did nearly the whole crew of the boat  these latter having on their corkjackets ran comparatively little risk of drowning but they as well as bax and clelland were in danger of being disabled by the rolling spars that surrounded them  with great difficulty they succeeded in turning the boat over but as it was nearly full of water much valuable time was wasted before it could be baled out sufficiently to render it once more serviceable  when this was accomplished they hauled clear of the wreck intending to veer round towards the stern where they could approach the ship with greater safety  the remaining passengers seeing this rushed upon the poop  at that moment the ship was lifted up and hurled with such violence on a sunken rock that her back was broken the sea dashed against her side separating the poop from the fore part of the vessel and turning it completely over so that every soul on board was plunged suddenly into the sea  a wild shriek of despair rose high above the howling of the storm and most of the weaker among the passengers sank in the raging sea to rise no more  but the lifeboat was now in a condition to render effectual aid to those who were strong enough to struggle a few minutes for their lives or to cling to broken portions of the wreck  she was soon as full as she could hold and bax seizing the bow oar forced her head round towards the shore  the coxswain sprang to the helm give way lads was shouted and in a few seconds the boat was once again careering towards the shore on the crest of a towering billow  she took the beach in safety  now then shove off again cried bax when the last of the passengers was assisted out of her  stop cried a coastguardman some of the men are too much knocked up to go off again  this was evident for when the lanterns were held up to the faces of the brave fellows it was seen that several of the less robust among them were deadly pale from sheer exhaustion and fatigue  they indignantly protested however that they were still game for another bout but the coxswain firmly though kindly insisted that the cork belts should be taken off two or three of them and given to the stoutest of at least a dozen volunteers who eagerly stepped forward  the boat was then relaunched and after a careful search and another sharp struggle with the angry sea returned with six saved men and a woman besides several apparently dead bodies which were instantly removed to a neighbouring cottage to be treated according to the rules laid down by the royal humane society for the recovery of those who are apparently drowned  see note 2  after the back of the ship was broken and the wreck overwhelmed the rocket apparatus of course became useless as the mast to which the ropes were attached broke off close to the deck and the ropes themselves became so entangled with the wreck as to be unmanageable but before this catastrophe occurred good service had been done for no fewer than sixty of the passengers of the illfated trident had been saved by this means alone  the lifeboat had been the means of saving one hundred and twenty lives and fifteen men who succeeded in swimming to the beach were rescued with the utmost difficulty by the people on shore  among these last was the captain who with that heroic selfdevotion which seems to be a common characteristic of british seamen had made up his mind to be the last man to quit the ship  this intention was frustrated by the breaking up of the vessel  in the confusion he was swept beyond the reach of the lifeboat and gained the beach he scarce knew how  here he was launched on the shingle by a billow and washed high up on the beach  he grasped the loose pebbles with the energy of despair but the cataract of white water that rushed back as the wave retired swept him with irresistible force into the sea  again this happened and as he dug his fingers into the moving gravel and felt how hopeless was his case a cry of anguish burst from him  the cry was heard by guy foster who with a rope round his waist had been for the last halfhour engaged in rescuing men and women from the fatal grasp of these retiring waves  this way lads fetch the lantern look alive he shouted and sprang towards the part of the shore whence the cry had proceeded followed by a crowd of seamen who had assisted him by holding the rope  guy was much exhausted  six times already had he plunged into the boiling surf and been dragged out with a fellowcreature in his arms he had removed the loop of the rope for a few minutes and now held it in his hand as he ran along the beach looking anxiously at the surf  once again the captain was hurled on the beach but in so exhausted a condition that he could make no effort to save himself  he rolled so near to guys feet that the latter dropped the rope in his haste as he leaped towards the drowning man  he caught him round the waist just as the broken billow began to rush back  for one moment guy stood firm but as the retiring water gathered force his limbs quivered the gravel rolled from beneath his feet and he was swept off his legs  before he was engulfed in the surf and almost before the cry of alarm had burst from his companions on the beach a boy flung the loop of the rope over his shoulders plunged headlong into the sea and catching guy round the neck with both arms held to him like a vice  it was tommy bogey  the men hauled gently on the rope at first fearing to tear the little fellow from his grasp but they need not have been so careful  tommys grip was an uncommonly firm one  in half a minute the three were pulled beyond the reach of the wavesthe captain still breathing guy able to walk though much exhausted and tommy bogey none the worse for his heroic and successful exertions  this was the last incident worthy of note that occurred  of the two hundred and fifty souls who had rejoiced that night in the prospect of a safe and speedy termination to their long voyage fiftyfive were drowned and one hundred and ninetyfive were saved  of these last the fifteen men who swam ashore would have been the sole survivors in all human probability if there had been no lifeboat or rocket apparatus on the coast  for the service thus rendered each man who risked his life that night in the lifeboat received 2 pounds from the royal lifeboat institution others who had assisted in saving life on the beach received rewards proportioned to their services and bax guy and tommy bogey were each awarded the gold medal of the society for the distinguished gallantry displayed and the great risks voluntarily encountered by them on this occasion  it was suggested that denham crumps and company should give something to the men of the lifeboat in acknowledgment of their services but denham crumps and company did not act on the suggestion    note 1  in order to give those of our readers who happen to be interested in this subject a better idea of the manner of using the rocket apparatus we subjoin the instructions given by the board of trade to masters and seamen in regard to it  in the event of your vessel stranding within a short distance of the united kingdom and the lives of the crew being placed in danger assistance will if possible be rendered from the shore in the following manner namely  1  a rocket or shot with a thin line attached will be fired across your vessel  get hold of this line as soon as you can and when you have secured it let one of the crew be separated from the rest and if in the daytime wave his hat or his hand or a flag or handkerchief or if at night let a rocket a blue light or a gun be fired or let a light be shown over the side of the ship and be again concealed as a signal to those on shore  2  when you see one of the men on shore separated from the rest wave a red flag or if at night show a red light and then conceal it you are to haul upon the rocket line until you get a tailed block with an endless fall rove through it  3  make the tail of the block fast to the mast about 15 feet above the deck or if your masts are gone to the highest secure part of the vessel and when the tail block is made fast and the rocket line unbent from the whip let one of the crew separated from the rest make the signal required by article 1 above  4  as soon as the signal is seen on shore a hawser will be bent to the whip line and will be hauled off to the ship by those on shore  5  when the hawser is got on board the crew should at once make it fast to the same part of the ship as the tailed block is made fast to only about 18 inches higher taking care that there are no turns of the whip line round the hawser  6  when the hawser has been made fast on board the signal directed by article 1 above is to be repeated  7  the men on shore will then pull the hawser taut and by means of the whip line will haul off to the ship a sling lifebuoy fitted with petticoat breeches  the person to be hauled ashore is to get into this sling thrusting his legs through the breeches and resting his armpits on the lifebuoy  when he is in and secure one of the crew must be separated from the rest and again signal to the shore as directed in article i above  the people on shore will then haul the person in the sling to the shore and when he has landed will haul back the empty sling to the ship for others  this operation will be repeated to and fro until all persons are hauled ashore from the wrecked vessel  8  it may sometimes happen that the state of the weather and the condition of the ship will not admit of the hawser being set up in which case the sling will be hauled off instead and the persons to be rescued will be hauled in it through the surf instead of along the hawser  masters and crews of wrecked vessels should bear in mind that the success in landing them may in a great measure depend upon their coolness and attention to the rules here laid down and that by attending to them many lives are annually saved by the mortar and rocket apparatus on the coasts of the united kingdom  the system of signalling must be strictly adhered to and all women children passengers and helpless persons should be landed before the crew of the shipboard of trade 22nd december 1859    note 2  it is of immense importance that every man in the kingdom should possess some degree of knowledge on the subject of the restoration of persons apparently drowned for no one can tell at what moment he may be called upon in the absence of medical aid to act in a case of this nature  we therefore make no apology for here giving in full the rules which have been adopted by the national lifeboat institution  they run as follows  i  send immediately for medical assistance blankets and dry clothing but proceed to treat the patient instantly on the spot in the open air with the face downwards whether on shore or afloat exposing the face neck and chest to the wind except in severe weather and removing all tight clothing from the neck and chest especially the braces  the points to be aimed at arefirst and immediately the restoration of breathing and secondly after breathing is restored the promotion of warmth and circulation  the efforts to restore breathing must be commenced immediately and energetically and persevered in for one or two hours or until a medical man has pronounced that life is extinct  efforts to promote warmth and circulation beyond removing the wet clothes and drying the skin must not be made until the first appearance of natural breathing  for if circulation of the blood be induced before breathing has recommenced the restoration to life will be endangered  ii  to restore breathing  to clear the throatplace the patient on the floor or ground with the face downwards and one of the arms under the forehead in which position all fluids will more readily escape by the mouth and the tongue itself will fall forward leaving the entrance into the windpipe free  assist this operation by wiping and cleansing the mouth  if satisfactory breathing commences use the treatment described below to promote warmth  if there be only slight breathing or no breathing or if the breathing fail then  to excite breathingturn the patient well and instantly on the side supporting the head and excite the nostrils with snuff hartshorn and smelling salts or tickle the throat with a feather etcetera if they are at hand  rub the chest and face warm and dash cold water or cold and hot water alternately on them  if there be no success lose not a moment but instantly  to imitate breathingreplace the patient on the face raising and supporting the chest well on a folded coat or other article of dress  turn the body very gently on the side and a little beyond and then briskly on the face back again repeating these measures cautiously efficiently and perseveringly about fifteen times in the minute or once every four or five seconds occasionally varying the side  by placing the patient on the chest the weight of the body forces the air out when turned on the side this pressure is removed and air enters the chest  on each occasion that the body is replaced on the face make uniform but efficient pressure with brisk movement on the back between and below the shoulderblades or bones on each side removing the pressure immediately before turning the body on the side  during the whole of the operations let one person attend solely to the movements of the head and of the arm placed under it  the first measure increases the expiration the second commences inspiration  the result is respiration or natural breathing and if not too late life  whilst the above operations are being proceeded with dry the hands and feet and as soon as dry clothing or blankets can be procured strip the body and cover or gradually reclothe it but taking care not to interfere with the efforts to restore breathing  iii  should these efforts not prove successful in the course of from two to five minutes proceed to imitate breathing by dr silvesters method as follows  place the patient on the back on a flat surface inclined a little upwards from the feet raise and support the head and shoulders on a small firm cushion or folded article of dress placed under the shoulderblades  draw forward the patients tongue and keep it projecting beyond the lips an elastic band over the tongue and under the chin will answer this purpose or a piece of string or tape may be tied round them or by raising the lower jaw the teeth may be made to retain the tongue in that position  remove all tight clothing from about the neck and chest especially the braces  to imitate the movements of breathingstanding at the patients head grasp the arms just above the elbows and draw the arms gently and steadily upwards above the head and keep them stretched upwards for two seconds  by this means air is drawn into the lungs  then turn down the patients arms and press them gently and firmly for two seconds against the sides of the chest  by this means air is pressed out of the lungs  repeat these measures alternately deliberately and perseveringly about fifteen times in a minute until a spontaneous effort to respire is perceived immediately upon which cease to imitate the movements of breathing and proceed to induce circulation and warmth  iv  treatment after natural breathing has been restoredto promote warmth and circulation  commence rubbing the limbs upwards with firm grasping pressure and energy using handkerchiefs flannels etcetera by this measure the blood is propelled along the veins towards the heart  the friction must be continued under the blanket or over the dry clothing  promote the warmth of the body by the application of hot flannels bottles or bladders of hot water heated bricks etcetera to the pit of the stomach the armpits between the thighs and to the soles of the feet  if the patient has been carried to a house after respiration has been restored be careful to let the air play freely about the room  on the restoration of life a teaspoonful of water warm should be given and then if the power of swallowing have returned small quantities of wine warm brandy and water or coffee should be administered  the patient should be kept in bed and a disposition to sleep encouraged  general observations  the above treatment should be persevered in for some hours as it is an erroneous opinion that persons are irrecoverable because life does not soon make its appearance persons having been restored after persevering for many hours  appearances which generally accompany deathbreathing and the hearts action cease entirely the eyelids are generally halfclosed the pupils dilated the jaws clenched the fingers semicontracted the tongue approaches to the under edges of the lips and these as well as the nostrils are covered with a frothy mucus  coldness and pallor of surface increase  cautionsprevent unnecessary crowding of persons round the body especially if in an apartment  avoid rough usage and do not allow the body to remain on the back unless the tongue is secured  under no circumstances hold the body up by the feet  on no account place the body in a warm bath unless under medical direction and even then it should only be employed as a momentary excitement    chapter fourteen  the morning after the storm  on the fifth morning that succeeded the breaking of the storm described in the last chapter the sun rose in gorgeous splendour and shone upon a sea that was clear and burnished like a sheet of glass  the wind had ceased suddenly and a perfect calm prevailed but although no breath of air ruffled the surface of the deep the long swell rose and fell as if the breast of ocean were still throbbing from its recent agitation  all along the east coast of england this swell met the shore in a succession of slowrolling waves which curled majestically over and appeared almost to pause for a moment ere they fell with deep solemn roar in a magnificent burst of foam  everywhere the effects of the storm were painfully evident  wrecks could be counted by the dozen from some of the bold headlands that commanded an extensive view of the shore  the work of destruction was not yet over  the services of our lifeboats could not yet be dispensed with although the fury of the winds had ceased  it is a mistake to suppose that when a gale has ceased all danger to man and destruction to his property is over  we are apt to attribute too much influence to the winds  undoubtedly they are the origin of the evil that befalls us in storms but they are not the immediate cause of the wholesale destruction that takes place annually among the shipping of the kingdom  it is the mighty hydraulic force of the sea the tremendous lifting power of the waves that does it all  although the storm was over and the wind had gone down the swell of the ocean had not yet ceased to act  on many a headland and in many a rocky bay brigs schooners barques and ships of large size and stout frame were that day lifted and battered rent torn riven and split by the sea as if they had been toys their great timbers snapped like pipestems and their iron bars and copper bolts twisted and gnarled as if they had been made of wire  the hardy men of deal were still out in those powerful boats that seem to be capable of bidding defiance to most storms saving property to the nation and earninghardly earningsalvage for themselves  the lifeboats too were outin some cases saving life in others saving property when there were no lives in danger  how inadequate are our conceptions of these things when formed from a written account of one or two incidents even although these be graphically described  how difficult it is to realise the actual scenes that are presented all along the coast during and immediately after each great storm that visits our shores  if we could by the exercise of supernatural power gaze down at these shores as from a birdseye point of view and take them in with all their stirring incidents at one glance if we could see the wrecks large and smallcolliers with their four or five hands emigrant ships with their hundreds of passengersbeating and grinding furiously on rocks that appear to rise out of and sink into a sea of foam if we could witness our lifeboats with their noblehearted crews creeping out of every nook and bay in the very teeth of what seems to be inevitable destruction if we could witness the hundred deeds of individual daring done by men with bronzed faces and rough garments who carry their lives habitually in their hands and think nothing of it if we could behold the flash of the rockets and hear the crack of the mortars and the boom of minute guns from john o groats to the lands end at the dead and dark hours of night when dwellers in our inland districts are abed all ignorant it may be or thoughtless in regard to these things above all if we could hear the shrieks of the perishing the sobs and thanksgivings of the rescued and the wild cheers of the rescuers and hear and see all this at one single glance so that our hearts might be more filled than they are at present with a sense of the terrible dangers of our shores and the heroism of our men of the coast it is probable that our prayers for those who go down to the sea in ships would be more frequent and fervent and our respect for those who risk life and limb to save the shipwrecked would be deeper  it is also probable that we might think it worth our while to contribute more largely than we do to the support of that noble institution whose work it is to place lifeboats where they are wanted on our coasts and to recognise reward and chronicle the deeds of those who distinguish themselves in the great work of saving human life  let us put a question to you good reader  if france or any other firstrate power were to begin the practice of making a sudden descent on us about once a month on an average all the year round slaying some hundreds of our fishermen and seamen each time occasionally cutting off some of our firstclass emigrant ships and killing all on boardmen women and childrenthus filling the land with repeated wails of sorrow with widows and with fatherless children what would you do  whatdo you say that you would fortify every island on the coast plant martello towers on every flat beach crown every height with cannon and station ironclads in every harbour and bay so that the entire coast should bristle with artillery  that sounds well but what guarantee have we that you really would act thus if france were to become so outrageous  common sense might assure me of it you reply  so it might and so it would if we had not evidence to the contrary in the fact that our country is thus assailed month after monthyear after yearby a more inveterate enemy than france ever was or will be and yet how little is done to defend ourselves against his attacks compared with what might be with what ought to be done  this enemy is the storm but like france he is not our natural enemy  we have only chosen in time past to allow him to become so  the storm has been wisely and beneficently ordained by god to purify the worlds atmosphere and to convey health and happiness to every land under heaven  if we will not take the obvious and quite possible precautions that are requisite to secure ourselves from his violence have we not ourselves to blame  there are far too few harbours of refuge on our exposed coasts the consequence is that our fishingboats are caught by the storm and wrecked and not unfrequently as many as a hundred lives are lost in a few hours who is to blame  a large vessel goes on the rocks because there is no lighthouse there to give warning of danger a post has been neglected and the enemy has crept in who neglected that post  after the ship has got on the rocks it is made known to the horrified passengers that there are no ships lifeboats aboard neither are there any lifebelts whose blame is that  still there seems hope for the shore is not far off and anxious people line it but no ordinary boat can live in such a sea  there is no rocket apparatus on this part of the coast no mortar apparatus by which a line might be sent on board why not  the nearest lifeboat station is fifteen miles off whose fault is that  is the storm our enemy here  is not selfish calculating miserly man his own enemy in this case  so the ship goes to pieces and the result is that the loss of this single vessel makes 60 widows and 150 fatherless children in one night not to speak of thousands of pounds worth of property lost to the nation  if you doubt this reader consult the pages of the lifeboat journal in which you will find facts related in a grave succinct unimpassioned way that ought to make your hair stand on end  thoughts strongly resembling those recorded in the last few pages filled the mind and the heart of bax as he stood on that calm bright morning on the seashore  it was a somewhat lonely spot at the foot of tall cliffs not far from which the shattered hull of a small brig lay jammed between two rocks  tommy bogey stood beside him and both man and boy gazed long and silently at the wrack which lined the shore  every nook every crevice and creek at the foot of the cliff was filled choke full of broken planks and spars all smashed up into pieces so small that with the exception of the stump of a mainmast and the heel of a bowsprit there was not a morsel that exceeded three feet in length and all laid side by side in such regular order by the swashing of the sea in and out of the narrower creeks that it seemed as if they had been piled there by the hand of man  they gazed silently because they had just come upon a sight which filled their hearts with sadness  close beside a large rock lay the form of an old whitehaired man with his head resting on a mass of seaweed as if he were asleep  beside him lay a little girl whose head rested on the old mans breast while her long golden hair lay in wild confusion over his face  the countenances of both were deadly pale and their lips blue  it required no doctors skill to tell that both were dead  ahs me  tommy tis a sad sight said bax  tommy made no reply for a few seconds but after an ineffectual effort to command himself he burst into tears  if we had only been here last night he sobbed at length we might have saved them  so we might so we might tommy who knows  some one should have been here anyhow  it seems to me that things aint well managed in these days  they havent half enough of appliances to save life thats a fact  bax said this somewhat sternly  whose fault is it bax said tommy looking up in his friends face  ha tommy replied the other with a smile it dont become the like o you or me to say whos to blame  youre too young to understand the outs and ins o such matters and im too ignorant  the boy smiled incredulously  the idea of bax being ignorant was too gross and absurd to be entertained for a moment even although stated by himself  well but urged tommy stoutly if things are wrong its clear that they aint right and surely ive a right to say so  true lad true returned bax with an approving nod thats just the point which id like you and me to stick to when we see things to be wrong dont lets shirk sayin so as flat as we can but dont let us go like too many shallowpates and say that we know whos wrong and why theyre wrong and offer to put them all right on the shortest notice  mayhap here bax spoke in a soft meditative tone as if he had forgotten his young friend and were only thinking aloud mayhap we may come to understand the matter one of these days and have a better right to speak outwho knows  that im certain of cried tommy in a tone and with an air that made bax smile despite the sad sight before him  come lad he said with sudden energy we must get em removed away and fetch a couple of men  ill arrange them  tommy was off in a moment and bax proceeded with gentle care to arrange the dress and limbs of the old man and the child  two men soon arrived and assisted to carry them away  who they were no one knew and few cared  they were only two of the many who are thus cast annually and by no means unavoidably on our stormy shores  do not misunderstand us good reader  compared with what is done by other lands in this matter britain does her duty well but compared with what is required by god at the hands of those who call themselves christians we still fall far short of our duty both as a nation and as individuals    chapter fifteen  relates to love cross purposes and mistakes etcetera  storms may rage orphans and widows may weep but the world must not pause in its regular routine of business and of pleasure  this is natural and right  it was not intended that men should walk perpetually in sackcloth and ashes because of the sorrows that surround them  but equally true is it that they were never meant to shut their eyes and ears to those woes and dance and sing through life heedlessly as far too many do until some thunderbolt falls on their own hearts and brings the truth home  the command is twofold weep with those that weep and rejoice with those that do rejoice  come then reader let us visit good mrs foster and rejoice with her as she sits at her teatable contemplating her gallant son with a mothers pride  she has some reason to be proud of him  guy has just received the gold medal awarded him by the lifeboat institution  bax and tommy have also received their medals and all three are taking tea with the widow on the occasion  lucy burton and amy russell are there too but both of these young ladies are naturally much more taken up with tommys medal than with those of guy or of bax  and well they may be for never a breast large or small was more worthy of the decoration it supported  my brave boy said the widow referring to tommy and taking him by the arm as he sat beside her but looking irresistibly at her son it was a noble deed  if i had the giving of medals i would have made yours twice the size with a diamond in the middle of it  what a capital idea said lucy with a silvery laugh that obliged her to display a double row of brilliant little teeth  a coral ring set with pearls would be finer dont you think said guy gravely  tommy grinned and said that that was a toothy remark  lucy blushed and said laughingly that she thought mrs fosters idea better whereupon the widow waxed vainglorious and tried to suggest some improvements  guy fearing that he had been presumptuous in paying this sly compliment anxiously sought to make amends by directing most of his conversation to amy  bax who was unusually quiet that evening was thus left to make himself agreeable to lucy  but he found it hard work poor fellow  it was quite evident that he was ill at ease  on most occasions although habitually grave bax was hearty and had always plenty to say without being obtrusive in his conversation moreover his manners were good and his deportment unconstrained and easy  but when he visited the widows cottage he became awkward and diffident and seemed to feel great difficulty in carrying on conversation  during the short time he had been at deal since the wreck of the nancy he had been up at the cottage every day on one errand or another and generally met the young ladies either in the house or in the garden  could it be that bax was in love  there was no doubt whatever of the fact in his own mind but strange to say no one else suspected it his character was grave simple and straightforward  he did not assume any of those peculiar airs by which young men make donkeys of themselves when in this condition  he feared too that it might be interfering with the hopes of his friend guy whose affections he had latterly been led to suspect lay in the same direction with his own  this made him very circumspect and modest in his behaviour  had he been quite sure of the state of guys heart he would have retired at once for it never occurred to him for a moment to imagine that the girl whom guy loved might not love guy and might possibly love himself  be this as it may bax resolved to watch his friend that night closely and act according to the indications given  little did poor guy know what a momentous hour that was in the life of his friend and the importance of the part he was then performing  bax rose to go sooner than usual  you are very kind maam he said in reply to mrs fosters remonstrances i have to visit an old friend tonight and as it is probable i may never see him again i trust youll excuse my going so early  mrs foster was obliged to acquiesce  bax shook hands hurriedly but very earnestly with each of the party and quitted the cottage in company with guy  come guy let us walk over the sandhills  a strange walk on so dark a night dont you think it would be more cheerful on the beach  so it would so it would said bax somewhat hastily but i want to be alone with you and were likely to meet some of our chums on the beach  besides i want to have a quiet talk and to tell ye somethingyoure in love guy  bax said this so abruptly that his friend started and for a few seconds was silent  then with a laugh he replied  well bax youve a blunt way of broaching a subject but now that you put the thing to me i feel inclined to believe that i am  youre a sharper fellow than i gave you credit for to have found me out so soon  it needs but little sharpness to guess that when two young folk are thrown much together and find each other agreeable theyre likely to fall in love  baxs voice sank to its deepest tones he felt that his hopes had now received their deathblow and in spite of himself he faltered  with a mighty effort he crushed down the feeling and continued in a tone of forced gaiety  come im rejoiced at your good luck my boy shes one of a thousand guy  so she is said guy but im not so sure of my good luck as you seem to be for i have not yet ventured to speak to her on the subject of love  no exclaimed bax in surprise thats strange  why so said guy  because youve had lots of time and opportunity lad  true said guy i have had enough of both but some folk are not so bold and prompt as others in this curious matter of love  ah very true observed bax some men do take more time than others and yet it seems to me that there has been time enough for a sharp fellow like you to have settled that question  however ive no doubt myself of the fact that she loves you guy and i do call that uncommon good luck  well it may seem a vain thing to say but i do fancy that she likes me a bit said the other in a half jocular tone  the two friends refrained from mentioning the name of the fair one  the heart and mind of each was filled with one object but each felt a strange disinclination to mention her name  but it seems to me continued guy that instead of wanting to tell me something as you said when you brought me out for a walk in this dreary waste of furze and sand at such a time of night your real object was to pump me  not so replied bax in a tone so deep and sad as to surprise his friend i brought you here because the lonely place accords with my feelings tonight  i have made up my mind to go to australia  guy stopped abruptly  you jest bax said he  i am in earnest replied the other and since i have forced myself into your confidence i think it but fair to give you mine  the cause of my going is love  yes guy i too am in love but alas my love is not returned it is hopeless  say not so began guy earnestly but his companion went on without noticing the interruption  the case is a peculiar one said he  i have known the sweet girl long enough to know that she does not love me and that she does love another man  moreover i love that man too  he is my friend so the long and the short of it is im going to upanchor away to the goldfields and leave the coast clear to him  this must not be bax you may be wrong in supposing your case hopeless  may i ask her name  forgive me guy i must not mention it said bax  it is not necessary to weary the reader with the variety of arguments with which guy plied his friend in order to turn him from his purpose as they wandered slowly over the sandhills together  he was unsuccessful in his efforts to arouse hope in the bosom of his friend or to induce him to suspend his determination for a time  nor was he more fortunate in attempting to make bax say who was the friendfor whom he was about to make so great a sacrificelittle suspecting that it was himself  now said bax after having firmly resisted his companions utmost efforts i want you to leave me here alone  i may seem to you to be obstinate and ungracious tonight he stopped and seized guys hand but believe me i am not so  my heart is terribly down and you know im a rough matteroffact fellow not given to be sentimental so i cant speak to you as i would wish on this subject but wherever i may go in this world i will never cease to pray for gods blessing on you and yours guy  i like to hear you say that bax returned the other it will rejoice my heart to think that love for me will be the means of taking you often to the throne of god  youre a good fellow guy perhaps what you have often said to me has not been thrown away as much as you suppose  come now instead of you having to urge the subject on me ill ask you to give me a text supposing that you and i were parting tonight for the last time and that i were going off to australia tomorrow what would you say to me in the way of advice and encouragement  guy paused thoughtfully for a moment and then said delight thyself in the lord trust also in him and he will give thee the desires of thine heart  thank ee lad ill not forget the words said bax wringing his friends hand  perhaps ill think of another and more suitable text when the time for parting really comes said guy sadly  goodnight bax mind you come up to the cottage tomorrow and let me know your plans  i shall be busy tomorrow but ill write said bax as his friend left him  ay he added there goes a real christian and a truehearted friend  ahs me  ill never see him more  bax wandered slowly and without aim over the dark waste for some time almost unintentionally he followed the path that led past the checkers of the hope  a solitary light burned in one of the lower windows of the old inn but no sound of revelry issued from its doors  leaving it behind him bax soon found himself standing within a few yards of the tombstone of the illfated mary whose name he bore  poor thing twas a sad fate he murmured as he contemplated the grave of the murdered girl who had been a cousin of his own grandfather  poor mary youre at rest now which is more than i am  for some minutes bax stood gazing dreamily at the grave which was barely visible in the faint light afforded by a few stars that shone through the cloudy sky  suddenly he started and every fibre of his strong frame was shaken with horror as he beheld the surface of the grave move and saw or fancied he saw a dim figure raise itself partially from the earth  bax was no coward in any sense of that word  many brave men there are who although quite fearless in regard to danger and death are the most arrant cowards in the matter of superstition and could be made to flee before a mere fancy  but our hero was not one of these  his mind was strong like his body and well balanced  he stood his ground and prepared to face the matter out  he would indeed have been more than human if such an unexpected sight in such circumstances had failed to horrify him but the effect of the shock soon passed away  who comes here to disturb me said a weak voice that evidently belonged to this ghost  hallo  jeph is that you exclaimed bax springing forward and gazing into the old mans face  ay its me and im sorry youve found me out for i like to be let alone in my grief  why jeph you dont need to be testy with your friend  ill quit ye this moment if you bid me but i think you might find a warmer and more fitting bed for your old bones than poor mary baxs grave  come let me help you up  bax said this so kindly that old jephs temporary anger at having been discovered passed away  well well said he the only two people who have found me out are the two i like best so it dont much matter  indeed exclaimed the young man in surprise who is number two jeph  tommy bogey  he found me here on the night when long orrick was chased by supple jim  strange he never told me about it said bax  cause i told him to hold his tongue replied jeph and tommys a good fellow and knows how to shut his mouth wen a friend asks him to as i now ask you bax for i dont want people know that i come here every night  what do you come here every night cried bax in surprise  ay every night fair weather and foul ive been used to both for a long time now and im too tough to be easily damaged  but why do you this jeph  you are not mad  if you were i could understand it  no matter no matter said the old man turning to gaze at the tombstone before quitting the place  some people are fond of having secrets  ive got one and i like to keep it  well i wont try to pump it out of you my old friend  moreover i havent got too much time to spare  i meant to go straight to your house tonight jeph to tell you that im off to australia tomorrow by peep o day  australia exclaimed jeph with a perplexed look in his old face  ay the blue peters at the masthead and the anchor tripped  here bax related to his old comrade what he had previously told to guy at first jeph shook his head but when the young sailor spoke of love being the cause of his sudden departure he made him sit down on the grave and listened earnestly  so so bax he said when the latter had concluded youre quite sure shes fond o the other feller are ye  quite  i had it from his own lips  at least he told me hes fond of her and i could see with my own eyes shes fond of him  poor lad said jeph patting his friends shoulder as if he had been a child youre quite right to go  i know what love is  youll never get cured in this country mayhap foreign airll do it  i refused to tell you what made me come out here lad but now that i knows how the wind blows with you i dont mind if i let ye into my secret  love ay its the old story love has brought me here night after night since ever i was a boy  love exclaimed his companion love of whom  why who should it be but the love o the dear girl as lies under this sod said the old man putting his hand affectionately on the grave ay you may well look at me in wonderment but i wasnt always the wrinkled old man i am now  i was a goodlookin lad once though i dont look like it now  when poor mary was murdered i was nineteen  i wont tell ye how i loved that dear girl  ye couldnt understand me when she was murdered by thathe paused abruptly for a moment and then resumedwhen she was murdered i thought i should have gone mad i was mad i believe for a time but when i came back here to stay after wanderin in foreign parts for many years i took to comin to the grave at nights  at first i got no good  i thought my heart would burst altogether but at last the lord sent peace into my soul  i began to think of her as an angel in heaven and now the sweetest hours of my life are spent on this grave  poor mary  she was gentle and kind especially to the poor and the afflicted  she took a great interest in the ways and means we had for savin people from wrecks and used often to say it was a pity they couldnt get a boat made that would neither upset nor sink in a storm  she had read o some such contrivance somewhere for she was a great reader  ever since that time ive bin trying in my poor way to make something o the sort but ive not managed it yet  i like to think she would have been pleased to see me at it  old jeph stopped at this point and shook his head slowly  then he continued  i find that as long as i keep near this grave my love for mary cant die and i dont want it to  but thats why i think youre right to go abroad  it wont do for a man like you to go moping through life as i have done  mayhap theres some truth in the sayin out o sight out o mind  ahs me said bax isnt it likely that there may be some truth too in the words o the old song absence makes the heart grow fonder but youre right jeph it wouldnt do for me to go moping through life as long as theres work to do  besides old boy theres plenty of this sort o thing to be done and ill do it better now that i dont have anybody in particular to live for  bax said this with reckless gaiety and touched the medal awarded to him by the lifeboat institution which still hung on his breast where it had been fastened that evening by lucy burton  the two friends rose and returned together to jephs cottage where bax meant to remain but a few minutes to leave sundry messages to various friends  he was shaking hands with the old man and bidding him farewell when the door was burst open and tommy bogey rushed into the room  bax seized the boy in his arms and pressed him to his breast  hallo  i say is it murder yere after or dye mistake me for a polar bear cried tommy on being put down wot a hug to be sure  lucky for me that my timbers aint easy stove in  wot dye mean by it  bax laughed and patted tommys head  nothin lad only i feel as if i should ha bin your mother  well i wont say yere far out rejoined the boy waggishly for i do think yere becomin an old wife  but i say what can be wrong with guy foster  he came back to the cottage a short while ago lookin quite glum and shut himself up in his room and he wont say whats wrong so i come down here to look for you for i knew id find ye with old jeph or bluenose  yere too inquisitive said bax drawing tommy towards him and sitting down on a chair so that the boys face might be on a level with his  no doubt guy will explain it to you in the morning  i say tommy i have sometimes wondered whether i could depend on the friendship which you so often profess for me  the boys face flushed and he looked for a moment really hurt  tutts tommy youre gettin thinskinned  i do but jest  well jest or no jest said the boy not half pleased you know very well that nothing could ever make me turn my back on you  are you sure said bax smiling  suppose now that i was to do something very bad to you something unkind or that looked unkind what then  in the first place you couldnt do that and in the second place if you did id like you just as well  ay but suppose continued bax in a jocular strain that what i did was very bad  well lets hear what you call very bad  bax paused as if to consider then he said suppose now that i were to go off suddenly to some far part of the world for many years without so much as saying goodbye to ye what would you think  id find out where you had gone to and follow you and pitch into you when i found you said tommy stoutly  ay but i did not ask what youd do i asked what youd think  why i would think something had happened to prevent you lettin me know but id never think ill of you replied tommy  i believe you boy said bax earnestly  but come enough o this idle talk  i want you to go up to the cottage with a message to guy tell him not to speak to any one tonight or tomorrow about what i said to him when we were walking on the sandhills and be off lad as fast as you can lest he should let it out before you get there  anything to do with smugglers inquired the boy with a knowing look as they stood outside the door  why nno not exactly  well goodnight bax goodnight old jeph  tommy departed and the two men stood alone  god bless the lad  youll be kind to him jeph when im away  trust me bax said the old man grasping his friends hand  without another word bax turned on his heel and his tall stalwart figure was quickly lost to view in the dark shadows of the night    chapter sixteen  tommy bogey forms a mighty resolve and mr denham being perplexed becomes liberal  when tommy bogey discovered the terrible fact that his friend bax had really gone from him perhaps for ever he went straight up to the cottage sat down on the kitchen floor at the feet of mrs laker laid his head on her lap and wept as if his heart would break  my poor boy said the sympathising laker stroking his head and endeavouring to comfort him more by tone and manner than by words  but tommy refused to be comforted  the strongest affection he had ever known was rudely and suddenly crushed  it was hard in bax to have done it so tommy felt though he would not admit it in so many words  so bax himself felt when the first wild rush of sorrow was past and he had leisure to consider the hasty step he had taken while sailing away over the distant sea towards the antipodes  bitterly did he blame himself and repent when repentance was of no avail  tommys grief was deep but not loud  he did not express it with a howling accompaniment  it burst from him in gasping sobs for a time then it subsided into the recesses of his young heart and gnawed there it did not again break bounds but it somewhat changed the boys character  it made him almost a man in thought and action  he experienced that strong emotion which is known to most young hearts at certain periods of early life and which shows itself in the formation of a fixed resolve to take some prompt and mighty step  what that step should be he did not know at first and did not care to know sufficient for him that coming to an unalterable determination of some indefinite sort afforded him great relief  after the first paroxysm was over tommy rose up kissed mrs laker on the cheek bade her goodnight with unwonted decision of manner and went straight to the amphibious hut of his friend bluenose whom he found taking a oneeyed survey of the downs through a telescope from mere force of habit  the captains name was more appropriate that day than it had been for many years  he was looking uncommonly blue indeed  he had just heard of the disappearance of bax for the news soon spread among the men on deal beach  being ignorant of the cause of his friends sudden departure and knowing his deliberate sensible nature the whole subject was involved in a degree of mystery which his philosophy utterly failed to clear up  being a bachelor and never having been in love or met with any striking incidents of a tender nature in his career it did not occur to him that woman could be at the bottom of it  uncle said tommy bax is gone  tommy i knows it was the brief reply and the telescope was shut up with a bang as the seaman sat down on a little chest and stared vacantly in the boys face  why did he do it asked tommy  dun know  who knows  spose he must ha gone mad though it dont seem likely  if it wasnt guy as told me id not believe it  does guy not know why hes gone  apperiently he does but he says hes bound not to tell  hope bax hant bin and done somethin not xactly right  bax do anything not exactly right cried tommy with a look and tone of amazed indignation  right lad youre right said bluenose apologetically  ive no doubt myself he could explain it all quite clear if he wos here for to do so  thats my opinion and ive no doubt either that the first letter he sends home will make all straight an snug depend on it  uncle said tommy i am going to australia  bluenose who had just lighted his pipe looked at the boy through the smoke smiled and said no tommy you aint  uncle repeated tommy i am  i once heard bax say hed rather go there than anywhere else if he was to go abroad so im certain he has gone there and im going to seek for him  wery good my lad said the captain coolly dye go by steamer tonight or by rail tomorrow mornin  praps youd better go by telegraph its quicker im told  you think im jokin uncle but im not as youll very soon find out  so saying tommy rose and left the hut  this was all he said on the subject  he was a strongminded little fellow  he at once assumed the position of an independent man and merely stated his intentions to one or two intimate friends such as bluenose laker and old jeph  as these regarded his statement as the wild fancy of an enthusiastic boy in the first gush of disappointment they treated it with goodnatured raillery  so tommy resolved as he would have himself have expressed it to shut up and keep his own counsel  when guy told lucy burton that the man who had saved her life had gone off thus suddenly she burst into tears but her tears had not flowed long before she asked guy the reason of his strange and abrupt departure  of course guy could not tell  he had been pledged to secrecy as to the cause  when lucy burton went to tell amy russell she did so with a trembling heart  for some time past she had suspected that amy loved bax and not guy as she had at first mistakenly supposed  knowing that if her suspicions were true the news would be terrible indeed to her friend she considerately went to her room and told her privately  amy turned deadly pale stood speechless for a few seconds and then fainted in her friends arms  on recovering she confessed her love but made lucy solemnly pledge herself to secrecy  no one shall ever know of this but yourself dear lucy said amy laying her head on her friends bosom and finding relief in tears    time passed away as time is wont to do and it seemed as if tommy bogey had forgotten to carry out his determination  from that day forward he never referred to it and the few friends to whom he had mentioned it supposed that he had given up the idea altogether as impracticable  they did not know the mettle that tommy was made of  after maturely considering the matter he had made up his mind to delay carrying out his plan until bax should have time to write home and acquaint him with his whereabouts  meanwhile he would set himself to make and save up money by every means in his power for he had sense enough to know that a moneyless traveller must be a helpless creature  peekins was permanently received into sandhill cottage as pageinbuttons in which capacity he presented a miserably attenuated figure but gave great satisfaction  tommy and he continued good friends the former devoting as much of his leisure time to the latter as he could spare  he had not much to spare however for he had among other things set himself energetically to the study of arithmetic and navigation under the united guidance of old jeph and bluenose  lucy burton paid a long visit to mrs foster and roamed over the sandhills day after day with her friend amy until her father the missionary came and claimed her and carried her back to ramsgate during lucys stay guy foster remained at the cottage busily engaged in various ways but especially in making himself agreeable to lucy in which effort he seemed to be very successful  when the latter left he suddenly discovered that he was wasting his time sadly and told his mother that he meant to look out for something to do  with this end in view he set out for london that mighty hive of industry and idleness into which there is a ceaseless flow of men who want something to do and of men who dont know what to do  and what of denham crumps and company during this period  the rats in and around red wharf lane could have told you had they been able to speak that things prospered with that firm  these jovial creatures that revelled so luxuriously in the slime and mud and miscellaneous abominations of that locality could have told you that every morning regularly they were caught rioting in the lane and sent squealing out of it by a boy in blue the successor of poor peekins who opened the office and prepared it for the business of the day that about half an hour later they the rats were again disturbed by the arrival of the headclerk closely followed by the juniors who were almost as closely followed by crumpshe being a timid old man who stood in awe of his senior partner that after this they had a good long period of comparative quiet during which they held a riotous game of hideandseek across the lane and down among sewers and dust holes and delightfully noisome and fetid places of a similar character interrupted at irregular intervals by a vagrant street boy or a daring cat or an inquisitive cur that this game was stopped at about ten oclock by the advent of mr denham who generally gave them the rats a smile of recognition as he passed to his office concluding no doubt by a natural process of ratiocination that they were kindred spirits because they delighted in bad smells and filthy garbage just as he denham rejoiced in thames air and filthy lucre  one fine morning speaking from a rats point of view when the air was so thick and heavy and moist that it was difficult to see more than a few yards in any direction denham came down the lane about halfanhour later than usual with a brisk step and an unusually smiling countenance  peekins successor relieved him of his hat topcoat and umbrella and one of the clerks brought him the letters  before opening these he shouted  mr crumps  crumps came meekly out of his cell as if he had been a bad dog who knew he deserved and expected a whipping  nothing wrong i trust he said anxiously  no on the contrary everything right crumps old face brightened ive succeeded in getting that ship at what i call a real bargain500 less than i had anticipated and was prepared to give  crumps rubbed his hands now i mean to send this ship out to australia with a miscellaneous cargo as soon as she can be got ready for sea  the gold fever is at its height just now and it strikes me that with a little judgment and prudence a good thing may be made out there  at any rate i mean to venture for our speculations last year have as you know turned out well with the exception of that unfortunate trident and we are sufficiently in funds just at this time to afford to run considerable risk  crumps expressed great satisfaction and agreed with all that denham said  he also asked what the name of the new ship was to be  the trident said mr denham  what the name of the ship we lost in saint margarets bay exclaimed crumps in surprise  i thought you knew the name of the ship we lost in saint margarets bay said denham sarcastically  of course of course replied crumps in some confusion but i mean that is dont you think it looks like flying in the face of providence to give it the same name  mr crumps said denham with an air of dignified reproof it is most unnatural most uncalled for to talk of providence in connexion with business  it is a word sir that may be appropriately used on sundays and in churches but not in offices and i beg that you will not again allude to it  there is no such thing sir as providence in business mattersat least such is my opinion and i say this in order that you may understand that any remarks of that kind are quite thrown away on me  i am a plain practical man of business mr crumps once for all allow me to say that i object to the very unbusinesslike remarks of a theological nature which you are sometimes pleased to introduce into our conversations  i again repeat that there is no such thing as providence in businessat all events not in my business  i will not again offend you said poor crumps who stood looking confused and moving his legs uneasily during the delivery of this oration but as you have condescended to argue the matter slightly may i venture to hint that our ships are propelled chiefly by means of sails and that the winds are in the hands of providence  there sir i utterly disagree with you retorted denham the winds are guided in their courses by the fixed laws of nature and cannot be altered or modified by the wishes or powers of man therefore it is quite unnecessary because useless to regard them in matters of business  i am utterly devoid sir of superstition and it is partly in order to make this clear to all with whom i have to do that i intend to name our new ship the trident and to order her to sail on a friday  as mr denham accompanied his last word with an inclination of the head which was equivalent to a dismissal mr crumps sighed and retired to his den  his practical and unsuperstitious partner opened and read the letters  while denham was thus engaged a tap came to the door and old mr summers entered the room  ah  summers glad to see you how are you said denham somewhat heartilyfor him  thank you denham im well replied the benign old gentleman with a smile as he fixed a pair of gold spectacles on his nose and sat down in a most businesslike way to examine a bundle of papers which he pulled out of his coatpocket  mr summers was a very old friend of denham and had been the friend of his father before him but that was not the reason of denhams regard for him  the old gentleman happened to be a merchant in the city with whom denham crumps and company did extensive and advantageous business  this was the cause of denhams unwonted urbanity  he cared little for the old mans friendship  in fact he would have dispensed with it without much regret for he was sometimes pressed to contribute to charities by his philanthropic friend  see i have settled that matter for you satisfactorily said mr summers there are the papers which you can look over at your leisure  thank you mr summers said denham impressively this is indeed very kind of you  but for your interference in this affair i am convinced that i should have lost a thousand pounds if not more  indeed exclaimed the old gentleman with a bright smile come im glad to hear you say so and it makes my second errand all the more easy  and what may your second errand be said denham with a sudden gravity of countenance which showed that he more than suspected it  well the fact is began summers its a little matter of begging that i have undertaken for the purpose of raising funds to establish one or two lifeboats on parts of our coast where they are very much needed denham fidgeted in his chair  you know i have a villa near deal and frequently witness the terrible scenes of shipwreck that are so common and so fatal on that coast  i am sorry to say that my begging expedition has not been attended with so much success as i had anticipated  it is not such agreeable work as one might suppose i assure you one gets so many unexpected rebuffs  did you ever try begging denham  denham said he never had and unless reduced to it by circumstances did not mean to do so  ah continued mr summers if you ever do try youll be surprised to find how difficult it is to screw money out of some people  mr denham thought that that difficulty would not surprise him at all but youll be delighted to find on the other hand what a number of truly liberal souls there are  its quite a treat for instance to meet with a manas i did the other daywho gives his charity in the light of such principles as thesethe lord loveth a cheerful giver it is more blessed to give than to receive he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the lordone who lays aside a certain proportion of his income for charitable purposes and who therefore knowing exactly how much he has to give at any moment gives or refuses as the case may be promptly and with a good grace  ha exclaimed denham whose soul abhorred this sort of talk but whose selfinterest compelled him to listen to it  really pursued mr summers it is quite interesting to study the outs and ins of christian philanthropy  have you ever given much attention to the subject mr denham  of course i mean in a philosophical way  ha ahem well i cannot say that i have except perhaps in my capacity of a poorlaw guardian in this district of the city  indeed i would recommend it to you  it is quite a relief to men of business like you and me who are necessarily swallowed up all day in the matter of making money to have the mind occasionally directed to the consideration of the best methods of getting rid of a little of their superabundance  it would do them a world of goodi can safely say so from experienceto consider such matters  i daresay that you also know something of this from experience  ha ejaculated mr denham who felt himself getting internally warm but was constrained of course from disinterested motives to keep cool and appear amiable  but forgive my taking up so much of your time my dear sir said mr summers rising what shall i put you down for  denham groaned inaudibly and said well ive no objection to give twenty pounds  how much said the old gentleman as though he had heard imperfectly at the same time pulling out a notebook  there was a slight peculiarity in the tone of the question that induced denham to say he would give fifty pounds  ah fifty said summers preparing to write thank you mr denham here he looked up gravely and added the subject however is one which deserves liberal consideration at the hands of society in general especially of ship owners  shall we say a hundred my dear sir  denham was about to plead poverty but recollecting that he had just admitted that his friend had been the means of saving a thousand pounds to the business he said well let it be a hundred with the best grace he could  thank you mr denham a thousand thanks said the old gentleman shaking his friends hand and quitting the room with the active step of a man who had much more business to do that day before dinner  mr denham returned to the perusal of his letters with the feelings of a man who has come by a heavy loss  yet strange to say he comforted himself on his way home that evening with the thought that after all he had done a liberal thing that he had given away a hundred pounds sterling in charity  given it  poor denham he did not know that up to that period he had never given away a single farthing of his wealth in the true spirit of liberalityalthough he had given much in the name of charity    chapter seventeen  dark deeds are done upon the seatommy bogey in great danger  well bluenose hoo dye find yerself today inquired supple rodger one fine morning as the captain sauntered slowly along the beach in front of his hut with his hands deep in the pockets of his pilotcoat  thankee i amongst the middlings  hows yerself  i like myself said rodgers hows old jeph  rather ornary but i dessay hell come all square after a day or two in dock answered the captain i left him shored up in bed with bolsters  so tommys slipped his cable im told said rodgers interrogatively  ay hes off an no mistake  i thought he was jokin for i heard him talk o goin after bax some time past but nothin more come of it till yesterday when he comes to me and bids me good day and then off like a galley after a french smuggler  its o no use tryin to catch him that boyll make his way and have his will somehow whether we let him or no  ay ay said bluenose lighting his pipe with a heavy sigh tommy bogeys gone for good  that was the last that was heard of poor tommy for many a long day on the beach of deal  but as there is no good reason why the readers should be kept in the dark regarding his movements we shall follow him on the rugged path he had selected and leave the men of deal to wonder for a time and talk and then forget him  having waited as long as his patience could hold out and no letter having come from bax tommy at last prepared to carry out his plan  by dint of hard labour among the boats at any odd jobs that people would give him and running messages and making himself generally useful to the numerous strangers who visited that fine and interesting part of the coast he had scraped together a few pounds  by persevering study at nights he had acquired a fair knowledge of figures and a smattering of navigation  thus equipped in mind and purse he went off to seek his fortune  his intention was in the first place to go to london and visit the three jolly tars where he doubted not every possible and conceivable sort of information in regard to shipping could be obtained  there chanced at the time to be a certain small collier lying in the downs awaiting a fair wind to carry her into the port of london  this collier a schooner was named the butterfly perhaps because the owner had a hazy idea that there was some resemblance between an insect flitting about from flower to flower and a vessel sailing from port to port  black as a chimney from keelson to truck she was as like to a butterfly as a ladys hand is to a monkeys paw  the skipper of the butterfly was a friend of bluenose and knew tommy he at once agreed to give him a passage to london and never thought of asking questions  soon after the boy went aboard the wind changed to the southwest the butterfly spread her black wings bore away to the norard and doubled the north foreland where she was becalmed and left to drift with the tide just as night was closing in  im tired jager this was the skippers name ill go below and take a snooze said tommy for ive lots o work before me tomorrow  so tommy went below and fell asleep  the three men who formed the crew of this dingy craft lay down on the deck the night being fine and also fell asleep jager being at the helm  now jager was one of those careless easygoing reckless seamen who by their folly ignorance and intemperance are constantly bringing themselves to the verge of destruction  he sat near the tiller gazing up at the stars dreamily for some time then he looked round the horizon then glanced at the compass and up at the sails which hung idly from the yards after which he began to mutter to himself in low grumbling tones  goin to blow from the norard  ay allers blows the way i dont want it to  driftin to the southward too  if this lasts well drift on the sands  comfrable to think on that is  come jager dont you go for to git into the blues  keep up yer sperits old boy  acting on his own suggestion the skipper rose and went below to a private locker in which he kept a supply of rumhis favourite beverage  he passed tommy bogey on the way  observing that the boy was sleeping soundly he stopped in front of him and gazed long into his face with that particularly stupid expression which is common to men who are always more or less tipsy  sleep away my lad itll do ye good  accompanying this piece of unnecessary advice with a sagacious nod of the head the skipper staggered on and possessed himself of a casebottle about threequarters full of rum with which he returned to the deck and began to drink  while he was thus employed a breeze sprang up from the northeast  ease off the sheets there you lubbers shouted the drunken man as he seized the tiller and looked at the compass  what sleeping again bunks  ill rouse ye i will  with that in a burst of anger he rushed forward and gave one of the sleepers a severe kick in the ribs  bunks rose sulkily and with a terrible imprecation advised the skipper not to try that again to which the skipper retorted that if his orders were not obeyed more sharply he would not only try it again but he would chuck him overboard besides  having applied a ropesend to the shoulders of one of the other sleepers he repeated his orders to ease off the sheets as the wind was fair and staggered back to his place at the helm  why i do believe it is a souwester he muttered to himself attempting in vain to read the compass  it was in reality northeast but jagers intellects were muddled he made it out to be southwest and steered accordingly almost straight before it  the three men who formed the crew of the little vessel were so angry at the treatment they had received that they neither cared nor knew how the ships head lay  a thick mist came down about the same time and veiled the lights which would otherwise have soon revealed the fact that the skipper had made a mistake  why wot on airth ails the compass muttered jager bending forward intently to gaze at the instrument which to his eye seemed to point in all directions at once come ill have another pull at the bbottle to steady me  he grasped the bottle to carry out this intention but in doing so thrust the helm down inadvertently  the schooner came up to the wind at once and as the wind had freshened to a stiff breeze and a great deal of canvas was set she heeled violently over to starboard  the skipper was pitched into the lee scuppers and the casebottle of rum was shivered to atoms before he had time to taste a drop  mind your helm roared bunks savagely  dye want to send us to the bottom  the man sprang to the helm and accompanied his remark with several fierce oaths which need not be repeated but which had the effect of rousing jagers anger to such a pitch that he jumped up and hit the sailor a heavy blow on the face  ill stop your swearin i will he cried preparing to repeat the blow but the man stepped aside and walked forward leaving his commander alone on the quarterdeck  bunks who was a small but active man was a favourite with the other two men who constituted the crew of the butterfly and both of whom were stronglimbed fellows  their anger at seeing him treated thus savagely knew no bounds  they had long been at deadly feud with jager one of them especially a tall dark bigwhiskered man named job had more than once said to his comrades that he would be the death of the skipper yet  bunks usually shook his head when he heard these threats and said it wouldnt pay unless he wanted to dance a hornpipe on nothing which was a delicate reference to being hung  when the two men saw bunks come forward with blood streaming from his mouth they looked at each other and swore a tremendous oath  will ye lend a hand jim sputtered job between his clenched teeth  jim nodded  no no cried bunks interposing but the two men dashed him aside and rushed aft  their purpose whatever it might have been was arrested for a moment by bunks suddenly shouting at the top of his lungs  light on the starboard bow  thats a lie said jager savagely use yer eyes you landlubber  were running straight on the north foreland cried job who with his companion suddenly stopped and gazed round them out ahead in alarm  the north foreland you fool cried the skipper roughly who ever saw the north foreland light on the starboard bow with the ships head due north  i dont believe er head is due north said job stepping up to the binnacle just as tommy bogey aroused by the sudden lurch of the vessel and the angry voices came on deck  out o the way cried jager roughly hitting job such a blow on the head that he sent him reeling against the lee bulwarks  the man on recovering himself uttered a fierce yell and rushing on the skipper seized him by the throat with his left hand and drove his right fist into his face with all his force  jager although a powerful man and when sober more than a match for his antagonist was overborne and driven with great violence against the binnacle which being of inferior quality and ill secured like everything else in the miserable vessel gave way under his weight and the compass was dashed to pieces on the deck  jim ran to assist his comrade and bunks attempted to interfere fortunately tommy bogeys presence of mind did not forsake him  he seized the tiller while the men were fighting furiously and steered away from the light feeling sure that whatever it might be the wisest thing to be done was to steer clear of it  he had not got the schooner quite before the wind when a squall struck her and laid her almost on her beamends  the lurch of the vessel sent the struggling men against the taffrail with great violence  the skippers back was almost broken by the shock for his body met the side of the vessel and the other two were thrown upon him  job took advantage of his opportunity seizing jager by the leg he suddenly lifted him over the iron rail and hurled him into the sea  there was one wild shriek and a heavy plunge and the miserable man sank to rise no more  it is impossible to describe the horror of the poor boy at the helm when he witnessed this coldblooded murder  bold though he was and accustomed to face danger and witness death in some of its most appalling forms he could not withstand the shock of such a scene of violence perpetrated amid the darkness and danger of a stormy night at sea  his first impulse was to run below and get out of sight of the men who had done so foul a deed but reflecting that they might in their passion toss him into the sea also if he were to show his horror he restrained himself and stood calmly at his post  come out o the way younker cried job seizing the helm  tommy shrank from the man as if he feared the contamination of his touch  you young whelp what are ye affeared on eh  he aimed a blow at tommy which the latter smartly avoided  murderer cried the boy rousing himself suddenly you shall swing for this yet  shall i eh  here jim catch hold o the tiller  jim obeyed and job sprang towards tommy but the latter who was lithe and active as a kitten leaped aside and avoided him  for five minutes the furious man rushed wildly about the deck in pursuit of the boy calling on bunks to intercept him but bunks would not stir hand or foot and jim could not quit the helm for the wind had increased to a gale and as there was too much sail set the schooner was flying before it with masts ropes and beams creaking under the strain  do your worst cried tommy during a brief pause youll never catch me  i defy you and will denounce you the moment we got into port  will you then youll never get into port alive yelled job as he leaped down the companion and returned almost instantly with one of the skippers pistols  he levelled it and fired but the unsteady motion of the vessel caused him to miss his aim  he was about to descend for another pistol when the attention of all on board was attracted by a loud roar of surf  breakers ahead roared bunks  this new dangerthe most terrible with perhaps the exception of fire to which a seaman can be exposedcaused all hands to forget the past in the more awful present  the helm was put down the schooner flew up into the wind and sheered close past a mass of leaping roaring foam the sight of which would have caused the stoutest heart to quail  keep her close hauled shouted job who stood on the heel of the bowsprit looking out ahead  dye think its the north foreland asked bunks who stood beside him  i spose it is said job but how it comes to be on our lee bow with the wind as it is beats me out and out  anyhow ill keep her well off the landmayhap run for the coast of norway  theyre not so partikler about inquiries there im told  ill tell ye what it is bunks said tommy who had gone forward and overheard the last observation but could not bring himself to speak to job you may depend on it were out of our course as sure as you stand there the breakers we have just passed are the north end of the goodwin sands  if we carry on as were going now and escape the sands well find ourselves on the coast o france or far down the channel in the morning  thankee for nothin said job with a sneer next time yeve got to give an opinion wait till its axed for an keep well out o the reach o my arm if ye dont want to keep company with the skipper  tommy made no reply to this  he did not even look as if he had heard it but addressing himself to bunks repeated his warning  bunks was disposed to attach some weight to it at first but as the compass was destroyed he had no means of ascertaining the truth of what was said and as job laughed all advice to scorn and had taken command of the vessel he quietly gave in  they soon passed the breakers and went away with the leegunwale dipping in the water right down the channel  feeling relieved from immediate danger the murderer once more attempted to catch tommy but without success  he then went below and soon after came on deck with such a flushed face and wild unsteady gaze that it was evident to his companions he had been at the spirit locker  jim was inclined to rebel now but he felt that job was more than a match for him and bunks besides he was the best seaman of the three  dont ee think wed better closereef the topsl said bunks as job came on deck if youll take the helm jim and me will lay out on the yard  there was truly occasion for anxiety  during the last hour the gale had increased and the masts were almost torn out of the little vessel as she drove before it  to turn her side to the wind would have insured her being thrown on her beamends  heavy seas were constantly breaking over the stern and falling with such weight on the deck that tommy expected to see them stove in and the vessel swamped  in other circumstances the boy would have been first to suggest reefing the sails and first to set the example but he felt that his life depended that night under god on his watchfulness and care  reef topsl cried job looking fiercely at bunks no we shant theres one reef int an thats enough  bunks shuddered for he saw by the glare of the murderers eyes that the evil deed coupled with his deep potations had driven him mad  praps it is said bunks in a submissive voice but it may be as well to close reef cause the weather dont seem like to git better  job turned with a wild laugh to tommy  here boy go aloft and reef topsl dye hear  tommy hesitated  if you dont said job hissing out the words in the extremity of his passion and stopping abruptly as if unable to give utterance to his feelings  well what if i dont asked the boy sternly  why thenha ha hawhy ill do it myself  with another fiendish laugh job sprang into the rigging and was soon out upon the topsailyard busy with the reef points  why hes shakin out the reef cried jim in alarm  ive half a mind to haul on the starboard brace and try to shake the monster into the sea  job soon shook out the reef and descending swiftly by one of the backstays seized the topsailhalyards  come lay hold he cried savagely  but no one would obey so uttering a curse upon his comrades he passed the rope round a stanchion and with his right hand partially hoisted the sail while with his left he hauled in the slack of the rope  the vessel already staggering under much too great a press of canvas now rushed through the water with terrific speed burying her bows in foam at one moment and hurling off clouds of spray at the next as she held on her wild course  job stood on the bowsprit drenched with spray holding with one hand to the forestay and waving the other high above his head cheering and yelling furiously as if he were daring the angry sea to come on and do its worst  jim now unable to speak or act from terror clung to the starboard bulwarks while bunks stood manfully at the helm  tommy held on to the mainmast shrouds and gazed earnestly and anxiously out ahead  thus they flew they knew not whither for several hours that night  towards morning a little before daybreak the gale began to moderate jobs mood had changed  his wild yelling fit had passed away and he now ranged about the decks in moody silence like a chained tiger going down every now and then to drink but never resting for a moment and always showing by his looks that he had his eye on tommy bogey  the poor boy knew this well and watched him intently the whole of that terrible night  bunks who had never once quitted his post began to yawn and suggested to jim that he might take a spell at the helm now when the progress of the schooner was suddenly arrested with a shock so violent that those on board were hurled prostrate on the deck the foretopmast snapped and went over the side carrying the maintopmast and the jibboom along with it and the sea made a clean breach over the stern completely sweeping the deck  job who chanced to have gone down below was hurled against the cabin bulkhead and the glass bottle he held to his lips was shivered to atoms  with his face cut and bleeding he sprang up the companionladder  on the rocks he shouted  on the sand anyhow answered bunks  the boat the boat she wont last ten minutes cried jim  one of the two boats belonging to the butterfly had been washed away by the last wave the other remained in its place  to this the three men rushed and launched it quickly into the water  job was first to get into it  jump in jump in he cried to the others who were prompt enough to obey  tommy bogey stood motionless and silent close to the mainmast  his face was very pale but a stern pursing of the lips and compression of the eyebrows showed that it was not cowardly fear that blanched his cheek  the boy the boy cried bunks as job let go his hold of the schooner  a wild stern laugh from job showed that he had made up his mind to leave tommy to perish  shame cried jim seizing one of the oars pull bunks pull to windard a bit well drop down and save him yet  pull you murderer shouted jim with a burst of anger so sudden and fierce that job was cowed  he sat down and obeyed  the boat was very small and might have been easily pulled by so strong a crew in ordinary circumstances but the strength of wind and sea together was so great that they were in great danger of being swamped and it required their utmost efforts to pull a few yards to windward of the schooner  now then look out cried jim endeavouring to turn the boat  as he said this a wave caught its side and upset it  the men uttered a loud cry a moment later and they were swept against the bow of the butterfly  tommy had sprung to the side caught up a rope and cast it over  bunks did not see it he made a wild grasp at the smooth wet side of the vessel but his hands found nothing to lay hold of and he was carried quickly away to leeward  jim caught the rope but was brought up so suddenly by it that it was torn from his grasp  he also went to leeward and perished  job had caught hold of the cutwater and digging his fingers into the wood held on by main strength for a few minutes  here lay hold o the rope cried tommy whose only desire now was to save the life of the wretched man there dont you feel it  he had rubbed the rope against jobs face in order to let him know it was there but the man seemed to have lost all power to move  he simply maintained his deathgrip until his strength gave way  tommy understood his case and looked quickly round for one of those ringshaped lifebuoys which we are accustomed to see in our passenger steamers tied up so securely that they would in most cases of sudden emergency be utterly useless  but the owners of the butterfly were economists they did not think lifepreserving worth the expenditure of a few shillings so there was no lifebuoy to be found  there was a round cork fender however which the boy seized and flung into the sea just as jobs grasp loosened  he uttered a wild shriek and tossed up his arms imploringly as he was carried away  the buoy fell close beside him and he caught it  but it was scarce sufficient to sustain his weight and merely prolonged the agonising struggle  tommy soon lost sight of him in the darkness  soon after there arose a wild fierce cry so loud and strong that it seemed to have been uttered at the boys elbow tommy shuddered for it suggested the idea of a despairing soul  he listened intently and twice again that thrilling cry broke on his ear but each time more faintly  still he continued to listen for it with a feeling of horror and once or twice fancied that he heard it rising above the turmoil of wind and waves  long before he ceased to listen in expectancy the murderers dead body lay tossing in that great watery grave in which so many of the human raceinnocent and guilty alikelie buried  ere long tommy was called to renewed exertion and trial  the tide happened to be rising when the schooner struck  while the incidents above related were taking place the butterfly was being dashed on the sand so violently that her breaking up in the course of a short time was a matter of certainty  tommy knew this well but he did not give way to despair  he resolved not to part with his young life without a struggle and therefore cast about in his mind what was best to be done  his first idea was to construct a raft  he had just begun this laborious work when the rising tide lifted the schooner over the sandbank and sent her off into deep water  this raised tommys hopes and spirits to an unnaturally high pitch he trimmed the foresailthe only one leftas well as he could and then seizing the tiller kept the vessel running straight before the wind  standing thus at the helm he began to reflect on his position and the reflection did not tend to comfort him  he was out in a gale on the stormy sea without companions without compass to guide him and steering he knew not whitherpossibly on rocks or shoals  this latter idea induced him to attempt to lieto till daybreak but the crippled condition of the schooner rendered this impossible  there was nothing for it therefore but to run before the gale  in a short time his attention was attracted to a peculiar sound in the hold  on examination he found that the vessel had sprung a leak and that the water was rising slowly but steadily  the poor boys heart sank and for the first time his courage began to give way but quickly recovering himself he lashed the helm in position and manfully set to work at the pump  he was somewhat relieved to find that the leak was small  in an hour he had pumped out nearly all the water  then he returned to the helm and rested there for an hour at the end of which the water in the hold had increased so much that he had to ply the pump again  the day broke while he was thus engaged but the morning was so thick that he could see no land  on returning to the helm the second time tommy felt that this state of things could not go on much longer  the excitement the watching the horrors of the past night were beginning to tell on him  his muscles were exhausted and he felt an irresistible desire to sleep  he struggled against this till about noon by which time the wind had moderated to a steady breeze and the sun shone through the mist as if to cheer him up a little  he had eaten nothing for many hours as he did not dare to quit his post to go below for food lest the schooner should come suddenly on some other vessel and be run down  hunger and exhaustion however soon rendered him desperate he ran below seized a handful of biscuit filled a can with water and returned hastily on deck to break his fast it was one of the sweetest meals he ever ate and refreshed him so much that he was able to go on alternately steering and pumping till late in the afternoon  then he suddenly broke down  exhausted nature could bear up no longer  he lashed the helm pumped out the water in the hold for the last time and went below to rest  he was half asleep as he descended the companionladder  a strange and sad yet dreamy feeling that everything he did was for the last time weighed heavily on his spirit but this was somehow relieved by the knowledge that he was now at last about to rest  there was delight in that simple thought though there mingled with it a feeling that the rest would terminate in death he lay down to sleep with a feeling that he lay down to die and a halfformed prayer escaped his lips as his wearied head fell upon the pillow  instantly he was buried in deep repose  the sun sank in the ocean the stars came out and spangled all the sky and the moon rose and sank again but tommy lay regardless of everything in profound slumber  again the sun arose on a sea so calm that it seemed like oil ascended into the zenith and sank towards its setting  still the boy continued to sleep his young head resting quietly on the pillow of the dead skipper his breath coming gently and regularly through the halfopened lips that smiled as if he were resting in peace on his mothers bosom  being dashed on the rocks or run into by steamers or whelmed in the waves were ideas that troubled him not or if they did they were connected only with the land of dreams  thus the poor boy rested calmly in the midst of dangeryet in safety for the arm of god was around him    chapter eighteen  the antipodes  a new scene breaks upon us now patient reader  we are among the antipodes in that vast and wonderful region where the kangaroo reigns in the wilderness and gold is sown broadcast in the land  the men we see are to a large extent the same men we saw before leaving the shores of old england but they are wonderfully changed  red flannel shirts long boots leathern belts felt hats and unshorn chins meet us at every turn so do barrows and pickaxes and shovels  it seems as if we had got into a region inhabited solely by navvies  many of them however appear to be very gentlemanly navvies  there are no ladies here scarcely any females at all for we have left the thriving settlements of australia far behind us and are now wandering over the daisy hill golddiggings  the particular section of that busy spot to which our attention is directed at this moment is named the kangaroo flats  none but strong men can get on here  let us go forward and see how they obtain this yellow metal that turns the world upside down  here is a man issuing from a hole in the earth close at our feet like a huge groundsquirrel  he is tall stout and fair with broad shoulders and a fine manly countenance which is ornamented by a thick beard and moustache of glossy yellow hair  the silken curly hair of this man contrasted with his great size and manliness is very striking  he seats himself on a mass of clay wipes the perspiration from his forehead and shouts to some one down in the earth  hallo  jack lets hoist out the stuff now  ay ay harry replies a strong voice with a sailorlike ring in it from below ill be on deck in a jiffy  let us descend and look at this miner  the hole is narrow and deep at the bottom of it is a dark tunnel two feet broad between two and three feet high and twentyfive feet long  at the farther extremity of it crouches a man with a pickaxe in his hands and a candle beside him  it is a very awkward position in which to work and the result is that this man pants and blows and sighs and sometimes laughs quietly to himself at the comicality of his attitudes while the perspiration pours over his face in large beads continuously  it seems very hard work and so indeed it is but the man is an unusually big and strong fellow larger even than his fair companion above ground  his hair is short black and curly as are his beard and whiskers but at this moment his whole head and face are so besmeared with clay that his aspect is piebald and not more becoming than his attitude  still there is a massive grandeur in the outline of his features which cannot be destroyed by incrustations of clay although his complexion is obscured by it  like his comrade above his costume consists of flannel shirt dark trousers and big boots  his shirt sleeves being rolled up to the shoulders display a pair of arms that a sculptor might gaze on with admiration  this strong man pants and gasps more than ever with the heat as he drives the pick and tears up the earth for gold  presently the candle burns dim the air is getting foul  hallo the candles going out cries the dark miner scrambling towards the bottom of the shaft on his hands and knees  ha time to take a mouthful o fresh air jack remarks the fair miner looking into the hole  in another moment a wild dishevelled claybespattered figure comes to the surface rises like a giant out of the earth and the countenance and proportions of our friend john bax are revealed in spite of the strange costume and black moustache and beard and incrustations of clay which more than half disguise him  whew how hot it is said bax as he stepped out of the hole  you may say that observed his friend rising but come along jack lets get up the stuff and wash out as much as we can before dinner mind youve got to write home this afternoon and wont be able to help me much in the evening  come along then said bax going to work again with redoubled energy  there was a windlass over the hole by which the clay was raised to the surface  bax wrought at this and his mate went below to fill the buckets  then they washed it out and flooded away cartloads of worthless soil until a small residue of clear shining particles remained behind  this they gathered carefully together added it to the bag that held their fortune remarked that there were no nuggets this time and that it was hard work and little pay after which they flung down their tools washed their hands and faces and went into their tent to dine  thus did bax and his mate an old acquaintance unexpectedly met with after arrival in australia dig and sweat and toil for gold  but bax and his friend worked thus hard only because it was their nature so to work at whatever their hands found to do  they had not set their hearts upon the gold  after dinner harry went out to drive his pick and shovel  bax remained in the tent to drive the quill  that night the two friends lay chatting and smoking in their tent after supper with a solitary candle between them and the result of the days worka small pile of shining dustbefore them  well not make our fortunes at this rate observed harry with a sigh  theres no saying what good fortune may be in store for us observed bax but put away the gold it will do us no good to gaze at it  harry rolled the little heap in a piece of paper and tossed it into the leathern bag which contained their earnings  come now said he replenishing his pipe lets hear the letter bax who dye says the friend youve written to  hes a boy said bax tommy bogey by name of which name by the way he has no reason to be proudbut hes a firstrate fellow and i fear will have set me down as a faithless friend for i left him without saying goodbye and the letter i wrote to him on my arrival here went to the bottom with the unfortunate ship that carried it  however here is the epistle  im open to correction harry if you think any part of it not shipshape  all right said harry go ahead  bax read as follows    kangaroo flats daisy hill diggings    australia 10th january 18    my dear tommythe mail is just about to leave us so i write to let   you know where i am and what doingalso to tell you that i have just   heard of the wreck of the ship that conveyed my first letter to you   which will account for my apparent neglect    gold digging is anything but a paying affair i find and its the   hardest work ive ever had to do  i have only been able to pay my way   up to this time  everything is fearfully dear  after deducting the   expenses of the last week for cartage sharpening picks etcetera i   and my mate have just realised 15 shillings each and this is the   first week we have made anything at all beyond what was required for   our living  however we live and work on in the hope of turning up a   nugget or finding a rich claim singingthough we cant exactly   believetheres a good time coming  here bax paused  i wont   read the next paragraph said he with a smile because its about   yourself harry so ill skip  nevertheless reader as we wish you to hear that passage we will make bax read on    my mate harry benton is an old schoolfellow whom i met with   accidentally in melbourne  we joined at once and have been together   ever since  i hope that nothing may occur to part us  you would like   him tommy  youve no idea what a fine gentle lionlike fellow he   is with a face like a true bold man in expression and like a   beautiful woman in form  im not up to penandink description   tommy but i think youll understand me when i say hes got a splendid   figurehead a strong frame and a warm heart    poor fellow he has had much sorrow since he came out here  he is a   widower and brought out his little daughter with him an only child   whose sweet face was once like sunshine in our tent  not long ago   this pretty flower of the desert sickened drooped and died with her   fair head on her fathers bosom  for a long time afterwards harry was   inconsolable but he took to reading the bible and the effect of that   has been wonderful  we read it regularly every night together and no   one can tell what comfort we have in it for i too have had sorrow of   a kind which you could not well understand unless i were to go into   an elaborate explanation  i believe that both of us can say in the   words of king david it was good for me that i was afflicted    i should like very much that you and he might meet  perhaps you   may one of these days  but to go on with my account of our life and   doings here  it was at this point that bax continued to read the letter aloud    the weather is tremendously warm  it is now 10th january the   height of summer and the sun is unbearable quite as hot as in india   i am told especially when the hot winds blow  among other evils we   are tormented with thousands of fleas  harry stands them worse than i   do untrue interrupted harry but their cousins the flies are   if possible even more exasperating  they resemble our own house   flies in appearancewould that they were equally harmless  myriads   of millions dont express their numbers more than ten expresses the   number of the stars  they are the most persevering brutes you ever   saw  they creep into your eyes run up your nose and plunge into   your mouth  nothing will shake them off and the mean despicable   creatures take special advantage of us when our hands are occupied in   carrying buckets of golddust or what alas ought to be golddust   but isnt  on such occasions we shake our heads wink our eyes and   snort and blow at them but all to no purposethere they stick and   creep till we get our hands free to attack them    a change must be coming over the weather soon for while i write the   wind is blowing like a gale out of a hot oven and is shaking the   tent so that i fear it will come down about my ears  it is a curious   fact that these hot winds always blow from the north which inclines   me to think there must be large sandy deserts in the interior of this   vast continent  we dont feel the heat through the day except when   we are at the windlass drawing up the pipeclay or while washing our   stuff for we are generally below ground driving  but although   not so hot as above it is desperately warm there too and the air is   bad    our drives are two and a half feet high by about two feet broad at   the floor from which they widen a little towards the top  as i am   six feet three in my stockings and harry is six feet one besides   being both of us broader across the shoulders than most men you may   fancy that we get into all sorts of shapes while working  all the   stuff that we drive out we throw away except about six inches on   the top where the gold lies so that the quantity of mullock as we   call it or useless material hoisted out is very great  there are   immense heaps of it lying at the mouth of our hole  if we chose to   liken ourselves to gigantic moles we have reason to be proud of our   molehills  all this stuff has to be got along the drives some of   which are twentyfive feet in length  one of us stands at the top   and hoists the stuff up the shaft in buckets  the other sits and   fills them at the bottom    this week we have taken out three cartloads of washing stuff which   we fear will produce very little gold  of course it is quite dark in   the drives so we use composition candles  harry drives in one   direction i in another and we hammer away from morning till night   the air is often bad but not explosive  when the candles burn low   and go out it is time for us to go out too and get fresh air for it   makes us blow terribly and gives us sore eyes  threefourths of the   people here are suffering from sore eyes the disease is worse this   season than it has been in the memory of the oldest diggers    we have killed six or seven snakes lately  they are very numerous   and the only things in the country we are absolutely afraid of  you   have no idea of the sort of dread one feels on coming slap upon one   unexpectedly  harry put his foot on one yesterday but got no hurt   they are not easily seen and their bite is always fatal    from all this you will see that a golddiggers life is a hard one   and worse than that it does not pay well  however i like it in the   meantime and having taken it up i shall certainly give it a fair   trial    i wish you were here tommy yet i am glad you are not  to have you   and guy in the tent would make our party perfect but it would try   your constitutions i fear and do you no good mentally for the   society by which we are surrounded is anything but select    but enough of the goldfields  i have a lot of questions to ask and   messages to send to my old friends and mates at deal  at this point the reading of the letter was interrupted by an uproar near the tent  high above the noise the voice of a boy was heard in great indignation  for a few minutes bax and his friend did not move they were too much accustomed to scenes of violence among the miners to think of interfering unless things became very serious  come bill let him alone cried a stern voice the lads no thief as you may see if you look in his face  i dont give a straw for looks and faces retorted bill who seemed to have caused the uproar the young rascal came peeping into my tent and thats enough for me  what cried the boy in an indignant shout may i not search through the tents to find a friend without being abused by every scoundrel who loves his gold so much that he thinks every one who looks at him wants to steal it  let me go i say  at the first words of this sentence bax started up with a look of intense surprise  before it was finished he had seized a thick stick and rushed from the tent followed by his mate  in two seconds they reached the centre of a ring of disputants in the midst of which a big coarselooking miner held by the collar the indignant lad who proved to be an old and truly unexpected acquaintance  bax shouted the boy  tommy bogey exclaimed bax  off your hands cried bax striding forward  the miner who was a powerful man hesitated  bax seized him by the neck and sent him head over heels into his own tent which stood behind him  serves him right cried one of the crowd who appeared to be delighted with the prospect of a row  hear hear echoed the rest approvingly  can it be you tommy cried bax grasping the boy by both arms and stooping to gaze into his face  found you at last shouted tommy with his eyes full and his face flushed by conflicting emotions  come into the tent cried bax hastening away and dragging his friend after him  tommy did not know whether to laugh or cry  his breast was still heaving with recent indignation and his heart was bursting with present joy so he gave utterance to a wild hysterical cheer and disappeared behind the folds of his friends tent amid the cheers and laughter of the miners who thereafter dispersed quietly to their several places of abode  tommy said bax placing the boy directly in front of him on a pile of rough coats and blankets and staring earnestly into his face i dont believe its you  im dreaming thats what i am so the sooner you pinch me out of this state the better  it were vain to attempt to give the broken and disjointed converse that here took place between the two friends  after a time they became more rational and less spasmodic in their talk and tommy at last condescended to explain the way in which he had managed to get there  but before i begin said he tell me whos your friend  he turned as he spoke to harry who seated on a provision cask with a pleasant smile on his handsome face and a black pipe in his mouth had been enjoying the scene immensely  ah true i forgot this is my mate harry benton an old schoolfellow  youll know more of him and like him better in course of time  i hope he will said harry extending his hand which tommy grasped and shook warmly and i hope to become better acquainted with you tommy though in truth you are no stranger to me for many a night has bax entertained me in this tent with accounts of your doings and his own both by land and sea  now go on my boy and explain the mystery of your sudden appearance here  the prime cause of my appearance is the faithlessness of bax said tommy  why did you not write to me  when it was explained that bax had written by a vessel which was wrecked the boy was mollified and when the letter which had just been written was handed to him he confessed that he had judged his old friend hastily  thereafter he related succinctly his adventures in the butterfly up to the point where we left him sound asleep in the skippers berth  how long i slept said tommy continuing the narrative i am not quite sure but it must have been a longish time for it was somewhere in a tuesday when i lay down and it was well into a thursday when i got up or rather was knocked up by the bow of a thousandton ship  it was a calm evening with just a gentle breeze blowin at the time and a little hazy  the look out in the ship did not see the schooner until he was close on her then he yelled hardalee so i was told for i didnt hear it bein as i said sound asleep  but i heard and felt what followed plain enough  there came a crash like thunder  i was pitched headforemost out o the berth and would certainly have got my neck broken but for the flimsy table in the cabin which gave way and went to pieces under me and thus broke my fall  i got on my legs and shot up the companion like a rocket  i was confused enough as you may suppose but i must have guessed at once what was wrongperhaps the rush of water told it mefor i leaped instantly over the side into the sea to avoid being sucked down by the sinking vessel  down it went sure enough and i was so near it that in spite of my struggles i was carried down a long way and all but choked  however up i came again like a cork  you always said i was lightheaded bax and i do believe that was the reason i came up so soon  well i swam about for ten minutes or so when a boat rowed up to the place  it had been lowered by the ship that ran me down  i was picked up and taken aboard and found that she was bound for australia  ha that just suited you i fancy said bax  of course it did but thats not all  who dye think the ship belonged to  youll never guessto your old employers denham crumps and company  she is named the trident after the one that was lost and old denham insisted on her sailing on a friday  the sailors said she would be sure to go to the bottom but they were wrong for we all got safe to melbourne after a very good voyage  well ive little more to tell now  on reaching melbourne i landed  without a sixpence in your pocket asked bax  by no means said tommy i had five golden sovereigns sewed up in the waistband of my trousers not to mention a silver watch like a saucepan given to me by old jeph at parting and a brass ring that i got from bluenose  but its wonderful how fast this melted away in melbourne it was half gone before i succeeded in finding out what part of the country you had gone to  the rest of it i paid to a party of miners who chanced to be coming here for leave to travel and feed with them they left me in the lurch however about two days walk from this place relieving me of the watch at parting but permitting me to keep the ring as a memorial of the pleasant journey we had had together then the rascals left me with provisions sufficient for one meal  so i came on alone and now present myself to you halfstarved and a beggar  here is material to appease your hunger lad said harry benton with a laugh as he tossed a mass of flour cake known among diggers as damper towards the boy  and here added bax pitching a small bag of golddust into his lap is material to deliver you from beggary at least for the present  as for the future tommy your own stout arms must do the rest  youll live in our tent and well make a golddigger of you in a couple of days  i could have wished you better fortune lad but as you have managed to make your way to this outotheway place i suppose youll want to remain  i believe you my boy said tommy with his mouth full of damper  so tommy bogey remained with his friends at the kangaroo flats and dug for gold  for several years they stuck to the laborious work during which time they dug up just enough to keep themselves in food and clothing  they were unlucky diggers  indeed this might have been said of most of the diggers around them  those who made fortunes by happening to find rich spots of ground were very few compared with the host of those who came with light hearts hoping for heavy pockets and went away with heavy hearts and light pockets  we shall not follow the fortunes of those three during their long period of exile  the curtain was lifted in order that the reader might take a glance at them in the faroff land  they are a pleasant trio to look upon  they do not thirst feverishly for the precious metal as many do their nightly reading of the word saves them from that  nevertheless they work hard earn little and sleep soundly  as we drop the curtain they are still toiling and moiling patiently heartily and hopefully for gold    chapter nineteen  denham longs for fresh air and finds it  there came a day at last in which foul air and confinement and moneymaking began to tell on the constitution of mr denham to disagree with him in fact  the rats began to miss him occasionally from redwharf lane at the wonted hour and no doubt gossiped a good deal on the subject over their evening meals after the labours and depredations of the day were ended  they observed too supposing them to have been capable of observation that when mr denham did come to his office he came with a pale face and an enfeebled step also with a thick shawl wrapped round his neck these peculiarities were so far taken advantage of by the rats that they ceased to fly with their wonted precipitancy when his step was heard and in course of time they did not even dive into their holes as in former days but sat close to them and waited until the merchant had passed knowing well that he was not capable of running at them  one large young rat in particularquite a rattling blade in his wayat length became so bold that he stood his ground one forenoon and deliberately stared at mr denham as he tottered up to the officedoor  we notice this fact because it occurred on the memorable day when mr denham admitted to himself that he was breaking down and that something must be done to set him up again  he thought as he sat at his desk leaning his head on his right hand that seaair might do him good and the idea of a visit to his sister at deal flitted across his mind but remembering that he had for many years treated that sister with frigid indifference and that he had dismissed her son guy harshly and without sufficient reason from his employment a few years ago he came to the conclusion that deal was not a suitable locality  then he thought of margate and ramsgate and even ventured to contemplate the scotch highlands but his energy being exhausted by illness he could not make up his mind so he sighed and felt supremely wretched  had there been any one at his elbow to suggest a plan of some sort and urge him to carry it out he would have felt relieved and grateful  but plans for our good are usually suggested and urged by those who love us and denham being a bachelor and a misanthrope happened to have no one to love him  he was a very rich manvery rich indeed and would have given a great deal of gold at that moment for a very small quantity of love but love is not a marketable commodity  denham knew that and sighed again  he felt that in reference to this thing he was a beggar and for the first time in his life experienced something of a beggars despair  while he sat thus musing bitterly there came a tap at the door  come in  the tapper came in and presented to the astonished gaze of mr denham the handsome face and figure of guy foster  i trust you will forgive my intrusion uncle said guy in apologetic tones as he advanced with a rather hesitating step but i am the bearer of a message from my mother  denham had looked up in surprise and with a dash of sternness but the expression passed into one of sadness mingled with suffering  he pointed to a chair and said curtly sit down as he replaced his forehead on his hand and partially concealed his haggard face  i am deeply grieved dear uncle continued guy to see you looking so very ill  i do sincerely hope  your message interrupted denham  my mother having heard frequently of late that you are far from well and conceiving that the fresh air of deal might do you good has sent me to ask you to be our guest for a time  it would afford us very great pleasure i assure you uncle  guy paused here but mr denham did not speak  the kindness of the unexpected and certainly unmerited invitation put as it was in tones which expressed great earnestness and regard took him aback  he felt ill at ease and his wonted selfpossession forsook him  probably much of this was owing to physical weakness  come uncle said guy affectionately you wont refuse us  we all live together in the cottage now but we dont quite fill it there is still one room to spare and my wife will be delighted to  your wife exclaimed denham in amazement  yes uncle replied guy in some surprise  did you not get our cards  mr denham rested his forehead again in his hand in some confusion for he remembered having received a letter long ago the address of which he knew to be in his nephews hand and supposing it to be an application to be taken back into the office he had tossed it into the fire without opening it  feeling much perplexed he saidoh ahwhat is the ladys name  lucy burton was her maiden name said guy she is the daughter of an independent minister who was formerly a scripturereader in ramsgate  humph ejaculated denham  pray may i ask what your profession is now  i am cashier in the office of a very intimate friend of oursmr summers  what the house with which we do so much business  the same said guy with a smile but tell me uncle will you come and stay with us  do say you will if it were only for a week or two  ill think of it nephew  mr denham did think of it  more than that he went and said he would stay a week  he stayed a week and found himself in such comfortable quarters that he resolved to stay a fortnight  he did so and then agreed to remain a month  finally it became a standing joke with bluenose who was a frequent visitor at the cottage kitchen that he denham was no better than the playactors who were always at their last week but one and never could get any farther  but mr denhams health did not improve  he had imbibed so much tar and fog and filth through his nostrils that his constitution could not recover from the effects and at last it began to dawn upon him that health was of greater value than gold that the accumulation of wealth was not the main object for which man had been created that there was a future in regard to which it would be well that he should now make some inquiries  here mr denham turned by a sort of instinct to amy russell whose face was like a beam of sunshine in sandhill cottage and whose labours among the poor and the afflicted showed that she regarded life in this world as a journey towards a better as an opportunity of doing good as a ladder leading to a higher and happier sphere  in regard to this sphere he denham knew next to nothingexcept of course intellectually mr denham turned to the right quarter for comfort and found it  still the merchants health did not improve so his physicians recommended a seavoyage  at an earlier period in his career he would as soonsooner perhapshave taken a balloon voyage but sickness had taught him wisdom  he gave in consented to take a passage in one of his own ships the trident which had made several good voyages to australia and ere long was ploughing over the billows of the south seas on his way to the antipodes  such is life  wonderful coincidences are of constant occurrence in this world  it chanced that in the same year that mr denham made up his mind to take a voyage to australia and back bax and tommy bogey made up their minds to give up digging for gold and return to their native land  their companion harry benton preferred to remain in the colony  bax and tommy had only made enough to keep themselves alive in the goldfields until their last year but during this year they had been more successful  they hit on a good claim worked it out and cleared two thousand pounds  with this they resolved to retire and push their fortunes at home  believing that they could realise more by carrying their gold home in dust and nuggets than by selling it in the colony they had it packed in boxes and took it aboard ship along with them the ship that chanced to be ready to sail for england at this time was the trident and almost the first face they saw on going aboard was the wellknown visage of mr denham  sea air had done him good  he looked strong and wellcomparatively bax and he started and gazed in surprise on each other  how are you said denham with some stiffness of manner  thank you very well answered bax  then both men felt and looked a little awkward  ahem coughed denham  hope youre well sir said bax  there was little in the words but there was much in the tone in which this was said  mr denham advanced and held out his hand  bax shook it warmly  they were sufficiently good friends during the whole of that voyage although there was just enough of remembrance of former days in the breast of each to prevent anything like cordiality between them  the homeward voyage was prosperous  favouring gales wafted them on their way  no storms arose to cause anxiety to the brave or to terrify the timid and few incidents worthy of notice occurred until after they had doubled the cape of good hope  but soon after this they met with an adventure which deserves record    chapter twenty  a fire at sea  on the troubled breast of the atlantic a little to the southward of that great collection of seaweed known by the name of the sargasso sea lay a large ship  she was in distress for her flag was hoisted with the union jack down the nature of her distress was apparent from a column of thick smoke that issued from the forehatch  the most terrible of all calamities had befallen hershe was on fire  that she was an emigrant ship was apparent from the great number of human beingsmen women and childrenwho crowded her decks  before the fire broke out she had weathered a severe gale the effects of which had not yet passed away for although there was little wind the waves were still high and the burning ship rolled and plunged heavily  how the fire originated no one could tell but the instant it was discovered the captain who was a brave and able man took prompt measures for its extinction  but his utmost efforts failed of success because the old story there was no suitable machinery on board for the extinction of fire  the owners of this ship however were not like too many utterly regardless of human life  on the contrary they had done a great dealmuch more than is done by many shipownersfor the comfort and safety of those who had entrusted their lives to them there were boats on board sufficient to carry the entire crew and passengers and two of these were lifeboats  there was also a large supply of lifebuoys and lifejackets the latter being made of cork in such a form that the wearers might be able to work in them without inconvenience  but in preparing the ship for sea fire had not been sufficiently considered  there was no fireengine aboard  buckets there were and these were plied with vigour but as we have said without success  finding that the fire continued to gain strength the captain ordered the ship to be scuttled in other words to be flooded by opening the lower ports and letting the sea rush in  the ship was one of those old east indiamen which in former days carried guns and marines like our menofwar  the ports were soon knocked out and the sea burst in foaming and splashing like a millrace when the sluice is drawn as it swept towards the hold carrying boxes bulkheads loose furniture and all before it  when it poured in a mighty cataract into the hold the terrified multitude that crowded the upper deck entertained the hope for a few minutes that the fire would certainly be put out  their hope was quickly crushed for the ship soon gave signs of being waterlogged and threatened to settle down rendering it necessary to close the ports before the fire was subdued  a wail of despair rose from them when this was done for now they knew that the ship was doomed and that death in two of its most appalling forms stared them in the face  the scene that followed was heartrending  the more timid among the passengers lost selfcommand some fell on their knees and with bitter cries implored god to have mercy on them  others took passionate farewell of each other or sat clinging to each other in the silence of despair  many became frantic rushed about the decks and tore their hair and a few of the braver spirits moved calmly and silently about doing anything that required to be done or coolly making preparation for the last struggle  among these last were several women who sustained by the christians hope went about comforting their companions and calming the poor children  in some cases they became the centres of little groups of men and women who listened intently while they read the word of god or joined with them in prayer  many cursing lips had become silent now or tremblingly attempted to call on our saviour for the first time in earnest  meanwhile the officers and crew were not idle  preparation was made to lower the boats  the lifebuoys and belts were got ready and everything was done to facilitate the abandoning of the vessel before she should be utterly consumed  the ordinary ships boats were converted into lifeboats by the simple contrivance of fastening small empty casks all round them under the seats and a largesized cask in the stern and bow of each  as the sea was still running high the operation of lowering was a matter of difficulty and danger  the women and children were put into the first boat while it hung suspended at the davits  two men stood by to detach the hooks that held the boat by the bow and stern the instant she should touch the water  this was the moment of danger for if one man should succeed in this and the other fail the inevitable consequence would be that the stern or the bow of the boat would be jerked into the air and the people in her hurled into the sea  four boats were lowered and cast off in safety  the fifth which contained men chiefly with only two or three women and no children was upset  the man in the bow could not detach his hook it remained fast while the stern hook was cast off and when the ship rose it hung suspended by the bow  instantly the people in her were struggling in the waves  the captain knowing that this might occur had ordered a dozen of the strongest of his men to put on cork lifebelts and stand in the main chains to be in readiness  these at once leaped into the sea and supported the people until another boat was lowered for them but a misfortune here befell them  while one of the boats was swinging it was dashed against the ships side so violently as to be stove in and rendered useless  this accident happened also to another boat so that even by overloading those that remained it would now be impossible to accommodate every one  in this dilemma the captain at once gave orders to heave overboard all the spare spars and the hencoops together with enough of cordage for the construction of a raft  this was promptly done and the raft was sufficiently far advanced in the course of an hour to admit of the emigrants being placed upon it  it was during the formation of this raft that the great value of the lifebelts became manifest  while the spars were in a loose and halffastened state the men were obliged to work in the water  to have done this without the support of the belts would have been very exhausting almost impossible but with their floating power the men could work with both hands and move about almost as freely in the water as on land  the lifebuoys were also of the greatest value at this time for the burning ship became so hot before the raft was ready that the passengers were obliged to jump overboard and get upon it as they best could or float about until there was room for them all  in these circumstances the buoys were the means of saving the lives of some who could not swim  it was late in the evening when the raft was commenced and night was far advanced before it was completed  during all this time the boats remained close to it after having hauled it a short distance from the burning ship which latter was now a mass of flame from the deck to the mastheads rendering the whole scene as bright as day  after the rigging was consumed and the masts had fallen over the side the hull continued to burn for a considerable time with less flame but with a dull red glow that afforded sufficient light to the workers  it was fortunate the light lasted so long for the night was so dark that it would otherwise have been almost impossible to have worked at the raft tossed and rolled about as it was by the heavy sea  it was a strange weird sight that busy glowing scene of disaster out upon the black ocean at midnight and wonderfulunaccountabledid it appear in the eyes of the nightwatch on board the trident as that ship came over the sea ploughing up the water before a steady breeze which had sprung up soon after the sun went down  what can it be said mr denham to the captain when they first observed the light on the horizon  a steamer perhaps replied the captain  no steamer ever spouted fire like that said bax who was the only other passenger on deck all the others having gone to rest the steamers on the american lakes and rivers do indeed spout sparks and flames of fire like giant squibs but then they burn wood  ocean steamers never flare up like that  i fear it is a ship on fire  think you so  steer straight for it captain said mr denham whose heart under the influence of bad health and latterly of considerable experience in the matter of human suffering had become a little softer than it used to be  the ships course was altered and long before the wreck was reached her decks swarmed with men and women who had got up in haste at the first mention of the word firesome of them with a confused notion that their own vessel was in danger  it was indeed a novel and terribly interesting sight to most of those on board the trident  at first they saw the burning vessel like a red meteor rising on the waves and disappearing in the hollows then the flames grew fierce and spread a halo round the doomed ship that shone out vividly against the surrounding darkness  this latter was rendered intensely deep by contrast with the light  then the masts went over the side and a bright volume of sparks and scattered tongues of flame shot up into the sky after which the hull shone like a glowworm until they drew quite near  the busy workers at the raft were too anxiously intent on their occupation to observe the approach of the trident whose black hull was nearly invisible and whose small lanterns might well have been overlooked on such an occasion  they dont see us observed mr denham  this was abundantly evident  within the circle of red light they could see the raft and the boats floating close to it the men in corkjackets toiling in the water and on floating spars with ropes handspikes and axes  it was not until the trident herself came within the circle of light and hoveto with flapping sails that the people in the boats became aware of her presence  then indeed there arose a shout of joy such as could be uttered only by men and women snatched suddenly and unexpectedly from the very jaws of death  again and again it burst forth and was replied to by the people in the trident many of whom were so excited by the scene and so overjoyed at the thought of having come up in time to save so many human beings that they burst into tears while others went down on their knees and thanked god fervently  seeing that the people were getting excited and knowing that order must be preserved if the work that lay before them was to be done speedily and without accident the captain sprang into the rigging ordered the women and children to go below and assured the male passengers that if any of them showed a disposition to be obstinate or unruly they also should be ordered below  this had the desired effect  order was at once restored and the captain then called for volunteers from among the stoutest of those on board to go into the chains and lift the women and children out of the boats  the appeal was responded to by all the strong men in the shipforemost and strongest among whom was our friend bax  from among these the captain selected the men that seemed best able for the work they undertook to do and this be it understood was no childs play  the state of the sea rendered it extremely difficult and dangerous to bring the boats alongside heavily laden as they were with human beings to get the men on board would be difficult enough even although they would in most cases be able to spring and lay hold of ropes and otherwise help themselves but to get out the women and children by such means was not to be thought of  the men of the trident who had the strongest arms and chests were therefore sent into the chains where they leaned forward in slings with outstretched arms and whenever the boats sheered up close enough they caught the women or children in their vicelike grasp and dragged them on board  bax owing to his unusual strength and breadth of shoulders was peculiarly fitted for this laborious duty  his long reach of arm enabled him to stretch far beyond the others and in several instances he caught hold of and rescued women after his companions had failed thus a much larger portion of the work fell upon him than on any of the others  in this sort of work tommy bogey was of no use whatever and severely did his youth and want of physical strength press upon his spirits that night poor boy  but tommys nature would not allow him to sit down and do nothing  feeling that he could not do manly work he set himself with right goodwill to womanly employment  he assisted in carrying the children below when they were handed over the side helped to strip them and brought dry clothing and blankets besides doing an immense amount of what may be termed stewardess work for the poor ladies there were others on board who worked willingly and well but none who were so ubiquitous as he none who knew so thoroughly what to do and how to do it and none certainly who did everything with such a superabundance of energy  once or twice tommy stopped in the middle of these occupations to see how bax was getting on for to his rather partial eyes it seemed that his friend was doing the whole work and that everybody else was merely looking on  on one of these occasions he saw bax sustaining the weight of an old man and a young woman  the girl was the old mans daughter she had clung to him in the boat and refused to let him go having lost selfcommand through terror ignorant of this and observing that the old man could not help himself bax grasped him under the arms the first time he came within reach  the boat was immediately swept away by the passing wave leaving the old man and the girl who still clung with a deathlike grasp to him suspended in the air  baxs great strength enabled him to support this double weight but he could not draw them up  a comrade stooped to assist him but the strain on the sling was so great that it gave way and bax with his burden fell into the sea like lead  tommy saw this happen  there were plenty of loose ropes about  he seized the end of one and leaped overboard instantly  he sank for a second or two and on coming to the surface looked hastily round  a hand was raised above the water near him  he knew it to be that of his friend and struck out for it but it disappeared  again it rose and there was a convulsive grasping of the fingers  tommy made one stroke and placed the rope in it  the fingers closed like a vice  next moment the ship rose and lifted bax completely out of the water with the old man and the girl still clinging to him  before the ship sank again the boat sheered up and they were all pulled into it  to leap on board the trident again and resume his position with a new and stronger sling was comparatively easy work for bax  tommy clambered up too close behind him  passing a strong rope round his friends waist he said quietly  it wont do to risk that again  true tommy said bax run below and fetch me a glass o brandy lad that last plunge almost floored me  the boy leaped over the side and dived below  he reappeared in a few seconds with a tin can with which he clambered over the side into the chains and held it to his friends lips  bax drained it at a draught and tommy left him without another word  the whole of this scene was enacted with the utmost speed and energy the spectators seemed to be paralysed with amazement at the quiet selfpossession of the man and the boy both of whom appeared to divine each others thoughts and to work into each others hands with the precision and certainty of a machine they did it all too as if they were entirely alone in the work  until now they had been watched with breathless anxiety but when tommy gave bax the can of brandy and then gravely went below with a baby that had just been rescued in his arms there arose a wild cheer of admiration not unmingled with laughter from those who had witnessed his conduct  but their attention was soon turned again to the boats two of which still remained with their freight on the heaving water  many incidents of a thrilling nature were enacted that night  one of the most interesting perhaps occurred soon after that which has just been related  in one of the boats was the young wife of an emigrant who having been compelled to separate from his wife and child when they left the burning ship in the first boat had come alongside of the trident in another boat  being an active man he had caught a rope and hauled himself on board some time before his wife was rescued  the poor young mother had tied her infant tightly to her bosom by means of a shawl in order to make sure that she should share its fate whatever that might be  when the boat sheered up alongside her husband was standing in the chains anxious to render her assistance  the woman chanced to come near to bax but not sufficiently so to grasp him  she had witnessed his great power and success in saving others and a feeling of strong confidence made her resolve to be caught hold of by him if possible she therefore drew back from the grasp of a stout fellow who held out his brawny arms to her  bax noticed this occur twice and understood the poor womans motive feeling proud of the confidence thus placed in him he watched his opportunity  the boat surged up but did not come near enough  it swept away from the ship and the poor womans hands played nervously about the folds of the shawl as she tried to adjust them more securely round her infant  again the boat rose on a wave the woman stood ready and bax stooped  it did not come quite near enough but the disappointed woman becoming desperate suddenly put her foot on the gunwale stood up at full length and stretched out her arms  bax just caught her by the hands when the boat was swept from under her  similar incidents had occurred so often that little anxiety was felt but our heros strength was now thoroughly exhausted  he could not haul her up he could only hold on and shout for assistance  it was promptly rendered but before the poor woman could be rescued the infant slipped from the shawl which the straightening of the mothers arms and her suspended position had loosened  a cry burst from the agonised father who stooped and stood in the attitude of one ready to plunge into the sea  the mother felt the child slipping and a piercing shriek escaped from her as she raised her knees and caught it between them  with muscular power intensified by a mothers love she held the infant in this strange position until both were drawn up and placed in safety on the deck  this was the last of baxs achievements on that eventful night  he was so thoroughly worn out by the longcontinued and tremendous exertions he had been called on to make that his strength great though it was broke down  he staggered down into the cabin flung himself wet as he was on a couch and almost instantly fell into a sleep so deep that he could not be roused for more than a moment or two at a time  seeing this tommy bade the bystanders leave him alone for a few minutes until he should come back when according to his own expression he would screw him up all right and tight  every one was by this time so thoroughly convinced that the boy was quite able to manage his friend that they stood still awaiting his return with much curiosity  tommy soon returned with a tumbler of hot brandy and water followed by the steward with a pile of blankets  hold that a minute said the boy handing the tumbler to a little old gentleman who stood swaying to and fro with the motion of the vessel and staring at bax as if he had been a halfdrowned seamonster  now then cried tommy punching his friend severely in the ribs seizing the hair of his head with both hands and shaking him until his neck seemed dislocatedto the surprise of all and the horror of not a few  the result was that bax grumbled angrily half awoke and raised himself on one elbow  drink you tomtit said the boy catching the tumbler from the old gentleman and applying it to his friends lips  bax smiled drank and fell back on the pillow with a deep sigh of satisfaction  then tommy spread blanket after blanket over him and tucked him in so neatly and with such a businesslike air that two or three mothers then present expressed their admiration and wonder in audible whispers  while bax was being thus carefully tended by tommy and a knot of sympathisers the passengers and crew vied with each other in making the rescued people as comfortable as circumstances would permit  meanwhile the trident was again laid on her course and thus crowded with human beings steered before favouring breezes for the shores of old england    chapter twenty one  mysterious doings  we return now to the coast of kent and beg the reader to follow us into the smugglers cave at saint margarets bay  here in a dark corner sat old jeph  it was a stormy sunday afternoon the old man had gone to the bay to visit coleman and accompany him to his place of worship  jeph had wandered alone in the direction of the cave after church  he found that some one had recently cleared its mouth of the rubbish that usually filled it and that by bending low he could gain an entrance  being of an adventurous disposition the old man

guy as the old man pulled a small packet wrapped in brown paper from his breast pocket and put it into his hands  then they rose and went away together  well said rodney nick  well echoed long orrick wot then  what next what dye want to do inquired rodney  do cried orrick i mean to get hold o that packet if i can by fair means or by foul thats wot i mean to do and i mean that you shall help me  the reader may imagine what were the feelings of the poor old man as he sat in the dark corner of the cave listening to this circumstantial relation of his most secret affairs  when he heard long orricks last words and felt how utterly powerless he was in his weakness to counteract him in his designs he could not prevent the escape of a deep groan  the effect on the two men was electrical  they sprang up filled with superstitious horror and fled precipitately from the cave  old jeph staggered out after them and made for the cottage of his friend coleman  the latter met him near the threshold  why jeph is this you  ive bin searchin for ye more than an hour and come to the conclusion ye must ha gone home but why youre ill jeph  ay im ill come help me home  nay not this night you shall stop with me the missusll give you a cup o tea as will do yer old heart good  no i must go home now said jeph in a tone so decided that his friend was staggered  you cant walk it you know in a

blow high blow low  wen he wants to go off to sea he goes off right or wrong  but youll take a glass o grog first  old jeph would not do this so he was led down to the beach by coleman where they found the boat being launched  goodbye old man said coleman helping him over the side  goodbyefarewell said jeph earnestly  i came here today apurpose to say farewell shake hands god bless you  the coastguardman was surprised by the warmth of his friends manner as well as by his words but before he could ask him what he meant the boat was run down the beach and out to sea  an hour later old jeph was carefully put to bed in his own cottage by his friend captain bluenose    chapter twenty two  the storm and the wreck  guy foster clad in a souwester hat and oilskin coat stood at the end of the pier of ramsgate harbour with his sweet wife lucy clinging to his arm and a sturdy boy of about four years old holding on with one hand to the skirts of his coat and with the other grasping the sleeve of his silverhaired grandsire mr burton  it was night and a bitter gale was blowing from the northeast accompanied by occasional showers of sleet  crowds of seamen and others stood on the pier eagerly watching the lifeboat which was being got ready to put off to sea  it is too cold for you darling said guy as he felt lucys arm tremble  oh no  i should like to stay said lucy anxiously  just then a tremendous wave burst on the massive stone pier and a shower of spray fell upon the crowd  lucy and her companions received a copious share of it  you are wet through dear and so is charlie said guy remonstratively  well i will go home but you must come with us papa  guy wants to remain i know  the missionary gave his daughter his arm and led her away while guy pushing through the crowd soon stood beside the lifeboat the crew of which already encased in their cork lifebelts were hastily taking their places  there goes another rocket cried one of those on the lookout its from the northsnhead light  look alive lads cried the coxswain of the boat more to relieve his feelings than to hurry the men who were already doing their best  the shrill note of a steamwhistle was heard at this moment its piercing sound rising high above the shriek of the gale and the roaring of the sea  it was a signal from the steamtug appointed to attend on the lifeboat and told that steam was up and all ready to put to sea  put to sea on such a night with the waves bursting in thunder on the shore the foam seething like milk beneath the wind shrieking like ten thousand fiends above and the great billows lifting up their heads as they came rolling in from the darkness of erebus that lay incumbent on the raging sea beyond  ay a landsman might have said madness with reason  even a seaman might have said that without much apparent impropriety  but the boatmen of ramsgate held a different opinion  the signal gun had been fired the rocket had gone up a wreck was known to be on the fatal goodwin sands and they were as eager to face the storm as if encountering danger and facing death were pleasant pastime  as the oars were about to be shipped one of the crew stumbled and struck his head so violently against the bollard that he fell stunned into the bottom of the boat  guy saw the accident as he stood on the edge of the pier  a sudden impulse seized him  at one bound he passed from the pier to the boat which was already some halfdozen feet away and took the seat and oar of the injured man  in the confusion and darkness the others thought he was one of the supernumerary boatmen and took no further notice of him  the boat was shoved back the lifejacket was transferred to guy and the boatman was put ashore  a few strokes brought the boat alongside the steamtug  heave the warp make fast all right steam ahead  the whistle shrieked again the warp tautened and tug and lifeboat made for the mouth of the harbour  as they passed out an inspiring cheer was given by the crowd and a rocket streamed up from the pierhead to signal the lightship that assistance was on the way  the lifeboat which thus gallantly put off to the rescue in a storm so wild that no ordinary boat could have faced it for a moment without being swamped was a celebrated one which had recently been invented and placed at this stationwhere it still lies and may be recognised by its white sides and peculiar build  its history is interesting  in the year 1851 the duke of northumberland then president of the lifeboat institution offered a prize of 100 pounds for the best model of a lifeboat  the result was that 280 models and plans were sent to somerset house for examination the prize was awarded to mr james beeching boatbuilder at great yarmouth who was ordered to construct a boat after the pattern of his model 36 feet long with 12 oars  the boat was built and was found to be the most perfect of its kind that had ever been launched  it was the first selfrighting boat ever constructed  the three great points to be attained in the construction of a lifeboat are buoyancy the power of righting itself if upset and the power of emptying itself if filled with water  up to this date the lifeboats of the kingdom were possessed of only the first quality  they could not be sunk that was all  of course that was a great deal but it was far from sufficient  mr beechings boat united all three qualities  its selfrighting principle was effected by means of two raised aircases one at the stem the other at the stern and a heavy metal keel  when overturned the boat attempted as it were to rest on its two elevated cases but these being buoyant resisted this effort and turned the boat over on its side the action being further assisted by the heavy keel which had a tendency to drag the bottom downwards  thus the upper part of the boat was raised by one action and the bottom part depressed by the other the result being that the boat righted itself immediately  in fact its remaining in an inverted position was an impossibility  the selfemptying principle was accomplished by the introduction of six selfacting valves into the bottom of the boat through which the water when shipped ran back into the sea  when we first heard of this we were puzzled reader as doubtless you are for it occurred to us that any hole made in a boats bottom would inevitably let water in instead of out  the difficulty was cleared up when we saw the model beechings boat had a double floor the upper one raised to a little above the level of the sea  the escapes were short metal pipes the upper openings of which were fitted into holes in the upper floor  the lower ends passed through the bottom of the boat  the valves of the top opened downward but could not be opened upwards so that the rushing of the sea into the pipes from below was checked but the rushing in of the sea from above pressed the valves open and allowed the water to run out in accordance with the wellknown law that water must find its level  thus the upper floor being above the level of the sea all the water ran out  boats on this principle modified in some of the details by mr peake of her majestys dockyard at woolwich are now adopted by the lifeboat institution  they right themselves in less than a minute and free themselves of water in about the same time  besides the above advantages mr beechings boat was fitted with the usual aircases round the sides and with a thick stripe of cork outside the gunwale also with lines hanging over the sides in festoons so that any one in the water using them as stirrups might get into the boat with ease  she was further provided with an anchor and cable with strong but light lines attached to grappling irons at the bow and stern which when thrown into the rigging or upon a wreck might fasten themselves to the ship and retain the boat without any other aid also with a lifebuoy and a lantern for night work besides numerous small articles  this boat was purchased by the harbour commissioners of ramsgate and anchored close to the pier in connexion with a powerful steamtug the fires of which were never allowed to die down ready at any moment to fly to the rescue on the signal of distress being given  this is the boat whose splendid deeds have so frequently of late drawn the attention and compelled the admiration of the whole country and it was this boat that issued from ramsgate harbour on the wild night referred to at the beginning of this chapter  both tide and wind were dead against them as they issued from the shelter of the pier and met the storm but the steamer was very powerful it buffeted the billows bravely and gradually gained the neighbourhood of the sands where the breakers and cross seas beat so furiously that their noise mingled with the blast created a din which can only be described as a prolonged and hideous roar  the night was extremely dark and bitterly cold  heavy seas continually burst over the steamers bulwarks and swept her deck from stem to stern  the little lifeboat far astern was dragged by the strong hawser through a wild turmoil of water and spray  the men nestling under the gunwales clung to the thwarts and maintained their position although sea after sea broke over them and well nigh washed them out  at length they reached the lightship hailed her and were told that the wreck was on a high part of the shingles bearing northwest from the light  away they went in that direction but being unable to find her made their way to the princes lightship where they were told there was a large ship on the girdler  once more they steamed in the direction indicated and soon discovered the wreck by the tarbarrels which she was burning  just as they sighted her an enormous sea broke over the steamer with such violence as to stop her way for a moment and cause her strong frame to quiver  look out lads cried the coxswain of the lifeboat as the black water loomed up between them and the tug  the men grasped the thwarts more firmly as a tremendous sea filled the boat to the gunwale  at this moment the checked steamer again leaped on her way the stout hawser parted like a piece of twine and the lifeboat was left behind  hoisting the corner of its small sail they made for the wreck  no time was lost in bailing as would have been the case with the boats of former years a few seconds sufficed to empty her  the wind was now blowing a complete hurricane with a terrific sea on the horrors of which were increased by the darkness of the night so that it was with the utmost difficulty they succeeded in getting alongside  the wreck was a coasting vessel with a crew of eighteen men there were no women or children so they were got into the boat without much loss of time and safely conveyed to the tug which lay to for her little consort about threequarters of a mile off  the lifeboat was again taken in tow and they proceeded together towards ramsgate when another gun and signalrocket recalled them to continue their arduous duties  the sleet of a winters night beat furiously in the faces of these boatmen as already much exhausted they once again faced the storm but the streaming rocket and the signalgun seemed to infuse new life and vigour into their hardy frames  out to sea they went again and having approached as near as they dared to the breakers worked their way along the edge of the sands keeping a bright lookout for the vessel in distress  up and down they cruised but nothing could be seen of her  at last on the eastern side of the sands they descried a large ship looming against the dark sky  there she is shouted the coxswain  the hawser was slipt and the boat detached from her bulky companion pushed into the very vortex of the breakers  to say that no other boat could have lived in such a sea would convey but a faint notion of the powers of this boat  any one of the deluging billows that again and again overwhelmed her would have swamped the best and largest boat that was ever launched and although the old lifeboats might have floated they certainly could not have made much progress in such a sea owing to the difficulty of getting rid of the water  but the ramsgate boat was empty a few seconds after being filled  the men had to take no thought as to this except to see to it that they should not be washed out of her  on getting alongside they found the wreck to be a very large ship  its black hull towered high above them and the great yards swayed with fearful violence over their heads  a single glance showed that she was crowded with men and women  the grapnels were thrown and guy starting up seized the immense boathook used by lifeboats and stood ready to hook on to the rigging he succeeded in fixing the hook but a violent lurch of the ship tore the handle out of his grasp and cast him into the bottom of the boat just then a man was seen to run out on the mainyard and slip down by a rope close to the sea  the boat sheered up towards him and several arms were stretched out to save but the boat glided away and the succeeding wave engulfed him  only for a second however  when it passed the man was still seen clinging to the rope the boat once again sheered up so close that he was induced to let go his hold  he dropped into the sea close alongside caught one of the lifelines and next instant was in the boat  all right  give me the boathook he cried seizing the handle as he spoke and affixing it with the strength of a giant to the chains of the ship  the tone of this mans voice thrilled to guys heart  he sprang forward and seized him by the arm  one glance was sufficient  bax  guy  there was no time for more  the astonishment of both was extreme as may well be supposed and that of guy was much increased when he heard another familiar voice shout  all right bax  all right tommy let them look alive with the women and children get up a light if you can  there were others in the lifeboat who recognised these voices but life and death were trembling in the balance at that moment they dared not unbend their attention from the one main object for an instant  some one in the trident for it was indeed that illfated ship seemed to have anticipated baxs wish  just as he spoke a torch made of tar and oakum was lighted and revealed the crowded decks the raging sea that sought to swallow them up and the lifeboat surging violently alongside  it was an appalling scene the shrieks of the women and children mingled with the howling wind the rush of the waves on the ships side and the shouting of men created a din so horrible that many a stout heart quailed  fortunately the men who were the most active in the work of saving others were so taken up with what they were about that there was no room for thought of personal danger  the first human being placed in the boat was a little child  its mother despairing of being saved herself pressed through the crowd held her little one over the side and cried out save my child  bax leaped on the airchamber at the bow of the boat and grasping the shoulder of a boatman with one hand stretched out the other towards the child but the boat swooped forward and brought him close under the chains where a sailor held a woman suspended in his arm ready to drop her into the boat when it should come close alongside  it did not however approach sufficiently near  the next wave carried them back and enabled bax to seize the child and lay it in a place of safety  the mother was soon beside it and in a short time the boat was quite filled  bax then leaped into the mizzenchains the lifeboat pushed off and conveyed her cargo to the steamtug  they took off 25 women and children the first trip  the steamer then towed the boat into position to enable her again to make straight for the wreck  by this means much valuable time was saved and more trips were made than could have been accomplished in the time by any lifeboat without the aid of a steamer  all the women and children and some of the male passengers had been safely conveyed to the tug when an accident happened which wellnigh destroyed the boat  this was the sudden falling of the mainmast of the trident  with a rending crash it fell on the boat overturned it and held it down so that its selfrighting principle was neutralised  the crew being secured against sinking by their lifejackets succeeded in clambering into the shipmany of them more or less bruised and cut the coxswain however did not appear he seemed to have been lost  hes under the boat gasped guy who having been entangled in the wreck of the mast was the last to get on board  axes men shouted the captain of the trident  a hundred pounds to the man who saves him cried a voice from the quarterdeck  who is this that is so liberal of his gold at a time when a hundred thousand pounds could not avail to save one hair of his own head  he clings to the mizzenshrouds with a face so ashy pale that guy foster scarce recognises his own uncle  ah  denham you have seen a storm and a wreck at last in circumstances you little dreamed of when years ago guy predicted that you would change your mind in regard to these matters and it would seem that your experience has done you no little good  but although mr denham shouted his best no one heard him  not the less on that account however did the strong men wield their axes and hew asunder the tough ropes and spars  bax as usual was prominent in action  he toiled as if for life and so it was for life though not his own  small was the hope yet it was enough to justify the toil the curvature of the lifeboat was so great that it was possible a portion of air sufficient to maintain life might be confined within it and so it turned out  for twenty minutes they toiled the boat was finally cleared bax struck the blow that set it free and dragged the coxswain out as it turned over  he was found to be alive though almost exhausted  once more they pushed off with a full load of human beings  among them were mr denham bax and tommy bogey  the greater part of the crew and some of the male passengers still remained in the wreck awaiting their turn  when the boat had advanced about a hundred yards a cry of distress was heard but the noise of wind and waves was so great that they thought it might have been mere imagination  nevertheless so much were they impressed that the coxswain put about and returned towards the wreck too soon they discovered that it had been the deathcry of those who were left behind for not a vestige of the trident remained the illfated vessel had been suddenly broken up and utterly swept away  in their anxiety to save any who might yet survive and be clinging to portions of the wreck the boat cruised about for some time and her captain was tempted to advance too far over the dangerous shoals  she struck suddenly with great violence and remained fast on the sands the utmost efforts were made to haul off but in vain  the boat was hurled again and again on the ridges of sandpassed over several of them and became hopelessly entangled  those wellknown ripples that one sees on the shore are on the goodwin sands magnified from an inch to nearly three feet  over these the boat now began to surge  hoist the sail up with it cried the coxswain as they suddenly passed into deeper water  some of the men began to hope that they had crossed the shoals but they were mistaken  the order was obeyed and the boat rushed forward wildly with its lee gunwale buried deep in the sea another moment and it struck again with tremendous violence  those on board would have been torn out of her had they not clung to the seats with the energy of despair  it now became clear to all who knew the locality that there was no alternative for them but to beat right across the sands  the violence of the gale had increased  the night was pitchy dark and the fearful shocks with which they struck the gigantic ripples on the banks sent despair to the hearts of all except the crew of the boat  these knowing her capabilities retained a vestige of hope  bax being ignorant on this point had given up all hope  he clung to the bollard close beside the coxswain  its all over with us at last he said as the boat struck heavily and was then lifted away on the crest of a roaring breaker  it may be so replied the coxswain calmly but if we escape being dashed on the wrecks that are scattered over the sands we may live it out yet  and what of mr denham the head of the wealthy firm who years ago had expressed the opinion that lifeboats were unnecessary and that those who devoted themselves to a seafaring life ought to make up their minds to the chances and risks attending such a life  what thought he as he lay there in the bottom of the boatterrified almost to death shaken and bruised by the repeated and awful shocks chilled by the intense cold and drenched to the skin with just enough life left to enable him to cling to a thwartwhat thought he on that terrible night  perchance he thought of his former life of pride selfishness and indifference to the woes of others  perhaps he reflected that his own neglect in other days had something to do with his being here now whatever he thought he spoke not  his face was deadly pale  his lips were blue  he crouched a hopeless a helpless and a pitiful object in the bottom of the lifeboat  presently they struck again  crash  every timber groaned as the boat turned broadside to the sea which made a clear breach over her  the coxswain and bax alone stood up both holding on to the mizzenmast the rest clung on as they best could to the thwarts sometimes buried in water often with only their heads above it  the tide was making and as the boat passed each shoal the bow lifted first and swung roundthen the stern and it was clear again but only to be hurled on the next ridge when the sea once more burst over it sweeping away everything that was loose  it became necessary to alter the trim of the boat by moving some of the men from one part to another  the coxswain shouted the order but only guy foster and two others were able to obey  all that the rest could do was to hold on with iron grasp for bare life  with some this had become the involuntary clutch of despair  thus on they went crashing and jerking from bank to bank amid the raging wind and surf and bitter cold  none save a lifeboat could have survived  to bax it seemed miraculous  what are you doin said he to one of the men near him  im takin off my lifebelt he replied itll be over all the quicker and i dont want to be beatin about over the sands alive or dead longer than i can help the sooner i go to the bottom the better  bax tried to cheer this man but in vain  at first a few of the more sanguine spirits among them had endeavoured to cheer their comrades but as time wore on their efforts ceased  all gave themselves up for lost and no word was spoken by any one save at long intervals when a brief sharp cry of agonising prayer escaped from those who looked to god for consolation  thus for two hours they beat over the sandsa distance of nearly two mileseach moment expecting to be overturned or dashed to pieces on some of the old wrecks  all this time the noblehearted coxswain remained at his post and bax stoodhopeless indeed yet watchful beside him  suddenly the beating from ridge to ridge ceased  the boat swung into deep water and rushed on her wild career over the foam  those who were not utterly exhausted noticed the fact and began to show symptoms of reviving hope and activity  others thoroughly worn out remained utterly indifferent to the change  yes the great danger was past  sail was quickly made  the storm was still wild as ever but with sufficient water below her winds and waves were powerless for evil to the lifeboat  rushing through the surf she soon gained the harbour of ramsgate and all on board were landed in safety  ay reader but the seeds of death had been sown that night  the boatmen returned to their homes and the saved passengers and crew of the trident were cared for by the authorities of the town but one sad result was that several of those who had so nobly risked their lives to save others never recovered from the effects of the sixteen hours of exposure to that pitiless storm  another and a glorious result was that a hundred and twenty souls were snatched from a watery grave    chapter twenty three  history of the lifeboat  we pause at this point in our story good reader to treat you to a little of what mankind is prone to consider dry namely a chapter of information and statistics  we dislike sailing under false colours therefore we warn you at the outset of the nature of what is to follow  and yet our subject ought not to be considered dry for it is indissolubly connected with salt water and if human hearts were suitably affected by the simple statement of facts drops of salt water would frequently moisten these pages  please do not skip  multum in parvo shall be our motto  lionel lukin a coachbuilder in london was the inventor of the lifeboat  he took out a patent for it on the 2nd november 1785 and wrote a pamphlet on lifeboats entitled the invention principles and construction of insubmergible boats  his boat was rendered buoyant by means of a projecting gunwale of cork and hollow aircases within it one of these being at the head the other at the stern  it was ballasted by means of a false iron keel  in these respects this boat possessed in rudimentary form the essentials of the lifeboat of the present day  a coble was converted into a lifeboat on these principles by lukin and launched at bamborough where in the course of the first year it was the means of saving many lives  this was the first lifeboat ever brought into action  lukin though a man of energy and perseverance was doomed to disappointment  the prince of wales george the fourth to his credit be it said was his warm and liberal patron but even the princes influence failed to awaken the sympathy of the public or of the men in high places who alone could bring this great invention into general use people in those days appeared to think that the annual drowning of thousands of their countrymen was an unavoidable necessitythe price we had to pay as it were for our maritime prosperity  lukin appealed in vain to the first lord of the admiralty and to many other influential men but a deaf ear was invariably turned to him  with the exception of the bamborough coble not a single lifeboat was placed at any of the dangerous localities on the east coast of england for several years  wrecked men and women and children were as far as the naval boards were concerned graciously permitted to swim ashore if they could or to go to the bottom if they couldnt  ultimately the inventor of the lifeboat went to his grave unrewarded and unacknowledgedat least by the nation though the lives saved through his invention were undoubtedly a reward beyond all price  the high honour of having constructed and set in motion a species of boat which has saved hundreds and thousands of human lives and perchance prevented the breaking of many human hearts is certainly due to lionel lukin  in 1789 the public were roused from their state of apathy in regard to shipwrecked seamen by the wreck of the adventure of newcastle the crew of which perished in the presence of thousands who could do nothing to save them  under the excitement of this disaster the inhabitants of south shields met to deplore and to consult  a committee was appointed and premiums were offered for the best models of lifeboats  men came forward and two stood preeminentmr william wouldhave a painter and mr henry greathead a boatbuilder of south shields  the former seems to have been the first who had a glimmering idea of the selfrighting principle but he never brought it to anything  cork was the buoyant principle in his boat  greathead suggested a curved keel the chairman of the committee modelled a boat in clay which combined several of the good qualities of each and this was given to greathead as the type of the boat he was to build  from this time forward lifeboats gradually multiplied  greathead became a noted improver and builder of them  he was handsomely rewarded for his useful labours by government and others and his name became so intimately and deservedly associated with the lifeboat that people erroneously gave him the credit of being its inventor  the duke of northumberland took a deep interest in the subject of lifeboats and expended money liberally in constructing and supporting them  before the close of 1863 greathead had built 31 boats 18 for england 5 for scotland and 8 for foreign countries  this was so far well but it was a wretchedly inadequate provision for the necessities of the case  interest had indeed been awakened in the public but the public cannot act as a united body and the trinity house seemed to fall back into the sleep from which it had been partially aroused  it was not till 1822 that the great because successful champion of the lifeboat stood forthin the person of sir william hillary baronet  sir william besides being a philanthropist was a hero  he not only devised liberal things and carried them into execution but he personally shared in the danger of rescuing life from the raging sea our space forbids a memoir but this much may be said briefly  he dwelt on the coast of the isle of man and established a sailors home at douglas  he constantly witnessed the horrors of shipwreck and seemed to make it his favourite occupation to act as one of the crew of boats that put off to wrecks  he was of course frequently in imminent danger once had his ribs broken and was nearly drowned oftentimes  during his career he personally assisted in saving 305 lives  he was the means of stirring up public men and the nation generally to a higher sense of their duty to those who risk their lives upon the sea and eventually in conjunction with two members of parliament mr thomas wilson and mr george hibbertwas the founder of the royal national institution for the preservation of life from shipwreck  this noble institutionnow named the royal national lifeboat institutionwas founded on the 4th of march 1824  from that date to the present time it has unremittingly carried out the great ends for which it was instituted  let us glance at these in detail as given in their publication the lifeboat journal  the objects of the institution are effected  1st by the stationing of lifeboats fully equipped with all necessary gear and means of security to those who man them and with transporting carriages on which they can be drawn by land to the neighbourhood of distant wrecks and by the erection of suitable houses in which the same are kept  2nd by the appointment of paid coxswains who have charge of and are held responsible for the good order and efficiency of the boats and by a quarterly exercise of the crew of each boat  3rd by a liberal remuneration of all those who risk their lives in going to the aid of wrecked persons whether in lifeboats or otherwise and by the rewarding with the gold or silver medal of the institution such persons as encounter great personal risk in the saving of life  4th by the superintendence of an honorary committee of residents in each locality who on their part undertake to collect locally what amount they are able of donations towards the first cost and of annual contributions towards the permanent expenses of their several establishments  in order to see how this work is and has been carried out let us look at the results as stated in the last annual report that for 1864  the lifeboats of the institution now number 132 and some of them were the means of saving no fewer than 417 lives during the past year nearly the whole of them in dangerous circumstances amidst high surfs when no other description of boats could have been launched with safety  they also took into port or materially assisted 17 vessels which might otherwise have been lost  the number of persons afloat in the boats on occasions of their being launched was 6000  in other words our army of coastheroes amounts apparently to that number  but in reality it is much larger for there are hundreds of willing volunteers all round the coast ready to man lifeboats if there were lifeboats to man although nearly every man of this 6000 risked his life again and again during the year not a single life was lost  nearly all these boats have been supplied with transporting carriages and boathouses by the institution  the cost in detail is as follows   lifeboat and her equipments300 pounds  transporting carriage      100 pounds  boathouse average cost  150 pounds  total                      550 pounds   the sums granted last year for the saving of 714 lives by lifeboats shoreboats etcetera amounted to nearly 1300 pounds about 1 pound 16 shillings 6 pence each life  fifteen silver medals and twentysix votes of thanks inscribed on vellum and parchment were also awarded for acts of extraordinary gallantry  the income of the institution in 1863 amounted to 21100 pounds fifteen new lifeboats were sent to various parts of the coast in that year  it is interesting to observe in the report the persons by whom donations are sometimes given to the institution  we read of 100 pounds from a sailors daughter and 100 pounds as a thankoffering for preservation at sea during the storm of 31st october last  another thankoffering of 20 pounds for preservation from imminent danger at sea appears in the list 100 pounds from a friend in gratitude to god for the preservation of his wife for another year and 20 pounds from a seamans daughter the produce of her needlework  among smaller sums we find 1 pound 6 shillings 9 pence collected in a sunday school 3 pounds 18 shillings 8 pence collected in a parish church as a new years offering  last and least in one sense though by no means least in another 1 shilling 6 pence in stamps from a sailors orphan child  the prayer naturally springs to ones lips god bless that dear orphan child but it has been already blessed with two of gods choicest giftsa sympathetic heart and an open hand  small sums like this are not in any sense to be despised  if the population of london alonetaking it at two millionswere individually to contribute 1 shilling 6 pence the sum would amount to 150000 pounds  why if everyone whose eye falls on this pageto descend to smaller numberswere to give a shilling it is not improbable that a sum would be raised sufficient to establish two lifeboats  see note 1  but there are those who besides being blessed with generous hearts are fortunate in possessing heavy purses  we find in the same report donations of from two hundred to two thousand pounds and legacies ranging from ten to a thousand pounds  the largest legacy that seems ever to have been bequeathed to the institution was that of 10000 pounds left in 1856 by captain hamilton fitzgerald rn one of the vicepresidents of the society  the mere mention of such sums may induce some to imagine that the coffers of the institution are in a very flourishing state  this would indeed be the case if the society had reached its culminating pointif everything were done that can be done for the preservation of life from shipwreck but this is by no means the case  it must be borne in mind that the institution is national  the entire coasts of the united kingdom are its field of operations and the drain upon its resources is apparently quite equal to its income  its chief means of support are voluntary contributions  since the society was instituted in 1824 to the present time it has been the means of saving 13570 livesmany if not most of these being lives of the utmost consequence to the commerce and defence of the country  during the same period it has granted 82 gold medals 736 silver medals and 17830 pounds in cash besides expending 82550 pounds on boats carriages and boathouses  considering then the magnitude and unavoidable costliness of the operations of this institution it is evident that a large annual income is indispensable if it is to continue its noble career efficiently  closely allied to this is another society which merits brief notice here  it is the shipwrecked fishermens and mariners royal benevolent society  originally this society which was instituted in 1839 maintained lifeboats on various parts of the coast  it eventually however made these over to the lifeboat institution and confined itself to its own special and truly philanthropic work which is  to board lodge and convey to their homes all destitute shipwrecked persons to whatever country they may belong through the instrumentality of its agents  to afford temporary assistance to the widows parents and children of all mariners and fishermen who may have been drowned and who were members of the society and to give a gratuity to mariners and fishermen who are members for the loss or damage of their clothes or boats  membership is obtained by an annual subscription of three shillings  assuredly every mariner and fisherman in the kingdom ought to be a member of this society for it is preeminently useful and no one can tell when he may require its assistance  the lifeboat institution and the shipwrecked fishermens and mariners society are distinct bodies but they do their benevolent work in harmonious concert  the one saves life or tries to save it the other cherishes the life so saved or comforts and affords timely aid to brokenhearted mourners for the dead  both institutions are national blessings and as such have the strongest possible claim on the sympathies of the nation    note 1  in case any reader should sympathise with us and desire to act on the above hint we subjoin the following address to which money may be sent the secretary of the royal national lifeboat institution 22 charing cross road london w    chapter twenty four  a meetinga death and a discovery  resuming our story we remind the reader that we left off just as the ramsgate lifeboat had gained a glorious victory over a great storm  availing ourselves of an authors privilege we now change the scene to the parlour of mrs fosters temporary lodgings at ramsgate whither the worthy lady had gone for change of air in company with her son guy her daughterinlaw lucy her little grandson charlie and her adopted daughter amy russell  bax is standing there alone  he looks like his former self in regard to costume for the only man approaching his own size who could lend him a suit of dry clothing happened to be a boatman so he is clad in the familiar rough coat with huge buttons the wide pantaloons and the souwester of former days  his countenance is changed however it is pale and troubled  on the way up from the harbour guy had told him that he was married and was surprised when bax instead of expressing a desire to be introduced to his wife made some wild proposal about going and looking after the people who had been saved  he was pleased however when bax suddenly congratulated him with great warmth and thereafter said with much firmness that he would go up to the house and see her  on this occasion also bax had told his friend that all the produce of his labour since he went away now lay buried in the goodwin sands  bax was ruminating on these things when the door opened and guy entered leading lucy by the hand  miss burton exclaimed bax springing forward  my wife said guy with a puzzled look  bax exclaimed lucy grasping his hand warmly and kissing it surely you knew that i was married to guy  bax did not reply  his chest heaved his lips were tightly compressed and his nostrils dilated as he gazed alternately at guy and lucy  at last he spoke in deep almost inaudible tones  miss russellis she still  my sister is still with us  i have told her you are come  she will be here directly said guy  as he spoke the door opened and mrs foster entered with amy leaning on her arm  the latter was very pale and trembled slightly  on seeing bax the blood rushed to her temples and then fled back to her heart she sank on a chair  the sailor was at her side in a moment he caught her as she was in the act of falling and going down on one knee supported her head on his shoulder  bring water she has fainted he cried  dear miss russelldearest amyoh my beloved girl look up  stunned and terrified though poor mrs foster was as she rushed about the room in search of water and scentbottles she was taken aback somewhat by the warmth of these expressions which bax in the strength of his feelings and the excitement of the moment uttered quite unconsciously  guy was utterly confounded for the truth now for the first time flashed upon him and when he beheld his friend tenderly press his lips on the fair forehead of the still insensible amy it became clear beyond a doubt  lucy was also amazed for although she was aware of amys love for bax she had never dreamed that it was returned  suddenly guys pentup surprise and excitement broke forth  seizing mrs foster by the shoulders he stared into her face and said mother i have been an ass an absolute donkeyand a blind one too ohha come along ill explain myself  lucy i shall require your assistance  without more ado guy led his mother and lucy forcibly out of the room and bax and amy were left alone    again we change the scene  the sandhills lying to the north of deal are before us and the shadows of night are beginning to deepen over the bleak expanse of downs  a fortnight has passed away  during that period bax experienced the great delight of feeling assured that amy loved him and the great misery of knowing that he had not a sixpence in the world  of course guy sought to cheer him by saying that there would be no difficulty in getting him the command of a ship but bax was not cheered by the suggestion he felt depressed and proposed to guy that they should take a ramble together over the sandhills  leaving the cottage to which the family had returned the day before the two friends walked in the direction of sandown castle  what say you to visit old jeph said guy i have never felt easy about him since he made me order his coffin and pay his debts  with all my heart said bax  i spent a couple of hours with him this forenoon and he appeared to me better than usual  seeing tommy and me again has cheered him greatly poor old man  stay i will run back for the packet he left with me to give to you he may perhaps wish to give it you with his own hand  guy ran back to the cottage and quickly returned with the packet  old jephs door was open when they approached his humble abode  guy knocked gently but receiving no answer entered the house  to their surprise and alarm they found the old mans bed empty  everything else in the room was in its usual place  the little table stood at the bedside with the large old bible on it and the bundle of receipts that guy had placed there on the day he paid the old mans debts  in a corner lay the black coffin with the windingsheet carefully folded on the lid  there was no sign of violence having been done and the friends were forced to the conclusion that jeph had quitted the place of his own accord  as he had been confined to bed ever since his illness about two weeksthis sudden disappearance was naturally alarming  there seems to have been no foul play said bax examining hastily the several closets in the room  where can he have gone  the tomb said guy as jephs old habit recurred to his memory  right exclaimed bax eagerly  come lets go quickly  they hastened out and breaking into a smart run soon reached the sandhills  neither of them spoke for each felt deep anxiety about the old man whose weak condition rendered it extremely improbable that he could long survive the shock that his system must have sustained by such a walk at such an hour  passing the checkers of the hope they soon reached mary baxs tomb the solitary stone threw a long dark shadow over the waste as the moon rose slowly behind it  this shadow concealed the grave until they were close beside it  ah he is here said bax kneeling down  guy knelt beside him and assisted to raise their old friend who lay extended on the grave  bax moved him so as to get from beneath the shadow of the stone and called him gently by name but he did not answer  when the moonlight next moment fell on his countenance the reason of his silence was sufficiently obvious  old jeph was dead  with tender care they lifted the body in their arms and bore it to the cottage where they laid it on the bed and sitting down beside it conversed for some time in low sad tones  bax said guy pulling the sealed packet from his breastpocket had you not better open this  it may perhaps contain some instructions having reference to his last restingplace  true replied bax breaking the seals  dear old jeph it is sad to lose you in this sudden way without a parting word or blessing  what have we here he continued unrolling several pieces of brown paper it feels like a key  as he spoke a small letter dropt from the folds of the brown paper with an oldfashioned key tied to it by a piece of twine  opening the letter he read as follows    dear baxwhen you get this i shall be where the wicked cease from   troubling and the weary are at rest  there is a hide in the   northwest corner of my room in the old house between the beam and   the wall  the key that is enclosed herewith will open it  i used to   hide baccy there in my smugglin days but since i left off that ive   never used it  there you will find a bag of gold  how much is in it   i know not  it was placed there by an old mate of mine more than   forty years ago  he was a great man for the guinea trade that was   carried on with france in the time of boneys wars  i never rightly   myself understood that business  im told that boney tried to get all   the gold out o this country by payin three shillings more than each   guinea was worth for it but that seems unreasonable to me   howsever although i never could rightly understand it there is no   doubt that some of our lads were consarned in smugglin guineas across   the channel and two or three of em made a good thing of it  my mate   was one o the lucky ones  one night he came home with a bag o gold   and tumbled it out on the table before me  i had my suspicions that   he had not come honestly by it so would have nothin to do with it   when i told him so he put it back into the bag tied it up and   replaced it in the hide and went away in a rage  he never came back   there was a storm from the eastard that night  two or three boats   were capsized and my mate and one or two more lads were drowned  the   guineas have lain in the hide ever since  ive often thought o usin   them but somehow or other never could make up my mind  you may call   this foolish mayhap it was anyhow i now leave the gold to youto   tommy if you never come back or to guy if he dont turn up   bluenose dont want it it would only bother him if i put it in his   way    this is all ive got to say the old house aint worth much but such   as it is its yours or it may go the same way as the guineas    now bax may god bless you and make you one of his own children   through jesus christ  my heart warms to you for your own sake and   for the sake of her whose name you bear  farewellyour old friend   and mate jeph  bax stooped over the bed and pressed his lips to the dead mans forehead when he had finished reading this letter  for some time the two friends sat talking of old jephs sayings and doings in former days forgetful of the treasure of which the epistle spoke  at last bax rose and drew a table to the corner mentioned in the letter  getting upon this he found an old board nailed against the wall  hand me that axe guy it must be behind this  the board was soon wrenched off and a small door revealed in the wall the key opened it at once and inside a bag was found  untying this bax emptied the glittering contents on the table  it was a large heap amounting to five hundred guineas  i congratulate you bax said guy this removes a great difficulty out of your way  five hundred guineas will give you a fair start  do you suppose that i will appropriate this to myself said bax  you and tommy are mentioned in the letter as well as me  you may do as you please in regard to tommy said guy but as for me i have a good salary and wont touch a guinea of it  well well said bax with a sad smile this is neither the time nor place to talk of such matters  it is time to give notice of the old mans death  saying this he returned the gold to its former place locked the hide and replaced the board  as he was doing this a peculiar cut in the beam over his head caught his eye  i do believe here is another hide said he  hand the axe again  a piece of wood was soon forced out of the side of the beam next the wall and it was discovered that the beam itself was hollow  nothing was found in it however except a crumpled piece of paper  see here there is writing on this said guy picking up the paper which bax flung down  it is a crabbed hand but i think i can make it outdear bogue you will find the tubs down pegwell bay with the sinkers on em the rest of the swag in fiddlers cave  humph an old smugglers letter said bax  mayhap the tubs and swag are there yet  we may remark here that long after the events now related bax and guy remembered this note and visited the spots mentioned out of curiosity but neither tubs nor swag were found  quitting the room with heavy hearts the two friends locked the door and went in search of those who are wont to perform the last offices to the dead    chapter twenty five  the conclusion  there came a day at last when the rats in redwharf lane obtained an entire holiday doubtless to their own amazement and revelled in almost unmolested felicity from morning till night  the office of denham crumps and company was shut the reason being that the head of the firm was dead  mr denham had died without a will  at the time when guy offended his uncle by expressing his opinion too freely denham vowed in his heart that his nephew should not inherit his business or fortune  he resolved to leave both to another nephew the son of a younger brother at that time in the east india companys service  but as death was a contingency inconceivably remote from himself at least in his own opinion he did not think it necessary to make his will at that time  he died therefore as we have said without making it  he died also without carrying out any of his good intentions  it is a common mistake to suppose that a man has only to repent of his evil deeds and that thenceforth all will be plain sailing  the habits of a lifetime are not to be overcome without a hard struggle even in the most sincere of christians  denham after being saved by the ramsgate lifeboat had made up his mind to turn his wealth to good account and in his philanthropic plans had resolved to look with special favour on the lifeboat institution  but he delayed to carry out these plans  he did not strike when the iron was hot and so the iron began slowly to cool  he had also determined to reinstate bax in his employment and to take guy into partnership but he delayed in these matters also  the love of gold and the memory of fancied insults began to tell on him as of old  he even went so far as to meditate carrying out his former intention of making his will in favour of the nephew in india  still denham did not fall back to his old position  a struggle which began when he resided with his sister at deal went on in his breast continually  while this struggle was yet undecided a fever seized him his constitution weakened by the hardships which he had so recently undergone gave way and he died  the result was that the business fell to the nextofkinmrs foster whose son in the natural course of things stepped into his uncles shoes  the result of this was that poor denhams good resolves and a great many more good resolves than denham could ever have conceived of were carried out in a way that would have amazed him had he been there to see it and that almost took the breath away from old mr crumps  a glance at guy in his office not long after his uncles death will show the reader how things were managed by the new head of the firm  guy was seated in denhams chair at denhams desk reading and writing what in former days would have been denhams letters  presently mr crumps entered  i was just going to ask you to consult with me said guy pray sit down sit down mr crumps  the old man in his modesty meant to stand as in former days he would have stood before denham  here is a letter from a friend continued guy asking for a contribution towards the establishment of a lifeboat on the coast of wales  he reminds me that i myself was once indebted to the services of a lifeboat when my life was in great danger and hopes that i will respond liberally to his appeal  his name is clelland  he was on board the old trident when she was wrecked in saint margarets bay  i made his acquaintance then  now what do you think we ought to give  i should like to have your advice on this point and on several other matters of a similar nature mr crumps because there has been no regular charity account in our ledger i find and i would like to open one  dont you think it would be as well to open one  mr crumps thought it would andbeing a man of naturally charitable and liberal impulses who had been constantly snubbed by mr denham for many years pasthe felt overjoyed at the prospect of a new era opening up before him  well what shall we send to mr clelland pursued guy  mr crumps unable all at once to get over old habits and associations suggested fifty pounds timidly  the district is a poor one said guy perhaps that being the case  say a hundred put in crumps eagerly and then in a partially apologetic tone the business can afford it my dear sir  heaven knows it is but little that  the old mans voice faltered and stopped  he was going to have made a remark that would have cast a slur on the character of his late partner so he checked himself and sighed  well then it shall be a hundred said guy jotting down the sum on a slip of paper  i would not advise more to be given to that particular district just now because it might tend to check the efforts of the people on the spot  if they fail to raise the requisite sum we can then give what is necessary  now there is an urgent appeal for funds being made just now to the public by the lifeboat institution  i think this a good opportunity to give away some of the cash which ought to have been  guy hesitated  he too was about to make a remark that would have been unfavourable to the character of his late uncle so he checked himself  what do you say to giving them a thousand pounds  mr crumps said nothing to it  he was too much taken aback to say anything but when he saw that guy had jotted the sum down and was apparently in earnest he nodded his head blew his nose violently for a man of his years and character and chuckled  well then continued guy there is another subject which occurs to me just now although it does not come under the head of charities  i wish to supply a ships lifeboat to every vessel that belongs to us and a set of lifebelts besides other things  i estimate that this will require a sum of nearly two thousand pounds  let me see  here guy began to jot and calculate and to talk to himself in an undertone while mr crumps utterly bereft of speech sat staring in amazement and delight at his young partner  while they were thus engaged the tiger in blue who had supplanted peekins entered and said that three gentlemen wished to see mr foster  show them in said guy  sit still mr crumps i have not yet done with my calculations  in a few seconds bax bluenose and tommy bogey were ushered into the office  the latter had become a tall handsome stripling during his residence abroad and bid fair to rival bax himself in stature  they shook hands cordially with guy and mr crumps  well bax is the new ship a good one said guy dyou think she will suit you  that will she said bax with a gratified look  as the old song says    shes a ship thats as tight to my fancy   as ever sailed oer the salt seas  i think she will be ready for sea in a couple of months  by that time i will be ready to take command if you choose to trust her to me  trust her to you bax  do you think we may trust our new vessel to him mr crumps inquired guy with a smile  mr crumps not having recovered the power of speech nodded his head and rubbed his hands slowly a benignant smile playing on his old face the while  well then continued bax amy so far from making any objection to going to sea with me says that she wont let me go away without her so thats settled and the wedding day is fixed for monday next week  but im not satisfied yet  i want you to do me still another favour guy  what is that  to let tommy bogey go as supercargo  hes seaman enough to go as first mate but hes too young for that yet  also i want to take bluenose as a free passenger  a free passenger said guy looking at the captain with surprise  yes you see said bluenose modestly im raither moloncholy about old jeph an if bax and tommy leave me ill feel quite desarted like moreover i wants to see furrin partsspecially the antypodes  but i haint blunt enough to pay my passage dye see and soand so  in short interpolated tommy hes blunt enough to ask a free one  a1 on lloyds said bluenose looking at tommy with a broad grin for the captain regarded all his nephews jokesgood bad and indifferentas being perfect  it need scarcely be said that guy readily agreed to their request and that mr crumps was ready to agree to whatsoever guy proposed  these matters being happily settled the trio having been invited to dine with guy at a neighbouring chophouse at five oclock rose and left the partners to continue their consultation    from that time forward bax and tommy bogey remained in the service of denham crumps and company and amy russell went regularly to sea with her husband  bluenose was afterwards appointed coxswain to a lifeboat on the coast of kent where he rendered good service in many a wild storm and was the means of snatching many a fellowcreature from the devouring sea  his friend coleman happened to be on the coastguard station near him and many a pipe did these two smoke together under the lee of the boathousespinning yarns of other days chiefly connected with the sea and shipwrecks  old coleman had had considerable experience in rough coast life and was well able to speak on such subjects  the records of the lifeboat institution show that about onethird of the medals and rewards granted for meritorious services are awarded to men of the coastguard  old coleman was one of those who had taken his full share of the dangerous work of saving life  he was also gifted with that rare qualitythe power of telling a story well so that he and bluenose became fast friends and constant companions during their residence on the kentish coast  similarity of tastes and desires drew other members of our tale together besides coleman and bluenose  old mr summers and mr clelland the dark passenger in the trident found such a strong bond of sympathy existing between them that they took cottages in juxtaposition in the town of deal and went about continually doing good  mrs foster lucy and guy were allies as a matter of course rodney nick improved somewhat in his character and became a respectable boatman  people said that mr burton the missionary to seamen had something to do with this improvement  it is not improbable that he had  but long orrick died as he had liveda notorious and incorrigible smuggler  peekins was changed from a tiger into a clerk and in process of time came to keep the books of that celebrated firm in which he had originally figured as a spider in blue tights and buttons  bax and tommy sailed together for several years  they also engaged in mercantile ventures to china on their own account and were so prosperous in their career that they realised ample fortunes and finally settled near each other on the coast of kent  here they resumed their old career of saving human life  they became noted as men who were ready to devise and prompt to act in cases of emergency  they helped to man the lifeboat in their neighbourhood when occasion required  they were the means of establishing a library and a mission to seamen and were regarded as a blessing to the district in which they dwelt  they were literally heroes of the coast for they spent their time in doing good to those whose lot it is to brave the dangers of the deep and sweep the stormy sea  the end
