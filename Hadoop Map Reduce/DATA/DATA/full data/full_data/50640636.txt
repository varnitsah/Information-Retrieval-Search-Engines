50640636	the formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms with observations on their habits  by charles darwin     introduction    the share which worms have taken in the formation of the layer of  vegetable mould which covers the whole surface of the land in  every moderately humid country is the subject of the present  volume  this mould is generally of a blackish colour and a few  inches in thickness  in different districts it differs but little  in appearance although it may rest on various subsoils  the  uniform fineness of the particles of which it is composed is one of  its chief characteristic features and this may be well observed in  any gravelly country where a recentlyploughed field immediately  adjoins one which has long remained undisturbed for pasture and  where the vegetable mould is exposed on the sides of a ditch or  hole  the subject may appear an insignificant one but we shall  see that it possesses some interest and the maxim de minimis non  curat lex does not apply to science  even elie de beaumont who  generally undervalues small agencies and their accumulated effects  remarks  1 la couche tresmince de la terre vegetale est un  monument dune haute antiquite et par le fait de sa permanence  un objet digne doccuper le geologue et capable de lui fournir des  remarques interessantes  although the superficial layer of  vegetable mould as a whole no doubt is of the highest antiquity  yet in regard to its permanence we shall hereafter see reason to  believe that its component particles are in most cases removed at  not a very slow rate and are replaced by others due to the  disintegration of the underlying materials  as i was led to keep in my study during many months worms in pots  filled with earth i became interested in them and wished to learn  how far they acted consciously and how much mental power they  displayed  i was the more desirous to learn something on this  head as few observations of this kind have been made as far as i  know on animals so low in the scale of organization and so poorly  provided with senseorgans as are earthworms  in the year 1837 a short paper was read by me before the  geological society of london 2 on the formation of mould in  which it was shown that small fragments of burnt marl cinders  c which had been thickly strewed over the surface of several  meadows were found after a few years lying at the depth of some  inches beneath the turf but still forming a layer  this apparent  sinking of superficial bodies is due as was first suggested to me  by mr wedgwood of maer hall in staffordshire to the large  quantity of fine earth continually brought up to the surface by  worms in the form of castings  these castings are sooner or later  spread out and cover up any object left on the surface  i was thus  led to conclude that all the vegetable mould over the whole country  has passed many times through and will again pass many times  through the intestinal canals of worms  hence the term animal  mould would be in some respects more appropriate than that  commonly used of vegetable mould  ten years after the publication of my paper m darchiac  evidently influenced by the doctrines of elie de beaumont wrote  about my singuliere theorie and objected that it could apply  only to les prairies basses et humides and that les terres  labourees les bois les prairies elevees napportent aucune  preuve a lappui de cette maniere de voir 3  but m darchiac  must have thus argued from inner consciousness and not from  observation for worms abound to an extraordinary degree in kitchen  gardens where the soil is continually worked though in such loose  soil they generally deposit their castings in any open cavities or  within their old burrows instead of on the surface  hensen  estimates that there are about twice as many worms in gardens as in  cornfields 4  with respect to prairies elevees i do not know  how it may be in france but nowhere in england have i seen the  ground so thickly covered with castings as on commons at a height  of several hundred feet above the sea  in woods again if the  loose leaves in autumn are removed the whole surface will be found  strewed with castings  dr king the superintendent of the botanic  garden in calcutta to whose kindness i am indebted for many  observations on earthworms informs me that he found near nancy  in france the bottom of the state forests covered over many acres  with a spongy layer composed of dead leaves and innumerable worm castings  he there heard the professor of amenagement des forets  lecturing to his pupils and pointing out this case as a beautiful  example of the natural cultivation of the soil for year after year  the thrownup castings cover the dead leaves the result being a  rich humus of great thickness  in the year 1869 mr fish 5 rejected my conclusions with respect  to the part which worms have played in the formation of vegetable  mould merely on account of their assumed incapacity to do so much  work  he remarks that considering their weakness and their size  the work they are represented to have accomplished is stupendous   here we have an instance of that inability to sum up the effects of  a continually recurrent cause which has often retarded the  progress of science as formerly in the case of geology and more  recently in that of the principle of evolution  although these several objections seemed to me to have no weight  yet i resolved to make more observations of the same kind as those  published and to attack the problem on another side namely to  weigh all the castings thrown up within a given time in a measured  space instead of ascertaining the rate at which objects left on  the surface were buried by worms  but some of my observations have  been rendered almost superfluous by an admirable paper by hensen  already alluded to which appeared in 1877 6  before entering on  details with respect to the castings it will be advisable to give  some account of the habits of worms from my own observations and  from those of other naturalists  first edition october 10th 1881    chapter ihabits of worms    nature of the sites

digestion calciferous glands structure ofcalcareous concretions formed in  the anterior pair of glandsthe calcareous matter primarily an  excretion but secondarily serves to neutralise the acids generated  during the digestive process   earthworms are distributed throughout the world under the form of  a few genera which externally are closely similar to one another   the british species of lumbricus have never been carefully  monographed but we may judge of their probable number from those  inhabiting neighbouring countries  in scandinavia there are eight  species according to eisen 7 but two of these rarely burrow in  the ground and one inhabits very wet places or even lives under  the water  we are here concerned only with the kinds which bring  up earth to the surface in the form of castings  hoffmeister says  that the species in germany are not well known but gives the same  number as eisen together with some strongly marked varieties 8  earthworms abound in england in many different stations  their  castings may be seen in extraordinary numbers on commons and chalk downs so as almost to cover the whole surface where the soil is  poor and the grass short and thin  but they are almost or quite as  numerous in some of the london parks where the grass grows well  and the soil appears rich  even on the same field worms are much  more frequent in some places than in others without any visible  difference in the nature of the soil  they abound in paved court yards close to houses and an instance will be given in which they  had burrowed through the floor of a very damp cellar  i have seen  worms in black peat in a boggy field but they are extremely rare  or quite absent in the drier brown fibrous peat which is so much  valued by gardeners  on dry sandy or gravelly tracks where heath  with some gorse ferns coarse grass moss and lichens alone grow  hardly any worms can be found  but in many parts of england  wherever a path crosses a heath its surface becomes covered with a  fine short sward  whether this change of vegetation is due to the  taller plants being killed by the occasional trampling of man and  animals or to the soil being occasionally manured by the droppings  from animals i do not know 9  on such grassy paths worm castings may often be seen  on a heath in surrey which was  carefully examined there were only a few castings on these paths  where they were much inclined but on the more level parts where a  bed of fine earth had been washed down from the steeper parts and  had accumulated to a thickness of a few inches wormcastings  abounded  these spots seemed to be overstocked with worms so that  they had been compelled to spread to a distance of a few feet from  the grassy paths and here their castings had been thrown up among  the heath but beyond this limit not a single casting could be  found  a layer though a thin one of fine earth which probably  long retains some moisture is in all cases as i believe  necessary for their existence and the mere compression of the soil  appears to be in some degree favourable to them for they often  abound in old gravel walks and in footpaths across fields  beneath large trees few castings can be found during certain  seasons of the year and this is apparently due to the moisture  having been sucked out of the ground by the innumerable roots of  the trees for such places may be seen covered with castings after  the heavy autumnal rains  although most coppices and woods support  many worms yet in a forest of tall and ancient beechtrees in  knole park where the ground beneath was bare of all vegetation  not a single casting could be found over wide spaces even during  the autumn  nevertheless castings were abundant on some grass covered glades and indentations which penetrated this forest  on  the mountains of north wales and on the alps worms as i have been  informed are in most places rare and this may perhaps be due to  the close proximity of the subjacent rocks into which worms cannot  burrow during the winter so as to escape being frozen  dr  mcintosh however found wormcastings at a height of 1500 feet on  schiehallion in scotland  they are numerous on some hills near  turin at from 2000 to 3000 feet above the sea and at a great  altitude on the nilgiri mountains in south india and on the  himalaya  earthworms must be considered as terrestrial animals though they  are still in one sense semiaquatic like the other members of the  great class of annelids to which they belong  m perrier found  that their exposure to the dry air of a room for only a single  night was fatal to them  on the other hand he kept several large  worms alive for nearly four months completely submerged in water  10  during the summer when the ground is dry they penetrate to a  considerable depth and cease to work as they do during the winter  when the ground is frozen  worms are nocturnal in their habits  and at night may be seen crawling about in large numbers but  usually with their tails still inserted in their burrows  by the  expansion of this part of their bodies and with the help of the  short slightly reflexed bristles with which their bodies are  armed they hold so fast that they can seldom be dragged out of the  ground without being torn into pieces 11  during the day they  remain in their burrows except at the pairing season when those  which inhabit adjoining burrows expose the greater part of their  bodies for an hour or two in the early morning  sick individuals  which are generally affected by the parasitic larvae of a fly must  also be excepted as they wander about during the day and die on  the surface  after heavy rain succeeding dry weather an  astonishing number of dead worms may sometimes be seen lying on the  ground  mr galton informs me that on one such occasion march  1881 the dead worms averaged one for every two and a half paces  in length on a walk in hyde park four paces in width  he counted  no less than 45 dead worms in one place in a length of sixteen  paces  from the facts above given it is not probable that these  worms could have been drowned and if they had been drowned they  would have perished in their burrows  i believe that they were  already sick and that their deaths were merely hastened by the  ground being flooded  it has often been said that under ordinary circumstances healthy  worms never or very rarely completely leave their burrows at  night but this is an error as white of selborne long ago knew   in the morning after there has been heavy rain the film of mud or  of very fine sand over gravelwalks is often plainly marked with  their tracks  i have noticed this from august to may both months  included and it probably occurs during the two remaining months of  the year when they are wet  on these occasions very few dead  worms could anywhere be seen  on january 31 1881 after a long continued and unusually severe frost with much snow as soon as a  thaw set in the walks were marked with innumerable tracks  on one  occasion five tracks were counted crossing a space of only an inch  square  they could sometimes be traced either to or from the  mouths of the burrows in the gravelwalks for distances between 2  or 3 up to 15 yards  i have never seen two tracks leading to the  same burrow nor is it likely from what we shall presently see of  their senseorgans that a worm could find its way back to its  burrow after having once left it  they apparently leave their  burrows on a voyage of discovery and thus they find new sites to  inhabit  morren states 12 that worms often lie for hours almost motionless  close beneath the mouths of their burrows  i have occasionally  noticed the same fact with worms kept in pots in the house so that  by looking down into their burrows their heads could just be seen   if the ejected earth or rubbish over the burrows be suddenly  removed the end of the worms body may very often be seen rapidly  retreating  this habit of lying near the surface leads to their  destruction to an immense extent  every morning during certain  seasons of the year the thrushes and blackbirds on all the lawns  throughout the country draw out of their holes an astonishing  number of worms and this they could not do unless they lay close  to the surface  it is not probable that worms behave in this  manner for the sake of breathing fresh air for we have seen that  they can live for a long time under water  i believe that they lie  near the surface for the sake of warmth especially in the morning  and we shall hereafter find that they often coat the mouths of  their burrows with leaves apparently to prevent their bodies from  coming into close contact with the cold damp earth  it is said  that they completely close their burrows during the winter  structurea few remarks must be made on this subject  the body  of a large worm consists of from 100 to 200 almost cylindrical  rings or segments each furnished with minute bristles  the  muscular system is well developed  worms can crawl backwards as  well as forwards and by the aid of their affixed tails can retreat  with extraordinary rapidity into their burrows  the mouth is  situated at the anterior end of the body and is provided with a  little projection lobe or lip as it has been variously called  which is used for prehension  internally behind the mouth there  is a strong pharynx shown in the accompanying diagram fig 1  which is pushed forwards when the animal eats and this part  corresponds according to perrier with the protrudable trunk or  proboscis of other annelids  the pharynx leads into the  oesophagus on each side of which in the lower part there are three  pairs of large glands which secrete a surprising amount of  carbonate of lime  these calciferous glands are highly remarkable  for nothing like them is known in any other animal  their use will  be discussed when we treat of the digestive process  in most of  the species the oesophagus is enlarged into a crop in front of the  gizzard  this latter organ is lined with a smooth thick chitinous  membrane and is surrounded by weak longitudinal but powerful  transverse muscles  perrier saw these muscles in energetic action  and as he remarks the trituration of the food must be chiefly  effected by this organ for worms possess no jaws or teeth of any  kind  grains of sand and small stones from the 120 to a little  more than the 110 inch in diameter may generally be found in  their gizzards and intestines  as it is certain that worms swallow  many little stones independently of those swallowed while  excavating their burrows it is probable that they serve like  millstones to triturate their food  the gizzard opens into the  intestine which runs in a straight course to the vent at the  posterior end of the body  the intestine presents a remarkable  structure the typhlosolis or as the old anatomists called it an  intestine within an intestine and claparede 13 has shown that  this consists of a deep longitudinal involution of the walls of the  intestine by which means an extensive absorbent surface is gained  the circulatory system is well developed  worms breathe by their  skin as they do not possess any special respiratory organs  the  two sexes are united in the same individual but two individuals  pair together  the nervous system is fairly well developed and  the two almost confluent cerebral ganglia are situated very near to  the anterior end of the body  sensesworms are destitute of eyes and at first i thought that  they were quite insensible to light for those kept in confinement  were repeatedly observed by the aid of a candle and others out of  doors by the aid of a lantern yet they were rarely alarmed  although extremely timid animals  other persons have found no  difficulty in observing worms at night by the same means 14  hoffmeister however states 15 that worms with the exception of  a few individuals are extremely sensitive to light but he admits  that in most cases a certain time is requisite for its action   these statements led me to watch on many successive nights worms  kept in pots which were protected from currents of air by means of  glass plates  the pots were approached very gently in order that  no vibration of the floor should be caused  when under these  circumstances worms were illuminated by a bullseye lantern having  slides of dark red and blue glass which intercepted so much light  that they could be seen only with some difficulty they were not at  all affected by this amount of light however long they were  exposed to it  the light as far as i could judge was brighter  than that from the full moon  its colour apparently made no  difference in the result  when they were illuminated by a candle  or even by a bright paraffin lamp they were not usually affected  at first  nor were they when the light was alternately admitted  and shut off  sometimes however they behaved very differently  for as soon as the light fell on them they withdrew into their  burrows with almost instantaneous rapidity  this occurred perhaps  once out of a dozen times  when they did not withdraw instantly  they often raised the anterior tapering ends of their bodies from  the ground as if their attention was aroused or as if surprise was  felt or they moved their bodies from side to side as if feeling  for some object  they appeared distressed by the light but i  doubt whether this was really the case for on two occasions after  withdrawing slowly they remained for a long time with their  anterior extremities protruding a little from the mouths of their  burrows in which position they were ready for instant and complete  withdrawal  when the light from a candle was concentrated by means of a large  lens on the anterior extremity they generally withdrew instantly  but this concentrated light failed to act perhaps once out of half  a dozen trials  the light was on one occasion concentrated on a  worm lying beneath water in a saucer and it instantly withdrew  into its burrow  in all cases the duration of the light unless  extremely feeble made a great difference in the result for worms  left exposed before a paraffin lamp or a candle invariably  retreated into their burrows within from five to fifteen minutes  and if in the evening the pots were illuminated before the worms  had come out of their burrows they failed to appear  from the foregoing facts it is evident that light affects worms by  its intensity and by its duration  it is only the anterior  extremity of the body where the cerebral ganglia lie which is  affected by light as hoffmeister asserts and as i observed on  many occasions  if this part is shaded other parts of the body  may be fully illuminated and no effect will be produced  as these  animals have no eyes we must suppose that the light passes through  their skins and in some manner excites their cerebral ganglia  it  appeared at first probable that the different manner in which they  were affected on different occasions might be explained either by  the degree of extension of their skin and its consequent  transparency or by some particular incident of the light but i  could discover no such relation  one thing was manifest namely  that when worms were employed in dragging leaves into their burrows  or in eating them and even during the short intervals whilst they  rested from their work they either did not perceive the light or  were regardless of it and this occurred even when the light was  concentrated on them through a large lens  so again whilst they  are paired they will remain for an hour or two out of their  burrows fully exposed to the morning light but it appears from  what hoffmeister says that a light will occasionally cause paired  individuals to separate  when a worm is suddenly illuminated and dashes like a rabbit into  its burrowto use the expression employed by a friendwe are at  first led to look at the action as a reflex one  the irritation of  the cerebral ganglia appears to cause certain muscles to contract  in an inevitable manner independently of the will or consciousness  of the animal as if it were an automaton  but the different  effect which a light produced on different occasions and  especially the fact that a worm when in any way employed and in the  intervals of such employment whatever set of muscles and ganglia  may then have been brought into play is often regardless of light  are opposed to the view of the sudden withdrawal being a simple  reflex action  with the higher animals when close attention to  some object leads to the disregard of the impressions which other  objects must be producing on them we attribute this to their  attention being then absorbed and attention implies the presence  of a mind  every sportsman knows that he can approach animals  whilst they are grazing fighting or courting much more easily  than at other times  the state also of the nervous system of the  higher animals differs much at different times for instance a  horse is much more readily startled at one time than at another   the comparison here implied between the actions of one of the  higher animals and of one so low in the scale as an earthworm may  appear farfetched for we thus attribute to the worm attention and  some mental power nevertheless i can see no reason to doubt the  justice of the comparison  although worms cannot be said to possess the power of vision their  sensitiveness to light enables them to distinguish between day and  night and they thus escape extreme danger from the many diurnal  animals which prey on them  their withdrawal into their burrows  during the day appears however to have become an habitual action  for worms kept in pots covered by glass plates over which sheets  of black paper were spread and placed before a northeast window  remained during the daytime in their burrows and came out every  night and they continued thus to act for a week  no doubt a  little light may have entered between the sheets of glass and the  blackened paper but we know from the trials with coloured glass  that worms are indifferent to a small amount of light  worms appear to be less sensitive to moderate radiant heat than to  a bright light  i judge of this from having held at different  times a poker heated to dull redness near some worms at a distance  which caused a very sensible degree of warmth in my hand  one of  them took no notice a second withdrew into its burrow but not  quickly the third and fourth much more quickly and the fifth as  quickly as possible  the light from a candle concentrated by a  lens and passing through a sheet of glass which would intercept  most of the heatrays generally caused a much more rapid retreat  than did the heated poker  worms are sensitive to a low  temperature as may be inferred from their not coming out of their  burrows during a frost  worms do not possess any sense of hearing  they took not the least  notice of the shrill notes from a metal whistle which was  repeatedly sounded near them nor did they of the deepest and  loudest tones of a bassoon  they were indifferent to shouts if  care was taken that the breath did not strike them  when placed on  a table close to the keys of a piano which was played as loudly as  possible they remained perfectly quiet  although they are indifferent to undulations in the air audible by  us they are extremely sensitive to vibrations in any solid object   when the pots containing two worms which had remained quite  indifferent to the sound of the piano were placed on this  instrument and the note c in the bass clef was struck both  instantly retreated into their burrows  after a time they emerged  and when g above the line in the treble clef was struck they again  retreated  under similar circumstances on another night one worm  dashed into its burrow on a very high note being struck only once  and the other worm when c in the treble clef was struck  on these  occasions the worms were not touching the sides of the pots which  stood in saucers so that the vibrations before reaching their  bodies had to pass from the sounding board of the piano through  the saucer the bottom of the pot and the damp not very compact  earth on which they lay with their tails in their burrows  they  often showed their sensitiveness when the pot in which they lived  or the table on which the pot stood was accidentally and lightly  struck but they appeared less sensitive to such jars than to the  vibrations of the piano and their sensitiveness to jars varied  much at different times  it has often been said that if the ground is beaten or otherwise  made to tremble worms believe that they are pursued by a mole and  leave their burrows  from one account that i have received i have  no doubt that this is often the case but a gentleman informs me  that he lately saw eight or ten worms leave their burrows and crawl  about the grass on some boggy land on which two men had just  trampled while setting a trap and this occurred in a part of  ireland where there were no moles  i have been assured by a  volunteer that he has often seen many large earthworms crawling  quickly about the grass a few minutes after his company had fired  a volley with blank cartridges  the peewit tringa vanellus  linn seems to know instinctively that worms will emerge if the  ground is made to tremble for bishop stanley states as i hear  from mr moorhouse that a young peewit kept in confinement used to  stand on one leg and beat the turf with the other leg until the  worms crawled out of their burrows when they were instantly  devoured  nevertheless worms do not invariably leave their  burrows when the ground is made to tremble as i know by having  beaten it with a spade but perhaps it was beaten too violently  the whole body of a worm is sensitive to contact  a slight puff of  air from the mouth causes an instant retreat  the glass plates  placed over the pots did not fit closely and blowing through the  very narrow chinks thus left often sufficed to cause a rapid  retreat  they sometimes perceived the eddies in the air caused by  quickly removing the glass plates  when a worm first comes out of  its burrow it generally moves the much extended anterior extremity  of its body from side to side in all directions apparently as an  organ of touch and there is some reason to believe as we shall  see in the next chapter that they are thus enabled to gain a  general notion of the form of an object  of all their senses that  of touch including in this term the perception of a vibration  seems much the most highly developed  in worms the sense of smell apparently is confined to the  perception of certain odours and is feeble  they were quite  indifferent to my breath as long as i breathed on them very  gently  this was tried because it appeared possible that they  might thus be warned of the approach of an enemy  they exhibited  the same indifference to my breath whilst i chewed some tobacco  and while a pellet of cottonwool with a few drops of millefleurs  perfume or of acetic acid was kept in my mouth  pellets of cotton wool soaked in tobacco juice in millefleurs perfume and in  paraffin were held with pincers and were waved about within two or  three inches of several worms but they took no notice  on one or  two occasions however when acetic acid had been placed on the  pellets the worms appeared a little uneasy and this was probably  due to the irritation of their skins  the perception of such  unnatural odours would be of no service to worms and as such timid  creatures would almost certainly exhibit some signs of any new  impression we may conclude that they did not perceive these  odours  the result was different when cabbageleaves and pieces of onion  were employed both of which are devoured with much relish by  worms  small square pieces of fresh and halfdecayed cabbage leaves and of onion bulbs were on nine occasions buried in my pots  beneath about 025 of an inch of common garden soil and they were  always discovered by the worms  one bit of cabbage was discovered  and removed in the course of two hours three were removed by the  next morning that is after a single night two others after two  nights and the seventh bit after three nights  two pieces of  onion were discovered and removed after three nights  bits of  fresh raw meat of which worms are very fond were buried and were  not discovered within fortyeight hours during which time they had  not become putrid  the earth above the various buried objects was  generally pressed down only slightly so as not to prevent the  emission of any odour  on two occasions however the surface was  well watered and was thus rendered somewhat compact  after the  bits of cabbage and onion had been removed i looked beneath them  to see whether the worms had accidentally come up from below but  there was no sign of a burrow and twice the buried objects were  laid on pieces of tinfoil which were not in the least displaced   it is of course possible that the worms whilst moving about on the  surface of the ground with their tails affixed within their  burrows may have poked their heads into the places where the above  objects were buried but i have never seen worms acting in this  manner  some pieces of cabbageleaf and of onion were twice buried  beneath very fine ferruginous sand which was slightly pressed down  and well watered so as to be rendered very compact and these  pieces were never discovered  on a third occasion the same kind of  sand was neither pressed down nor watered and the pieces of  cabbage were discovered and removed after the second night  these  several facts indicate that worms possess some power of smell and  that they discover by this means odoriferous and muchcoveted kinds  of food  it may be presumed that all animals which feed on various  substances possess the sense of taste and this is certainly the  case with worms  cabbageleaves are much liked by worms and it  appears that they can distinguish between different varieties but  this may perhaps be owing to differences in their texture  on  eleven occasions pieces of the fresh leaves of a common green  variety and of the red variety used for pickling were given them  and they preferred the green the red being either wholly neglected  or much less gnawed  on two other occasions however they seemed  to prefer the red  halfdecayed leaves of the red variety and  fresh leaves of the green were attacked about equally  when leaves  of the cabbage horseradish a favourite food and of the onion  were given together the latter were always and manifestly  preferred  leaves of the cabbage limetree ampelopsis parsnip  pastinaca and celery apium were likewise given together and  those of the celery were first eaten  but when leaves of cabbage  turnip beet celery wild cherry and carrots were given together  the two latter kinds especially those of the carrot were  preferred to all the others including those of celery  it was  also manifest after many trials that wild cherry leaves were  greatly preferred to those of the limetree and hazel corylus   according to mr bridgman the halfdecayed leaves of phlox verna  are particularly liked by worms 16  pieces of the leaves of cabbage turnip horseradish and onion  were left on the pots during 22 days and were all attacked and had  to be renewed but during the whole of this time leaves of an  artemisia and of the culinary sage thyme and mint mingled with  the above leaves were quite neglected excepting those of the mint  which were occasionally and very slightly nibbled  these latter  four kinds of leaves do not differ in texture in a manner which  could make them disagreeable to worms they all have a strong  taste but so have the four first mentioned kinds of leaves and  the wide difference in the result must be attributed to a  preference by the worms for one taste over another  mental qualitiesthere is little to be said on this head  we  have seen that worms are timid  it may be doubted whether they  suffer as much pain when injured as they seem to express by their  contortions  judging by their eagerness for certain kinds of food  they must enjoy the pleasure of eating  their sexual passion is  strong enough to overcome for a time their dread of light  they  perhaps have a trace of social feeling for they are not disturbed  by crawling over each others bodies and they sometimes lie in  contact  according to hoffmeister they pass the winter either  singly or rolled up with others into a ball at the bottom of their  burrows 17  although worms are so remarkably deficient in the  several senseorgans this does not necessarily preclude  intelligence as we know from such cases as those of laura  bridgman and we have seen that when their attention is engaged  they neglect impressions to which they would otherwise have  attended and attention indicates the presence of a mind of some  kind  they are also much more easily excited at certain times than  at others  they perform a few actions instinctively that is all  the individuals including the young perform such actions in  nearly the same fashion  this is shown by the manner in which the  species of perichaeta eject their castings so as to construct  towers also by the manner in which the burrows of the common  earthworm are smoothly lined with fine earth and often with little  stones and the mouths of their burrows with leaves  one of their  strongest instincts is the plugging up the mouths of their burrows  with various objects and very young worms act in this manner  but  some degree of intelligence appears as we shall see in the next  chapter to be exhibited in this worka result which has  surprised me more than anything else in regard to worms  food and digestionworms are omnivorous  they swallow an  enormous quantity of earth out of which they extract any  digestible matter which it may contain but to this subject i must  recur  they also consume a large number of halfdecayed leaves of  all kinds excepting a few which have an unpleasant taste or are  too tough for them likewise petioles peduncles and decayed  flowers  but they will also consume fresh leaves as i have found  by repeated trials  according to morren 18 they will eat  particles of sugar and liquorice and the worms which i kept drew  many bits of dry starch into their burrows and a large bit had its  angles well rounded by the fluid poured out of their mouths  but  as they often drag particles of soft stone such as of chalk into  their burrows i feel some doubt whether the starch was used as  food  pieces of raw and roasted meat were fixed several times by  long pins to the surface of the soil in my pots and night after  night the worms could be seen tugging at them with the edges of  the pieces engulfed in their mouths so that much was consumed   raw fat seems to be preferred even to raw meat or to any other  substance which was given them and much was consumed  they are  cannibals for the two halves of a dead worm placed in two of the  pots were dragged into the burrows and gnawed but as far as i  could judge they prefer fresh to putrid meat and in so far i  differ from hoffmeister  leon fredericq states 19 that the digestive fluid of worms is of  the same nature as the pancreatic secretion of the higher animals  and this conclusion agrees perfectly with the kinds of food which  worms consume  pancreatic juice emulsifies fat and we have just  seen how greedily worms devour fat it dissolves fibrin and worms  eat raw meat it converts starch into grapesugar with wonderful  rapidity and we shall presently show that the digestive fluid of  worms acts on starch 20  but they live chiefly on halfdecayed  leaves and these would be useless to them unless they could digest  the cellulose forming the cellwalls for it is well known that all  other nutritious substances are almost completely withdrawn from  leaves shortly before they fall off  it has however now been  ascertained that some forms of cellulose though very little or not  at all attacked by the gastric secretion of the higher animals are  acted on by that from the pancreas 21  the halfdecayed or fresh leaves which worms intend to devour are  dragged into the mouths of their burrows to a depth of from one to  three inches and are then moistened with a secreted fluid  it has  been assumed that this fluid serves to hasten their decay but a  large number of leaves were twice pulled out of the burrows of  worms and kept for many weeks in a very moist atmosphere under a  bellglass in my study and the parts which had been moistened by  the worms did not decay more quickly in any plain manner than the  other parts  when fresh leaves were given in the evening to worms  kept in confinement and examined early on the next morning  therefore not many hours after they had been dragged into the  burrows the fluid with which they were moistened when tested with  neutral litmus paper showed an alkaline reaction  this was  repeatedly found to be the case with celery cabbage and turnip  leaves  parts of the same leaves which had not been moistened by  the worms were pounded with a few drops of distilled water and  the juice thus extracted was not alkaline  some leaves however  which had been drawn into burrows out of doors at an unknown  antecedent period were tried and though still moist they rarely  exhibited even a trace of alkaline reaction  the fluid with which the leaves are bathed acts on them whilst  they are fresh or nearly fresh in a remarkable manner for it  quickly kills and discolours them  thus the ends of a fresh  carrotleaf which had been dragged into a burrow were found after  twelve hours of a dark brown tint  leaves of celery turnip  maple elm lime thin leaves of ivy and occasionally those of  the cabbage were similarly acted on  the end of a leaf of triticum  repens still attached to a growing plant had been drawn into a  burrow and this part was dark brown and dead whilst the rest of  the leaf was fresh and green  several leaves of lime and elm  removed from burrows out of doors were found affected in different  degrees  the first change appears to be that the veins become of a  dull reddishorange  the cells with chlorophyll next lose more or  less completely their green colour and their contents finally  become brown  the parts thus affected often appeared almost black  by reflected light but when viewed as a transparent object under  the microscope minute specks of light were transmitted and this  was not the case with the unaffected parts of the same leaves   these effects however merely show that the secreted fluid is  highly injurious or poisonous to leaves for nearly the same  effects were produced in from one to two days on various kinds of  young leaves not only by artificial pancreatic fluid prepared  with or without thymol but quickly by a solution of thymol by  itself  on one occasion leaves of corylus were much discoloured by  being kept for eighteen hours in pancreatic fluid without any  thymol  with young and tender leaves immersion in human saliva  during rather warm weather acted in the same manner as the  pancreatic fluid but not so quickly  the leaves in all these  cases often became infiltrated with the fluid  large leaves from an ivy plant growing on a wall were so tough that  they could not be gnawed by worms but after four days they were  affected in a peculiar manner by the secretion poured out of their  mouths  the upper surfaces of the leaves over which the worms had  crawled as was shown by the dirt left on them were marked in  sinuous lines by either a continuous or broken chain of whitish  and often starshaped dots about 2 mm in diameter  the  appearance thus presented was curiously like that of a leaf into  which the larva of some minute insect had burrowed  but my son  francis after making and examining sections could nowhere find  that the cellwalls had been broken down or that the epidermis had  been penetrated  when the section passed through the whitish dots  the grains of chlorophyll were seen to be more or less discoloured  and some of the palisade and mesophyll cells contained nothing but  broken down granular matter  these effects must be attributed to  the transudation of the secretion through the epidermis into the  cells  the secretion with which worms moisten leaves likewise acts on the  starchgranules within the cells  my son examined some leaves of  the ash and many of the lime which had fallen off the trees and  had been partly dragged into wormburrows  it is known that with  fallen leaves the starchgrains are preserved in the guardcells of  the stomata  now in several cases the starch had partially or  wholly disappeared from these cells in the parts which had been  moistened by the secretion while it was still well preserved in  the other parts of the same leaves  sometimes the starch was  dissolved out of only one of the two guardcells  the nucleus in  one case had disappeared together with the starchgranules  the  mere burying of limeleaves in damp earth for nine days did not  cause the destruction of the starchgranules  on the other hand  the immersion of fresh lime and cherry leaves for eighteen hours in  artificial pancreatic fluid led to the dissolution of the starch granules in the guardcells as well as in the other cells  from the secretion with which the leaves are moistened being  alkaline and from its acting both on the starchgranules and on  the protoplasmic contents of the cells we may infer that it  resembles in nature not saliva 22 but pancreatic secretion and  we know from fredericq that a secretion of this kind is found in  the intestines of worms  as the leaves which are dragged into the  burrows are often dry and shrivelled it is indispensable for their  disintegration by the unarmed mouths of worms that they should  first be moistened and softened and fresh leaves however soft and  tender they may be are similarly treated probably from habit   the result is that they are partially digested before they are  taken into the alimentary canal  i am not aware of any other case  of extrastomachal digestion having been recorded  the boa constrictor is said to bathe its prey with saliva but this is  doubtful and it is done solely for the sake of lubricating its  prey  perhaps the nearest analogy may be found in such plants as  drosera and dionaea for here animal matter is digested and  converted into peptone not within a stomach but on the surfaces of  the leaves  calciferous glandsthese glands see fig 1 judging from their  size and from their rich supply of bloodvessels must be of much  importance to the animal  but almost as many theories have been  advanced on their use as there have been observers  they consist  of three pairs which in the common earthworm debouch into the  alimentary canal in advance of the gizzard but posteriorly to it  in urochaeta and some other genera 23  the two posterior pairs  are formed by lamellae which according to claparede are  diverticula from the oesophagus 24  these lamellae are coated  with a pulpy cellular layer with the outer cells lying free in  infinite numbers  if one of these glands is punctured and  squeezed a quantity of white pulpy matter exudes consisting of  these free cells  they are minute and vary in diameter from 2 to  6 microns  they contain in their centres a little excessively fine  granular matter but they look so like oil globules that claparede  and others at first treated them with ether  this produces no  effect but they are quickly dissolved with effervescence in acetic  acid and when oxalate of ammonia is added to the solution a white  precipitate is thrown down  we may therefore conclude that they  contain carbonate of lime  if the cells are immersed in a very  little acid they become more transparent look like ghosts and  are soon lost to view but if much acid is added they disappear  instantly  after a very large number have been dissolved a  flocculent residue is left which apparently consists of the  delicate ruptured cellwalls  in the two posterior pairs of glands  the carbonate of lime contained in the cells occasionally  aggregates into small rhombic crystals or into concretions which  lie between the lamellae but i have seen only one case and  claparede only a very few such cases  the two anterior glands differ a little in shape from the four  posterior ones by being more oval  they differ also conspicuously  in generally containing several small or two or three larger or a  single very large concretion of carbonate of lime as much as 15  mm in diameter  when a gland includes only a few very small  concretions or as sometimes happens none at all it is easily  overlooked  the large concretions are round or oval and  exteriorly almost smooth  one was found which filled up not only  the whole gland as is often the case but its neck so that it  resembled an oliveoil flask in shape  these concretions when  broken are seen to be more or less crystalline in structure  how  they escape from the gland is a marvel but that they do escape is  certain for they are often found in the gizzard intestines and  in the castings of worms both with those kept in confinement and  those in a state of nature  claparede says very little about the structure of the two anterior  glands and he supposes that the calcareous matter of which the  concretions are formed is derived from the four posterior glands   but if an anterior gland which contains only small concretions is  placed in acetic acid and afterwards dissected or if sections are  made of such a gland without being treated with acid lamellae like  those in the posterior glands and coated with cellular matter could  be plainly seen together with a multitude of free calciferous  cells readily soluble in acetic acid  when a gland is completely  filled with a single large concretion there are no free cells as  these have been all consumed in forming the concretion  but if  such a concretion or one of only moderately large size is  dissolved in acid much membranous matter is left which appears to  consist of the remains of the formerly active lamellae  after the  formation and expulsion of a large concretion new lamellae must be  developed in some manner  in one section made by my son the  process had apparently commenced although the gland contained two  rather large concretions for near the walls several cylindrical  and oval pipes were intersected which were lined with cellular  matter and were quite filled with free calciferous cells  a great  enlargement in one direction of several oval pipes would give rise  to the lamellae  besides the free calciferous cells in which no nucleus was visible  other and rather larger free cells were seen on three occasions  and these contained a distinct nucleus and nucleolus  they were  only so far acted on by acetic acid that the nucleus was thus  rendered more distinct  a very small concretion was removed from  between two of the lamellae within an anterior gland  it was  imbedded in pulpy cellular matter with many free calciferous  cells together with a multitude of the larger free nucleated  cells and these latter cells were not acted on by acetic acid  while the former were dissolved  from this and other such cases i  am led to suspect that the calciferous cells are developed from the  larger nucleated ones but how this was effected was not  ascertained  when an anterior gland contains several minute concretions some of  these are generally angular or crystalline in outline while the  greater number are rounded with an irregular mulberrylike surface   calciferous cells adhered to many parts of these mulberrylike  masses and their gradual disappearance could be traced while they  still remained attached  it was thus evident that the concretions  are formed from the lime contained within the free calciferous  cells  as the smaller concretions increase in size they come into  contact and unite thus enclosing the now functionless lamellae  and by such steps the formation of the largest concretions could be  followed  why the process regularly takes place in the two  anterior glands and only rarely in the four posterior glands is  quite unknown  morren says that these glands disappear during the  winter and i have seen some instances of this fact and others in  which either the anterior or posterior glands were at this season  so shrunk and empty that they could be distinguished only with  much difficulty  with respect to the function of the calciferous glands it is  probable that they primarily serve as organs of excretion and  secondarily as an aid to digestion  worms consume many fallen  leaves and it is known that lime goes on accumulating in leaves  until they drop off the parentplant instead of being reabsorbed  into the stem or roots like various other organic and inorganic  substances 25  the ashes of a leaf of an acacia have been known  to contain as much as 72 per cent of lime  worms therefore would  be liable to become charged with this earth unless there were some  special means for its excretion and the calciferous glands are  well adapted for this purpose  the worms which live in mould close  over the chalk often have their intestines filled with this  substance and their castings are almost white  here it is evident  that the supply of calcareous matter must be superabundant   nevertheless with several worms collected on such a site the  calciferous glands contained as many free calciferous cells and  fully as many and large concretions as did the glands of worms  which lived where there was little or no lime and this indicates  that the lime is an excretion and not a secretion poured into the  alimentary canal for some special purpose  on the other hand the following considerations render it highly  probable that the carbonate of lime which is excreted by the  glands aids the digestive process under ordinary circumstances   leaves during their decay generate an abundance of various kinds of  acids which have been grouped together under the term of humus  acids  we shall have to recur to this subject in our fifth  chapter and i need here only say that these acids act strongly on  carbonate of lime  the halfdecayed leaves which are swallowed in  such large quantities by worms would therefore after they have  been moistened and triturated in the alimentary canal be apt to  produce such acids  and in the case of several worms the contents  of the alimentary canal were found to be plainly acid as shown by  litmus paper  this acidity cannot be attributed to the nature of  the digestive fluid for pancreatic fluid is alkaline and we have  seen that the secretion which is poured out of the mouths of worms  for the sake of preparing the leaves for consumption is likewise  alkaline  the acidity can hardly be due to uric acid as the  contents of the upper part of the intestine were often acid  in  one case the contents of the gizzard were slightly acid those of  the upper intestines being more plainly acid  in another case the  contents of the pharynx were not acid those of the gizzard  doubtfully so while those of the intestine were distinctly acid at  a distance of 5 cm below the gizzard  even with the higher  herbivorous and omnivorous animals the contents of the large  intestine are acid  this however is not caused by any acid  secretion from the mucous membrane the reaction of the intestinal  walls in the larger as in the small intestine is alkaline  it must  therefore arise from acid fermentations going on in the contents  themselves     in carnivora the contents of the coecum are said  to be alkaline and naturally the amount of fermentation will  depend largely on the nature of the food 26  with worms not only the contents of the intestines but their  ejected matter or the castings are generally acid  thirty  castings from different places were tested and with three or four  exceptions were found to be acid and the exceptions may have been  due to such castings not having been recently ejected for some  which were at first acid were on the following morning after  being dried and again moistened no longer acid and this probably  resulted from the humus acids being as is known to be the case  easily decomposed  five fresh castings from worms which lived in  mould close over the chalk were of a whitish colour and abounded  with calcareous matter and these were not in the least acid  this  shows how effectually carbonate of lime neutralises the intestinal  acids  when worms were kept in pots filled with fine ferruginous  sand it was manifest that the oxide of iron with which the grains  of silex were coated had been dissolved and removed from them in  the castings  the digestive fluid of worms resembles in its action as already  stated the pancreatic secretion of the higher animals and in  these latter pancreatic digestion is essentially alkaline the  action will not take place unless some alkali be present and the  activity of an alkaline juice is arrested by acidification and  hindered by neutralization 27  therefore it seems highly  probable that the innumerable calciferous cells which are poured  from the four posterior glands into the alimentary canal of worms  serve to neutralise more or less completely the acids there  generated by the halfdecayed leaves  we have seen that these  cells are instantly dissolved by a small quantity of acetic acid  and as they do not always suffice to neutralise the contents of  even the upper part of the alimentary canal the lime is perhaps  aggregated into concretions in the anterior pair of glands in  order that some may be carried down to the posterior parts of the  intestine where these concretions would be rolled about amongst  the acid contents  the concretions found in the intestines and in  the castings often have a worn appearance but whether this is due  to some amount of attrition or of chemical corrosion could not be  told  claparede believes that they are formed for the sake of  acting as millstones and of thus aiding in the trituration of the  food  they may give some aid in this way but i fully agree with  perrier that this must be of quite subordinate importance seeing  that the object is already attained by stones being generally  present in the gizzards and intestines of worms    chapter

were pinned down to  the soil and at night the manner in which they were seized could  be observed  the worms always endeavoured to drag the leaves  towards their burrows and they tore or sucked off small fragments  whenever the leaves were sufficiently tender  they generally  seized the thin edge of a leaf with their mouths between the  projecting upper and lower lip the thick and strong pharynx being  at the same time as perrier remarks pushed forward within their  bodies so as to afford a point of resistance for the upper lip   in the case of broad flat objects they acted in a wholly different  manner  the pointed anterior extremity of the body after being  brought into contact with an object of this kind was drawn within  the adjoining rings so that it appeared truncated and became as  thick as the rest of the body  this part could then be seen to  swell a little and this i believe is due to the pharynx being  pushed a little forwards  then by a slight withdrawal of the  pharynx or by its expansion a vacuum was produced beneath the  truncated slimy end of the body whilst in contact with the object  and by this means the two adhered firmly together 28  that under  these circumstances a vacuum was produced was plainly seen on one  occasion when a large worm lying beneath a flaccid cabbage leaf  tried to drag it away for the surface of the leaf directly over  the end of the worms body became deeply pitted  on another  occasion a worm suddenly lost its hold on a flat leaf and the  anterior end of the body was momentarily seen to be cupformed   worms can attach themselves to an object beneath water in the same  manner and i saw one thus dragging away a submerged slice of an  onionbulb  the edges of fresh or nearly fresh leaves affixed to the ground  were often nibbled by the worms and sometimes the epidermis and  all the parenchyma on one side was gnawed completely away over a  considerable space the epidermis alone on the opposite side being  left quite clean  the veins were never touched and leaves were  thus sometimes partly converted into skeletons  as worms have no  teeth and as their mouths consist of very soft tissue it may be  presumed that they consume by means of suction the edges and the  parenchyma of fresh leaves after they have been softened by the  digestive fluid  they cannot attack such strong leaves as those of  seakale or large and thick leaves of ivy though one of the latter  after it had become rotten was reduced in parts to the state of a  skeleton  worms seize leaves and other objects not only to serve as food  but for plugging up the mouths of their burrows and this is one of  their strongest instincts  they sometimes work so energetically  that mr d f simpson who has a small walled garden where worms  abound in bayswater informs me that on a calm damp evening he  there heard so extraordinary a rustling noise from under a tree  from which many leaves had fallen that he went out with a light  and discovered that the noise was caused by many worms dragging the  dry leaves and squeezing them into the burrows  not only leaves  but petioles of many kinds some flowerpeduncles often decayed  twigs of trees bits of paper feathers tufts of wool and horse hairs are dragged into their burrows for this purpose  i have seen  as many as seventeen petioles of a clematis projecting from the  mouth of one burrow and ten from the mouth of another  some of  these objects such as the petioles just named feathers c are  never gnawed by worms  in a gravelwalk in my garden i found many  hundred leaves of a pinetree p austriaca or nigricans drawn by  their bases into burrows  the surfaces by which these leaves are  articulated to the branches are shaped in as peculiar a manner as  is the joint between the legbones of a quadruped and if these  surfaces had been in the least gnawed the fact would have been  immediately visible but there was no trace of gnawing  of  ordinary dicotyledonous leaves all those which are dragged into  burrows are not gnawed  i have seen as many as nine leaves of the  limetree drawn into the same burrow and not nearly all of them  had been gnawed but such leaves may serve as a store for future  consumption  where fallen leaves are abundant many more are  sometimes collected over the mouth of a burrow than can be used so  that a small pile of unused leaves is left like a roof over those  which have been partly dragged in  a leaf in being dragged a little way into a cylindrical burrow is  necessarily much folded or crumpled  when another leaf is drawn  in this is done exteriorly to the first one and so on with the  succeeding leaves and finally all become closely folded and  pressed together  sometimes the worm enlarges the mouth of its  burrow or makes a fresh one close by so as to draw in a still  larger number of leaves  they often or generally fill up the  interstices between the drawnin leaves with moist viscid earth  ejected from their bodies and thus the mouths of the burrows are  securely plugged  hundreds of such plugged burrows may be seen in  many places especially during the autumnal and early winter  months  but as will hereafter be shown leaves are dragged into  the burrows not only for plugging them up and for food but for the  sake of lining the upper part or mouth  when worms cannot obtain leaves petioles sticks c with which  to plug up the mouths of their burrows they often protect them by  little heaps of stones and such heaps of smooth rounded pebbles  may frequently be seen on gravelwalks  here there can be no  question about food  a lady who was interested in the habits of  worms removed the little heaps of stones from the mouths of  several burrows and cleared the surface of the ground for some  inches all round  she went out on the following night with a  lantern and saw the worms with their tails fixed in their burrows  dragging the stones inwards by the aid of their mouths no doubt by  suction  after two nights some of the holes had 8 or 9 small  stones over them after four nights one had about 30 and another  34 stones 29  one stonewhich had been dragged over the  gravelwalk to the mouth of a burrow weighed two ounces and this  proves how strong worms are  but they show greater strength in  sometimes displacing stones in a welltrodden gravelwalk that  they do so may be inferred from the cavities left by the displaced  stones being exactly filled by those lying over the mouths of  adjoining burrows as i have myself observed  work of this kind is usually performed during the night but i have  occasionally known objects to be drawn into the burrows during the  day  what advantage the worms derive from plugging up the mouths  of their burrows with leaves c or from piling stones over them  is doubtful  they do not act in this manner at the times when they  eject much earth from their burrows for their castings then serve  to cover the mouths  when gardeners wish to kill worms on a lawn  it is necessary first to brush or rake away the castings from the  surface in order that the limewater may enter the burrows 30   it might be inferred from this fact that the mouths are plugged up  with leaves c to prevent the entrance of water during heavy  rain but it may be urged against this view that a few loose  wellrounded stones are illadapted to keep out water  i have  moreover seen many burrows in the perpendicularly cut turfedgings  to gravelwalks into which water could hardly flow as well  plugged as burrows on a level surface  it is not probable that the  plugs or piles of stones serve to conceal the burrows from  scolopendras which according to hoffmeister 31 are the  bitterest enemies of worms or from the larger species of carabus  and staphylinus which attack them ferociously for these animals  are nocturnal and the burrows are opened at night  may not worms  when the mouth of the burrow is protected be able to remain with  safety with their heads close to it which we know that they like  to do but which costs so many of them their lives  or may not the  plugs check the free ingress of the lowest stratum of air when  chilled by radiation at night from the surrounding ground and  herbage  i am inclined to believe in this latter view  firstly  because when worms were kept in pots in a room with a fire in  which case cold air could not enter the burrows they plugged them  up in a slovenly manner and secondarily because they often coat  the upper part of their burrows with leaves apparently to prevent  their bodies from coming into close contact with the cold damp  earth  mr e parfitt has suggested to me that the mouths of the  burrows are closed in order that the air within them may be kept  thoroughly damp and this seems the most probable explanation of  the habit  but the pluggingup process may serve for all the above  purposes  whatever the motive may be it appears that worms much dislike  leaving the mouths of their burrows open  nevertheless they will  reopen them at night whether or not they can afterwards close  them  numerous open burrows may be seen on recentlydug ground  for in this case the worms eject their castings in cavities left in  the ground or in the old burrows instead of piling them over the  mouths of their burrows and they cannot collect objects on the  surface by which the mouths might be protected  so again on a  recently disinterred pavement of a roman villa at abinger  hereafter to be described the worms pertinaciously opened their  burrows almost every night when these had been closed by being  trampled on although they were rarely able to find a few minute  stones wherewith to protect them  intelligence shown by worms in their manner of plugging up their  burrowsif a man had to plug up a small cylindrical hole with  such objects as leaves petioles or twigs he would drag or push  them in by their pointed ends but if these objects were very thin  relatively to the size of the hole he would probably insert some  by their thicker or broader ends  the guide in his case would be  intelligence  it seemed therefore worth while to observe carefully  how worms dragged leaves into their burrows whether by their tips  or bases or middle parts  it seemed more especially desirable to  do this in the case of plants not natives to our country for  although the habit of dragging leaves into their burrows is  undoubtedly instinctive with worms yet instinct could not tell  them how to act in the case of leaves about which their progenitors  knew nothing  if moreover worms acted solely through instinct or  an unvarying inherited impulse they would draw all kinds of leaves  into their burrows in the same manner  if they have no such  definite instinct we might expect that chance would determine  whether the tip base or middle was seized  if both these  alternatives are excluded intelligence alone is left unless the  worm in each case first tries many different methods and follows  that alone which proves possible or the most easy but to act in  this manner and to try different methods makes a near approach to  intelligence  in the first place 227 withered leaves of various kinds mostly of  english plants were pulled out of wormburrows in several places   of these 181 had been drawn into the burrows by or near their  tips so that the footstalk projected nearly upright from the  mouth of the burrow 20 had been drawn in by their bases and in  this case the tips projected from the burrows and 26 had been  seized near the middle so that these had been drawn in  transversely and were much crumpled  therefore 80 per cent  always using the nearest whole number had been drawn in by the  tip 9 per cent by the base or footstalk and 11 per cent  transversely or by the middle  this alone is almost sufficient to  show that chance does not determine the manner in which leaves are  dragged into the burrows  of the above 227 leaves 70 consisted of the fallen leaves of the  common limetree which is almost certainly not a native of  england  these leaves are much acuminated towards the tip and are  very broad at the base with a welldeveloped footstalk  they are  thin and quite flexible when halfwithered  of the 70 79 per  cent had been drawn in by or near the tip 4 per cent by or near  the base and 17 per cent transversely or by the middle  these  proportions agree very closely as far as the tip is concerned  with those before given  but the percentage drawn in by the base  is smaller which may be attributed to the breadth of the basal  part of the blade  we here also see that the presence of a foot stalk which it might have been expected would have tempted the  worms as a convenient handle has little or no influence in  determining the manner in which lime leaves are dragged into the  burrows  the considerable proportion viz 17 per cent drawn in  more or less transversely depends no doubt on the flexibility of  these halfdecayed leaves  the fact of so many having been drawn  in by the middle and of some few having been drawn in by the base  renders it improbable that the worms first tried to draw in most of  the leaves by one or both of these methods and that they  afterwards drew in 79 per cent by their tips for it is clear that  they would not have failed in drawing them in by the base or  middle  the leaves of a foreign plant were next searched for the blades of  which were not more pointed towards the apex than towards the base   this proved to be the case with those of a laburnum a hybrid  between cytisus alpinus and laburnum for on doubling the terminal  over the basal half they generally fitted exactly and when there  was any difference the basal half was a little the narrower  it  might therefore have been expected that an almost equal number of  these leaves would have been drawn in by the tip and base or a  slight excess in favour of the latter  but of 73 leaves not  included in the first lot of 227 pulled out of wormburrows 63  per cent had been drawn in by the tip 27 per cent by the base  and 10 per cent transversely  we here see that a far larger  proportion viz 27 per cent were drawn in by the base than in  the case of lime leaves the blades of which are very broad at the  base and of which only 4 per cent had thus been drawn in  we may  perhaps account for the fact of a still larger proportion of the  laburnum leaves not having been drawn in by the base by worms  having acquired the habit of generally drawing in leaves by their  tips and thus avoiding the footstalk  for the basal margin of the  blade in many kinds of leaves forms a large angle with the foot stalk and if such a leaf were drawn in by the footstalk the  basal margin would come abruptly into contact with the ground on  each side of the burrow and would render the drawing in of the  leaf very difficult  nevertheless worms break through their habit of avoiding the foot stalk if this part offers them the most convenient means for  drawing leaves into their burrows  the leaves of the endless  hybridised varieties of the rhododendron vary much in shape some  are narrowest towards the base and others towards the apex  after  they have fallen off the blade on each side of the midrib often  becomes curled up while drying sometimes along the whole length  sometimes chiefly at the base sometimes towards the apex  out of  28 fallen leaves on one bed of peat in my garden no less than 23  were narrower in the basal quarter than in the terminal quarter of  their length and this narrowness was chiefly due to the curling in  of the margins  out of 36 fallen leaves on another bed in which  different varieties of the rhododendron grew only 17 were narrower  towards the base than towards the apex  my son william who first  called my attention to this case picked up 237 fallen leaves in  his garden where the rhododendron grows in the natural soil and  of these 65 per cent could have been drawn by worms into their  burrows more easily by the base or footstalk than by the tip and  this was partly due to the shape of the leaf and in a less degree  to the curling in of the margins  27 per cent could have been  drawn in more easily by the tip than by the base  and 8 per cent  with about equal ease by either end  the shape of a fallen leaf  ought to be judged of before one end has been drawn into a burrow  for after this has happened the free end whether it be the base  or apex will dry more quickly than the end imbedded in the damp  ground and the exposed margins of the free end will consequently  tend to become more curled inwards than they were when the leaf was  first seized by the worm  my son found 91 leaves which had been  dragged by worms into their burrows though not to a great depth  of these 66 per cent had been drawn in by the base or footstalk  and 34 per cent by the tip  in this case therefore the worms  judged with a considerable degree of correctness how best to draw  the withered leaves of this foreign plant into their burrows  notwithstanding that they had to depart from their usual habit of  avoiding the footstalk  on the gravelwalks in my garden a very large number of leaves of  three species of pinus p austriaca nigricans and sylvestris are  regularly drawn into the mouths of worm burrows  these leaves  consist of two socalled needles which are of considerable length  in the two first and short in the last named species and are  united to a common base and it is by this part that they are  almost invariably drawn into the burrows  i have seen only two or  at most three exceptions to this rule with worms in a state of  nature  as the sharply pointed needles diverge a little and as  several leaves are drawn into the same burrow each tuft forms a  perfect chevaux de frise  on two occasions many of these tufts  were pulled up in the evening but by the following morning fresh  leaves had been pulled in and the burrows were again well  protected  these leaves could not be dragged into the burrows to  any depth except by their bases as a worm cannot seize hold of  the two needles at the same time and if one alone were seized by  the apex the other would be pressed against the ground and would  resist the entry of the seized one  this was manifest in the above  mentioned two or three exceptional cases  in order therefore  that worms should do their work well they must drag pineleaves  into their burrows by their bases where the two needles are  conjoined  but how they are guided in this work is a perplexing  question  this difficulty led my son francis and myself to observe worms in  confinement during several nights by the aid of a dim light while  they dragged the leaves of the above named pines into their  burrows  they moved the anterior extremities of their bodies about  the leaves and on several occasions when they touched the sharp  end of a needle they withdrew suddenly as if pricked  but i doubt  whether they were hurt for they are indifferent to very sharp  objects and will swallow even rosethorns and small splinters of  glass  it may also be doubted whether the sharp ends of the  needles serve to tell them that this is the wrong end to seize for  the points were cut off many leaves for a length of about one inch  and fiftyseven of them thus treated were drawn into the burrows by  their bases and not one by the cutoff ends  the worms in  confinement often seized the needles near the middle and drew them  towards the mouths of their burrows and one worm tried in a  senseless manner to drag them into the burrow by bending them   they sometimes collected many more leaves over the mouths of their  burrows as in the case formerly mentioned of limeleaves than  could enter them  on other occasions however they behaved very  differently for as soon as they touched the base of a pineleaf  this was seized being sometimes completely engulfed in their  mouths or a point very near the base was seized and the leaf was  then quickly dragged or rather jerked into their burrows  it  appeared both to my son and myself as if the worms instantly  perceived as soon as they had seized a leaf in the proper manner   nine such cases were observed but in one of them the worm failed  to drag the leaf into its burrow as it was entangled by other  leaves lying near  in another case a leaf stood nearly upright  with the points of the needles partly inserted into a burrow but  how placed there was not seen and then the worm reared itself up  and seized the base which was dragged into the mouth of the burrow  by bowing the whole leaf  on the other hand after a worm had  seized the base of a leaf this was on two occasions relinquished  from some unknown motive  as already remarked the habit of plugging up the mouths of the  burrows with various objects is no doubt instinctive in worms and  a very young one born in one of my pots dragged for some little  distance a scotchfir leaf one needle of which was as long and  almost as thick as its own body  no species of pine is endemic in  this part of england it is therefore incredible that the proper  manner of dragging pineleaves into the burrows can be instinctive  with our worms  but as the worms on which the above observations  were made were dug up beneath or near some pines which had been  planted there about forty years it was desirable to prove that  their actions were not instinctive  accordingly pineleaves were  scattered on the ground in places far removed from any pinetree  and 90 of them were drawn into the burrows by their bases  only  two were drawn in by the tips of the needles and these were not  real exceptions as one was drawn in for a very short distance and  the two needles of the other cohered  other pineleaves were given  to worms kept in pots in a warm room and here the result was  different for out of 42 leaves drawn into the burrows no less  than i6 were drawn in by the tips of the needles  these worms  however worked in a careless or slovenly manner for the leaves  were often drawn in to only a small depth sometimes they were  merely heaped over the mouths of the burrows and sometimes none  were drawn in  i believe that this carelessness may be accounted  for either by the warmth of the air or by its dampness as the  pots were covered by glass plates the worms consequently did not  care about plugging up their holes effectually  pots tenanted by  worms and covered with a net which allowed the free entrance of  air were left out of doors for several nights and now 72 leaves  were all properly drawn in by their bases  it might perhaps be inferred from the facts as yet given that  worms somehow gain a general notion of the shape or structure of  pineleaves and perceive that it is necessary for them to seize  the base where the two needles are conjoined  but the following  cases make this more than doubtful  the tips of a large number of  needles of p austriaca were cemented together with shelllac  dissolved in alcohol and were kept for some days until as i  believe all odour or taste had been lost and they were then  scattered on the ground where no pinetrees grew near burrows from  which the plugging had been removed  such leaves could have been  drawn into the burrows with equal ease by either end and judging  from analogy and more especially from the case presently to be  given of the petioles of clematis montana i expected that the apex  would have been preferred  but the result was that out of 121  leaves with the tips cemented which were drawn into burrows 108  were drawn in by their bases and only 13 by their tips  thinking  that the worms might possibly perceive and dislike the smell or  taste of the shelllac though this was very improbable especially  after the leaves had been left out during several nights the tips  of the needles of many leaves were tied together with fine thread   of leaves thus treated 150 were drawn into burrows123 by the base  and 27 by the tied tips so that between four land five times as  many were drawn in by the base as by the tip  it is possible that  the short cutoff ends of the thread with which they were tied may  have tempted the worms to drag in a larger proportional number by  the tips than when cement was used  of the leaves with tied and  cemented tips taken together 271 in number 85 per cent were  drawn in by the base and 15 per cent by the tips  we may  therefore infer that it is not the divergence of the two needles  which leads worms in a state of nature almost invariably to drag  pineleaves into their burrows by the base  nor can it be the  sharpness of the points of the needles which determines them for  as we have seen many leaves with the points cut off were drawn in  by their bases  we are thus led to conclude that with pineleaves  there must be something attractive to worms in the base  notwithstanding that few ordinary leaves are drawn in by the base  or footstalk  petioleswe will now turn to the petioles or footstalks of  compound leaves after the leaflets have fallen off  those from  clematis montana which grew over a verandah were dragged early in  january in large numbers into the burrows on an adjoining gravel walk lawn and flowerbed  these petioles vary from 25 to 45  inches in length are rigid and of nearly uniform thickness except  close to the base where they thicken rather abruptly being here  about twice as thick as in any other part  the apex is somewhat  pointed but soon withers and is then easily broken off  of these  petioles 314 were pulled out of burrows in the above specified  sites and it was found that 76 per cent had been drawn in by  their tips and 24 per cent by their bases so that those drawn in  by the tip were a little more than thrice as many as those drawn in  by the base  some of those extracted from the wellbeaten gravel walk were kept separate from the others and of these 59 in  number nearly five times as many had been drawn in by the tip as  by the base whereas of those extracted from the lawn and flower bed where from the soil yielding more easily less care would be  necessary in plugging up the burrows the proportion of those drawn  in by the tip 130 to those drawn in by the base 48 was rather  less than three to one  that these petioles had been dragged into  the burrows for plugging them up and not for food was manifest  as neither end as far as i could see had been gnawed  as several  petioles are used to plug up the same burrow in one case as many  as 10 and in another case as many as 15 the worms may perhaps at  first draw in a few by the thicker end so as to save labour but  afterwards a large majority are drawn in by the pointed end in  order to plug up the hole securely  the fallen petioles of our native ashtree were next observed and  the rule with most objects viz that a large majority are dragged  into the burrows by the more pointed end had not here been  followed and this fact much surprised me at first  these petioles  vary in length from 5 to 85 inches they are thick and fleshy  towards the base whence they taper gently towards the apex which  is a little enlarged and truncated where the terminal leaflet had  been originally attached  under some ashtrees growing in a grass field 229 petioles were pulled out of worm burrows early in  january and of these 515 per cent had been drawn in by the base  and 485 per cent by the apex  this anomaly was however readily  explained as soon as the thick basal part was examined for in 78  out of 103 petioles this part had been gnawed by worms just above  the horseshoe shaped articulation  in most cases there could be  no mistake about the gnawing for ungnawed petioles which were  examined after being exposed to the weather for eight additional  weeks had not become more disintegrated or decayed near the base  than elsewhere  it is thus evident that the thick basal end of the  petiole is drawn in not solely for the sake of plugging up the  mouths of the burrows but as food  even the narrow truncated tips  of some few petioles had been gnawed and this was the case in 6  out of 37 which were examined for this purpose  worms after  having drawn in and gnawed the basal end often push the petioles  out of their burrows and then drag in fresh ones either by the  base for food or by the apex for plugging up the mouth more  effectually  thus out of 37 petioles inserted by their tips 5  had been previously drawn in by the base for this part had been  gnawed  again i collected a handful of petioles lying loose on  the ground close to some pluggedup burrows where the surface was  thickly strewed with other petioles which apparently had never been  touched by worms and 14 out of 47 ie nearly onethird after  having had their bases gnawed had been pushed out of the burrows  and were now lying on the ground  from these several facts we may  conclude that worms draw in some petioles of the ash by the base to  serve as food and others by the tip to plug up the mouths of their  burrows in the most efficient manner  the petioles of robinia pseudoacacia vary from 4 or 5 to nearly 12  inches in length they are thick close to the base before the  softer parts have rotted off and taper much towards the upper end   they are so flexible that i have seen some few doubled up and thus  drawn into the burrows of worms  unfortunately these petioles were  not examined until february by which time the softer parts had  completely rotted off so that it was impossible to ascertain  whether worms had gnawed the bases though this is in itself  probable  out of 121 petioles extracted from burrows early in  february 68 were imbedded by the base and 53 by the apex  on  february 5 all the petioles which had been drawn into the burrows  beneath a robinia were pulled up and after an interval of eleven  days 35 petioles had been again dragged in 19 by the base and 16  by the apex  taking these two lots together 56 per cent were  drawn in by the base and 44 per cent by the apex  as all the  softer parts had long ago rotted off we may feel sure especially  in the latter case that none had been drawn in as food  at this  season therefore worms drag these petioles into their burrows  indifferently by either end a slight preference being given to the  base  this latter fact may be accounted for by the difficulty of  plugging up a burrow with objects so extremely thin as are the  upper ends  in support of this view it may be stated that out of  the 16 petioles which had been drawn in by their upper ends the  more attenuated terminal portion of 7 had been previously broken  off by some accident  triangles of paperelongated triangles were cut out of moderately  stiff writingpaper which was rubbed with raw fat on both sides  so as to prevent their becoming excessively limp when exposed at  night to rain and dew  the sides of all the triangles were three  inches in length with the bases of 120 one inch and of the other  183 half an inch in length  these latter triangles were very  narrow or much acuminated 32  as a check on the observations  presently to be given similar triangles in a damp state were  seized by a very narrow pair of pincers at different points and at  all inclinations with reference to the margins and were then drawn  into a short tube of the diameter of a wormburrow  if seized by  the apex the triangle was drawn straight into the tube with its  margins infolded if seized at some little distance from the apex  for instance at half an inch this much was doubled back within the  tube  so it was with the base and basal angles though in this  case the triangles offered as might have been expected much more  resistance to being drawn in  if seized near the middle the  triangle was doubled up with the apex and base left sticking out  of the tube  as the sides of the triangles were three inches in  length the result of their being drawn into a tube or into a  burrow in different ways may be conveniently divided into three  groups  those drawn in by the apex or within an inch of it those  drawn in by the base or within an inch of it and those drawn in by  any point in the middle inch  in order to see how the triangles would be seized by worms some in  a damp state were given to worms kept in confinement  they were  seized in three different manners in the case of both the narrow  and broad triangles  viz by the margin by one of the three  angles which was often completely engulfed in their mouths and  lastly by suction applied to any part of the flat surface  if  lines parallel to the base and an inch apart are drawn across a  triangle with the sides three inches in length it will be divided  into three parts of equal length  now if worms seized  indifferently by chance any part they would assuredly seize on the  basal part or division far oftener than on either of the two other  divisions  for the area of the basal to the apical part is as 5 to  1 so that the chance of the former being drawn into a burrow by  suction will be as 5 to 1 compared with the apical part  the  base offers two angles and the apex only one so that the former  would have twice as good a chance independently of the size of the  angles of being engulfed in a worms mouth as would the apex  it  should however be stated that the apical angle is not often  seized by worms the margin at a little distance on either side  being preferred  i judge of this from having found in 40 out of 46  cases in which triangles had been drawn into burrows by their  apical ends that the tip had been doubled back within the burrow  for a length of between 120 of an inch and 1 inch  lastly the  proportion between the margins of the basal and apical parts is as  3 to 2 for the broad and 25 to 2 for the narrow triangles  from  these several considerations it might certainly have been expected  supposing that worms seized hold of the triangles by chance that a  considerably larger proportion would have been dragged into the  burrows by the basal than by the apical part but we shall  immediately see how different was the result  triangles of the above specified sizes were scattered on the ground  in many places and on many successive nights near wormburrows  from which the leaves petioles twigs c with which they had  been plugged were removed  altogether 303 triangles were drawn by  worms into their burrows  12 others were drawn in by both ends  but as it was impossible to judge by which end they had been first  seized these are excluded  of the 303 62 per cent had been  drawn in by the apex using this term for all drawn in by the  apical part one inch in length 15 per cent by the middle and  23 per cent by the basal part  if they had been drawn  indifferently by any point the proportion for the apical middle  and basal parts would have been 333 per cent for each but as we  have just seen it might have been expected that a much larger  proportion would have been drawn in by the basal than by any other  part  as the case stands nearly three times as many were drawn in  by the apex as by the base  if we consider the broad triangles by  themselves 59 per cent were drawn in by the apex 25 per cent by  the middle and 16 per cent by the base  of the narrow triangles  65 per cent were drawn in by the apex 14 per cent by the middle  and 21 per cent by the base so that here those drawn in by the  apex were more than 3 times as many as those drawn in by the base   we may therefore conclude that the manner in which the triangles  are drawn into the burrows is not a matter of chance  in eight cases two triangles had been drawn into the same burrow  and in seven of these cases one had been drawn in by the apex and  the other by the base  this again indicates that the result is not  determined by chance  worms appear sometimes to revolve in the act  of drawing in the triangles for five out of the whole lot had been  wound into an irregular spire round the inside of the burrow   worms kept in a warm room drew 63 triangles into their burrows  but as in the case of the pineleaves they worked in a rather  careless manner for only 44 per cent were drawn in by the apex  22 per cent by the middle and 33 per cent by the base  in five  cases two triangles were drawn into the same burrow  it may be suggested with much apparent probability that so large a  proportion of the triangles were drawn in by the apex not from the  worms having selected this end as the most convenient for the  purpose but from having first tried in other ways and failed   this notion was countenanced by the manner in which worms in  confinement were seen to drag about and drop the triangles but  then they were working carelessly  i did not at first perceive the  importance of this subject but merely noticed that the bases of  those triangles which had been drawn in by the apex were generally  clean and not crumpled  the subject was afterwards attended to  carefully  in the first place several triangles which had been  drawn in by the basal angles or by the base or a little above the  base and which were thus much crumpled and dirtied were left for  some hours in water and were then well shaken while immersed but  neither the dirt nor the creases were thus removed  only slight  creases could be obliterated even by pulling the wet triangles  several times through my fingers  owing to the slime from the  worms bodies the dirt was not easily washed off  we may  therefore conclude that if a triangle before being dragged in by  the apex had been dragged into a burrow by its base with even a  slight degree of force the basal part would long retain its  creases and remain dirty  the condition of 89 triangles 65 narrow  and 24 broad ones which had been drawn in by the apex was  observed and the bases of only 7 of them were at all creased  being at the same time generally dirty  of the 82 uncreased  triangles 14 were dirty at the base but it does not follow from  this fact that these had first been dragged towards the burrows by  their bases for the worms sometimes covered large portions of the  triangles with slime and these when dragged by the apex over the  ground would be dirtied and during rainy weather the triangles  were often dirtied over one whole side or over both sides  if the  worms had dragged the triangles to the mouths of their burrows by  their bases as often as by their apices and had then perceived  without actually trying to draw them into the burrow that the  broader end was not well adapted for this purposeeven in this  case a large proportion would probably have had their basal ends  dirtied  we may therefore inferimprobable as is the inference that worms are able by some means to judge which is the best end by  which to draw triangles of paper into their burrows  the percentage results of the foregoing observations on the manner  in which worms draw various kinds of objects into the mouths of  their burrows may be abridged as follows                                drawn                              into the    drawn in drawn in nature of object            burrows    by or     by or                              by or       near      near                              near the    the       the                              apex       middle   base leaves of various kinds          80        11         9  of the lime basal margin   of blade broad apex   acuminated                     79        17         4  of a laburnum basal part of   blade as narrow as or some   times little narrower than   the apical part                63        10        27  of the rhododendron basal   part of blade often narrower   than the apical part           34               66  of pinetrees consisting of   two needles arising from a   common base                                 100 petioles of a clematis   somewhat pointed at the apex   and blunt at the base          76               24  of the ash the thick basal   end often drawn in to serve   as food                       485            515  of robinia extremely thin   especially towards the apex   so as to be illfitted for   plugging up the burrows        44              56 triangles of paper of the   two sizes                      62       15        23  of the broad ones alone        59       25        16  of the narrow ones alone       65       14        21   if we consider these several  cases we can hardly escape from the  conclusion that worms show some degree of intelligence in their  manner of plugging up their burrows  each particular object is  seized in too uniform a manner and from causes which we can  generally understand for the result to be attributed to mere  chance  that every object has not been drawn in by its pointed  end may be accounted for by labour having been saved through some  being inserted by their broader or thicker ends  no doubt worms  are led by instinct to plug up their burrows and it might have  been expected that they would have been led by instinct how best to  act in each particular case independently of intelligence  we see  how difficult it is to judge whether intelligence comes into play  for even plants might sometimes be thought to be thus directed for  instance when displaced leaves redirect their upper surfaces  towards the light by extremely complicated movements and by the  shortest course  with animals actions appearing due to  intelligence may be performed through inherited habit without any  intelligence although aboriginally thus acquired  or the habit  may have been acquired through the preservation and inheritance of  beneficial variations of some other habit and in this case the new  habit will have been acquired independently of intelligence  throughout the whole course of its development  there is no a  priori improbability in worms having acquired special instincts  through either of these two latter means  nevertheless it is  incredible that instincts should have been developed in reference  to objects such as the leaves of petioles of foreign plants  wholly unknown to the progenitors of the worms which act in the  described manner  nor are their actions so unvarying or inevitable  as are most true instincts  as worms are not guided by special instincts in each particular  case though possessing a general instinct to plug up their  burrows and as chance is excluded the next most probable  conclusion seems to be that they try in many different ways to draw  in objects and at last succeed in some one way  but it is  surprising that an animal so low in the scale as a worm should have  the capacity for acting in this manner as many higher animals have  no such capacity  for instance ants may be seen vainly trying to  drag an object transversely to their course which could be easily  drawn longitudinally though after a time they generally act in a  wiser manner m fabre states 33 that a sphexan insect  belonging to the same highlyendowed order with antsstocks its  nest with paralysed grasshoppers which are invariably dragged  into the burrow by their antennae  when these were cut off close  to the head the sphex seized the palpi but when these were  likewise cut off the attempt to drag its prey into the burrow was  given up in despair  the sphex had not intelligence enough to  seize one of the six legs or the ovipositor of the grasshopper  which as m fabre remarks would have served equally well  so  again if the paralysed prey with an egg attached to it be taken  out of the cell the sphex after entering and finding the cell  empty nevertheless closes it up in the usual elaborate manner   bees will try to escape and go on buzzing for hours on a window  one half of which has been left open  even a pike continued during  three months to dash and bruise itself against the glass sides of  an aquarium in the vain attempt to seize minnows on the opposite  side 34  a cobrasnake was seen by mr layard 35 to act much  more wisely than either the pike or the sphex it had swallowed a  toad lying within a hole and could not withdraw its head the toad  was disgorged and began to crawl away it was again swallowed and  again disgorged and now the snake had learnt by experience for it  seized the toad by one of its legs and drew it out of the hole   the instincts of even the higher animals are often followed in a  senseless or purposeless manner  the weaverbird will  perseveringly wind threads through the bars of its cage as if  building a nest  a squirrel will pat nuts on a wooden floor as if  he had just buried them in the ground  a beaver will cut up logs  of wood and drag them about though there is no water to dam up  and so in many other cases  mr romanes who has specially studied the minds of animals  believes that we can safely infer intelligence only when we see an  individual profiting by its own experience  by this test the cobra  showed some intelligence but this would have been much plainer if  on a second occasion he had drawn a toad out of a hole by its leg   the sphex failed signally in this respect  now if worms try to  drag objects into their burrows first in one way and then in  another until they at last succeed they profit at least in each  particular instance by experience  but evidence has been advanced showing that worms do not habitually  try to draw objects into their burrows in many different ways   thus halfdecayed limeleaves from their flexibility could have  been drawn in by their middle or basal parts and were thus drawn  into the burrows in considerable numbers yet a large majority were  drawn in by or near the apex  the petioles of the clematis could  certainly have been drawn in with equal ease by the base and apex  yet three times and in certain cases five times as many were drawn  in by the apex as by the base  it might have been thought that the  footstalks of leaves would have tempted the worms as a convenient  handle yet they are not largely used except when the base of the  blade is narrower than the apex  a large number of the petioles of  the ash are drawn in by the base but this part serves the worms as  food  in the case of pineleaves worms plainly show that they at  least do not seize the leaf by chance but their choice does not  appear to be determined by the divergence of the two needles and  the consequent advantage or necessity of drawing them into their  burrows by the base  with respect to the triangles of paper those  which had been drawn in by the apex rarely had their bases creased  or dirty and this shows that the worms had not often first tried  to drag them in by this end  if worms are able to judge either before drawing or after having  drawn an object close to the mouths of their burrows how best to  drag it in they must acquire some notion of its general shape   this they probably acquire by touching it in many places with the  anterior extremity of their bodies which serves as a tactile  organ  it may be well to remember how perfect the sense of touch  becomes in a man when born blind and deaf as are worms  if worms  have the power of acquiring some notion however rude of the shape  of an object and of their burrows as seems to be the case they  deserve to be called intelligent for they then act in nearly the  same manner as would a man under similar circumstances  to sum up as chance does not determine the manner in which objects  are drawn into the burrows and as the existence of specialized  instincts for each particular case cannot be admitted the first  and most natural supposition is that worms try all methods until  they at last succeed but many appearances are opposed to such a  supposition  one alternative alone is left namely that worms  although standing low in the scale of organization possess some  degree of intelligence  this will strike every one as very  improbable but it may be doubted whether we know enough about the  nervous system of the lower animals to justify our natural distrust  of such a conclusion  with respect to the small size of the  cerebral ganglia we should remember what a mass of inherited  knowledge with some power of adapting means to an end is crowded  into the minute brain of a workerant  means by which worms excavate their burrowsthis is effected in  two ways by pushing away the earth on all sides and by swallowing  it  in the former case the worm inserts the stretched out and  attenuated anterior extremity of its body into any little crevice  or hole and then as perrier remarks 36 the pharynx is pushed  forwards into this part which consequently swells and pushes away  the earth on all sides  the anterior extremity thus serves as a  wedge  it also serves as we have before seen for prehension and  suction and as a tactile organ  a worm was placed on loose mould  and it buried itself in between two and three minutes  on another  occasion four worms disappeared in 15 minutes between the sides of  the pot and the earth which had been moderately pressed down  on  a third occasion three large worms and a small one were placed on  loose mould well mixed with fine sand and firmly pressed down and  they all disappeared except the tail of one in 35 minutes  on a  fourth occasion six large worms were placed on argillaceous mud  mixed with sand firmly pressed down and they disappeared except  the extreme tips of the tails of two of them in 40 minutes  in  none of these cases did the worms swallow as far as could be  seen any earth  they generally entered the ground close to the  sides of the pot  a pot was next filled with very fine ferruginous sand which was  pressed down well watered and thus rendered extremely compact  a  large worm left on the surface did not succeed in penetrating it  for some hours and did not bury itself completely until 25 hrs 40  min had elapsed  this was effected by the sand being swallowed  as was evident by the large quantity ejected from the vent long  before the whole body had disappeared  castings of a similar  nature continued to be ejected from the burrow during the whole of  the following day  as doubts have been expressed by some writers whether worms ever  swallow earth solely for the sake of making their burrows some  additional cases may be given  a mass of fine reddish sand 23  inches in thickness left on the ground for nearly two years had  been penetrated in many places by worms and their castings  consisted partly of the reddish sand and partly of black earth  brought up from beneath the mass  this sand had been dug up from a  considerable depth and was of so poor a nature that weeds could  not grow on it  it is therefore highly improbable that it should  have been swallowed by the worms as food  again in a field near my  house the castings frequently consist of almost pure chalk which  lies at only a little depth beneath the surface and here again it  is very improbable that the chalk should have been swallowed for  the sake of the very little organic matter which could have  percolated into it from the poor overlying pasture  lastly a  casting thrown up through the concrete and decayed mortar between  the tiles with which the now ruined aisle of beaulieu abbey had  formerly been paved was washed so that the coarser matter alone  was left  this consisted of grains of quartz micaceous slate  other rocks and bricks or tiles many of them from 120 to 110  inch in diameter  no one will suppose that these grains were  swallowed as food yet they formed more than half of the casting  for they weighed 19 grains the whole casting having weighed 33  grains  whenever a worm burrows to a depth of some feet in  undisturbed compact ground it must form its passage by swallowing  the earth for it is incredible that the ground could yield on all  sides to the pressure of the pharynx when pushed forwards within  the worms body  that worms swallow a larger quantity of earth for the sake of  extracting any nutritious matter which it may contain than for  making their burrows appears to me certain  but as this old  belief has been doubted by so high an authority as claparede  evidence in its favour must be given in some detail  there is no a  priori improbability in such a belief for besides other annelids  especially the arenicola marina which throws up such a profusion  of castings on our tidal sands and which it is believed thus  subsists there are animals belonging to the most distinct classes  which do not burrow but habitually swallow large quantities of  sand namely the molluscan onchidium and many echinoderms 37  if earth were swallowed only when worms deepened their burrows or  made new ones castings would be thrown up only occasionally but  in many places fresh castings may be seen every morning and the  amount of earth ejected from the same burrow on successive days is  large  yet worms do not burrow to a great depth except when the  weather is very dry or intensely cold  on my lawn the black  vegetable mould or humus is only about 5 inches in thickness and  overlies lightcoloured or reddish clayey soil  now when castings  are thrown up in the greatest profusion only a small proportion  are light coloured and it is incredible that the worms should  daily make fresh burrows in every direction in the thin superficial  layer of darkcoloured mould unless they obtained nutriment of  some kind from it  i have observed a strictly analogous case in a  field near my house where bright red clay lay close beneath the  surface  again on one part of the downs near winchester the  vegetable mould overlying the chalk was found to be only from 3 to  4 inches in thickness and the many castings here ejected were as  black as ink and did not effervesce with acids so that the worms  must have confined themselves to this thin superficial layer of  mould of which large quantities were daily swallowed  in another  place at no great distance the castings were white and why the  worms should have burrowed into the chalk in some places and not in  others i am unable to conjecture  two great piles of leaves had been left to decay in my grounds and  months after their removal the bare surface several yards in  diameter was so thickly covered during several months with  castings that they formed an almost continuous layer and the large  number of worms which lived here must have subsisted during these  months on nutritious matter contained in the black earth  the lowest layer from another pile of decayed leaves mixed with  some earth was examined under a high power and the number of  spores of various shapes and sizes which it contained was  astonishingly great and these crushed in the gizzards of worms may  largely aid in supporting them  whenever castings are thrown up in  the greatest number few or no leaves are drawn into the burrows  for instance the turf along a hedgerow about 200 yards in length  was daily observed in the autumn during several weeks and every  morning many fresh castings were seen but not a single leaf was  drawn into these burrows  these castings from their blackness and  from the nature of the subsoil could not have been brought up from  a greater depth than 6 or 8 inches  on what could these worms have  subsisted during this whole time if not on matter contained in the  black earth  on the other hand whenever a large number of leaves  are drawn into the burrows the worms seem to subsist chiefly on  them for few earthcastings are then ejected on the surface  this  difference in the behaviour of worms at different times perhaps  explains a statement by claparede namely that triturated leaves  and earth are always found in distinct parts of their intestines  worms sometimes abound in places where they can rarely or never  obtain dead or living leaves for instance beneath the pavement in  wellswept courtyards into which leaves are only occasionally  blown  my son horace examined a house one corner of which had  subsided and he found here in the cellar which was extremely  damp many small wormcastings thrown up between the stones with  which the cellar was paved and in this case it is improbable that  the worms could ever have obtained leaves  mr a c horner  confirms this account as he has seen castings in the cellars of  his house which is an old one at tonbridge  but the best evidence known to me of worms subsisting for at  least considerable periods of time solely on the organic matter  contained in earth is afforded by some facts communicated to me by  dr king  near nice large castings abound in extraordinary  numbers so that 5 or 6 were often found within the space of a  square foot  they consist of fine palecoloured earth containing  calcareous matter which after having passed through the bodies of  worms and being dried coheres with considerable force  i have  reason to believe that these castings had been formed by species of  perichaeta which have been naturalized here from the east 38   they rise like towers with their summits often a little broader  than their bases sometimes to a height of above 3 and often to a  height of 25 inches  the tallest of those which were measured was  33 inches in height and 1 inch in diameter  a small cylindrical  passage runs up the centre of each tower through which the worm  ascends to eject the earth which it has swallowed and thus to add  to its height  a structure of this kind would not allow leaves  being easily dragged from the surrounding ground into the burrows  and dr king who looked carefully never saw even a fragment of a  leaf thus drawn in  nor could any trace be discovered of the worms  having crawled down the exterior surfaces of the towers in search  of leaves and had they done so tracks would almost certainly have  been left on the upper part whilst it remained soft  it does not  however follow that these worms do not draw leaves into their  burrows during some other season of the year at which time they  would not build up their towers  from the several foregoing cases it can hardly be doubted that  worms swallow earth not only for the sake of making their burrows  but for obtaining food  hensen however concludes from his  analyses of mould that worms probably could not live on ordinary  vegetable mould though he admits that they might be nourished to  some extent by leafmould 39  but we have seen that worms  eagerly devour raw meat fat and dead worms and ordinary mould  can hardly fail to contain many ova larvae and small living or  dead creatures spores of cryptogamic plants and micrococci such  as those which give rise to saltpetre  these various organisms  together with some cellulose from any leaves and roots not utterly  decayed might well account for such large quantities of mould  being swallowed by worms  it may be worth while here to recall the  fact that certain species of utricularia which grow in damp places  in the tropics possess bladders beautifully constructed for  catching minute subterranean animals and these traps would not  have been developed unless many small animals inhabited such soil  the depth to which worms penetrate and the construction of their  burrowsalthough worms usually live near the surface yet they  burrow to a considerable depth during longcontinued dry weather  and severe cold  in scandinavia according to eisen and in  scotland according to mr lindsay carnagie the burrows run down  to a depth of from 7 to 8 feet in north germany according to  hoffmeister from 6 to 8 feet but hensen says from 3 to 6 feet   this latter observer has seen worms frozen at a depth of 15 feet  beneath the surface  i have not myself had many opportunities for  observation but i have often met with worms at depths of 3 to 4  feet  in a bed of fine sand overlying the chalk which had never  been disturbed a worm was cut into two at 55 inches and another  was found here at down in december at the bottom of its burrow at  61 inches beneath the surface  lastly in earth near an old roman  villa which had not been disturbed for many centuries a worm was  met with at a depth of 66 inches and this was in the middle of  august  the burrows run down perpendicularly or more commonly a little  obliquely  they are said sometimes to branch but as far as i have  seen this does not occur except in recently dug ground and near  the surface  they are generally or as i believe invariably lined  with a thin layer of fine darkcoloured earth voided by the worms  so that they must at first be made a little wider than their  ultimate diameter  i have seen several burrows in undisturbed sand  thus lined at a depth of 4 ft 6 in and others close to the  surface thus lined in recently dug ground  the walls of fresh  burrows are often dotted with little globular pellets of voided  earth still soft and viscid and these as it appears are spread  out on all sides by the worm as it travels up or down its burrow   the lining thus formed becomes very compact and smooth when nearly  dry and closely fits the worms body  the minute reflexed  bristles which project in rows on all sides from the body thus  have excellent points of support and the burrow is rendered well  adapted for the rapid movement of the animal  the lining appears  also to strengthen the walls and perhaps saves the worms body  from being scratched  i think so because several burrows which  passed through a layer of sifted coalcinders spread over turf to  a thickness of 15 inch had been thus lined to an unusual  thickness  in this case the worms judging from the castings had  pushed the cinders away on all sides and had not swallowed any of  them  in another place burrows similarly lined passed through a  layer of coarse coalcinders 35 inches in thickness  we thus see  that the burrows are not mere excavations but may rather be  compared with tunnels lined with cement  the mouths of the burrow are in addition often lined with leaves  and this is an instinct distinct from that of plugging them up and  does not appear to have been hitherto noticed  many leaves of the  scotchfir or pine pinus sylvestris were given to worms kept in  confinement in two pots and when after several weeks the earth was  carefully broken up the upper parts of three oblique burrows were  found surrounded for lengths of 7 4 and 35 inches with pine leaves together with fragments of other leaves which had been  given the worms as food  glass beads and bits of tile which had  been strewed on the surface of the soil were stuck into the  interstices between the pineleaves and these interstices were  likewise plastered with the viscid castings voided by the worms   the structures thus formed cohered so well that i succeeded in  removing one with only a little earth adhering to it  it consisted  of a slightly curved cylindrical case the interior of which could  be seen through holes in the sides and at either end  the pine leaves had all been drawn in by their bases and the sharp points  of the needles had been pressed into the lining of voided earth   had this not been effectually done the sharp points would have  prevented the retreat of the worms into their burrows and these  structures would have resembled traps armed with converging points  of wire rendering the ingress of an animal easy and its egress  difficult or impossible  the skill shown by these worms is  noteworthy and is the more remarkable as the scotch pine is not a  native of this district  after having examined these burrows made by worms in confinement i  looked at those in a flowerbed near some scotch pines  these had  all been plugged up in the ordinary manner with the leaves of this  tree drawn in for a length of from 1 to 15 inch but the mouths  of many of them were likewise lined with them mingled with  fragments of other kinds of leaves drawn in to a depth of 4 or 5  inches  worms often remain as formerly stated for a long time  close to the mouths of their burrows apparently for warmth and  the basketlike structures formed of leaves would keep their bodies  from coming into close contact with the cold damp earth  that they  habitually rested on the pineleaves was rendered probable by  their clean and almost polished surfaces  the burrows which run far down into the ground generally or at  least often terminate in a little enlargement or chamber  here  according to hoffmeister one or several worms pass the winter  rolled up into a ball  mr lindsay carnagie informed me 1838  that he had examined many burrows over a stonequarry in scotland  where the overlying boulderclay and mould had recently been  cleared away and a little vertical cliff thus left  in several  cases the same burrow was a little enlarged at two or three points  one beneath the other and all the burrows terminated in a rather  large chamber at a depth of 7 or 8 feet from the surface  these  chambers contained many small sharp bits of stone and husks of  flaxseeds  they must also have contained living seeds for on the  following spring mr carnagie saw grassplants sprouting out of  some of the intersected chambers  i found at abinger in surrey two  burrows terminating in similar chambers at a depth of 36 and 41  inches and these were lined or paved with little pebbles about as  large as mustard seeds and in one of the chambers there was a  decayed oatgrain with its husk  hensen likewise states that the  bottoms of the burrows are lined with little stones and where  these could not be procured seeds apparently of the pear had  been used as many as fifteen having been carried down into a  single burrow one of which had germinated 40  we thus see how  easily a botanist might be deceived who wished to learn how long  deeply buried seeds remained alive if he were to collect earth  from a considerable depth on the supposition that it could contain  only seeds which had long lain buried  it is probable that the  little stones as well as the seeds are carried down from the  surface by being swallowed for a surprising number of glass beads  bits of tile and of glass were certainly thus carried down by worms  kept in pots but some may have been carried down within their  mouths  the sole conjecture which i can form why worms line their  winterquarters with little stones and seeds is to prevent their  closely coiledup bodies from coming into close contact with the  surrounding cold soil and such contact would perhaps interfere  with their respiration which is effected by the skin alone  a worm after swallowing earth whether for making its burrow or for  food soon comes to the surface to empty its body  the ejected  earth is thoroughly mingled with the intestinal secretions and is  thus rendered viscid  after being dried it sets hard  i have  watched worms during the act of ejection and when the earth was in  a very liquid state it was ejected in little spurts and by a slow  peristaltic movement when not so liquid  it is not cast  indifferently on any side but with some care first on one and  then on another side the tail being used almost like a trowel   when a worm comes to the surface to eject earth the tail  protrudes but when it collects leaves its head must protrude   worms therefore must have the power of turning round in their  closelyfitting burrows and this as it appears to us would be a  difficult feat  as soon as a little heap has been formed the worm  apparently avoids for the sake of safety protruding its tail and  the earthy matter is forced up through the previously deposited  soft mass  the mouth of the same burrow is used for this purpose  for a considerable time  in the case of the towerlike castings  see fig 2 near nice and of the similar but still taller towers  from bengal hereafter to be described and figured a considerable  degree of skill is exhibited in their construction  dr king also  observed that the passage up these towers hardly ever ran in the  same exact line with the underlying burrow so that a thin  cylindrical object such as a haulm of grass could not be passed  down the tower into the burrow and this change of direction  probably serves in some manner as a protection  worms do not always eject their castings on the surface of the  ground  when they can find any cavity as when burrowing in newly  turnedup earth or between the stems of bankedup plants they  deposit their castings in such places  so again any hollow beneath  a large stone lying on the surface of the ground is soon filled up  with their castings  according to hensen old burrows are  habitually used for this purpose but as far as my experience  serves this is not the case excepting with those near the surface  in recently dug ground  i think that hensen may have been deceived  by the walls of old burrows lined with black earth having sunk in  or collapsed for black streaks are thus left and these are  conspicuous when passing through lightcoloured soil and might be  mistaken for completely filledup burrows  it is certain that old burrows collapse in the course of time for  as we shall see in the next chapter the fine earth voided by  worms if spread out uniformly would form in many places in the  course of a year a layer 02 of an inch in thickness so that at  any rate this large amount is not deposited within the old unused  burrows  if the burrows did not collapse the whole ground would  be first thickly riddled with holes to a depth of about ten inches  and in fifty years a hollow unsupported space ten inches in depth  would be left  the holes left by the decay of successively formed  roots of trees and plants must likewise collapse in the course of  time  the burrows of worms run down perpendicularly or a little  obliquely and where the soil is at all argillaceous there is no  difficulty in believing that the walls would slowly flow or slide  inwards during very wet weather  when however the soil is sandy  or mingled with many small stones it can hardly be viscous enough  to flow inwards during even the wettest weather but another agency  may here come into play  after much rain the ground swells and as  it cannot expand laterally the surface rises during dry weather  it sinks again  for instance a large flat stone laid on the  surface of a field sank 333 mm whilst the weather was dry between  may 9th and june 13th and rose 191 mm between september 7th and  19th of the same year much rain having fallen during the latter  part of this time  during frosts and thaws the movements were  twice as great  these observations were made by my son horace who  will hereafter publish an account of the movements of this stone  during successive wet and dry seasons and of the effects of its  being undermined by worms  now when the ground swells if it be  penetrated by cylindrical holes such as wormburrows their walls  will tend to yield and be pressed inwards and the yielding will be  greater in the deeper parts supposing the whole to be equally  moistened from the greater weight of the superincumbent soil which  has to be raised than in the parts near the surface  when the  ground dries the walls will shrink a little and the burrows will  be a little enlarged  their enlargement however through the  lateral contraction of the ground will not be favoured but rather  opposed by the weight of the superincumbent soil  distribution of wormsearthworms are found in all parts of the  world and some of the genera have an enormous range 41  they  inhabit the most isolated islands they abound in iceland and are  known to exist in the west indies st helena madagascar new  caledonia and tahiti  in the antarctic regions worms from  kerguelen land have been described by ray lankester and i found  them in the falkland islands  how they reach such isolated islands  is at present quite unknown  they are easily killed by saltwater  and it does not appear probable that young worms or their egg capsules could be carried in earth adhering to the feet or beaks of  landbirds  moreover kerguelen land is not now inhabited by any  landbird  in this volume we are chiefly concerned with the earth cast up by  worms and i have gleaned a few facts on this subject with respect  to distant lands  worms throw up plenty of castings in the united  states  in venezuela castings probably ejected by species of  urochaeta are common in the gardens and fields but not in the  forests as i hear from dr ernst of caracas  he collected 156  castings from the courtyard of his house having an area of 200  square yards  they varied in bulk from half a cubic centimeter to  five cubic centimeters and were on an average three cubic  centimeters  they were therefore of small size in comparison  with those often found in england for six large castings from a  field near my house averaged 16 cubic centimeters  several species  of earthworms are common in st catharina in south brazil and  fritz muller informs me that in most parts of the forests and  pasturelands the whole soil to a depth of a quarter of a metre  looks as if it had passed repeatedly through the intestines of  earthworms even where hardly any castings are to be seen on the  surface  a gigantic but very rare species is found there the  burrows of which are sometimes even two centimeters or nearly 08  of an inch in diameter and which apparently penetrate the ground  to a great depth  in the dry climate of new south wales i hardly expected that worms  would be common but dr g krefft of sydney to whom i applied  after making inquiries from gardeners and others and from his own  observations informs me that their castings abound  he sent me  some collected after heavy rain and they consisted of little  pellets about 015 inch in diameter and the blackened sandy earth  of which they were formed still cohered with considerable tenacity  the late mr john scott of the botanic gardens near calcutta made  many observations for me on worms living under the hot and humid  climate of bengal  the castings abound almost everywhere in  jungles and in the open ground to a greater degree as he thinks  than in england  after the water has subsided from the flooded  ricefields the whole surface very soon becomes studded with  castingsa fact which much surprised mr scott as he did not know  how long worms could survive beneath water  they cause much  trouble in the botanic garden for some of the finest of our lawns  can be kept in anything like order only by being almost daily  rolled if left undisturbed for a few days they become studded with  large castings  these closely resemble those described as  abounding near nice and they are probably the work of a species of  perichaeta  they stand up like towers with an open passage in the  centre  a figure of one of these castings from a photograph is here given  fig 3  the largest received by me was 35 inches in height and  135 inch in diameter another was only 075 inch in diameter and  275 in height  in the following year mr scott measured several  of the largest one was 6 inches in height and nearly 15 in  diameter  two others were 5 inches in height and respectively 2  and rather more than 25 inches in diameter  the average weight of  the 22 castings sent to me was 35 grammes 125 oz and one of  them weighed 448 grammes or 2 oz all these castings were  thrown up either in one night or in two  where the ground in  bengal is dry as under large trees castings of a different kind  are found in vast numbers  these consist of little oval or conical  bodies from about the 120 to rather above 110 of an inch in  length  they are obviously voided by a distinct species of worms  the period during which worms near calcutta display such  extraordinary activity lasts for only a little over two months  namely during the cool season after the rains  at this time they  are generally found within about 10 inches beneath the surface   during the hot season they burrow to a greater depth and are then  found coiled up and apparently hybernating  mr scott has never  seen them at a greater depth than 25 feet but has heard of their  having been found at 4 feet  within the forests fresh castings  may be found even during the hot season  the worms in the botanic  garden during the cool and dry season draw many leaves and little  sticks into the mouths of their burrows like our english worms  but they rarely act in this manner during the rainy season  mr scott saw wormcastings on the lofty mountains of sikkim in  north india  in south india dr king found in one place on the  plateau of the nilgiris at an elevation of 7000 feet a good many  castings which are interesting for their great size  the worms  which eject them are seen only during the wet season and are  reported to be from 12 to 15 inches in length and as thick as a  mans little finger  these castings were collected by dr king  after a period of 110 days without any rain and they must have  been ejected either during the northeast or more probably during  the previous southwest monsoon for their surfaces had suffered  some disintegration and they were penetrated by many fine roots  a  drawing is here given fig 4 of one which seems to have best  retained its original size and appearance  notwithstanding some  loss from disintegration five of the largest of these castings  after having been well sundried weighed each on an average 895  grammes or above 3 oz and the largest weighed 12314 grammes or  433 ozthat is above a quarter of a pound  the largest  convolutions were rather more than one inch in diameter but it is  probable that they had subsided a little whilst soft and that  their diameters had thus been increased  some had flowed so much  that they now consisted of a pile of almost flat confluent cakes   all were formed of fine rather lightcoloured earth and were  surprisingly hard and compact owing no doubt to the animal matter  by which the particles of earth had been cemented together  they  did not disintegrate even when left for some hours in water   although they had been cast up on the surface of gravelly soil  they contained extremely few bits of rock the largest of which was  only 015 inch in diameter  dr king saw in ceylon a worm about 2 feet in length and 05 inch  in diameter and he was told that it was a very common species  during the wet season  these worms must throw up castings at least  as large as those on the nilgiri mountains but dr king saw none  during his short visit to ceylon  sufficient facts have now been given showing that worms do much  work in bringing up fine earth to the surface in most or all parts  of the world and under the most different climates    chapter iiithe amount of fine earth brought up by worms to the  surface    rate at which various objects strewed on the surface

spread outthe slow rate at which mould can increase to  a great thicknessconclusion   we now come to the more immediate subject of this volume namely  the amount of earth which is brought up by worms from beneath the  surface and is afterwards spread out more or less completely by  the rain and wind  the amount can be judged of by two methodsby  the rate at which objects left on the surface are buried and more  accurately by weighing the quantity brought up within a given time   we will begin with the first method as it was first followed  near mael hall in staffordshire quicklime had been spread about  the year 1827 thickly over a field of good pastureland which had  not since been ploughed  some square holes were dug in this field  in the beginning of october 1837 and the sections showed a layer  of turf formed by the matted roots of the grasses 05 inch in  thickness beneath which at a depth of 25 inches or 3 inches  from the surface a layer of the lime in powder or in small lumps  could be distinctly seen running all round the vertical sides of  the holes  the soil beneath the layer of lime was either gravelly  or of a coarse sandy nature and differed considerably in  appearance from the overlying darkcoloured fine mould  coal cinders had been spread over a part of this same field either in  the year 1833 or 1834 and when the above holes were dug that is  after an interval of 3 or 4 years the cinders formed a line of  black spots round the holes at a depth of 1 inch beneath the  surface parallel to and above the white layer of lime  over  another part of this field cinders had been strewed only about  halfayear before and these either still lay on the surface or  were entangled among the roots of the grasses and i here saw the  commencement of the burying process for wormcastings had been  heaped on several of the smaller fragments  after an interval of  475 years this field was reexamined and now the two layers of  lime and cinders were found almost everywhere at a greater depth  than before by nearly 1 inch we will say by 075 of an inch   therefore mould to an average thickness of 022 of an inch had been  annually brought up by the worms and had been spread over the  surface of this field  coalcinders had been strewed over another field at a date which  could not be positively ascertained so thickly that they formed  october 1837 a layer 1 inch in thickness at a depth of about 3  inches from the surface  the layer was so continuous that the  overlying dark vegetable mould was connected with the subsoil of  red clay only by the roots of the grasses and when these were  broken the mould and the red clay fell apart  in a third field  on which coalcinders and burnt marl had been strewed several times  at unknown dates holes were dug in 1842 and a layer of cinders  could be traced at a depth of 35 inches beneath which at a depth  of 95 inches from the surface there was a line of cinders together  with burnt marl  on the sides of one hole there were two layers of  cinders at 2 and 35 inches beneath the surface and below them at  a depth in parts of 95 and in other parts of 105 inches there  were fragments of burnt marl  in a fourth field two layers of  lime one above the other could be distinctly traced and beneath  them a layer of cinders and burnt marl at a depth of from 10 to 12  inches below the surface  a piece of waste swampy land was enclosed drained ploughed  harrowed and thickly covered in the year 1822 with burnt marl and  cinders  it was sowed with grass seeds and now supports a  tolerably good but coarse pasture  holes were dug in this field in  1837 or 15 years after its reclamation and we see in the  accompanying diagram fig 5 reduced to half of the natural  scale that the turf was 1 inch thick beneath which there was a  layer of vegetable mould 25 inches thick  this layer did not  contain fragments of any kind but beneath it there was a layer of  mould 15 inch in thickness full of fragments of burnt marl  conspicuous from their red colour one of which near the bottom was  an inch in length and other fragments of coalcinders together  with a few white quartz pebbles  beneath this layer and at a depth  of 45 inches from the surface the original black peaty sandy  soil with a few quartz pebbles was encountered  here therefore the  fragments of burnt marl and cinders had been covered in the course  of 15 years by a layer of fine vegetable mould only 25 inches in  thickness excluding the turf  six and a half years subsequently  this field was reexamined and the fragments were now found at  from 4 to 5 inches beneath the surface  so that in this interval  of 65 years about 15 inch of mould had been added to the  superficial layer  i am surprised that a greater quantity had not  been brought up during the whole 215 years for in the closely  underlying black peaty soil there were many worms  it is  however probable that formerly whilst the land remained poor  worms were scanty and the mould would then have accumulated  slowly  the average annual increase of thickness for the whole  period is 019 of an inch  two other cases are worth recording  in the spring of 1835 a  field which had long existed as poor pasture and was so swampy  that it trembled slightly when stamped on was thickly covered with  red sand so that the whole surface appeared at first bright red   when holes were dug in this field after an interval of about 25  years the sand formed a layer at a depth of 075 in beneath the  surface  in 1842 ie 7 years after the sand had been laid on  fresh holes were dug and now the red sand formed a distinct layer  2 inches beneath the surface or 15 inch beneath the turf so that  on an average 021 inch of mould had been annually brought to the  surface  immediately beneath the layer of red sand the original  substratum of black sandy peat extended  a grass field likewise not far from maer hall had formerly been  thickly covered with marl and was then left for several years as  pasture it was afterwards ploughed  a friend had three trenches  dug in this field 28 years after the application of the marl 42  and a layer of the marl fragments could be traced at a depth  carefully measured of 12 inches in some parts and of 14 inches in  other parts  this difference in depth depended on the layer being  horizontal whilst the surface consisted of ridges and furrows from  the field having been ploughed  the tenant assured me that it had  never been turned up to a greater depth than from 6 to 8 inches  and as the fragments formed an unbroken horizontal layer from 12 to  14 inches beneath the surface these must have been buried by the  worms whilst the land was in pasture before it was ploughed for  otherwise they would have been indiscriminately scattered by the  plough throughout the whole thickness of the soil  fourandahalf  years afterwards i had three holes dug in this field in which  potatoes had been lately planted and the layer of marlfragments  was now found 13 inches beneath the bottoms of the furrows and  therefore probably 15 inches beneath the general level of the  field  it should however be observed that the thickness of the  blackish sandy soil which had been thrown up by the worms above  the marlfragments in the course of 325 years would have measured  less than 15 inches if the field had always remained as pasture  for the soil would in this case have been much more compact  the  fragments of marl almost rested on an undisturbed substratum of  white sand with quartz pebbles and as this would be little  attractive to worms the mould would hereafter be very slowly  increased by their action  we will now give some cases of the action of worms on land  differing widely from the dry sandy or the swampy pastures just  described  the chalk formation extends all round my house in kent  and its surface from having been exposed during an immense period  to the dissolving action of rainwater is extremely irregular  being abruptly festooned and penetrated by many deep welllike  cavities 43  during the dissolution of the chalk the insoluble  matter including a vast number of unrolled flints of all sizes  has been left on the surface and forms a bed of stiff red clay  full of flints and generally from 6 to 14 feet in thickness  over  the red clay wherever the land has long remained as pasture there  is a layer a few inches in thickness of darkcoloured vegetable  mould  a quantity of broken chalk was spread on december 20 1842 over a  part of a field near my house which had existed as pasture  certainly for 30 probably for twice or thrice as many years  the  chalk was laid on the land for the sake of observing at some future  period to what depth it would become buried  at the end of  november 1871 that is after an interval of 29 years a trench was  dug across this part of the field and a line of white nodules  could be traced on both sides of the trench at a depth of 7 inches  from the surface  the mould therefore excluding the turf had  here been thrown up at an average rate of 022 inch per year   beneath the line of chalk nodules there was in parts hardly any  fine earth free of flints while in other parts there was a layer  225 inches in thickness  in this latter case the mould was  altogether 925 inches thick and in one such spot a nodule of  chalk and a smooth flint pebble both of which must have been left  at some former time on the surface were found at this depth  at  from 11 to 12 inches beneath the surface the undisturbed reddish  clay full of flints extended  the appearance of the above  nodules of chalk surprised me much at first as they closely  resembled waterworn pebbles whereas the freshlybroken fragments  had been angular  but on examining the nodules with a lens they  no longer appeared waterworn for their surfaces were pitted  through unequal corrosion and minute sharp points formed of  broken fossil shells projected from them  it was evident that the  corners of the original fragments of chalk had been wholly  dissolved from presenting a large surface to the carbonic acid  dissolved in the rainwater and to that generated in soil  containing vegetable matter as well as to the humusacids 44   the projecting corners would also relatively to the other parts  have been embraced by a larger number of living rootlets and these  have the power of even attacking marble as sachs has shown  thus  in the course of 29 years buried angular fragments of chalk had  been converted into wellrounded nodules  another part of this same field was mossy and as it was thought  that sifted coalcinders would improve the pasture a thick layer  was spread over this part either in 1842 or 1843 and another layer  some years afterwards  in 1871 a trench was here dug and many  cinders lay in a line at a depth of 7 inches beneath the surface  with another line at a depth of 55 inches parallel to the one  beneath  in another part of this field which had formerly existed  as a separate one and which it was believed had been pastureland  for more than a century trenches were dug to see how thick the  vegetable mould was  by chance the first trench was made at a spot  where at some former period certainly more than forty years  before a large hole had been filled up with coarse red clay  flints fragments of chalk and gravel and here the fine vegetable  mould was only from 4125 to 4375 inches in thickness  in another  and undisturbed place the mould varied much in thickness namely  from 65 to 85 inches beneath which a few small fragments of  brick were found in one place  from these several cases it would  appear that during the last 29 years mould has been heaped on the  surface at an average annual rate of from 02 to 022 of an inch   but in this district when a ploughed field is first laid down in  grass the mould accumulates at a much slower rate  the rate  also must become very much slower after a bed of mould several  inches in thickness has been formed for the worms then live  chiefly near the surface and burrow down to a greater depth so as  to bring up fresh earth from below only during the winter when the  weather is very cold at which time worms were found in this field  at a depth of 26 inches and during summer when the weather is  very dry  a field which adjoins the one just described slopes in one part  rather steeply viz at from 10 degrees to 15 degrees this part  was last ploughed in 1841 was then harrowed and left to become  pastureland  for several years it was clothed with an extremely  scant vegetation and was so thickly covered with small and large  flints some of them half as large as a childs head that the  field was always called by my sons the stony field  when they  ran down the slope the stones clattered together i remember  doubting whether i should live to see these larger flints covered  with vegetable mould and turf  but the smaller stones disappeared  before many years had elapsed as did every one of the larger ones  after a time so that after thirty years 1871 a horse could  gallop over the compact turf from one end of the field to the  other and not strike a single stone with his shoes  to anyone who  remembered the appearance of the field in 1842 the transformation  was wonderful  this was certainly the work of the worms for  though castings were not frequent for several years yet some were  thrown up month after month and these gradually increased in  numbers as the pasture improved  in the year 1871 a trench was dug  on the above slope and the blades of grass were cut off close to  the roots so that the thickness of the turf and of the vegetable  mould could be measured accurately  the turf was rather less than  half an inch and the mould which did not contain any stones 25  inches in thickness  beneath this lay coarse clayey earth full of  flints like that in any of the neighbouring ploughed fields  this  coarse earth easily fell apart from the overlying mould when a spit  was lifted up  the average rate of accumulation of the mould  during the whole thirty years was only 083 inch per year ie  nearly one inch in twelve years but the rate must have been much  slower at first and afterwards considerably quicker  the transformation in the appearance of this field which had been  effected beneath my eyes was afterwards rendered the more  striking when i examined in knole park a dense forest of lofty  beechtrees beneath which nothing grew  here the ground was  thickly strewed with large naked stones and wormcastings were  almost wholly absent  obscure lines and irregularities on the  surface indicated that the land had been cultivated some centuries  ago  it is probable that a thick wood of young beechtrees sprung  up so quickly that time enough was not allowed for worms to cover  up the stones with their castings before the site became unfitted  for their existence  anyhow the contrast between the state of the  now miscalled stony field well stocked with worms and the  present state of the ground beneath the old beechtrees in knole  park where worms appeared to be absent was striking  a narrow path running across part of my lawn was paved in 1843 with  small flagstones set edgeways but worms threw up many castings  and weeds grew thickly between them  during several years the path  was weeded and swept but ultimately the weeds and worms prevailed  and the gardener ceased to sweep merely mowing off the weeds as  often as the lawn was mowed  the path soon became almost covered  up and after several years no trace of it was left  on removing  in 1877 the thin overlying layer of turf the small flagstones  all in their proper places were found covered by an inch of fine  mould  two recently published accounts of substances strewed on the  surface of pastureland having become buried through the action of  worms may be here noticed  the rev h c key had a ditch cut in  a field over which coalashes had been spread as it was believed  eighteen years before and on the cleancut perpendicular sides of  the ditch at a depth of at least seven inches there could be  seen for a length of 60 yards a distinct very even narrow line  of coalashes mixed with small coal perfectly parallel with the  topsward 45  this parallelism and the length of the section  give interest to the case  secondly mr dancer states 46 that  crushed bones had been thickly strewed over a field and some  years afterwards these were found several inches below the  surface at a uniform depth  the rev mr zincke informs me that he has lately had an orchard  dug to the unusual depth of 4 feet  the upper 18 inches consisted  of darkcoloured vegetable mould and the next 18 inches of sandy  loam containing in the lower part many rolled pieces of sandstone  with some bits of brick and tile probably of roman origin as  remains of this period have been found close by  the sandy loam  rested on an indurated ferruginous pan of yellow clay on the  surface of which two perfect celts were found  if as seems  probable the celts were originally left on the surface of the  land they have since been covered up with earth 3 feet in  thickness all of which has probably passed through the bodies of  worms excepting the stones which may have been scattered on the  surface at different times together with manure or by other means   it is difficult otherwise to understand the source of the 18 inches  of sandy loam which differed from the overlying dark vegetable  mould after both had been burnt only in being of a brighter red  colour and in not being quite so finegrained  but on this view  we must suppose that the carbon in vegetable mould when it lies at  some little depth beneath the surface and does not continually  receive decaying vegetable matter from above loses its dark colour  in the course of centuries but whether this is probable i do not  know  worms appear to act in the same manner in new zealand as in europe  for professor j von haast has described 47 a section near the  coast consisting of micaschist covered by 5 or 6 feet of loess  above which about 12 inches of vegetable soil had accumulated   between the loess and the mould there was a layer from 3 to 6  inches in thickness consisting of cores implements flakes and  chips all manufactured from hard basaltic rock  it is therefore  probable that the aborigines at some former period had left these  objects on the surface and that they had afterwards been slowly  covered up by the castings of worms  farmers in england are well aware that objects of all kinds left  on the surface of pastureland after a time disappear or as they  say work themselves downwards  how powdered lime cinders and  heavy stones can work down and at the same rate through the  matted roots of a grasscovered surface is a question which has  probably never occurred to them 48  the sinking of great stones through the action of wormswhen a  stone of large size and of irregular shape is left on the surface  of the ground it rests of course on the more protuberant parts  but worms soon fill up with their castings all the hollow spaces on  the lower side for as hensen remarks they like the shelter of  stones  as soon as the hollows are filled up the worms eject the  earth which they have swallowed beyond the circumference of the  stones and thus the surface of the ground is raised all round the  stone  as the burrows excavated directly beneath the stone after a  time collapse the stone sinks a little 49  hence it is that  boulders which at some ancient period have rolled down from a rocky  mountain or cliff on to a meadow at its base are always somewhat  imbedded in the soil and when removed leave an exact impression  of their lower surfaces in the underlying fine mould  if however  a boulder is of such huge dimensions that the earth beneath is  kept dry such earth will not be inhabited by worms and the  boulder will not sink into the ground  a limekiln formerly stood in a grassfield near leith hill place  in surrey and was pulled down 35 years before my visit all the  loose rubbish had been carted away excepting three large stones of  quartzose sandstone which it was thought might hereafter be of  some use  an old workman remembered that they had been left on a  bare surface of broken bricks and mortar close to the foundations  of the kiln but the whole surrounding surface is now covered with  turf and mould  the two largest of these stones had never since  been moved nor could this easily have been done as when i had  them removed it was the work of two men with levers  one of these  stones and not the largest was 64 inches long 17 inches broad  and from 9 to 10 inches in thickness  its lower surface was  somewhat protuberant in the middle and this part still rested on  broken bricks and mortar showing the truth of the old workmans  account  beneath the brick rubbish the natural sandy soil full of  fragments of sandstone was found and this could have yielded very  little if at all to the weight of the stone as might have been  expected if the subsoil had been clay  the surface of the field  for a distance of about 9 inches round the stone gradually sloped  up to it and close to the stone stood in most places about 4  inches above the surrounding ground  the base of the stone was  buried from 1 to 2 inches beneath the general level and the upper  surface projected about 8 inches above this level or about 4  inches above the sloping border of turf  after the removal of the  stone it became evident that one of its pointed ends must at first  have stood clear above the ground by some inches but its upper  surface was now on a level with the surrounding turf  when the  stone was removed an exact cast of its lower side forming a  shallow crateriform hollow was left the inner surface of which  consisted of fine black mould excepting where the more protuberant  parts rested on the brickrubbish  a transverse section of this  stone together with its bed drawn from measurements made after it  had been displaced is here given on a scale of 05 inch to a foot  fig 6  the turfcovered border which sloped up to the stone  consisted of fine vegetable mould in one part 7 inches in  thickness  this evidently consisted of wormcastings several of  which had been recently ejected  the whole stone had sunk in the  thirtyfive years as far as i could judge about 15 inch and  this must have been due to the brickrubbish beneath the more  protuberant parts having been undermined by worms  at this rate  the upper surface of the stone if it had been left undisturbed  would have sunk to the general level of the field in 247 years but  before this could have occurred some earth would have been washed  down by heavy rain from the castings on the raised border of turf  over the upper surface of the stone  the second stone was larger that the one just described viz 67  inches in length 39 in breadth and 15 in thickness  the lower  surface was nearly flat so that the worms must soon have been  compelled to eject their castings beyond its circumference  the  stone as a whole had sunk about 2 inches into the ground  at this  rate it would have required 262 years for its upper surface to have  sunk to the general level of the field  the upwardly sloping  turfcovered border round the stone was broader than in the last  case viz from 14 to 16 inches and why this should be so i  could see no reason  in most parts this border was not so high as  in the last case viz from 2 to 25 inches but in one place it  was as much as 55  its average height close to the stone was  probably about 3 inches and it thinned out to nothing  if so a  layer of fine earth 15 inches in breadth and 15 inch in average  thickness of sufficient length to surround the whole of the much  elongated slab must have been brought up by the worms in chief  part from beneath the stone in the course of 35 years  this amount  would be amply sufficient to account for its having sunk about 2  inches into the ground more especially if we bear in mind that a  good deal of the finest earth would have been washed by heavy rain  from the castings ejected on the sloping border down to the level  of the field  some fresh castings were seen close to the stone   nevertheless on digging a large hole to a depth of 18 inches where  the stone had lain only two worms and a few burrows were seen  although the soil was damp and seemed favourable for worms  there  were some large colonies of ants beneath the stone and possibly  since their establishment the worms had decreased in number  the third stone was only about half as large as the others and two  strong boys could together have rolled it over  i have no doubt  that it had been rolled over at a moderately recent time for it  now lay at some distance from the two other stones at the bottom of  a little adjoining slope  it rested also on fine earth instead of  partly on brickrubbish  in agreement with this conclusion the  raised surrounding border of turf was only 1 inch high in some  parts and 2 inches in other parts  there were no colonies of ants  beneath this stone and on digging a hole where it had lain  several burrows and worms were found  at stonehenge some of the outer druidical stones are now  prostrate having fallen at a remote but unknown period and these  have become buried to a moderate depth in the ground  they are  surrounded by sloping borders of turf on which recent castings  were seen  close to one of these fallen stones which was 17 ft  long 6 ft broad and 285 inches thick a hole was dug and here  the vegetable mould was at least 95 inches in thickness  at this  depth a flint was found and a little higher up on one side of the  hole a fragment of glass  the base of the stone lay about 95  inches beneath the level of the surrounding ground and its upper  surface 19 inches above the ground  a hole was also dug close to a second huge stone which in falling  had broken into two pieces and this must have happened long ago  judging from the weathered aspect of the fractured ends  the base  was buried to a depth of 10 inches as was ascertained by driving  an iron skewer horizontally into the ground beneath it  the  vegetable mould forming the turfcovered sloping border round the  stone on which many castings had recently been ejected was 10  inches in thickness and most of this mould must have been brought  up by worms from beneath its base  at a distance of 8 yards from  the stone the mould was only 55 inches in thickness with a piece  of tobacco pipe at a depth of 4 inches and this rested on broken  flint and chalk which could not have easily yielded to the pressure  or weight of the stone  a straight rod was fixed horizontally by the aid of a spirit level across a third fallen stone which was 7 feet 9 inches long  and the contour of the projecting parts and of the adjoining  ground which was not quite level was thus ascertained as shown  in the accompanying diagram fig 7 on a scale of 05 inch to a  foot  the turfcovered border sloped up to the stone on one side  to a height of 4 inches and on the opposite side to only 25  inches above the general level  a hole was dug on the eastern  side and the base of the stone was here found to lie at a depth of  4 inches beneath the general level of the ground and of 8 inches  beneath the top of the sloping turfcovered border   sufficient evidence has now been given showing that small objects  left on the surface of the land where worms abound soon get buried  and that large stones sink slowly downwards through the same means   every step of the process could be followed from the accidental  deposition of a single casting on a small object lying loose on the  surface to its being entangled amidst the matted roots of the  turf and lastly to its being embedded in the mould at various  depths beneath the surface  when the same field was reexamined  after the interval of a few years such objects were found at a  greater depth than before  the straightness and regularity of the  lines formed by the imbedded objects and their parallelism with  the surface of the land are the most striking features of the  case for this parallelism shows how equably the worms must have  worked the result being however partly the effect of the washing  down of the fresh castings by rain  the specific gravity of the  objects does not affect their rate of sinking as could be seen by  porous cinders burnt marl chalk and quartz pebbles having all  sunk to the same depth within the same time  considering the  nature of the substratum which at leith hill place was sandy soil  including many bits of rock and at stonehenge chalkrubble with  broken flints considering also the presence of the turfcovered  sloping border of mould round the great fragments of stone at both  these places their sinking does not appear to have been sensibly  aided by their weight though this was considerable 50  on the number of worms which live within a given spacewe will  now show firstly what a vast number of worms live unseen by us  beneath our feet and secondly the actual weight of the earth  which they bring up to the surface within a given space and within  a given time  hensen who has published so full and interesting an  account of the habits of worms 51 calculates from the number  which he found in a measured space that there must exist 133000  living worms in a hectare of land or 53767 in an acre  this  latter number of worms would weigh 356 pounds taking hensens  standard of the weight of a single worm namely three grams  it  should however be noted that this calculation is founded on the  numbers found in a garden and hensen believes that worms are here  twice as numerous as in cornfields  the above result astonishing  though it be seems to me credible judging from the number of  worms which i have sometimes seen and from the number daily  destroyed by birds without the species being exterminated  some  barrels of bad ale were left on mr millers land 52 in the hope  of making vinegar but the vinegar proved bad and the barrels were  upset  it should be premised that acetic acid is so deadly a  poison to worms that perrier found that a glass rod dipped into  this acid and then into a considerable body of water in which worms  were immersed invariably killed them quickly  on the morning  after the barrels had been upset the heaps of worms which lay  dead on the ground were so amazing that if mr miller had not seen  them he could not have thought it possible for such numbers to  have existed in the space  as further evidence of the large  number of worms which live in the ground hensen states that he  found in a garden sixtyfour open burrows in a space of 145 square  feet that is nine in 2 square feet  but the burrows are  sometimes much more numerous for when digging in a grassfield  near maer hall i found a cake of dry earth as large as my two  open hands which was penetrated by seven burrows as large as  goosequills  weight of the earth ejected from a single burrow and from all the  burrows within a given spacewith respect to the weight of the  earth daily ejected by worms hensen found that it amounted in the  case of some worms which he kept in confinement and which he  appears to have fed with leaves to only 05 gram or less than 8  grains per diem  but a very much larger amount must be ejected by  worms in their natural state at the periods when they consume  earth as food instead of leaves and when they are making deep  burrows  this is rendered almost certain by the following weights  of the castings thrown up at the mouths of single burrows the  whole of which appeared to have been ejected within no long time  as was certainly the case in several instances  the castings were  dried excepting in one specified instance by exposure during many  days to the sun or before a hot fire   weight of the castings accumulated at the mouth of a single burrow   weight in ounces given in

retained their vermiform configuration generally  exceeded an ounce in weight after being dried and sometimes nearly  equalled a quarter of a pound  on the nilgiri mountains one  casting even exceeded this latter weight  the largest castings in  england were found on extremely poor pastureland and these as  far as i have seen are generally larger than those on land  producing a rich vegetation  it would appear that worms have to  swallow a greater amount of earth on poor than on rich land in  order to obtain sufficient nutriment  with respect to the towerlike castings near nice nos 5 and 6 in  the above table dr king often found five or six of them on a  square foot of surface and these judging from their average  weight would have weighed together 75 ounces so that the weight  of those on a square yard would have been 4 lb 35 oz  dr king  collected near the close of the year 1872 all the castings which  still retained their vermiform shape whether broken down or not  from a square foot in a place abounding with worms on the summit  of a bank where no castings could have rolled down from above   these castings must have been ejected as he judged from their  appearance in reference to the rainy and dry periods near nice  within the previous five or six months they weighed 95 oz or 5  lb 55 oz per square yard  after an interval of four months dr  king collected all the castings subsequently ejected on the same  square foot of surface and they weighed 25 oz or 1 lb 65 oz  per square yard  therefore within about ten months or we will say  for safetys sake within a year 12 oz of castings were thrown up  on this one square foot or 675 pounds on the square yard and  this would give 1458 tons per acre  in a field at the bottom of a valley in the chalk see no 2 in the  foregoing table a square yard was measured at a spot where very  large castings abounded they appeared however almost equally  numerous in a few other places  these castings which retained  perfectly their vermiform shape were collected and they weighed  when partially dried 1 lb 135 oz  this field had been rolled  with a heavy agricultural roller fiftytwo days before and this  would certainly have flattened every single casting on the land   the weather had been very dry for two or three weeks before the day  of collection so that not one casting appeared fresh or had been  recently ejected  we may therefore assume that those which were  weighed had been ejected within we will say forty days from the  time when the field was rolledthat is twelve days short of the  whole intervening period  i had examined the same part of the  field shortly before it was rolled and it then abounded with fresh  castings  worms do not work in dry weather during the summer or  in winter during severe frosts  if we assume that they work for  only half the yearthough this is too low an estimatethen the  worms in this field would eject during the year 8387 pounds per  square yard or 1812 tons per acre assuming the whole surface to  be equally productive in castings  in the foregoing cases some of the necessary data had to be  estimated but in the two following cases the results are much more  trustworthy  a lady on whose accuracy i can implicitly rely  offered to collect during a year all the castings thrown up on two  separate square yards near leith hill place in surrey  the  amount collected was however somewhat less than that originally  ejected by the worms for as i have repeatedly observed a good  deal of the finest earth is washed away whenever castings are  thrown up during or shortly before heavy rain  small portions also  adhered to the surrounding blades of grass and it required too  much time to detach every one of them  on sandy soil as in the present instance castings are liable to  crumble after dry weather and particles were thus often lost  the  lady also occasionally left home for a week or two and at such  times the castings must have suffered still greater loss from  exposure to the weather  these losses were however compensated  to some extent by the collections having been made on one of the  squares for four days and on the other square for two days more  than the year  a space was selected october 9th 1870 for one of the squares on  a broad grasscovered terrace which had been mowed and swept  during many years  it faced the south but was shaded during part  of the day by trees  it had been formed at least a century ago by  a great accumulation of small and large fragments of sandstone  together with some sandy earth rammed down level  it is probable  that it was at first protected by being covered with turf  this  terrace judging from the number of castings on it was rather  unfavourable for the existence of worms in comparison with the  neighbouring fields and an upper terrace  it was indeed surprising  that as many worms could live here as were seen for on digging a  hole in this terrace the black vegetable mould together with the  turf was only four inches in thickness beneath which lay the level  surface of lightcoloured sandy soil with many fragments of  sandstone  before any castings were collected all the previously  existing ones were carefully removed  the last days collection  was on october 14th 1871  the castings were then well dried  before a fire and they weighed exactly 35 lbs  this would give  for an acre of similar land 756 tons of dry earth annually ejected  by worms  the second square was marked on unenclosed common land at a height  of about 700 ft above the sea at some little distance from leith  hill tower  the surface was clothed with short fine turf and had  never been disturbed by the hand of man  the spot selected  appeared neither particularly favourable nor the reverse for worms  but i have often noticed that castings are especially abundant on  common land and this may perhaps be attributed to the poorness  of the soil  the vegetable mould was here between three and four  inches in thickness  as this spot was at some distance from the  house where the lady lived the castings were not collected at such  short intervals of time as those on the terrace consequently the  loss of fine earth during rainy weather must have been greater in  this than in the last case  the castings moreover were more sandy  and in collecting them during dry weather they sometimes crumbled  into dust and much was thus lost  therefore it is certain that  the worms brought up to the surface considerably more earth than  that which was collected  the last collection was made on october  27th 1871 ie 367 days after the square had been marked out and  the surface cleared of all preexisting castings  the collected  castings after being well dried weighed 7453 pounds and this  would give for an acre of the same kind of land 161 tons of  annually ejected dry earth   summary of the four foregoing cases   1  castings ejected near nice within about a year collected by  dr king on a square foot of surface calculated to yield per acre  1458 tons  2  castings ejected during about 40 days on a square yard in a  field of poor pasture at the bottom of a large valley in the chalk  calculated to yield annually per acre 1812 tons  3  castings collected from a square yard on an old terrace at  leith hill place during 369 days calculated to yield annually per  acre 756 tons  4  castings collected from a square yard on leith hill common  during 367 days calculated to yield annually per acre 161 tons   the thickness of the layer of mould which castings ejected during  a year would form if uniformly spread outas we know from the  two last cases in the above summary the weight of the dried  castings ejected by worms during a year on a square yard of  surface i wished to learn how thick a layer of ordinary mould this  amount would form if spread uniformly over a square yard  the dry  castings were therefore broken into small particles and whilst  being placed in a measure were well shaken and pressed down  those  collected on the terrace amounted to 12477 cubic inches and this  amount if spread out over a square yard would make a layer 09627  inch in thickness  those collected on the common amounted to  19756 cubic inches and would make a similar layer 01524 inch in  thickness  these thicknesses must however be corrected for the triturated  castings after being well shaken down and pressed did not make  nearly so compact a mass as vegetable mould though each separate  particle was very compact  yet mould is far from being compact as  is shown by the number of airbubbles which rise up when the  surface is flooded with water  it is moreover penetrated by many  fine roots  to ascertain approximately by how much ordinary  vegetable mould would be increased in bulk by being broken up into  small particles and then dried a thin oblong block of somewhat  argillaceous mould with the turf pared off was measured before  being broken up was well dried and again measured  the drying  caused it to shrink by 17 of its original bulk judging from  exterior measurements alone  it was then triturated and partly  reduced to powder in the same manner as the castings had been  treated and its bulk now exceeded notwithstanding shrinkage from  drying by 116 that of the original block of damp mould   therefore the above calculated thickness of the layer formed by  the castings from the terrace after being damped and spread over a  square yard would have to be reduced by 116 and this will reduce  the layer to 009 of an inch so that a layer 09 inch in thickness  would be formed in the course of ten years  on the same principle  the castings from the common would make in the course of a single  year a layer 01429 inch or in the course of 10 years 1429 inch  in thickness  we may say in round numbers that the thickness in  the former case would amount to nearly 1 inch and in the second  case to nearly 15 inch in 10 years  in order to compare these results with those deduced from the rates  at which small objects left on the surfaces of grassfields become  buried as described in the early part of this chapter we will  give the following summary   summary of the thickness of the mould accumulated over objects left  strewed on the surface in the course of ten years   the accumulation of mould during 1475 years on the surface of a  dry sandy grassfield near maer hall amounted to 22 inches in  10 years  the accumulation during 215 years on a swampy field near maer  hall amounted to nearly 19 inch in 10 years  the accumulation during 7 years on a very swampy field near maer  hall amounted to 21 inches in 10 years  the accumulation during 29 years on good argillaceous pasture land over the chalk at down amounted to 22 inches in 10 years  the accumulation during 30 years on the side of a valley over the  chalk at down the soil being argillaceous very poor and only  just converted into pasture so that it was for some years  unfavourable for worms amounted to 083 inch in 10 years   in these cases excepting the last it may be seen that the amount  of earth brought to the surface during 10 years is somewhat greater  than that calculated from the castings which were actually weighed   this excess may be partly accounted for by the loss which the  weighed castings had previously undergone through being washed by  rain by the adhesion of particles to the blades of the surrounding  grass and by their crumbling when dry  nor must we overlook other  agencies which in all ordinary cases add to the amount of mould  and which would not be included in the castings that were  collected namely the fine earth brought up to the surface by  burrowing larvae and insects especially by ants  the earth  brought up by moles generally has a somewhat different appearance  from vegetable mould but after a time would not be distinguishable  from it  in dry countries moreover the wind plays an important  part in carrying dust from one place to another and even in  england it must add to the mould on fields near great roads  but  in our country these latter several agencies appear to be of quite  subordinate importance in comparison with the action of worms  we have no means of judging how great a weight of earth a single  fullsized worm ejects during a year  hensen estimates that 53767  worms exist in an acre of land but this is founded on the number  found in gardens and he believes that only about half as many live  in cornfields  how many live in old pasture land is unknown but  if we assume that half the above number or 26886 worms live on  such land then taking from the previous summary 15 tons as the  weight of the castings annually thrown up on an acre of land each  worm must annually eject 20 ounces  a fullsized casting at the  mouth of a single burrow often exceeds as we have seen an ounce  in weight and it is probable that worms eject more than 20 full sized castings during a year  if they eject annually more than 20  ounces we may infer that the worms which live in an acre of  pasture land must be less than 26886 in number  worms live chiefly in the superficial mould which is usually from  4 or 5 to 10 and even 12 inches in thickness and it is this mould  which passes over and over again through their bodies and is  brought to the surface  but worms occasionally burrow into the  subsoil to a much greater depth and on such occasions they bring  up earth from this greater depth and this process has gone on for  countless ages  therefore the superficial layer of mould would  ultimately attain though at a slower and slower rate a thickness  equal to the depth to which worms ever burrow were there not other  opposing agencies at work which carry away to a lower level some of  the finest earth which is continually being brought to the surface  by worms  how great a thickness vegetable mould ever attains i  have not had good opportunities for observing but in the next  chapter when we consider the burial of ancient buildings some  facts will be given on this head  in the two last chapters we  shall see that the soil is actually increased though only to a  small degree through the agency of worms but their chief work is  to sift the finer from the coarser particles to mingle the whole  with vegetable debris and to saturate it with their intestinal  secretions  finally no one who considers the facts given in this chapteron  the burying of small objects and on the sinking of great stones  left on the surfaceon the vast number of worms which live

aware how much they owe to worms  for the preservation of many ancient objects  coins gold  ornaments stone implements c if dropped on the surface of the  ground will infallibly be buried by the castings of worms in a few  years and will thus be safely preserved until the land at some  future time is turned up  for instance many years ago a grass field was ploughed on the northern side of the severn not far from  shrewsbury and a surprising number of iron arrowheads were found  at the bottom of the furrows which as mr blakeway a local  antiquary believed were relics of the battle of shrewsbury in the  year 1403 and no doubt had been originally left strewed on the  battlefield  in the present chapter i shall show that not only  implements c are thus preserved but that the floors and the  remains of many ancient buildings in england have been buried so  effectually in large part through the action of worms that they  have been discovered in recent times solely through various  accidents  the enormous beds of rubbish several yards in  thickness which underlie many cities such as rome paris and  london the lower ones being of great antiquity are not here  referred to as they have not been in any way acted on by worms   when we consider how much matter is daily brought into a great city  for building fuel clothing and food and that in old times when  the roads were bad and the work of the scavenger was neglected a  comparatively small amount was carried away we may agree with elie  de beaumont who in discussing this subject says pour une  voiture de materiaux qui en sort on y en fait entrer cent 53   nor should we overlook the effects of fires the demolition of old  buildings and the removal of rubbish to the nearest vacant space  abinger surreylate in the autumn of 1876 the ground in an old  farmyard at this place was dug to a depth of 2 to 25 feet and  the workmen found various ancient remains  this led mr t h  farrer of abinger hall to have an adjoining ploughed field  searched  on a trench being dug a layer of concrete still partly  covered with tesserae small red tiles and surrounded on two  sides by brokendown walls was soon discovered  it is believed  54 that this room formed part of the atrium or receptionroom of  a roman villa  the walls of two or three other small rooms were  afterwards discovered  many fragments of pottery other objects  and coins of several roman emperors dating from 133 to 361 and  perhaps to 375 ad were likewise found  also a halfpenny of  george i 1715  the presence of this latter coin seems an  anomaly but no doubt it was dropped on the ground during the last  century and since then there has been ample time for its burial  under a considerable depth of the castings of worms  from the  different dates of the roman coins we may infer that the building  was long inhabited  it was probably ruined and deserted 1400 or  1500 years ago  i was present during the commencement of the excavations august  20 1877 and mr farrer had two deep trenches dug at opposite ends  of the atrium so that i might examine the nature of the soil near  the remains  the field sloped from east to west at an angle of  about 7 degrees and one of the two trenches shown in the  accompanying section fig 8 was at the upper or eastern end  the  diagram is on a scale of 120 of an inch to an inch but the  trench which was between 4 and 5 feet broad and in parts above 5  feet deep has necessarily been reduced out of all proportion  the  fine mould over the floor of the atrium varied in thickness from 11  to 16 inches and on the side of the trench in the section was a  little over 13 inches  after the mould had been removed the floor  appeared as a whole moderately level but it sloped in parts at an  angle of 1 degree and in one place near the outside at as much as  8 degrees 30 minutes  the wall surrounding the pavement was built  of rough stones and was 23 inches in thickness where the trench  was dug  its broken summit was here 13 inches but in another part  15 inches beneath the surface of the field being covered by this  thickness of mould  in one spot however it rose to within 6  inches of the surface  on two sides of the room where the  junction of the concrete floor with the bounding walls could be  carefully examined there was no crack or separation  this trench  afterwards proved to have been dug within an adjoining room 11 ft  by 11 ft 6 in in size the existence of which was not even  suspected whilst i was present  on the side of the trench farthest from the buried wall w the  mould varied from 9 to 14 inches in thickness it rested on a mass  b 23 inches thick of blackish earth including many large stones   beneath this was a thin bed of very black mould c then a layer  of earth full of fragments of mortar d and then another thin bed  about 3 inches thick e of very black mould which rested on the  undisturbed subsoil f of firm yellowish argillaceous sand  the  23inch bed b was probably made ground as this would have  brought up the floor of the room to a level with that of the  atrium  the two thin beds of black mould at the bottom of the  trench evidently marked two former landsurfaces  outside the  walls of the northern room many bones ashes oystershells  broken pottery and an entire pot were subsequently found at a depth  of 16 inches beneath the surface  the second trench was dug on the western or lower side of the  villa  the mould was here only 65 inches in thickness and it  rested on a mass of fine earth full of stones broken tiles and  fragments of mortar 34 inches in thickness beneath which was the  undisturbed sand  most of this earth had probably been washed down  from the upper part of the field and the fragments of stones  tiles c must have come from the immediately adjoining ruins  it appears at first sight a surprising fact that this field of  light sandy soil should have been cultivated and ploughed during  many years and that not a vestige of these buildings should have  been discovered  no one even suspected that the remains of a roman  villa lay hidden close beneath the surface  but the fact is less  surprising when it is known that the field as the bailiff  believed had never been ploughed to a greater depth than 4 inches   it is certain that when the land was first ploughed the pavement  and the surrounding broken walls must have been covered by at least  4 inches of soil for otherwise the rotten concrete floor would  have been scored by the ploughshare the tesserae torn up and the  tops of the old walls knocked down  when the concrete and tesserae were first cleared over a space of  14 by 9 ft the floor which was coated with troddendown earth  exhibited no signs of having been penetrated by worms and although  the overlying fine mould closely resembled that which in many  places has certainly been accumulated by worms yet it seemed  hardly possible that this mould could have been brought up by worms  from beneath the apparently sound floor  it seemed also extremely  improbable that the thick walls surrounding the room and still  united to the concrete had been undermined by worms and had thus  been caused to sink being afterwards covered up by their castings   i therefore at first concluded that all the fine mould above the  ruins had been washed down from the upper parts of the field but  we shall soon see that this conclusion was certainly erroneous  though much fine earth is known to be washed down from the upper  part of the field in its present ploughed state during heavy rains  although the concrete floor did not at first appear to have been  anywhere penetrated by worms yet by the next morning little cakes  of the troddendown earth had been lifted up by worms over the  mouths of seven burrows which passed through the softer parts of  the naked concrete or between the interstices of the tesserae  on  the third morning twentyfive burrows were counted and by suddenly  lifting up the little cakes of earth four worms were seen in the  act of quickly retreating  two castings were thrown up during the  third night on the floor and these were of large size  the season  was not favourable for the full activity of worms and the weather  had lately been hot and dry so that most of the worms now lived at  a considerable depth  in digging the two trenches many open  burrows and some worms were encountered at between 30 and 40 inches  beneath the surface but at a greater depth they became rare  one  worm however was cut through at 485 and another at 515 inches  beneath the surface  a fresh humuslined burrow was also met with  at a depth of 57 and another at 655 inches  at greater depths  than this neither burrows nor worms were seen  as i wished to learn how many worms lived beneath the floor of the  atriuma space of about 14 by 9 feetmr farrer was so kind as to  make observations for me during the next seven weeks by which  time the worms in the surrounding country were in full activity  and were working near the surface  it is very improbable that  worms should have migrated from the adjoining field into the small  space of the atrium after the superficial mould in which they  prefer to live had been removed  we may therefore conclude that  the burrows and the castings which were seen here during the  ensuing seven weeks were the work of the former inhabitants of the  space  i will now give a few extracts from mr farrers notes  aug 26th 1877 that is five days after the floor had been  cleared  on the previous night there had been some heavy rain  which washed the surface clean and now the mouths of forty burrows  were counted  parts of the concrete were seen to be solid and had  never been penetrated by worms and here the rainwater lodged  sept 5thtracks of worms made during the previous night could  be seen on the surface of the floor and five or six vermiform  castings had been thrown up  these were defaced  sept 12thduring the last six days the worms have not been  active though many castings have been ejected in the neighbouring  fields but on this day the earth was a little raised over the  mouths of the burrows or castings were ejected at ten fresh  points  these were defaced  it should be understood that when a  fresh burrow is spoken of this generally means only that an old  burrow has been reopened  mr farrer was repeatedly struck with  the pertinacity with which the worms reopened their old burrows  even when no earth was ejected from them  i have often observed  the same fact and generally the mouths of the burrows are  protected by an accumulation of pebbles sticks or leaves  mr  farrer likewise observed that the worms living beneath the floor of  the atrium often collected coarse grains of sand and such little  stones as they could find round the mouths of their burrows  sept 13th soft wet weather  the mouths of the burrows were re opened or castings were ejected at 31 points these were all  defaced  sept 14th 34 fresh holes or castings all defaced  sept 15th 44 fresh holes only 5 castings all defaced  sept 18th 43 fresh holes 8 castings all defaced  the number of castings on the surrounding fields was now very  large  sept 19th 40 holes 8 castings all defaced  sept 22nd 43 holes only a few fresh castings all defaced  sept 23rd 44 holes 8 castings  sept 25th 50 holes no record of the number of castings  oct 13th  61 holes no record of the number of castings  after an interval of three years mr farrer at my request again  looked at the concrete floor and found the worms still at work  knowing what great muscular power worms possess and seeing how  soft the concrete was in many parts i was not surprised at its  having been penetrated by their burrows but it is a more  surprising fact that the mortar between the rough stones of the  thick walls surrounding the rooms was found by mr farrer to have  been penetrated by worms  on august 26th that is five days after  the ruins had been exposed he observed four open burrows on the  broken summit of the eastern wall w in fig 8 and on september  15th other burrows similarly situated were seen  it should also  be noted that in the perpendicular side of the trench which was  much deeper than is represented in fig 8 three recent burrows  were seen which ran obliquely far down beneath the base of the old  wall  we thus see that many worms lived beneath the floor and the walls  of the atrium at the time when the excavations were made and that  they afterwards almost daily brought up earth to the surface from a  considerable depth  there is not the slightest reason to doubt  that worms have acted in this manner ever since the period when the  concrete was sufficiently decayed to allow them to penetrate it  and even before that period they would have lived beneath the  floor as soon as it became pervious to rain so that the soil  beneath was kept damp  the floor and the walls must therefore have  been continually undermined and fine earth must have been heaped  on them during many centuries perhaps for a thousand years  if  the burrows beneath the floor and walls which it is probable were  formerly as numerous as they now are had not collapsed in the  course of time in the manner formerly explained the underlying  earth would have been riddled with passages like a sponge and as  this was not the case we may feel sure that they have collapsed   the inevitable result of such collapsing during successive  centuries will have been the slow subsidence of the floor and of  the walls and their burial beneath the accumulated wormcastings   the subsidence of a floor whilst it still remains nearly  horizontal may at first appear improbable but the case presents  no more real difficulty than that of loose objects strewed on the  surface of a field which as we have seen become buried several  inches beneath the surface in the course of a few years though  still forming a horizontal layer parallel to the surface  the  burial of the paved and level path on my lawn which took place  under my own observation is an analogous case  even those parts  of the concrete floor which the worms could not penetrate would  almost certainly have been undermined and would have sunk like  the great stones at leith hill place and stonehenge for the soil  would have been damp beneath them  but the rate of sinking of the  different parts would not have been quite equal and the floor was  not quite level  the foundations of the boundary walls lie as  shown in the section at a very small depth beneath the surface  they would therefore have tended to subside at nearly the same rate  as the floor  but this would not have occurred if the foundations  had been deep as in the case of some other roman ruins presently  to be described  finally we may infer that a large part of the fine vegetable  mould which covered the floor and the brokendown walls of this  villa in some places to a thickness of 16 inches was brought up  from below by worms  from facts hereafter to be given there can be  no doubt that some of the finest earth thus brought up will have  been washed down the sloping surface of the field during every  heavy shower of rain  if this had not occurred a greater amount of  mould would have accumulated over the ruins than that now present   but beside the castings of worms and some earth brought up by  insects and some accumulation of dust much fine earth will have  been washed over the ruins from the upper parts of the field since  it has been under cultivation and from over the ruins to the lower  parts of the slope the present thickness of the mould being the  resultant of these several agencies   i may here append a modern instance of the sinking of a pavement  communicated to me in 1871 by mr ramsay director of the  geological survey of england  a passage without a roof 7 feet in  length by 3 feet 2 inches in width led from his house into the  garden and was paved with slabs of portland stone  several of  these slabs were 16 inches square others larger and some a little  smaller  this pavement had subsided about 3 inches along the  middle of the passage and two inches on each side as could be  seen by the lines of cement by which the slabs had been originally  joined to the walls  the pavement had thus become slightly concave  along the middle but there was no subsidence at the end close to  the house  mr ramsay could not account for this sinking until he  observed that castings of black mould were frequently ejected along  the lines of junction between the slabs and these castings were  regularly swept away  the several lines of junction including  those with the lateral walls were altogether 39 feet 2 inches in  length  the pavement did not present the appearance of ever having  been renewed and the house was believed to have been built about  eightyseven years ago  considering all these circumstances mr  ramsay does not doubt that the earth brought up by the worms since  the pavement was first laid down or rather since the decay of the  mortar allowed the worms to burrow through it and therefore within  a much shorter time than the eightyseven years has sufficed to  cause the sinking of the pavement to the above amount except close  to the house where the ground beneath would have been kept nearly  dry  beaulieu abbey hampshirethis abbey was destroyed by henry  viii and there now remains only a portion of the southern aisle wall  it is believed that the king had most of the stones carried  away for building a castle and it is certain that they have been  removed  the positions of the nave and transepts were ascertained  not long ago by the foundations having been found and the place is  now marked by stones let into the ground  where the abbey formerly  stood there now extends a smooth grasscovered surface which  resembles in all respects the rest of the field  the guardian a  very old man said the surface had never been levelled in his time   in the year 1853 the duke of buccleuch had three holes dug in the  turf within a few yards of one another at the western end of the  nave and the old tesselated pavement of the abbey was thus  discovered  these holes were afterwards surrounded by brickwork  and protected by trapdoors so that the pavement might be readily  inspected and preserved  when my son william examined the place on  january 5 1872 he found that the pavement in the three holes lay  at depths of 675 10 and 115 inches beneath the surrounding turf covered surface  the old guardian asserted that he was often  forced to remove wormcastings from the pavement and that he had  done so about six months before  my son collected all from one of  the holes the area of which was 532 square feet and they weighed  797 ounces  assuming that this amount had accumulated in six  months the accumulation during a year on a square yard would be  168 pounds which though a large amount is very small compared  with what as we have seen is often ejected on fields and commons   when i visited the abbey on june 22 1877 the old man said that he  had cleared out the holes about a month before but a good many  castings had since been ejected  i suspect that he imagined that  he swept the pavements oftener than he really did for the  conditions were in several respects very unfavourable for the  accumulation of even a moderate amount of castings  the tiles are  rather large viz about 55 inches square and the mortar between  them was in most places sound so that the worms were able to bring  up earth from below only at certain points  the tiles rested on a  bed of concrete and the castings in consequence consisted in large  part viz in the proportion of 19 to 33 of particles of mortar  grains of sand little fragments of rock bricks or tile and such  substances could hardly be agreeable and certainly not nutritious  to worms  my son dug holes in several places within the former walls of the  abbey at a distance of several yards from the above described  bricked squares  he did not find any tiles though these are known  to occur in some other parts but he came in one spot to concrete  on which tiles had once rested  the fine mould beneath the turf on  the sides of the several holes varied in thickness from only 2 to  275 inches and this rested on a layer from 875 to above 11  inches in thickness consisting of fragments of mortar and stone rubbish with the interstices compactly filled up with black mould   in the surrounding field at a distance of 20 yards from the abbey  the fine vegetable mould was 11 inches thick  we may conclude from these facts that when the abbey was destroyed  and the stones removed a layer of rubbish was left over the whole  surface and that as soon as the worms were able to penetrate the  decayed concrete and the joints between the tiles they slowly  filled up the interstices in the overlying rubbish with their  castings which were afterwards accumulated to a thickness of  nearly three inches over the whole surface  if we add to this  latter amount the mould between the fragments of stones some five  or six inches of mould must have been brought up from beneath the  concrete or tiles  the concrete or tiles will consequently have  subsided to nearly this amount  the bases of the columns of the  aisles are now buried beneath mould and turf  it is not probable  that they can have been undermined by worms for their foundations  would no doubt have been laid at a considerable depth  if they  have not subsided the stones of which the columns were constructed  must have been removed from beneath the former level of the floor  chedworth gloucestershirethe remains of a large roman villa  were discovered here in 1866 on ground which had been covered with  wood from time immemorial  no suspicion seems ever to have been  entertained that ancient buildings lay buried here until a  gamekeeper in digging for rabbits encountered some remains 55   but subsequently the tops of some stone walls were detected in  parts of the wood projecting a little above the surface of the  ground  most of the coins found here belonged to constans who  died 350 ad and the constantine family  my sons francis and  horace visited the place in november 1877 for the sake of  ascertaining what part worms may have played in the burial of these  extensive remains  but the circumstances were not favourable for  this object as the ruins are surrounded on three sides by rather  steep banks down which earth is washed during rainy weather   moreover most of the old rooms have been covered with roofs for  the protection of the elegant tesselated pavements  a few facts may however be given on the thickness of the soil  over these ruins  close outside the northern rooms there is a  broken wall the summit of which was covered by 5 inches of black  mould and in a hole dug on the outer side of this wall where the  ground had never before been disturbed black mould full of  stones 26 inches in thickness was found resting on the  undisturbed subsoil of yellow clay  at a depth of 22 inches from  the surface a pigs jaw and a fragment of a tile were found  when  the excavations were first made some large trees grew over the  ruins and the stump of one has been left directly over a party wall near the bathroom for the sake of showing the thickness of  the superincumbent soil which was here 38 inches  in one small  room which after being cleared out had not been roofed over my  sons observed the hole of a worm passing through the rotten  concrete and a living worm was found within the concrete  in  another open room wormcastings were seen on the floor over which  some earth had by this means been deposited and here grass now  grew  brading isle of wighta fine roman villa was discovered here in  1880 and by the end of october no less than 18 chambers had been  more or less cleared  a coin dated 337 ad  was found  my son  william visited the place before the excavations were completed  and he informs me that most of the floors were at first covered  with much rubbish and fallen stones having their interstices  completely filled up with mould abounding as the workmen said  with worms above which there was mould without any stones  the  whole mass was in most places from 3 to above 4 ft in thickness   in one very large room the overlying earth was only 2 ft 6 in  thick and after this had been removed so many castings were  thrown up between the tiles that the surface had to be almost daily  swept  most of the floors were fairly level  the tops of the  brokendown walls were covered in some places by only 4 or 5 inches  of soil so that they were occasionally struck by the plough but  in other places they were covered by from 13 to 18 inches of soil   it is not probable that these walls could have been undermined by  worms and subsided as they rested on a foundation of very hard red  sand into which worms could hardly burrow  the mortar however  between the stones of the walls of a hypocaust was found by my son  to have been penetrated by many wormburrows  the remains of this  villa stand on land which slopes at an angle of about 3 degrees  and the land appears to have been long cultivated  therefore no  doubt a considerable quantity of fine earth has been washed down  from the upper parts of the field and has largely aided in the  burial of these remains  silchester hampshirethe ruins of this small roman town have  been better preserved than any other remains of the kind in  england  a broken wall in most parts from 15 to 18 feet in height  and about 15 mile in compass now surrounds a space of about 100  acres of cultivated land on which a farmhouse and a church stand  56  formerly when the weather was dry the lines of the buried  walls could be traced by the appearance of the crops and recently  very extensive excavations have been undertaken by the duke of  wellington under the superintendence of the late rev j g joyce  by which means many large buildings have been discovered  mr  joyce made careful coloured sections and measured the thickness of  each bed of rubbish whilst the excavations were in progress and  he has had the kindness to send me copies of several of them  when  my sons francis and horace visited these ruins he accompanied  them and added his notes to theirs  mr joyce estimates that the town was inhabited by the romans for  about three centuries and no doubt much matter must have  accumulated within the walls during this long period  it appears  to have been destroyed by fire and most of the stones used in the  buildings have since been carried away  these circumstances are  unfavourable for ascertaining the part which worms have played in  the burial of the ruins but as careful sections of the rubbish  overlying an ancient town have seldom or never before been made in  england i will give copies of the most characteristic portions of  some of those made by mr joyce  they are of too great length to  be here introduced entire  an east and west section 30 ft in length was made across a room  in the basilica now called the hall of the merchants fig 9   the hard concrete floor still covered here and there with  tesserae was found at 3 ft beneath the surface of the field  which was here level  on the floor there were two large piles of  charred wood one alone of which is shown in the part of the  section here given  this pile was covered by a thin white layer of  decayed stucco or plaster above which was a mass presenting a  singularly disturbed appearance of broken tiles mortar rubbish  and fine gravel together 27 inches in thickness  mr joyce  believes that the gravel was used in making the mortar or concrete  which has since decayed some of the lime probably having been  dissolved  the disturbed state of the rubbish may have been due to  its having been searched for building stones  this bed was capped  by fine vegetable mould 9 inches in thickness  from these facts  we may conclude that the hall was burnt down and that much rubbish  fell on the floor through and from which the worms slowly brought  up the mould now forming the surface of the level field  a section across the middle of another hall in the basilica 32  feet 6 inches in length called the aerarium is shown in fig 10   it appears that we have here evidence of two fires separated by an  interval of time during which the 6 inches of mortar and concrete  with broken tiles was accumulated  beneath one of the layers of  charred wood a valuable relic a bronze eagle was found and this  shows that the soldiers must have deserted the place in a panic   owing to the death of mr joyce i have not been able to ascertain  beneath which of the two layers the eagle was found  the bed of  rubble overlying the undisturbed gravel originally formed as i  suppose the floor for it stands on a level with that of a  corridor outside the walls of the hall but the corridor is not  shown in the section as here given  the vegetable mould was 16  inches thick in the thickest part and the depth from the surface  of the field clothed with herbage to the undisturbed gravel was  40 inches  the section shown in fig 11 represents an excavation made in the  middle of the town and is here introduced because the bed of rich  mould attained according to mr joyce the unusual thickness of  20 inches  gravel lay at the depth of 48 inches from the surface  but it was not ascertained whether this was in its natural state  or had been brought here and had been rammed down as occurs in  some other places  the section shown in fig 12 was taken in the centre of the  basilica and though it was 5 feet in depth the natural subsoil  was not reached  the bed marked concrete was probably at one  time a floor and the beds beneath seem to be the remnants of more  ancient buildings  the vegetable mould was here only 9 inches  thick  in some other sections not copied we likewise have  evidence of buildings having been erected over the ruins of older  ones  in one case there was a layer of yellow clay of very unequal  thickness between two beds of debris the lower one of which rested  on a floor with tesserae  the ancient broken walls appear to have  been sometimes roughly cut down to a uniform level so as to serve  as the foundations for a temporary building and mr joyce suspects  that some of these buildings were wattled sheds plastered with  clay which would account for the abovementioned layer of clay  turning now to the points which more immediately concern us  worm castings were observed on the floors of several of the rooms in  one of which the tesselation was unusually perfect  the tesserae  here consisted of little cubes of hard sandstone of about 1 inch  several of which were loose or projected slightly above the general  level  one or occasionally two open wormburrows were found  beneath all the loose tesserae  worms have also penetrated the old  walls of these ruins  a wall which had just been exposed to view  during the excavations then in progress was examined it was built  of large flints and was 18 inches in thickness  it appeared  sound but when the soil was removed from beneath the mortar in  the lower part was found to be so much decayed that the flints fell  apart from their own weight  here in the middle of the wall at a  depth of 29 inches beneath the old floor and of 495 inches beneath  the surface of the field a living worm was found and the mortar  was penetrated by several burrows  a second wall was exposed to view for the first time and an open  burrow was seen on its broken summit  by separating the flints  this burrow was traced far down in the interior of the wall but as  some of the flints cohered firmly the whole mass was disturbed in  pulling down the wall and the burrow could not be traced to the  bottom  the foundations of a third wall which appeared quite  sound lay at a depth of 4 feet beneath one of the floors and of  course at a considerably greater depth beneath the level of the  ground  a large flint was wrenched out of the wall at about a foot  from the base and this required much force as the mortar was  sound but behind the flint in the middle of the wall the mortar  was friable and here there were wormburrows  mr joyce and my  sons were surprised at the blackness of the mortar in this and in  several other cases and at the presence of mould in the interior  of the walls  some may have been placed there by the old builders  instead of mortar but we should remember that worms line their  burrows with black humus  moreover open spaces would almost  certainly have been occasionally left between the large irregular  flints and these spaces we may feel sure would be filled up by  the worms with their castings as soon as they were able to  penetrate the wall  rainwater oozing down the burrows would also  carry fine darkcoloured particles into every crevice  mr joyce  was at first very sceptical about the amount of work which i  attributed to worms but he ends his notes with reference to the  lastmentioned wall by saying this case caused me more surprise  and brought more conviction to me than any other  i should have  said and did say that it was quite impossible such a wall could  have been penetrated by earthworms  in almost all the rooms the pavement has sunk considerably  especially towards the middle and this is shown in the three  following sections  the measurements were made by stretching a  string tightly and horizontally over the floor  the section fig  13 was taken from north to south across a room 18 feet 4 inches  in length with a nearly perfect pavement next to the red wooden  hut  in the northern half the subsidence amounted to 575 inches  beneath the level of the floor as it now stands close to the walls  and it was greater in the northern than in the southern half but  according to mr joyce the entire pavement has obviously subsided   in several places the tesserae appeared as if drawn a little away  from the walls whilst in other places they were still in close  contact with them  in fig 14 we see a section across the paved floor of the southern  corridor or ambulatory of a quadrangle in an excavation made near  the spring  the floor is 7 feet 9 inches wide and the broken down walls now project only 075 of an inch above its level  the  field which was in pasture here sloped from north to south at an  angle of 30 degrees 40 seconds  the nature of the ground at some  little distance on each side of the corridor is shown in the  section  it consisted of earth full of stones and other debris  capped with dark vegetable mould which was thicker on the lower or  southern than on the northern side  the pavement was nearly level  along lines parallel to the sidewalls but had sunk in the middle  as much as 775 inches  a small room at no great distance from that represented in fig 13  had been enlarged by the roman occupier on the southern side by an  addition of 5 feet 4 inches in breadth  for this purpose the  southern wall of the house had been pulled down but the  foundations of the old wall had been left buried at a little depth  beneath the pavement of the enlarged room  mr joyce believes that  this buried wall must have been built before the reign of claudius  ii who died 270 ad  we see in the accompanying section fig  15 that the tesselated pavement has subsided to a less degree over  the buried wall than elsewhere so that a slight convexity or  protuberance here stretched in a straight line across the room   this led to a hole being dug and the buried wall was thus  discovered  we see in these three sections and in several others not given  that the old pavements have sunk or sagged considerably  mr joyce  formerly attributed this sinking solely to the slow settling of the  ground  that there has been some settling is highly probable and  it may be seen in fig 15 that the pavement for a width of 5 feet  over the southern enlargement of the room which must have been  built on fresh ground has sunk a little more than on the old  northern side  but this sinking may possibly have had no  connection with the enlargement of the room for in fig 13 one  half of the pavement has subsided more than the other half without  any assignable cause  in a bricked passage to mr joyces own  house laid down only about six years ago the same kind of sinking  has occurred as in the ancient buildings  nevertheless it does not  appear probable that the whole amount of sinking can be thus  accounted for  the roman builders excavated the ground to an  unusual depth for the foundations of their walls which were thick  and solid it is therefore hardly credible that they should have  been careless about the solidity of the bed on which their  tesselated and often ornamented pavements were laid  the sinking  must as it appears to me be attributed in chief part to the  pavement having been undermined by worms which we know are still  at work  even mr joyce at last admitted that this could not have  failed to have produced a considerable effect  thus also the large  quantity of fine mould overlying the pavements can be accounted  for the presence of which would otherwise be inexplicable  my  sons noticed that in one room in which the pavement had sagged very  little there was an unusually small amount of overlying mould  as the foundations of the walls generally lie at a considerable  depth they will either have not subsided at all through the  undermining action of worms or they will have subsided much less  than the floor  this latter result would follow from worms not  often working deep down beneath the foundations but more  especially from the walls not yielding when penetrated by worms  whereas the successively formed burrows in a mass of earth equal  to one of the walls in depth and thickness would have collapsed  many times since the desertion of the ruins and would consequently  have shrunk or subsided  as the walls cannot have sunk much or at  all the immediately adjoining pavement from adhering to them will  have been prevented from subsiding and thus the present curvature  of the pavement is intelligible  the circumstance which has surprised me most with respect to  silchester is that during the many centuries which have elapsed  since the old buildings were deserted the vegetable mould has not  accumulated over them to a greater thickness than that here  observed  in most places it is only about 9 inches in thickness  but in some places 12 or even more inches  in fig 11 it is given  as 20 inches but this section was drawn by mr joyce before his  attention was particularly called to this subject  the land  enclosed within the old walls is described as sloping slightly to  the south but there are parts which according to mr joyce are  nearly level and it appears that the mould is here generally  thicker than elsewhere  the surface slopes in other parts from  west to east and mr joyce describes one floor as covered at the  western end by rubbish and mould to a thickness of 285 inches and  at the eastern end by a thickness of only 115 inches  a very  slight slope suffices to cause recent castings to flow downwards  during heavy rain and thus much earth will ultimately reach the  neighbouring rills and streams and be carried away  by this means  the absence of very thick beds of mould over these ancient ruins  may as i believe be explained  moreover most of the land here  has long been ploughed and this would greatly aid the washing away  of the finer earth during rainy weather  the nature of the beds immediately beneath the vegetable mould in  some of the sections is rather perplexing  we see for instance  in the section of an excavation in a grass meadow fig 14 which  sloped from north to south at an angle of 30 degrees 40 seconds  that the mould on the upper side is only six inches and on the  lower side nine inches in thickness  but this mould lies on a mass  255 inches in thickness on the upper side of dark brown mould  as described by mr joyce thickly interspersed with small pebbles  and bits of tiles which present a corroded or worn appearance   the state of this darkcoloured earth is like that of a field which  has long been ploughed for the earth thus becomes intermingled  with stones and fragments of all kinds which have been much exposed  to the weather  if during the course of many centuries this grass  meadow and the other now cultivated fields have been at times  ploughed and at other times left as pasture the nature of the  ground in the above section is rendered intelligible  for worms  will continually have brought up fine earth from below which will  have been stirred up by the plough whenever the land was  cultivated  but after a time a greater thickness of fine earth  will thus have been accumulated than could be reached by the  plough and a bed like the 255inch mass in fig 14 will have  been formed beneath the superficial mould which latter will have  been brought to the surface within more recent times and have been  well sifted by the worms  wroxeter shropshire the old roman city of uriconium was founded  in the early part of the second century if not before this date  and it was destroyed according to mr wright probably between the  middle of the fourth and fifth century  the inhabitants were  massacred and skeletons of women were found in the hypocausts   before the year 1859 the sole remnant of the city above ground  was a portion of a massive wall about 20 ft in height  the  surrounding land undulates slightly and has long been under  cultivation  it had been noticed that the corncrops ripened  prematurely in certain narrow lines and that the snow remained  unmelted in certain places longer than in others  these  appearances led as i was informed to extensive excavations being  undertaken  the foundations of many large buildings and several  streets have thus been exposed to view  the space enclosed within  the old walls is an irregular oval about 1 mile in length  many  of the stones or bricks used in the buildings must have been  carried away but the hypocausts baths and other underground  buildings were found tolerably perfect being filled with stones  broken tiles rubbish and soil  the old floors of various rooms  were covered with rubble  as i was anxious to know how thick the  mantle of mould and rubbish was which had so long concealed these  ruins i applied to dr h johnson who had superintended the  excavations and he with the greatest kindness twice visited the  place to examine it in reference to my questions and had many  trenches dug in four fields which had hitherto been undisturbed   the results of his observations are given in the following table   he also sent me specimens of the mould and answered as far as he  could all my questions   measurements by dr h johnson of the thickness of the vegetable  mould over the roman

mould the earth which differed more  or less abruptly in its dark colour and in its texture from the  underlying sand or rubble  in the specimens sent to me the mould  resembled that which lies immediately beneath the turf in old  pastureland excepting that it often contained small stones too  large to have passed through the bodies of worms  but the trenches  above described were dug in fields none of which were in pasture  and all had been long cultivated  bearing in mind the remarks made  in reference to silchester on the effects of longcontinued  culture combined with the action of worms in bringing up the finer  particles to the surface the mould as so designated by dr  johnson seems fairly well to deserve its name  its thickness  where there was no causeway floor or walls beneath was greater  than has been elsewhere observed namely in many places above 2  ft and in one spot above 3 ft  the mould was thickest on and  close to the nearly level summit of the field called shop  leasows and in a small adjoining field which as i believe is  of nearly the same height  one side of the former field slopes at  an angle of rather above 2 degrees and i should have expected that  the mould from being washed down during heavy rain would have  been thicker in the lower than in the upper part but this was not  the case in two out of the three trenches here dug  in many places where streets ran beneath the surface or where old  buildings stood the mould was only 8 inches in thickness and dr   johnson was surprised that in ploughing the land the ruins had  never been struck by the plough as far as he had heard  he thinks  that when the land was first cultivated the old walls were perhaps  intentionally pulled down and that hollow places were filled up   this may have been the case but if after the desertion of the city  the land was left for many centuries uncultivated worms would have  brought up enough fine earth to have covered the ruins completely  that is if they had subsided from having been undermined  the  foundations of some of the walls for instance those of the portion  still standing about 20 feet above the ground and those of the  marketplace lie at the extraordinary depth of 14 feet but it is  highly improbable that the foundations were generally so deep  the  mortar employed in the buildings must have been excellent for it  is still in parts extremely hard  wherever walls of any height  have been exposed to view they are as dr  johnson believes  still perpendicular  the walls with such deep foundations cannot  have been undermined by worms and therefore cannot have subsided  as appears to have occurred at abinger and silchester  hence it is  very difficult to account for their being now completely covered  with earth but how much of this covering consists of vegetable  mould and how much of rubble i do not know  the marketplace with  the foundations at a depth of 14 feet was covered up as dr   johnson believes by between 6 and 24 inches of earth  the tops of  the brokendown walls of a caldarium or bath 9 feet in depth were  likewise covered up with nearly 2 feet of earth  the summit of an  arch leading into an ashpit 7 feet in depth was covered up with  not more than 8 inches of earth  whenever a building which has not  subsided is covered with earth we must suppose either that the  upper layers of stone have been at some time carried away by man  or that earth has since been washed down during heavy rain or  blown down during storms from the adjoining land and this would  be especially apt to occur where the land has long been cultivated   in the above cases the adjoining land is somewhat higher than the  three specified sites as far as i can judge by maps and from  information given me by dr  johnson  if however a great pile of  broken stones mortar plaster timber and ashes fell over the  remains of any building their disintegration in the course of  time and the sifting action of worms would ultimately conceal the  whole beneath fine earth  conclusion the cases given in this chapter show that worms have  played a considerable part in the burial and concealment of several  roman and other old buildings in england but no doubt the washing  down of soil from the neighbouring higher lands and the deposition  of dust have together aided largely in the work of concealment   dust would be apt to accumulate wherever old brokendown walls  projected a little above the then existing surface and thus  afforded some shelter  the floors of the old rooms halls and  passages have generally sunk partly from the settling of the  ground but chiefly from having been undermined by worms and the  sinking has commonly been greater in the middle than near the  walls  the walls themselves whenever their foundations do not lie  at a great depth have been penetrated and undermined by worms and  have consequently subsided  the unequal subsidence thus caused  probably explains the great cracks which may be seen in many  ancient walls as well as their inclination from the perpendicular    chapter vthe action of worms in the denudation of the land    evidence of the amount of

brick in the  castings over ancient buildings well rounded  the triturating  power of worms not quite insignificant under a geological point of  view   no one doubts that our world at one time consisted of crystalline  rocks and that it is to their disintegration through the action of  air water changes of temperature rivers waves of the sea  earthquakes and volcanic outbursts that we owe our sedimentary  formations  these after being consolidated and sometimes  recrystallized have often been again disintegrated  denudation  means the removal of such disintegrated matter to a lower level   of the many striking results due to the modern progress of geology  there are hardly any more striking than those which relate to  denudation  it was long ago seen that there must have been an  immense amount of denudation but until the successive formations  were carefully mapped and measured no one fully realised how great  was the amount  one of the first and most remarkable memoirs ever  published on this subject was that by ramsay 57 who in 1846  showed that in wales from 9000 to 11000 feet in thickness of solid  rock had been stripped off large tracks of country  perhaps the  plainest evidence of great denudation is afforded by faults or  cracks which extend for many miles across certain districts with  the strata on one side raised even ten thousand feet above the  corresponding strata on the opposite side and yet there is not a  vestige of this gigantic displacement visible on the surface of the  land  a huge pile of rock has been planed away on one side and not  a remnant left  until the last twenty or thirty years most geologists thought that  the waves of the sea were the chief agents in the work of  denudation but we may now feel sure that air and rain aided by  streams and rivers are much more powerful agentsthat is if we  consider the whole area of the land  the long lines of escarpment  which stretch across several parts of england were formerly  considered to be undoubtedly ancient coastlines but we now know  that they stand up above the general surface merely from resisting  air rain and frost better than the adjoining formations  it has  rarely been the good fortune of a geologist to bring conviction to  the minds of his fellowworkers on a disputed point by a single  memoir but mr whitaker of the geological survey of england was  so fortunate when in 1867 he published his paper on subaerial  denudation and on cliffs and escarpments of the chalk 58   before this paper appeared mr a tylor had adduced important  evidence on subaerial denudation by showing that the amount of  matter brought down by rivers must infallibly lower the level of  their drainage basins by many feet in no immense lapse of time   this line of argument has since been followed up in the most  interesting manner by archibald geikie croll and others in a  series of valuable memoirs 59  for the sake of those who have  never attended to this subject a single instance may be here  given namely that of the mississippi which is chosen because the  amount of sediment brought down by this great river has been  investigated with especial care by order of the united states  government  the result is as mr croll shows that the mean level  of its enormous area of drainage must be lowered 14566 of a foot  annually or 1 foot in 4566 years  consequently taking the best  estimate of the mean height of the north american continent viz  748 feet and looking to the future the whole of the great  mississippi basin will be washed away and brought down to the  sealevel in less than 4500000 years if no elevation of the land  takes place  some rivers carry down much more sediment relatively  to their size and some much less than the mississippi  disintegrated matter is carried away by the wind as well as by  running water  during volcanic outbursts much rock is triturated  and is thus widely dispersed and in all arid countries the wind  plays an important part in the removal of such matter  winddriven  sand also wears down the hardest rocks  i have shown 60 that  during four months of the year a large quantity of dust is blown  from the northwestern shores of africa and falls on the atlantic  over a space of 1600 miles in latitude and for a distance of from  300 to 600 miles from the coast  but dust has been seen to fall at  a distance of 1030 miles from the shores of africa  during a stay  of three weeks at st jago in the cape verde archipelago the  atmosphere was almost always hazy and extremely fine dust coming  from africa was continually falling  in some of this dust which  fell in the open ocean at a distance of between 330 and 380 miles  from the african coast there were many particles of stone about  11000 of an inch square  nearer to the coast the water has been  seen to be so much discoloured by the falling dust that a sailing  vessel left a track behind her  in countries like the cape verde  archipelago where it seldom rains and there are no frosts the  solid rock nevertheless disintegrates and in conformity with the  views lately advanced by a distinguished belgian geologist de  koninck such disintegration may be attributed in chief part to the  action of the carbonic and nitric acids together with the nitrates  and nitrites of ammonia dissolved in the dew  in all humid even moderately humid countries worms aid in the  work of denudation in several ways  the vegetable mould which  covers as with a mantle the surface of the land has all passed  many times through their bodies  mould differs in appearance from  the subsoil only in its dark colour and in the absence of  fragments or particles of stone when such are present in the  subsoil larger than those which can pass through the alimentary  canal of a worm  this sifting of the soil is aided as has already  been remarked by burrowing animals of many kinds especially by  ants  in countries where the summer is long and dry the mould in  protected places must be largely increased by dust blown from other  and more exposed places  for instance the quantity of dust  sometimes blown over the plains of la plata where there are no  solid rocks is so great that during the gran seco 1827 to  1830 the appearance of the land which is here unenclosed was so  completely changed that the inhabitants could not recognise the  limits of their own estates and endless lawsuits arose  immense  quantities of dust are likewise blown about in egypt and in the  south of france  in china as richthofen maintains beds appearing  like fine sediment several hundred feet in thickness and extending  over an enormous area owe their origin to dust blown from the high  lands of central asia 61  in humid countries like great britain  as long as the land remains in its natural state clothed with  vegetation the mould in any one place can hardly be much increased  by dust but in its present condition the fields near high roads  where there is much traffic must receive a considerable amount of  dust and when fields are harrowed during dry and windy weather  clouds of dust may be seen to be blown away  but in all these  cases the surfacesoil is merely transported from one place to  another  the dust which falls so thickly within our houses  consists largely of organic matter and if spread over the land  would in time decay and disappear almost entirely  it appears  however from recent observations on the snowfields of the arctic  regions that some little meteoric dust of extra mundane origin is  continually falling  the dark colour of ordinary mould is obviously due to the presence  of decaying organic matter which however is present in but small  quantities  the loss of weight which mould suffers when heated to  redness seems to be in large part due to water in combination being  dispelled  in one sample of fertile mould the amount of organic  matter was ascertained to be only 176 per cent in some  artificially prepared soil it was as much as 55 per cent and in  the famous black soil of russia from 5 to even 12 per cent 62   in leafmould formed exclusively by the decay of leaves the amount  is much greater and in peat the carbon alone sometimes amounts to  64 per cent but with these latter cases we are not here  concerned  the carbon in the soil tends gradually to oxidise and  to disappear except where water accumulates and the climate is  cool 63 so that in the oldest pastureland there is no great  excess of organic matter notwithstanding the continued decay of  the roots and the underground stems of plants and the occasional  addition of manure  the disappearance of the organic matter from  mould is probably much aided by its being brought again and again  to the surface in the castings of worms  worms on the other hand add largely to the organic matter in the  soil by the astonishing number of halfdecayed leaves which they  draw into their burrows to a depth of 2 or 3 inches  they do this  chiefly for obtaining food but partly for closing the mouths of  their burrows and for lining the upper part  the leaves which they  consume are moistened torn into small shreds partially digested  and intimately commingled with earth and it is this process which  gives to vegetable mould its uniform dark tint  it is known that  various kinds of acids are generated by the decay of vegetable  matter and from the contents of the intestines of worms and from  their castings being acid it seems probable that the process of  digestion induces an analogous chemical change in the swallowed  triturated and halfdecayed leaves  the large quantity of  carbonate of lime secreted by the calciferous glands apparently  serves to neutralise the acids thus generated for the digestive  fluid of worms will not act unless it be alkaline  as the contents  of the upper part of their intestines are acid the acidity can  hardly be due to the presence of uric acid  we may therefore  conclude that the acids in the alimentary canal of worms are formed  during the digestive process and that probably they are nearly of  the same nature as those in ordinary mould or humus  the latter  are well known to have the power of deoxidising or dissolving per oxide of iron as may be seen wherever peat overlies red sand or  where a rotten root penetrates such sand  now i kept some worms in  a pot filled with very fine reddish sand consisting of minute  particles of silex coated with the red oxide of iron and the  burrows which the worms made through this sand were lined or  coated in the usual manner with their castings formed of the sand  mingled with their intestinal secretions and the refuse of the  digested leaves and this sand had almost wholly lost its red  colour  when small portions of it were placed under the  microscope most of the grains were seen to be transparent and  colourless owing to the dissolution of the oxide whilst almost  all the grains taken from other parts of the pot were coated with  the oxide  acetic acid produced hardly any effect on his sand and  even hydrochloric nitric and sulphuric acids diluted as in the  pharmacopoeia produced less effect than did the acids in the  intestines of the worms  mr a a julien has lately collected all the extant information  about the acids generated in humus which according to some  chemists amount to more than a dozen different kinds  these  acids as well as their acid salts ie in combination with  potash soda and ammonia act energetically on carbonate of lime  and on the oxides of iron  it is also known that some of these  acids which were called long ago by thenard azohumic are enabled  to dissolve colloid silica in proportion to the nitrogen which they  contain 64  in the formation of these latter acids worms  probably afford some aid for dr h johnson informs me that by  nesslers test he found 0018 per cent of ammonia in their  castings  it may be here added that i have recently been informed by dr  gilbert that several square yards on his lawn were swept clean  and after two or three weeks all the wormcastings on the space  were collected and dried  these were found to contain 035 of  nitrogen  this is from two to three times as much as we find in  our ordinary arable surfacesoil more than in our ordinary pasture  surfacesoil but less than in rich kitchengarden mould   supposing a quantity of castings equal to 10 tons in the dry state  were annually deposited on an acre this would represent a manuring  of 78 lbs of nitrogen per acre per annum and this is very much  more than the amount of nitrogen in the annual yield of hay per  acre if raised without any nitrogenous manure  obviously so far  as the nitrogen in the castings is derived from surfacegrowth or  from surfacesoil it is not a gain to the latter but so far as it  is derived from below it is a gain  the several humusacids which appear as we have just seen to be  generated within the bodies of worms during the digestive process  and their acid salts play a highly important part according to  the recent observations of mr julien in the disintegration of  various kinds of rocks  it has long been known that the carbonic  acid and no doubt nitric and nitrous acids which are present in  rainwater act in like manner  there is also a great excess of  carbonic acid in all soils especially in rich soils and this is  dissolved by the water in the ground  the living roots of plants  moreover as sachs and others have shown quickly corrode and leave  their impressions on polished slabs of marble dolomite and  phosphate of lime  they will attack even basalt and sandstone  65  but we are not here concerned with agencies which are wholly  independent of the action of worms  the combination of any acid with a base is much facilitated by  agitation as fresh surfaces are thus continually brought into  contact  this will be thoroughly effected with the particles of  stone and earth in the intestines of worms during the digestive  process and it should be remembered that the entire mass of the  mould over every field passes in the course of a few years  through their alimentary canals  moreover as the old burrows  slowly collapse and as fresh castings are continually brought to  the surface the whole superficial layer of mould slowly revolves  or circulates and the friction of the particles one with another  will rub off the finest films of disintegrated matter as soon as  they are formed  through these several means minute fragments of  rocks of many kinds and mere particles in the soil will be  continually exposed to chemical decomposition and thus the amount  of soil will tend to increase  as worms line their burrows with their castings and as the burrows  penetrate to a depth of 5 or 6 or even more feet some small  amount of the humusacids will be carried far down and will there  act on the underlying rocks and fragments of rock  thus the  thickness of the soil if none be removed from the surface will  steadily though slowly tend to increase but the accumulation will  after a time delay the disintegration of the underlying rocks and  of the more deeply seated particles  for the humusacids which are  generated chiefly in the upper layer of vegetable mould are  extremely unstable compounds and are liable to decomposition  before they reach any considerable depth 66  a thick bed of  overlying soil will also check the downward extension of great  fluctuations of temperature and in cold countries will check the  powerful action of frost  the free access of air will likewise be  excluded  from these several causes disintegration would be almost  arrested if the overlying mould were to increase much in  thickness owing to none or little being removed from the surface  67  in my own immediate neighbourhood we have a curious proof how  effectually a few feet of clay checks some change which goes on in  flints lying freely exposed for the large ones which have lain  for some time on the surface of ploughed fields cannot be used for  building they will not cleave properly and are said by the  workmen to be rotten 68  it is therefore necessary to obtain  flints for building purposes from the bed of red clay overlying the  chalk the residue of its dissolution by rainwater or from the  chalk itself  not only do worms aid directly in the chemical disintegration of  rocks but there is good reason to believe that they likewise act  in a direct and mechanical manner on the smaller particles  all  the species which swallow earth are furnished with gizzards and  these are lined with so thick a chitinous membrane that perrier  speaks of it 69 as une veritable armature  the gizzard is  surrounded by powerful transverse muscles which according to  claparede are about ten times as thick as the longitudinal ones  and perrier saw them contracting energetically  worms belonging to  one genus digaster have two distinct but quite similar gizzards  and in another genus moniligaster the second gizzard consists of  four pouches one succeeding the other so that it may almost be  said to have five gizzards 70  in the same manner as  gallinaceous and struthious birds swallow stones to aid in the  trituration of their food so it appears to be with terricolous  worms  the gizzards of thirtyeight of our common worms were  opened and in twentyfive of them small stones or grains of sand  sometimes together with the hard calcareous concretions formed  within the anterior calciferous glands were found and in two  others concretions alone  in the gizzards of the remaining worms  there were no stones but some of these were not real exceptions  as the gizzards were opened late in the autumn when the worms had  ceased to feed and their gizzards were quite empty 71  when worms make their burrows through earth abounding with little  stones no doubt many will be unavoidably swallowed but it must  not be supposed that this fact accounts for the frequency with  which stones and sand are found in their gizzards  for beads of  glass and fragments of brick and of hard tiles were scattered over  the surface of the earth in pots in which worms were kept and had  already made their burrows and very many of these beads and  fragments were picked up and swallowed by the worms for they were  found in their castings intestines and gizzards  they even  swallowed the coarse red dust formed by the pounding of the tiles   nor can it be supposed that they mistook the beads and fragments  for food for we have seen that their taste is delicate enough to  distinguish between different kinds of leaves  it is therefore  manifest that they swallow hard objects such as bits of stone  beads of glass and angular fragments of bricks or tiles for some  special purpose and it can hardly be doubted that this is to aid  their gizzards in crushing and grinding the earth which they so  largely consume  that such hard objects are not necessary for  crushing leaves may be inferred from the fact that certain  species which live in mud or water and feed on dead or living  vegetable matter but which do not swallow earth are not provided  with gizzards 72 and therefore cannot have the power of  utilising stones  during the grinding process the particles of earth must be rubbed  against one another and between the stones and the tough lining  membrane of the gizzard  the softer particles will thus suffer  some attrition and will perhaps even be crushed  this conclusion  is supported by the appearance of freshly ejected castings for  these often reminded me of the appearance of paint which has just  been ground by a workman between two flat stones  morren remarks  that the intestinal canal is impleta tenuissima terra veluti in  pulverem redacta 73  perrier also speaks of letat de pate  excessivement fine a laquelle est reduite la terre quils  rejettent c 74  as the amount of trituration which the particles of earth undergo  in the gizzards of worms possesses some interest as we shall  hereafter see i endeavoured to obtain evidence on this head by  carefully examining many of the fragments which had passed through  their alimentary canals  with worms living in a state of nature  it is of course impossible to know how much the fragments may have  been worn before they were swallowed  it is however clear that  worms do not habitually select already rounded particles for  sharply angular bits of flint and of other hard rocks were often  found in their gizzards or intestines  on three occasions sharp  spines from the stems of rosebushes were thus found  worms kept  in confinement repeatedly swallowed angular fragments of hard tile  coal cinders and even the sharpest fragments of glass   gallinaceous and struthious birds retain the same stones in their  gizzards for a long time which thus become well rounded but this  does not appear to be the case with worms judging from the large  number of the fragments of tiles glass beads stones c  commonly found in their castings and intestines  so that unless  the same fragments were to pass repeatedly through their gizzards  visible signs of attrition in the fragments could hardly be  expected except perhaps in the case of very soft stones  i will now give such evidence of attrition as i have been able to  collect  in the gizzards of some worms dug out of a thin bed of  mould over the chalk there were many wellrounded small fragments  of chalk and two fragments of the shells of a landmollusc as  ascertained by their microscopical structure which latter were  not only rounded but somewhat polished  the calcareous concretions  formed in the calciferous glands which are often found in their  gizzards intestines and occasionally in their castings when of  large size sometimes appeared to have been rounded but with all  calcareous bodies the rounded appearance may be partly or wholly  due to their corrosion by carbonic acid and the humusacids  in  the gizzards of several worms collected in my kitchen garden near a  hothouse eight little fragments of cinders were found and of  these six appeared more or less rounded as were two bits of  brick but some other bits were not at all rounded  a farmroad  near abinger hall had been covered seven years before with brick rubbish to the depth of about 6 inches turf had grown over this  rubbish on both sides of the road for a width of 18 inches and on  this turf there were innumerable castings  some of them were  coloured of a uniform red owing to the presence of much brickdust  and they contained many particles of brick and of hard mortar from  1 to 3 mm in diameter most of which were plainly rounded but all  these particles may have been rounded before they were protected by  the turf and were swallowed like those on the bare parts of the  road which were much worn  a hole in a pasturefield had been  filled up with brickrubbish at the same time viz seven years  ago and was now covered with turf and here the castings contained  very many particles of brick all more or less rounded and this  brickrubbish after being shot into the hole could not have  undergone any attrition  again old bricks very little broken  together with fragments of mortar were laid down to form walks  and were then covered with from 4 to 6 inches of gravel six little  fragments of brick were extracted from castings collected on these  walks three of which were plainly worn  there were also very many  particles of hard mortar about half of which were well rounded  and it is not credible that these could have suffered so much  corrosion from the action of carbonic acid in the course of only  seven years  much better evidence of the attrition of hard objects in the  gizzards of worms is afforded by the state of the small fragments  of tiles or bricks and of concrete in the castings thrown up where  ancient buildings once stood  as all the mould covering a field  passes every few years through the bodies of worms the same small  fragments will probably be swallowed and brought to the surface  many times in the course of centuries  it should be premised that  in the several following cases the finer matter was first washed  away from the castings and then all the particles of bricks tiles  and concrete were collected without any selection and were  afterwards examined  now in the castings ejected between the  tesserae on one of the buried floors of the roman villa at abinger  there were many particles from to 2 mm in diameter of tiles and  concrete which it was impossible to look at with the naked eye or  through a strong lens and doubt for a moment that they had almost  all undergone much attrition  i speak thus after having examined  small waterworn pebbles formed from roman bricks which m henri  de saussure had the kindness to send me and which he had extracted  from sand and gravel beds deposited on the shores of the lake of  geneva at a former period when the water stood at about two metres  above its present level  the smallest of these waterworn pebbles  of brick from geneva resembled closely many of those extracted from  the gizzards of worms but the larger ones were somewhat smoother  four castings found on the recently uncovered tesselated floor of  the great room in the roman villa at brading contained many  particles of tile or brick of mortar and of hard white cement  and the majority of these appeared plainly worn  the particles of  mortar however seemed to have suffered more corrosion than  attrition for grains of silex often projected from their surfaces   castings from within the nave of beaulieu abbey which was  destroyed by henry viii were collected from a level expanse of  turf overlying the buried tesselated pavement through which worm burrows passed and these castings contained innumerable particles  of tiles and bricks of concrete and cement the majority of which  had manifestly undergone some or much attrition  there were also  many minute flakes of a micaceous slate the points of which were  rounded  if the above supposition that in all these cases the  same minute fragments have passed several times through the  gizzards of worms be rejected notwithstanding its inherent  probability we must then assume that in all the above cases the  many rounded fragments found in the castings had all accidentally  undergone much attrition before they were swallowed and this is  highly improbable  on the other hand it must be stated that fragments of ornamental  tiles somewhat harder than common tiles or bricks which had been  swallowed only once by worms kept in confinement were with the  doubtful exception of one or two of the smallest grains not at all  rounded  nevertheless some of them appeared a little worn though  not rounded  notwithstanding these cases if we consider the  evidence above given there can be little doubt that the fragments  which serve as millstones in the gizzards of worms suffer when of  a not very hard texture some amount of attrition and that the  smaller particles in the earth which is habitually swallowed in  such astonishingly large quantities by worms are ground together  and are thus levigated  if this be the case the terra  tenuissimathe pate excessivement fineof which the castings  largely consist is in part due to the mechanical action of the  gizzard 75 and this fine matter as we shall see in the next  chapter is that which is chiefly washed away from the innumerable  castings on every field during each heavy shower of rain  if the  softer stones yield at all the harder ones will suffer some slight  amount of wear and tear  the trituration of small particles of stone in the gizzards of  worms is of more importance under a geological point of view than  may at first appear to be the case for mr sorby has clearly shown  that the ordinary means of disintegration namely running water  and the waves of the sea act with less and less power on fragments  of rock the smaller they are  hence as he remarks even making  no allowance for the extra buoying up of very minute particles by a  current of water depending on surface cohesion the effects of  wearing on the form of the grains must vary directly as their  diameter or thereabouts  if so a grain of 110 an inch in  diameter would be worn ten times as much as one of an inch in  diameter and at least a hundred times as much as one of 1100 an  inch in diameter  perhaps then we may conclude that a grain 110  of an inch in diameter would be worn as much or more in drifting a  mile as a grain 11000 of an inch in being drifted 100 miles  on  the same principle a pebble one inch in diameter would be worn  relatively more by being drifted only a few hundred yards 76   nor should we forget in considering the power which worms exert in  triturating particles of rock that there is good evidence that on  each acre of land which is sufficiently damp and not too sandy  gravelly or rocky for worms to inhabit a weight of more than ten  tons of earth annually passes through their bodies and is brought  to the surface  the result for a country of the size of great  britain within a period not very long in a geological sense such  as a million years cannot be insignificant for the ten tons of  earth has to be multiplied first by the above number of years and  then by the number of acres fully stocked with worms and in  england together with scotland the land which is cultivated and  is well fitted for these animals has been estimated at above 32  million acres  the product is 320 million million tons of earth    chapter vithe denudation of the landcontinued    denudation aided by recently

furrows on land  anciently ploughedthe formation and amount of mould over the  chalk formation  we are now prepared to consider the more direct part which worms  take in the denudation of the land  when reflecting on subaerial  denudation it formerly appeared to me as it has to others that a  nearly level or very gently inclined surface covered with turf  could suffer no loss during even a long lapse of time  it may  however be urged that at long intervals debacles of rain or  waterspouts would remove all the mould from a very gentle slope  but when examining the steep turfcovered slopes in glen roy i  was struck with the fact how rarely any such event could have  happened since the glacial period as was plain from the well preserved state of the three successive roads or lakemargins   but the difficulty in believing that earth in any appreciable  quantity can be removed from a gently inclined surface covered  with vegetation and matted with roots is removed through the  agency of worms  for the many castings which are thrown up during  rain and those thrown up some little time before heavy rain flow  for a short distance down an inclined surface  moreover much of  the finest levigated earth is washed completely away from the  castings  during dry weather castings often disintegrate into  small rounded pellets and these from their weight often roll down  any slope  this is more especially apt to occur when they are  started by the wind and probably when started by the touch of an  animal however small  we shall also see that a strong wind blows  all the castings even on a level field to leeward whilst they  are soft and in like manner the pellets when they are dry  if the  wind blows in nearly the direction of an inclined surface the  flowing down of the castings is much aided  the observations on which these several statements are founded must  now be given in some detail  castings when first ejected are  viscid and soft during rain at which time worms apparently prefer  to eject them they are still softer so that i have sometimes  thought that worms must swallow much water at such times  however  this may be rain even when not very heavy if long continued  renders recentlyejected castings semifluid and on level ground  they then spread out into thin circular flat discs exactly as  would so much honey or very soft mortar with all traces of their  vermiform structure lost  this latter fact was sometimes made  evident when a worm had subsequently bored through a flat circular  disc of this kind and heaped up a fresh vermiform mass in the  centre  these flat subsided discs have been repeatedly seen by me  after heavy rain in many places on land of all kinds  on the flowing of wet castings and the rolling of dry  disintegrated castings down inclined surfaceswhen castings are  ejected on an inclined surface during or shortly before heavy rain  they cannot fail to flow a little down the slope  thus on some  steep slopes in knole park which were covered with coarse grass  and had apparently existed in this state from time immemorial i  found oct 22 1872 after several wet days that almost all the  many castings were considerably elongated in the line of the slope  and that they now consisted of smooth only slightly conical  masses  whenever the mouths of the burrows could be found from  which the earth had been ejected there was more earth below than  above them  after some heavy storms of rain jan 25 1872 two  rather steeply inclined fields near down which had formerly been  ploughed and were now rather sparsely clothed with poor grass were  visited and many castings extended down the slopes for a length of  5 inches which was twice or thrice the usual diameter of the  castings thrown up on the level parts of these same fields  on  some fine grassy slopes in holwood park inclined at angles between  8 degrees and 11 degrees 30 seconds with the horizon where the  surface apparently had never been disturbed by the hand of man  castings abounded in extraordinary numbers  and a space 16 inches  in length transversely to the slope and 6 inches in the line of the  slope was completely coated between the blades of grass with a  uniform sheet of confluent and subsided castings  here also in  many places the castings had flowed down the slope and now formed  smooth narrow patches of earth 6 7 and 75 inches in length   some of these consisted of two castings one above the other which  had become so completely confluent that they could hardly be  distinguished  on my lawn clothed with very fine grass most of  the castings are black but some are yellowish from earth having  been brought up from a greater depth than usual and the flowing down of these yellow castings after heavy rain could be clearly  seen where the slope was 5 degrees and where it was less than 1  degree some evidence of their flowing down could still be detected   on another occasion after rain which was never heavy but which  lasted for 18 hours all the castings on this same gently inclined  lawn had lost their vermiform structure and they had flowed so  that fully twothirds of the ejected earth lay below the mouths of  the burrows  these observations led me to make others with more care  eight  castings were found on my lawn where the grassblades are fine and  close together and three others on a field with coarse grass  the  inclination of the surface at the eleven places where these  castings were collected varied between 4 degrees 30 seconds and 17  degrees 30 seconds the mean of the eleven inclinations being 9  degrees 26 seconds  the length of the castings in the direction of  the slope was first measured with as much accuracy as their  irregularities would permit  it was found possible to make these  measurements within about of an inch but one of the castings was  too irregular to admit of measurement  the average length in the  direction of the slope of the remaining ten castings was 203  inches  the castings were then divided with a knife into two parts  along a horizontal line passing through the mouth of the burrow  which was discovered by slicing off the turf and all the ejected  earth was separately collected namely the part above the hole and  the part below  afterwards these two parts were weighed  in every  case there was much more earth below than above the mean weight of  that above being 103 grains and of that below 205 grains so that  the latter was very nearly double the former  as on level ground  castings are commonly thrown up almost equally round the mouths of  the burrows this difference in weight indicates the amount of  ejected earth which had flowed down the slope  but very many more  observations would be requisite to arrive at any general result  for the nature of the vegetation and other accidental  circumstances such as the heaviness of the rain the direction and  force of the wind c appear to be more important in determining  the quantity of the earth which flows down a slope than its angle   thus with four castings on my lawn included in the above eleven  where the mean slope was 7 degrees 19 seconds the difference in  the amount of earth above and below the burrows was greater than  with three other castings on the same lawn where the mean slope was  12 degrees 5 seconds  we may however take the above eleven cases which are accurate as  far as they go and calculate the weight of the ejected earth which  annually flows down a slope having a mean inclination of 9 degrees  26 seconds  this was done by my son george  it has been shown  that almost exactly twothirds of the ejected earth is found below  the mouth of the burrow and onethird above it  now if the two thirds which is below the hole be divided into two equal parts the  upper half of this twothirds exactly counterbalances the onethird  which is above the hole so that as far as regards the onethird  above and the upper half of the twothirds below there is no flow  of earth down the hillside  the earth constituting the lower half  of the twothirds is however displaced through distances which  are different for every part of it but which may be represented by  the distance between the middle point of the lower half of the two thirds and the hole  so that the average distance of displacement  is a half of the whole length of the wormcasting  now the average  length of ten out of the above eleven castings was 203 inches and  half of this we may take as being 1 inch  it may therefore be  concluded that onethird of the whole earth brought to the surface  was in these cases carried down the slope through 1 inch 77  it was shown in the third chapter that on leith hill common dry  earth weighing at least 7453 lbs was brought up by worms to the  surface on a square yard in the course of a year  if a square yard  be drawn on a hillside with two of its sides horizontal then it is  clear that only 136 part of the earth brought up on that square  yard would be near enough to its lower side to cross it supposing  the displacement of the earth to be through one inch  but it  appears that only of the earth brought up can be considered to flow  downwards hence 13 of 136 or 1108 of 7453 lbs will cross the  lower side of our square yard in a year  now 1108 of 7453 lbs  is 11 oz  therefore 11 oz of dry earth will annually cross each  linear yard running horizontally along a slope having the above  inclination or very nearly 7 lbs will annually cross a horizontal  line 100 yards in length on a hillside having this inclination  a more accurate though still very rough calculation can be made  of the bulk of earth which in its natural damp state annually  flows down the same slope over a yardline drawn horizontally  across it  from the several cases given in the third chapter it  is known that the castings annually brought to the surface on a  square yard if uniformly spread out would form a layer 02 of an  inch in thickness  it therefore follows by a calculation similar  to the one already given that 13 of 02x36 or 24 cubic inches  of damp earth will annually cross a horizontal line one yard in  length on a hillside with the above inclination  this bulk of damp  castings was found to weigh 185 oz  therefore 1156 lbs of damp  earth instead of 7 lbs of dry earth as by the former calculation  would annually cross a line 100 yards in length on our inclined  surface  in these calculations it has been assumed that the castings flow a  short distance downwards during the whole year but this occurs  only with those ejected during or shortly before rain so that the  above results are thus far exaggerated  on the other hand during  rain much of the finest earth is washed to a considerable distance  from the castings even where the slope is an extremely gentle one  and is thus wholly lost as far as the above calculations are  concerned  castings ejected during dry weather and which have set  hard lose in the same manner a considerable quantity of fine  earth  dried castings moreover are apt to disintegrate into  little pellets which often roll or are blown down any inclined  surface  therefore the above result namely that 24 cubic inches  of earth weighing 185 oz whilst damp annually crosses a yard line of the specified kind is probably not much if at all  exaggerated  this amount is small but we should bear in mind how many branching  valleys intersect most countries the whole length of which must be  very great and that earth is steadily travelling down both turf covered sides of each valley  for every 100 yards in length in a  valley with sides sloping as in the foregoing cases 480 cubic  inches of damp earth weighing above 23 pounds will annually reach  the bottom  here a thick bed of alluvium will accumulate ready to  be washed away in the course of centuries as the stream in the  middle meanders from side to side  if it could be shown that worms generally excavate their burrows at  right angles to an inclined surface and this would be their  shortest course for bringing up earth from beneath then as the old  burrows collapsed from the weight of the superincumbent soil the  collapsing would inevitably cause the whole bed of vegetable mould  to sink or slide slowly down the inclined surface  but to  ascertain the direction of many burrows was found too difficult and  troublesome  a straight piece of wire was however pushed into  twentyfive burrows on several sloping fields and in eight cases  the burrows were nearly at right angles to the slope whilst in the  remaining cases they were indifferently directed at various angles  either upwards or downwards with respect to the slope  in countries where the rain is very heavy as in the tropics the  castings appear as might have been expected to be washed down in  a greater degree than in england  mr scott informs me that near  calcutta the tall columnar castings previously described the  diameter of which is usually between 1 and 15 inch subside on a  level surface after heavy rain into almost circular thin flat  discs between 3 and 4 and sometimes 5 inches in diameter  three  fresh castings which had been ejected in the botanic gardens on a  slightly inclined grasscovered artificial bank of loamy clay  were carefully measured and had a mean height of 217 and a mean  diameter of 143 inches these after heavy rain formed elongated  patches of earth with a mean length in the direction of the slope  of 583 inches  as the earth had spread very little up the slope  a large part judging from the original diameter of these castings  must have flowed bodily downwards about 4 inches  moreover some of  the finest earth of which they were composed must have been washed  completely away to a still greater distance  in drier sites near  calcutta a species of worm ejects its castings not in vermiform  masses but in little pellets of varying sizes  these are very  numerous in some places and mr scott says that they are washed  away by every shower  i was led to believe that a considerable quantity of fine earth is  washed quite away from castings during rain from the surfaces of  old ones being often studded with coarse particles  accordingly a  little fine precipitated chalk moistened with saliva or gumwater  so as to be slightly viscid and of the same consistence as a fresh  casting was placed on the summits of several castings and gently  mixed with them  these castings were then watered through a very  fine rose the drops from which were closer together than those of  rain but not nearly so large as those in a thunderstorm nor did  they strike the ground with nearly so much force as drops during  heavy rain  a casting thus treated subsided with surprising  slowness owing as i suppose to its viscidity  it did not flow  bodily down the grasscovered surface of the lawn which was here  inclined at an angle of 16 degrees 20 seconds nevertheless many  particles of the chalk were found three inches below the casting   the experiment was repeated on three other castings on different  parts of the lawn which sloped at 2 degrees 30 seconds 3 degrees  and 6 degrees and particles of chalk could be seen between 4 and 5  inches below the casting and after the surface had become dry  particles were found in two cases at a distance of 5 and 6 inches   several other castings with precipitated chalk placed on their  summits were left to the natural action of the rain  in one case  after rain which was not heavy the casting was longitudinally  streaked with white  in two other cases the surface of the ground  was rendered somewhat white for a distance of one inch from the  casting and some soil collected at a distance of 25 inches where  the slope was 7 degrees effervesced slightly when placed in acid   after one or two weeks the chalk was wholly or almost wholly  washed away from all the castings on which it had been placed and  these had recovered their natural colour  it may be here remarked that after very heavy rain shallow pools  may be seen on level or nearly level fields where the soil is not  very porous and the water in them is often slightly muddy when  such little pools have dried the leaves and blades of grass at  their bottoms are generally coated with a thin layer of mud  this  mud i believe is derived in large part from recently ejected  castings  dr king informs me that the majority of the before described  gigantic castings which he found on a fully exposed bare  gravelly knoll on the nilgiri mountains in india had been more or  less weathered by the previous northeast monsoon and most of them  presented a subsided appearance  the worms here eject their  castings only during the rainy season and at the time of dr  kings visit no rain had fallen for 110 days  he carefully  examined the ground between the place where these huge castings  lay and a little watercourse at the base of the knoll and nowhere  was there any accumulation of fine earth such as would necessarily  have been left by the disintegration of the castings if they had  not been wholly removed  he therefore has no hesitation in  asserting that the whole of these huge castings are annually washed  during the two monsoons when about 100 inches of rain fall into  the little watercourse and thence into the plains lying below at  a depth of 3000 or 4000 feet  castings ejected before or during dry weather become hard  sometimes surprisingly hard from the particles of earth having  been cemented together by the intestinal secretions  frost seems  to be less effective in their disintegration than might have been  expected  nevertheless they readily disintegrate into small  pellets after being alternately moistened with rain and again  dried  those which have flowed during rain down a slope  disintegrate in the same manner  such pellets often roll a little  down any sloping surface their descent being sometimes much aided  by the wind  the whole bottom of a broad dry ditch in my grounds  where there were very few fresh castings was completely covered  with these pellets or disintegrated castings which had rolled down  the steep sides inclined at an angle of 27 degrees  near nice in places where the great cylindrical castings  previously described abound the soil consists of very fine  arenaceocalcareous loam and dr king informs me that these  castings are extremely liable to crumble during dry weather into  small fragments which are soon acted on by rain and then sink  down so as to be no longer distinguishable from the surrounding  soil  he sent me a mass of such disintegrated castings collected  on the top of a bank where none could have rolled down from above   they must have been ejected within the previous five or six months  but they now consisted of more or less rounded fragments of all  sizes from 075 of an inch in diameter to minute grains and mere  dust  dr king witnessed the crumbling process whilst drying some  perfect castings which he afterwards sent me  mr scott also  remarks on the crumbling of the castings near calcutta and on the  mountains of sikkim during the hot and dry season  when the castings near nice had been ejected on an inclined  surface the disintegrated fragments rolled downwards without  losing their distinctive shape and in some places could be  collected in basketfuls  dr king observed a striking instance of  this fact on the corniche road where a drain about 25 feet wide  and 9 inches deep had been made to catch the surface drainage from  the adjoining hillside  the bottom of this drain was covered for  a distance of several hundred yards to a depth of from 15 to 3  inches by a layer of broken castings still retaining their  characteristic shape  nearly all these innumerable fragments had  rolled down from above for extremely few castings had been ejected  in the drain itself  the hillside was steep but varied much in  inclination which dr king estimated at from 30 degrees to 60  degrees with the horizon  he climbed up the slope and found  every here and there little embankments formed by fragments of the  castings that had been arrested in their downward progress by  irregularities of the surface by stones twigs c  one little  group of plants of anemone hortensis had acted in this manner and  quite a small bank of soil had collected round it  much of this  soil had crumbled down but a great deal of it still retained the  form of castings  dr king dug up this plant and was struck with  the thickness of the soil which must have recently accumulated over  the crown of the rhizoma as shown by the length of the bleached  petioles in comparison with those of other plants of the same  kind where there had been no such accumulation  the earth thus  accumulated had no doubt been secured as i have everywhere seen  by the smaller roots of the plants  after describing this and  other analogous cases dr king concludes  i can have no doubt  that worms help greatly in the process of denudation  ledges of earth on steep hillsideslittle horizontal ledges one  above another have been observed on steep grassy slopes in many  parts of the world  the formation has been attributed to animals  travelling repeatedly along the slope in the same horizontal lines  while grazing and that they do thus move and use the ledges is  certain but professor henslow a most careful observer told sir  j hooker that he was convinced that this was not the sole cause of  their formation  sir j hooker saw such ledges on the himalayan  and atlas ranges where there were no domesticated animals and not  many wild ones but these latter would it is probable use the  ledges at night while grazing like our domesticated animals  a  friend observed for me the ledges on the alps of switzerland and  states that they ran at 3 or 4 ft one above the other and were  about a foot in breadth  they had been deeply pitted by the feet  of grazing cows  similar ledges were observed by the same friend  on our chalk downs and on an old talus of chalkfragments thrown  out of a quarry which had become clothed with turf  my son francis examined a chalk escarpment near lewes and here on  a part which was very steep sloping at 40 degrees with the  horizon about 30 flat ledges extended horizontally for more than  100 yards at an average distance of about 20 inches one beneath  the other  they were from 9 to 10 inches in breadth  when viewed  from a distance they presented a striking appearance owing to  their parallelism but when examined closely they were seen to be  somewhat sinuous and one often ran into another giving the  appearance of the ledge having forked into two  they are formed of  lightcoloured earth which on the outside where thickest was in  one case 9 inches and in another case between 6 and 7 inches in  thickness  above the ledges the thickness of the earth over the  chalk was in the former case 4 and in the latter only 3 inches   the grass grew more vigorously on the outer edges of the ledges  than on any other part of the slope and here formed a tufted  fringe  their middle part was bare but whether this had been  caused by the trampling of sheep which sometimes frequent the  ledges my son could not ascertain  nor could he feel sure how  much of the earth on the middle and bare parts consisted of  disintegrated wormcastings which had rolled down from above but  he felt convinced that some had thus originated and it was  manifest that the ledges with their grassfringed edges would  arrest any small object rolling down from above  at one end or side of the bank bearing these ledges the surface  consisted in parts of bare chalk and here the ledges were very  irregular  at the other end of the bank the slope suddenly became  less steep and here the ledges ceased rather abruptly but little  embankments only a foot or two in length were still present  the  slope became steeper lower down the hill and the regular ledges  then reappeared  another of my sons observed on the inland side  of beachy head where the surface sloped at about 25 degrees many  short little embankments like those just mentioned  they extended  horizontally and were from a few inches to two or three feet in  length  they supported tufts of grass growing vigorously  the  average thickness of the mould of which they were formed taken  from nine measurements was 45 inches while that of the mould  above and beneath them was on an average only 32 inches and on  each side on the same level 31 inches  on the upper parts of  the slope these embankments showed no signs of having been  trampled on by sheep but in the lower parts such signs were fairly  plain  no long continuous ledges had here been formed  if the little embankments above the corniche road which dr king  saw in the act of formation by the accumulation of disintegrated  and rolled wormcastings were to become confluent along horizontal  lines ledges would be formed  each embankment would tend to  extend laterally by the lateral extension of the arrested castings  and animals grazing on a steep slope would almost certainly make  use of every prominence at nearly the same level and would indent  the turf between them and such intermediate indentations would  again arrest the castings  an irregular ledge when once formed  would also tend to become more regular and horizontal by some of  the castings rolling laterally from the higher to the lower parts  which would thus be raised  any projection beneath a ledge would  not afterwards receive disintegrated matter from above and would  tend to be obliterated by rain and other atmospheric agencies   there is some analogy between the formation as here supposed of  these ledges and that of the ripples of winddrifted sand as  described by lyell 78  the steep grasscovered sides of a mountainous valley in  westmoreland called grisedale was marked in many places with  innumerable lines of miniature cliffs with almost horizontal  little ledges at their bases  their formation was in no way  connected with the action of worms for castings could not anywhere  be seen and their absence is an inexplicable fact although the  turf lay in many places over a considerable thickness of boulder clay and moraine rubbish  nor as far as i could judge was the  formation of these little cliffs at all closely connected with the  trampling of cows or sheep  it appeared as if the whole  superficial somewhat argillaceous earth while partially held  together by the roots of the grasses had slided a little way down  the mountain sides and in thus sliding had yielded and cracked in  horizontal lines transversely to the slope  castings blown to leeward by the windwe have seen that moist  castings flow and that disintegrated castings roll down any  inclined surface and we shall now see that castings recently  ejected on level grasscovered surfaces are blown during gales of  wind accompanied by rain to leeward  this has been observed by me  many times on many fields during several successive years  after  such gales the castings present a gently inclined and smooth or  sometimes furrowed surface to windward while they are steeply  inclined or precipitous to leeward so that they resemble on a  miniature scale glacierground hillocks of rock  they are often  cavernous on the leeward side from the upper part having curled  over the lower part  during one unusually heavy southwest gale  with torrents of rain many castings were wholly blown to leeward  so that the mouths of the burrows were left naked and exposed on  the windward side  recent castings naturally flow down an inclined  surface but on a grassy field which sloped between 10 degrees and  15 degrees several were found after a heavy gale blown up the  slope  this likewise occurred on another occasion on a part of my  lawn where the slope was somewhat less  on a third occasion the  castings on the steep grasscovered sides of a valley down which  a gale had blown were directed obliquely instead of straight down  the slope and this was obviously due to the combined action of the  wind and gravity  four castings on my lawn where the downward  inclination was 0  degrees 45 seconds 1 degree 3 degrees and 3  degrees 30 seconds mean 2 degrees 45 seconds towards the north east after a heavy southwest gale with rain were divided across  the mouths of the burrows and weighed in the manner formerly  described  the mean weight of the earth below the mouths of  burrows and to leeward was to that above the mouths and on the  windward side as 275 to 1 whereas we have seen that with several  castings which had flowed down slopes having a mean inclination of  9 degrees 26 seconds and with three castings where the inclination  was above 12 degrees the proportional weight of the earth below to  that above the burrows was as only 2 to 1  these several cases  show how efficiently gales of wind accompanied by rain act in  displacing recently ejected castings  we may therefore conclude  that even a moderately strong wind will produce some slight effect  on them  dry and indurated castings after their disintegration into small  fragments or pellets are sometimes probably often blown by a  strong wind to leeward  this was observed on four occasions but i  did not sufficiently attend to this point  one old casting on a  gently sloping bank was blown quite away by a strong southwest  wind  dr king believes that the wind removes the greater part of  the old crumbling castings near nice  several old castings on my  lawn were marked with pins and protected from any disturbance   they were examined after an interval of 10 weeks during which time  the weather had been alternately dry and rainy  some which were  of a yellowish colour had been washed almost completely away as  could be seen by the colour of the surrounding ground  others had  completely disappeared and these no doubt had been blown away   lastly others still remained and would long remain as blades of  grass had grown through them  on poor pastureland which has  never been rolled and has not been much trampled on by animals the  whole surface is sometimes dotted with little pimples through and  on which grass grows and these pimples consist of old worm castings  in all the many observed cases of soft castings blown to leeward  this had been effected by strong winds accompanied by rain  as  such winds in england generally blow from the south and southwest  earth must on the whole tend to travel over our fields in a north  and northeast direction  this fact is interesting because it  might be thought that none could be removed from a level grass covered surface by any means  in thick and level woods protected  from the wind castings will never be removed as long as the wood  lasts and mould will here tend to accumulate to the depth at which  worms can work  i tried to procure evidence as to how much mould  is blown whilst in the state of castings by our wet southern  gales to the northeast over open and flat land by looking to the  level of the surface on opposite sides of old trees and hedgerows  but i failed owing to the unequal growth of the roots of trees and  to most pastureland having been formerly ploughed  on an open plain near stonehenge there exist shallow circular  trenches with a low embankment outside surrounding level spaces  50 yards in diameter  these rings appear very ancient and are  believed to be contemporaneous with the druidical stones  castings  ejected within these circular spaces if blown to the northeast by  southwest winds would form a layer of mould within the trench  thicker on the northeastern than on any other side  but the site  was not favourable for the action of worms for the mould over the  surrounding chalk formation with flints was only 337 inches in  thickness from a mean of six observations made at a distance of 10  yards outside the embankment  the thickness of the mould within  two of the circular trenches was measured every 5 yards all round  on the inner sides near the bottom  my son horace protracted these  measurements on paper and though the curved line representing the  thickness of the mould was extremely irregular yet in both  diagrams it could be seen to be thicker on the northeastern side  than elsewhere  when a mean of all the measurements in both the  trenches was laid down and the line smoothed it was obvious that  the mould was thickest in the quarter of the circle between north west and northeast and thinnest in the quarter between southeast  and southwest especially at this latter point  besides the  foregoing measurements six others were taken near together in one  of the circular trenches on the northeast side and the mould  here had a mean thickness of 229 inches while the mean of six  other measurements on the southwest side was only 146 inches   these observations indicate that the castings had been blown by the  southwest winds from the circular enclosed space into the trench  on the northeast side but many more measurements in other  analogous cases would be requisite for a trustworthy result  the amount of fine earth brought to the surface under the form of  castings and afterwards transported by the winds accompanied by  rain or that which flows and rolls down an inclined surface no  doubt is small in the course of a few scores of years for  otherwise all the inequalities in our pasture fields would be  smoothed within a much shorter period than appears to be the case   but the amount which is thus transported in the course of thousands  of years cannot fail to be considerable and deserves attention  e  de beaumont looks at the vegetable mould which everywhere covers  the land as a fixed line from which the amount of denudation may  be measured 79  he ignores the continued formation of fresh  mould by the disintegration of the underlying rocks and fragments  of rock and it is curious to find how much more philosophical were  the views maintained long ago by playfair who in 1802 wrote  in the permanence of a coat of vegetable mould on the surface of  the earth we have a demonstrative proof of the continued  destruction of the rocks 80  ancient encampments and tumulie de beaumont adduces the present  state of many ancient encampments and tumuli and of old ploughed  fields as evidence that the surface of the land undergoes hardly  any degradation  but it does not appear that he ever examined the  thickness of the mould over different parts of such old remains   he relies chiefly on indirect but apparently trustworthy evidence  that the slopes of the old embankments are the same as they  originally were and it is obvious that he could know nothing about  their original heights  in knole park a mound had been thrown up  behind the rifletargets which appeared to have been formed of  earth originally supported by square blocks of turf  the sides  sloped as nearly as i could estimate them at an angle of 45  degrees or 50 degrees with the horizon and they were covered  especially on the northern side with long coarse grass beneath  which many wormcastings were found  these had flowed bodily  downwards and others had rolled down as pellets  hence it is  certain that as long as a mound of this kind is tenanted by worms  its height will be continually lowered  the fine earth which flows  or rolls down the sides of such a mound accumulates at its base in  the form of a talus  a bed even a very thin bed of fine earth is  eminently favourable for worms so that a greater number of  castings would tend to be ejected on a talus thus formed than  elsewhere and these would be partially washed away by every heavy  shower and be spread over the adjoining level ground  the final  result would be the lowering of the whole mound whilst the  inclination of the sides would not be greatly lessened  the same  result would assuredly follow with ancient embankments and tumuli  except where they had been formed of gravel or of nearly pure sand  as such matter is unfavourable for worms  many old fortifications  and tumuli are believed to be at least 2000 years old and we  should bear in mind that in many places about one inch of mould is  brought to the surface in 5 years or two inches in 10 years   therefore in so long a period as 2000 years a large amount of  earth will have been repeatedly brought to the surface on most old  embankments and tumuli especially on the talus round their bases  and much of this earth will have been washed completely away  we  may therefore conclude that all ancient mounds when not formed of  materials unfavourable to worms will have been somewhat lowered in  the course of centuries although their inclinations may not have  been greatly changed  fields formerly ploughedfrom a very remote period and in many  countries land has been ploughed so that convex beds called  crowns or ridges usually about 8 feet across and separated by  furrows have been thrown up  the furrows are directed so as to  carry off the surface water  in my attempts to ascertain how long  a time these crowns and furrows last when ploughed land has been  converted into pasture obstacles of many kinds were encountered   it is rarely known when a field was last ploughed and some fields  which were thought to have been in pasture from time immemorial  were afterwards discovered to have been ploughed only 50 or 60  years before  during the early part of the present century when  the price of corn was very high land of all kinds seems to have  been ploughed in britain  there is however no reason to doubt  that in many cases the old crowns and furrows have been preserved  from a very ancient period 81  that they should have been  preserved for very unequal lengths of time would naturally follow  from the crowns when first thrown up having differed much in  height in different districts as is now the case with recently  ploughed land  in old pasture fields the mould wherever measurements were made  was found to be from 05 to 2 inches thicker in the furrows than on  the crowns but this would naturally follow from the finer earth  having been washed from the crowns into the furrows before the land  was well clothed with turf and it is impossible to tell what part  worms may have played in the work  nevertheless from what we have  seen castings would certainly tend to flow and to be washed during  heavy rain from the crowns into the furrows  but as soon as a bed  of fine earth had by any means been accumulated in the furrows it  would be more favourable for worms than the other parts and a  greater number of castings would be thrown up here than elsewhere  and as the furrows on sloping land are usually directed so as to  carry off the surface water some of the finest earth would be  washed from the castings which had been here ejected and be carried  completely away  the result would be that the furrows would be  filled up very slowly while the crowns would be lowered perhaps  still more slowly by the flowing and rolling of the castings down  their gentle inclinations into the furrows  nevertheless it might be expected that old furrows especially  those on a sloping surface would in the course of time be filled  up and disappear  some careful observers however who examined  fields for me in gloucestershire and staffordshire could not detect  any difference in the state of the furrows in the upper and lower  parts of sloping fields supposed to have been long in pasture and  they came to the conclusion that the crowns and furrows would last  for an almost endless number of centuries  on the other hand the  process of obliteration seems to have commenced in some places   thus in a grass field in north wales known to have been ploughed  about 65 years ago which sloped at an angle of 15 degrees to the  northeast the depth of the furrows only 7 feet apart was  carefully measured and was found to be about 45 inches in the  upper part of the slope and only 1 inch near the base where they  could be traced with difficulty  on another field sloping at about  the same angle to the southwest the furrows were scarcely  perceptible in the lower part although these same furrows when  followed on to some adjoining level ground were from 25 to 35  inches in depth  a third and closely similar case was observed   in a fourth case the mould in a furrow in the upper part of a  sloping field was 25 inches and in the lower part 45 inches in  thickness  on the chalk downs at about a mile distance from stonehenge my son  william examined a grasscovered furrowed surface sloping at from  8 degrees to 10 degrees which an old shepherd said had not been  ploughed within the memory of man  the depth of one furrow was  measured at 16 points in a length of 68 paces and was found to be  deeper where the slope was greatest and where less earth would  naturally tend to accumulate and at the base it almost  disappeared  the thickness of the mould in this furrow in the  upper part was 25 inches which increased to 5 inches a little  above the steepest part of the slope and at the base in the  middle of the narrow valley at a point which the furrow if  continued would have struck it amounted to 7 inches  on the  opposite side of the valley there were very faint almost  obliterated traces of furrows  another analogous but not so  decided a case was observed at a few miles distance from  stonehenge  on the whole it appears that the crowns and furrows on  land formerly ploughed but now covered with grass tend slowly to  disappear when the surface is inclined and this is probably in  large part due to the action of worms but that the crowns and  furrows last for a very long time when the surface is nearly level  formation and amount of mould over the chalk formationworm castings are often ejected in extraordinary numbers on steep  grasscovered slopes where the chalk comes close to the surface  as my son william observed near winchester and elsewhere  if such  castings are largely washed away during heavy rains it is  difficult to understand at first how any mould can still remain on  our downs as there does not appear any evident means for supplying  the loss  there is moreover another cause of loss namely in  the percolation of the finer particles of earth into the fissures  in the chalk and into the chalk itself  these considerations led  me to doubt for a time whether i had not exaggerated the amount of  fine earth which flows or rolls down grasscovered slopes under the  form of castings and i sought for additional information  in some  places the castings on chalk downs consist largely of calcareous  matter and here the supply is of course unlimited  but in other  places for instance on a part of teg down near winchester the  castings were all black and did not effervesce with acids  the  mould over the chalk was here only from 3 to 4 inches in thickness   so again on the plain near stonehenge the mould apparently free  from calcareous matter averaged rather less than 35 inches in  thickness  why worms should penetrate and bring up chalk in some  places and not in others i do not know  in many districts where the land is nearly level a bed several  feet in thickness of red clay full of unworn flints overlies the  upper chalk  this overlying matter the surface of which has been  converted into mould consists of the undissolved residue from the  chalk  it may be well here to recall the case of the fragments of  chalk buried beneath wormcastings on one of my fields the angles  of which were so completely rounded in the course of 29 years that  the fragments now resembled waterworn pebbles  this must have  been effected by the carbonic acid in the rain and in the ground  by the humusacids and by the corroding power of living roots   why a thick mass of residue has not been left on the chalk  wherever the land is nearly level may perhaps be accounted for by  the percolation of the fine particles into the fissures which are  often present in the chalk and are either open or are filled up  with impure chalk or into the solid chalk itself  that such  percolation occurs can hardly be doubted  my son collected some  powdered and fragmentary chalk beneath the turf near winchester  the former was found by colonel parsons r e to contain 10 per  cent and the fragments 8 per cent of earthy matter  on the  flanks of the escarpment near abinger in surrey some chalk close  beneath a layer of flints 2 inches in thickness and covered by 8  inches of mould yielded a residue of 37 per cent of earthy  matter  on the other hand the upper chalk properly contains as i  was informed by the late david forbes who had made many analyses  only from 1 to 2 per cent of earthy matter and two samples from  pits near my house contained 13 and 06 per cent  i mention these  latter cases because from the thickness of the overlying bed of  red clay with flints i had imagined that the underlying chalk  might here be less pure than elsewhere  the cause of the residue  accumulating more in some places than in others may be attributed  to a layer of argillaceous matter having been left at an early  period on the chalk and this would check the subsequent  percolation of earthy matter into it  from the facts now given we may conclude that castings ejected on  our chalk downs suffer some loss by the percolation of their finer  matter into the chalk  but such impure superficial chalk when  dissolved would leave a larger supply of earthy matter to be added  to the mould than in the case of pure chalk  besides the loss  caused by percolation some fine earth is certainly washed down the  sloping grasscovered surfaces of our downs  the washingdown  process however will be checked in the course of time for  although i do not know how thin a layer of mould suffices to  support worms yet a limit must at last be reached and then their  castings would cease to be ejected or would become scanty  the following cases show that a considerable quantity of fine earth  is washed down  the thickness of the mould was measured at points  12 yards apart across a small valley in the chalk near winchester   the sides sloped gently at first then became inclined at about 20  degrees then more gently to near the bottom which transversely  was almost level and about 50 yards across  in the bottom the  mean thickness of the mould from five measurements was 83 inches  whilst on the sides of the valley where the inclination varied  between 14 degrees and 20 degrees its mean thickness was rather  less than 35 inches  as the turfcovered bottom of the valley  sloped at an angle of only between 2 degrees and 3 degrees it is  probable that most of the 83inch layer of mould had been washed  down from the flanks of the valley and not from the upper part   but as a shepherd said that he had seen water flowing in this  valley after the sudden thawing of snow it is possible that some  earth may have been brought down from the upper part or on the  other hand that some may have been carried further down the  valley  closely similar results with respect to the thickness of  the mould were obtained in a neighbouring valley  st catherines hill near winchester is 327 feet in height and  consists of a steep cone of chalk about 025 of a mile in diameter   the upper part was converted by the romans or as some think by  the ancient britons into an encampment by the excavation of a  deep and broad ditch all round it  most of the chalk removed  during the work was thrown upwards by which a projecting bank was  formed and this effectually prevents wormcastings which are  numerous in parts stones and other objects from being washed or  rolled into the ditch  the mould on the upper and fortified part  of the hill was found to be in most places only from 25 to 35  inches in thickness whereas it had accumulated at the foot of the  embankment above the ditch to a thickness in most places of from 8  to 95 inches  on the embankment itself the mould was only 1 to  15 inch in thickness and within the ditch at the bottom it varied  from 25 to 35 but was in one spot 6 inches in thickness  on the  northwest side of the hill either no embankment had ever been  thrown up above the ditch or it had subsequently been removed so  that here there was nothing to prevent wormcastings earth and  stones being washed into the ditch at the bottom of which the  mould formed a layer from 11 to 22 inches in thickness  it should  however be stated that here and on other parts of the slope the  bed of mould often contained fragments of chalk and flint which had  obviously rolled down at different times from above  the  interstices in the underlying fragmentary chalk were also filled up  with mould  my son examined the surface of this hill to its base in a south west direction  beneath the great ditch where the slope was about  24 degrees the mould was very thin namely from 15 to 25  inches whilst near the base where the slope was only 3 degrees to  4 degrees it increased to between 8 and 9 inches in thickness  we  may therefore conclude that on this artificially modified hill as  well as in the natural valleys of the neighbouring chalk downs  some fine earth probably derived in large part from wormcastings  is washed down and accumulates in the lower parts notwithstanding  the percolation of an unknown quantity into the underlying chalk a  supply of fresh earthy matter being afforded by the dissolution of  the chalk through atmospheric and other agencies    chapter viiconclusion    summary of the part which worms have played in the history of the  worldtheir aid in the disintegration of rocksin the denudation  of the landin the preservation of ancient remainsin the  preparation of the soil for the growth of plantsmental powers of  wormsconclusion  worms have played a more important part in the history of the world  than most persons would at first suppose  in almost all humid  countries they are extraordinarily numerous and for their size  possess great muscular power  in many parts of england a weight of  more than ten tons 10516 kilogrammes of dry earth annually  passes through their bodies and is brought to the surface on each  acre of land so that the whole superficial bed of vegetable mould  passes through their bodies in the course of every few years  from  the collapsing of the old burrows the mould is in constant though  slow movement and the particles composing it are thus rubbed  together  by these means fresh surfaces are continually exposed to  the action of the carbonic acid in the soil and of the humusacids  which appear to be still more efficient in the decomposition of  rocks  the generation of the humusacids is probably hastened  during the digestion of the many halfdecayed leaves which worms  consume  thus the particles of earth forming the superficial  mould are subjected to conditions eminently favourable for their  decomposition and disintegration  moreover the particles of the  softer rocks suffer some amount of mechanical trituration in the  muscular gizzards of worms in which small stones serve as mill stones  the finely levigated castings when brought to the surface in a  moist condition flow during rainy weather down any moderate slope  and the smaller particles are washed far down even a gently  inclined surface  castings when dry often crumble into small  pellets and these are apt to roll down any sloping surface  where  the land is quite level and is covered with herbage and where the  climate is humid so that much dust cannot be blown away it appears  at first sight impossible that there should be any appreciable  amount of subaerial denudation but wormcastings are blown  especially whilst moist and viscid in one uniform direction by the  prevalent winds which are accompanied by rain  by these several  means the superficial mould is prevented from accumulating to a  great thickness and a thick bed of mould checks in many ways the  disintegration of the underlying rocks and fragments of rock  the removal of wormcastings by the above means leads to results  which are far from insignificant  it has been shown that a layer  of earth 02 of an inch in thickness is in many places annually  brought to the surface and if a small part of this amount flows  or rolls or is washed even for a short distance down every  inclined surface or is repeatedly blown in one direction a great  effect will be produced in the course of ages  it was found by  measurements and calculations that on a surface with a mean  inclination of 9 degrees 26 seconds 24 cubic inches of earth  which had been ejected by worms crossed in the course of a year a  horizontal line one yard in length so that 240 cubic inches would  cross a line 100 yards in length  this latter amount in a damp  state would weigh 115 pounds  thus a considerable weight of earth  is continually moving down each side of every valley and will in  time reach its bed  finally this earth will be transported by the  streams flowing in the valleys into the ocean the great receptacle  for all matter denuded from the land  it is known from the amount  of sediment annually delivered into the sea by the mississippi  that its enormous drainagearea must on an average be lowered  00263 of an inch each year and this would suffice in four and  half million years to lower the whole drainagearea to the level of  the seashore  so that if a small fraction of the layer of fine  earth 02 of an inch in thickness which is annually brought to  the surface by worms is carried away a great result cannot fail  to be produced within a period which no geologist considers  extremely long   archaeologists ought to be grateful to worms as they protect and  preserve for an indefinitely long period every object not liable  to decay which is dropped on the surface of the land by burying  it beneath their castings  thus also many elegant and curious  tesselated pavements and other ancient remains have been preserved  though no doubt the worms have in these cases been largely aided by  earth washed and blown from the adjoining land especially when  cultivated  the old tesselated pavements have however often  suffered by having subsided unequally from being unequally  undermined by the worms  even old massive walls may be undermined  and subside and no building is in this respect safe unless the  foundations lie 6 or 7 feet beneath the surface at a depth at  which worms cannot work  it is probable that many monoliths and  some old walls have fallen down from having been undermined by  worms   worms prepare the ground 82 in an excellent manner for the growth  of fibrousrooted plants and for seedlings of all kinds  they  periodically expose the mould to the air and sift it so that no  stones larger than the particles which they can swallow are left in  it  they mingle the whole intimately together like a gardener who  prepares fine soil for his choicest plants  in this state it is  well fitted to retain moisture and to absorb all soluble  substances as well as for the process of nitrification  the bones  of dead animals the harder parts of insects the shells of land molluscs leaves twigs c are before long all buried beneath  the accumulated castings of worms and are thus brought in a more  or less decayed state within reach of the roots of plants  worms  likewise drag an infinite number of dead leaves and other parts of  plants into their burrows partly for the sake of plugging them up  and partly as food  the leaves which are dragged into the burrows as food after being  torn into the finest shreds partially digested and saturated with  the intestinal and urinary secretions are commingled with much  earth  this earth forms the dark coloured rich humus which almost  everywhere covers the surface of the land with a fairly well defined layer or mantle  hensen 83 placed two worms in a vessel  18 inches in diameter which was filled with sand on which fallen  leaves were strewed and these were soon dragged into their burrows  to a depth of 3 inches  after about 6 weeks an almost uniform  layer of sand a centimeter 04 inch in thickness was converted  into humus by having passed through the alimentary canals of these  two worms  it is believed by some persons that wormburrows which  often penetrate the ground almost perpendicularly to a depth of 5  or 6 feet materially aid in its drainage notwithstanding that the  viscid castings piled over the mouths of the burrows prevent or  check the rainwater directly entering them  they allow the air to  penetrate deeply into the ground  they also greatly facilitate the  downward passage of roots of moderate size and these will be  nourished by the humus with which the burrows are lined  many  seeds owe their germination to having been covered by castings and  others buried to a considerable depth beneath accumulated castings  lie dormant until at some future time they are accidentally  uncovered and germinate  worms are poorly provided with senseorgans for they cannot be  said to see although they can just distinguish between light and  darkness they are completely deaf and have only a feeble power of  smell the sense of touch alone is well developed  they can  therefore learn but little about the outside world and it is  surprising that they should exhibit some skill in lining their  burrows with their castings and with leaves and in the case of  some species in piling up their castings into towerlike  constructions  but it is far more surprising that they should  apparently exhibit some degrees of intelligence instead of a mere  blind instinctive impulse in their manner of plugging up the  mouths of their burrows  they act in nearly the same manner as  would a man who had to close a cylindrical tube with different  kinds of leaves petioles triangles of paper c for they  commonly seize such objects by their pointed ends  but with thin  objects a certain number are drawn in by their broader ends  they  do not act in the same unvarying manner in all cases as do most of  the lower animals for instance they do not drag in leaves by  their footstalks unless the basal part of the blade is as narrow  as the apex or narrower than it   when we behold a wide turfcovered expanse we should remember  that its smoothness on which so much of its beauty depends is  mainly due to all the inequalities having been slowly levelled by  worms  it is a marvellous reflection that the whole of the  superficial mould over any such expanse has passed and will again  pass every few years through the bodies of worms  the plough is  one of the most ancient and most valuable of mans

received i mistook the figure 30 for 80   the tenant moreover formerly said that he had marled the field  thirty years before but was now positive that this was done in  1809 that is twentyeight years before the first examination of  the field by my friend  the error as far as the figure 80 is  concerned was corrected in an article by me in the gardeners  chronicle 1844 p 218  43  these pits or pipes are still in process of formation   during the last forty years i have seen or heard of five cases in  which a circular space several feet in diameter suddenly fell in  leaving on the field an open hole with perpendicular sides some  feet in depth  this occurred in one of my own fields whilst it  was being rolled and the hinder quarters of the shaft horse fell  in two or three cartloads of rubbish were required to fill up the  hole  the subsidence occurred where there was a broad depression  as if the surface had fallen in at several former periods  i heard  of a hole which must have been suddenly formed at the bottom of a  small shallow pool where sheep had been washed during many years  and into which a man thus occupied fell to his great terror  the  rainwater over this whole district sinks perpendicularly into the  ground but the chalk is more porous in certain places than in  others  thus the drainage from the overlying clay is directed to  certain points where a greater amount of calcareous matter is  dissolved than elsewhere  even narrow open channels are sometimes  formed in the solid chalk  as the chalk is slowly dissolved over  the whole country but more in some parts than in others the  undissolved residuethat is the overlying mass of red clay with  flintslikewise sinks slowly down and tends to fill up the pipes  or cavities  but the upper part of the red clay holds together  aided probably by the roots of plants for a longer time than the  lower parts and thus forms a roof which sooner or later falls in  as in the above mentioned five cases  the downward movement of the  clay may be compared with that of a glacier but is incomparably  slower and this movement accounts for a singular fact namely  that the much elongated flints which are embedded in the chalk in a  nearly horizontal position are commonly found standing nearly or  quite upright in the red clay  this fact is so common that the  workmen assured me that this was their natural position  i roughly  measured one which stood vertically and it was of the same length  and of the same relative thickness as one of my arms  these  elongated flints must get placed in their upright position on the  same principle that a trunk of a tree left on a glacier assumes a  position parallel to the line of motion  the flints in the clay  which form almost half its bulk are very often broken though not  rolled or abraded and this may he accounted for by their mutual  pressure whilst the whole mass is subsiding  i may add that the  chalk here appears to have been originally covered in parts by a  thin bed of fine sand with some perfectly rounded flint pebbles  probably of tertiary age for such sand often partly fills up the  deeper pits or cavities in the chalk  44  s w

letter june 1838 to sir c  lyell remarks that scotch farmers are afraid of putting lime on  ploughed land until just before it is laid down for pasture from a  belief that it has some tendency to sink  he adds  some years  since in autumn i laid lime on an oatstubble and ploughed it  down thus bringing it into immediate contact with the dead  vegetable matter and securing its thorough mixture through the  means of all the subsequent operations of fallow  in consequence  of the above prejudice i was considered to have committed a great  fault but the result was eminently successful and the practice  was partially followed  by means of mr darwins observations i  think the prejudice will be removed  49  this conclusion which as we shall immediately see is fully  justified is of some little importance as the socalled bench stones which surveyors fix in the ground as a record of their  levels may in time become false standards  my son horace intends  at some future period to

disappearance of flints over wide and nearly level areas from  which the chalk has been removed by subaerial denudation  but the  surface of every flint is coated by an opaque modified layer which  will just yield to a steel point whilst the freshly fractured  translucent surface will not thus yield  the removal by  atmospheric agencies of the outer modified surfaces of freely  exposed flints though no doubt excessively slow together with the  modification travelling inwards will as may be suspected  ultimately lead to their complete disintegration notwithstanding  that they appear to be so extremely durable  69  archives de zoolog exper tom iii 1874 p 409  70  nouvelles archives du museum tom viii 1872 pp  95  131  71  morren in speaking of the earth in the alimentary canals of
