181795	twice told tales                      the vision of the fountain                        by nathaniel hawthorne    at fifteen i became a resident in a country village more than a hundred miles from home  the morning after my arrivala september morning but warm and bright as any in julyi rambled into a wood of oaks with a few walnuttrees intermixed forming the closest shade above my head  the ground was rocky uneven overgrown with bushes and clumps of young saplings and traversed only by cattlepaths  the track which i chanced to follow led me to a crystal spring with a border of grass as freshly green as on may morning and overshadowed by the limb of a great oak one solitary sunbeam found its way down and played like a goldfish in the water  from my childhood i have loved to gaze into a spring  the water filled a circular basin small but deep and set round with stones some of which were covered with slimy moss the others naked and of variegated hue reddish white and brown  the bottom was covered with coarse sand which sparkled in the lonely sunbeam and seemed to illuminate the spring with an unborrowed light  in one spot the gush of the water violently agitated the sand but without obscuring the fountain or breaking the glassiness of its surface  it appeared as if some living creature were about to emergethe naiad of the spring perhapsin the shape of a beautiful young woman with a gown of filmy watermoss a belt of rainbowdrops and a cold pure passionless countenance  how would the beholder shiver pleasantly yet fearfully to see her sitting on one of the stones paddling her white feet in the ripples and throwing up water to sparkle in the sun  wherever she laid her hands on grass and flowers they would immediately be moist as with morning dew  then would she set about her labors like a careful housewife to clear the fountain of withered leaves and bits of slimy wood and old acorns from the oaks above and grains of corn left by cattle in drinking till the bright sand in the bright water were like a treasury of diamonds  but should the intruder approach too near he would find only the drops of a summer shower glistening about the spot where he had seen her  reclining on the border of grass where the dewy goddess should have been i bent forward and a pair of eyes met mine within the watery mirror  they were the reflection of my own  i looked again and lo another face deeper in the fountain than my own image more distinct in all the features yet faint as thought  the vision had the aspect of a fair young girl with locks of paly gold  a mirthful expression laughed in the eyes and dimpled over the whole shadowy countenance till it seemed just what a fountain would be if while dancing merrily into the sunshine it should assume the shape of woman  through the dim rosiness of the cheeks i could see the brown leaves the slimy twigs the acorns and the sparkling sand  the solitary sunbeam was diffused among the golden hair which melted into its faint brightness and became a glory round that head so beautiful  my description can give no idea how suddenly the fountain was thus tenanted and how soon it was left desolate  i breathed and there was the face  i held my breath and it was gone  had it passed away or faded into nothing  i doubted whether it had ever been  my sweet readers what a dreamy and delicious hour did i spend where that vision found and left me  for a long time i sat perfectly still waiting till it should reappear and fearful that the slightest motion or even the flutter of my breath might frighten it away  thus have i often started from a pleasant dream and then kept quiet in hopes to wile it back  deep were my musings as to the race and attributes of that ethereal being  had i created her  was she the daughter of my fancy akin to those strange shapes which peep under the lids of childrens eyes  and did her beauty gladden me for that one moment and then die  or was she a waternymph within the fountain or fairy or woodland goddess peeping over my shoulder or the ghost of some forsaken maid who had drowned herself for love  or in good truth had a lovely girl with a warm heart and lips that would bear pressure stolen softly behind me and thrown her image into the spring  i watched and waited but no vision came again  i departed but with a spell upon me which drew me back that same afternoon to the haunted spring  there was the water gushing the sand sparkling and the sunbeam glimmering  there the vision was not but only a great frog the hermit of that solitude who immediately withdrew his speckled snout and made himself invisible all except a pair of long legs beneath a stone methought he had a devilish look  i could have slain him  thus did the vision leave me and many a doleful day succeeded to the parting moment  by the spring and in the wood and on the hill and through the village at dewy sunrise burning noon and at that magic hour of sunset when she had vanished from my sight i sought her but in vain  weeks came and went months rolled away and she appeared not in them  i imparted my mystery to none but wandered to and fro or sat in solitude like one that had caught a glimpse of heaven and could take no more joy on earth  i withdrew into an inner world where my thoughts lived and breathed and the vision in the midst of them  without intending it i became at once the author and hero of a romance conjuring up rivals imagining events the actions of others and my own and experiencing every change of passion till jealousy and despair had their end in bliss  o had i the burning fancy of my early youth with manhoods colder gift the power of expression your hearts sweet ladies should flutter at my tale  in the middle of january i was summoned home  the day before my departure visiting the spots which had been hallowed by the vision i found that the spring had a frozen bosom and nothing but the snow and a glare of winter sunshine on the hill of the rainbow  let me hope thought i or my heart will be as icy as the fountain and the whole world as desolate as this snowy hill  most of the day was spent in preparing for the journey which was to commence at four oclock the next morning  about an hour after supper when all was in readiness i descended from my chamber to the sittingroom to take leave of the old clergyman and his family with whom i had been an inmate  a gust of wind blew out my lamp as i passed through the entry  according to their invariable custom so pleasant a one when the fire blazes cheerfully the family were sitting in the parlor with no other light than what came from the hearth  as the good clergymans scanty stipend compelled him to use all sorts of economy the foundation of his fires was always a large heap of tan or ground bark which would smoulder away from morning till night with a dull warmth and no flame this evening the heap of tan was newly put on and surmounted with three sticks of redoak full of moisture and a few pieces of dry pine that had not yet kindled  there was no light except the little that came sullenly from two halfburned brands without even glimmering on the andirons  but i knew the position of the old ministers armchair and also where his wife sat with her knittingwork and how to avoid his two daughters one a stout country lass and the other a consumptive girl groping through the gloom i found my own place next to that of the son a learned collegian who had come home to keep school in the village during the winter vacation  i noticed that there was less room than usual tonight between the collegians chair and mine  as people are always taciturn in the dark not a word was said for some time after my entrance  nothing broke the stillness but the regular click of the matrons knittingneedles  at times the fire threw out a brief and dusky gleam which twinkled on the old mans glasses and hovered doubtfully round our circle but was far too faint to portray the individuals who composed it  were we not like ghosts  dreamy as the scene was might it not be a type of the mode in which departed people who had known and loved each other here would hold communion in eternity  we were aware of each others presence not by sight nor sound nor touch but by an inward consciousness  would it not be so among the dead  the silence was interrupted by the consumptive daughter addressing a remark to some one in the circle whom she called rachel  her tremulous and decayed accents were answered by a single word but in a voice that made me start and bend towards the spot whence it had proceeded  had i ever heard that sweet low tone  if not why did it rouse up so many old recollections or mockeries of such the shadows of things familiar yet unknown and fill my mind with confused images of her features who had spoken though buried in the gloom of the parlor  whom had my heart recognized that it throbbed so  i listened to catch her gentle breathing and strove by the intensity of my gaze to picture forth a shape where none was visible  suddenly the dry pine caught the fire blazed up with a ruddy glow and where the darkness had been there was shethe vision of the fountain a spirit of radiance only she had vanished with the rainbow and appeared again in the firelight perhaps to flicker with the blaze and be gone  yet her cheek was rosy and lifelike and her features in the bright warmth of the room were even sweeter and tenderer than my recollection of them  she knew me  the mirthful expression that had laughed in her eyes and dimpled over her countenance when i beheld her faint beauty in the fountain was laughing and dimpling there now  one moment our glance mingledthe next down rolled the heap of tan upon the kindled woodand darkness snatched away that daughter of the light and gave her back to me no more  fair ladies there is nothing more to tell  must the simple mystery be revealed then that rachel was the daughter of the village squire and had left home for a boardingschool the morning after i arrived and returned the day before my departure  if i transformed her to an angel it is what every youthful lover does for his mistress  therein consists the essence of my story  but slight the change sweet maids to make angels of yourselves
