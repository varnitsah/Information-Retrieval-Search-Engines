battlefields of history and have written a story of adventure in australia in the early days when the bush rangers and the natives constituted a real and formidable danger to the settlers i have done this not with the intention of extending your knowledge or even of pointing a moral although the story is not without one but simply for a changea change both for you and myself but frankly more for myself than for you you know the old story of the boy who bothered his brains with euclid until he came to dream regularly that he was an equilateral triangle enclosed in a circle well i feel that unless i break away sometimes from history i shall be haunted day and night by visions of men in armour and soldiers of all ages and times  if when i am away on a holiday i come across the ruins of a castle i find myself at once wondering how it could best have been attacked and defended if i stroll down to the thames i begin to plan schemes of crossing it in the face of an enemy and if matters go on who can say but that i may find myself some day arrested on the charge of surreptitiously entering the tower of london or effecting an escalade of the keep of windsor castle to avoid such a misfortunewhich would entail a total cessation of my stories for a term of yearsi have turned to a new subject which i can only hope that you will find as interesting if not as instructive as the other books which i have written  g a henty    chapter 1 the broken window   you are the most troublesome boy in the village reuben whitney and you will come to a bad end  the words followed a shower of cuts with the cane the speaker was an elderly man the master of the village school of tipping near lewes in sussex and the words were elicited in no small degree by the vexation of the speaker at his inability to wring a cry from the boy whom he was striking he was a lad of some thirteen years of age with a face naturally bright and intelligent but at present quivering with anger  i dont care if i do he said defiantly it wont be my fault but yours and the rest of them  you ought to be ashamed of yourself the master said instead of speaking in that way you who learn easier than anyone here and could always be at the top of your class if you chose i had hoped better things of you reuben but its just the way its your bright boys as mostly gets into mischief  at this moment the door of the school room opened and a lady with two girls one of about fourteen and the other eleven years of age entered  what is the matter now the lady asked seeing the schoolmaster cane in hand and the boy standing before him  reuben whitney what in trouble again reuben i am afraid you are a very troublesome boy  i am not troublesome mam the boy said sturdily that is i wouldnt be if they would let me alone but everything that is done bad they put it down to me  but what have you been doing now reuben  i have done nothing at all mam but hes always down on me and he pointed to the master and when they are always down on a fellow its no use his trying to do right  what has the boy been doing now mr white the lady asked  look there mam at those four windows all smashed and the squire had all the broken panes mended only a fortnight ago  how was it done mr white  by a big stone mam which caught the frame where they joined and smashed them all  i did not do it mrs ellison indeed i didnt  why do you suppose it was reuben mrs ellison asked the master  because i had kept him in half an hour after the others went home to dinner for pinching young jones and making him call out and he had only just gone out of the gate when i heard the smash so there is no doubt about it for all the others must have been in at their dinner at that time  i didnt do it mam the boy repeated directly i got out of the gate i started off to run home i hadnt gone not twenty yards when i heard a smash but i wasnt going for to stop to see what it was it werent no business of mine and thats all i know about it  mamma the younger of the two girls said eagerly what he says is quite true you know you let me run down the village with the jelly for mrs thomsons child and as i was coming down the road i saw a boy come out of the gate of the school and run away and then i heard a noise of broken glass and i saw another boy jump over the hedge opposite and run too he came my way and directly he saw me he ran to a gate and climbed over  do you know who it was kate mrs ellison asked  yes mamma it was tom thorne  is thomas thorne here mrs ellison asked in a loud voice  there was a general turning of the heads of the children to the point where a boy somewhat bigger than the rest had been apparently studying his lessons with great diligence  come here tom thorne mrs ellison said  the boy slouched up with a sullen face  you hear what my daughter says tom what have you to say in reply  i didnt throw the stone at the window the boy replied i chucked it at a sparrow and it werent my fault if it missed him and broke the window  i should say it was your fault tom mrs ellison said sharplyvery much your fault if you throw a great stone at a bird without taking care to see what it may hit but that is nothing to your fault in letting another boy be punished for what you did i shall report the matter to the squire and he will speak to your father about it you are a wicked bad boy  mr white i will speak to you outside  followed by her daughters mrs ellison went out kate giving a little nod in reply to the grateful look that reuben whitney cast towards her and his muttered  thank you miss  walk on my dears mrs ellison said i will overtake you in a minute or two  this will not do mr white she said when she was alone with the master i have told you before that i did not approve of your thrashing so much and now it is proved that you punish without any sufficient cause and upon suspicion only i shall report the case at once to the squire and unless i am greatly mistaken you will have to look out for another place  i am very sorry mrs ellison indeed i am and it is not often i use the cane now if it had been anyone else i might have believed him but reuben whitney is always in mischief  no wonder he is in mischief the lady said severely if he is punished without a hearing for all the misdeeds of others well i shall leave the matter in the squires hands but i am sure he will no more approve than i do of the children being ill treated  reuben whitney was the son of a miller near tipping john whitney had been considered a welltodo man but he had speculated in corn and had got into difficulties and his body was one day found floating in the mill dam no one knew whether it was the result of intention or accident but the jury of his neighbours who sat upon the inquest gave him the benefit of the doubt and brought in a verdict of accidental death he was but tenant of the mill and when all the creditors were satisfied there were only a few pounds remaining for the widow  with these she opened a little shop in tipping with a miscellaneous collection of tinware and cheap ironmongery cottons tapes and small articles of haberdashery with toys sweets and cakes for the children the profits were small but the squire who had known her husband charged but a nominal rent for the cottage and this was more than paid by the fruit trees in the garden which also supplied her with potatoes and vegetables so that she managed to support her boy and herself in tolerable comfort  she herself had been the daughter of a tradesman in lewes and many wondered that she did not return to her father upon her husbands death but her home had not been a comfortable one before her marriage for her father had taken a second wife and she did not get on well with her stepmother she thought therefore that anything would be better than returning with her boy to a home where to the mistress at least she would be most unwelcome  she had as a girl received an education which raised her somewhat above the other villagers of tipping and of an evening she was in the habit of helping reuben with his lessons and trying to correct the broadness of dialect which he picked up from the other boys she was an active and bustling woman managed her little shop well and kept the garden with reubens assistance in excellent order  mrs ellison had at her first arrival in the village three years before done much to give her a good start by ordering that all articles of use for the house in which she dealt should be purchased of her and she highly approved of the energy and independence of the young widow but lately there had been an estrangement between the squires wife and the village shopkeeper mrs ellison whose husband owned all the houses in the village as well as the land surrounding it was accustomed to speak her mind very freely to the wives of the villagers she was kindness itself in cases of illness or distress and her kitchen supplied soups jellies and nourishing food to all who required it but in return mrs ellison expected her lectures on waste untidiness and mismanagement to be listened to with respect and reverence  she was then at once surprised and displeased when two or three months before having spoken sharply to mrs whitney as to the alleged delinquencies of reuben she found herself decidedly though not disrespectfully replied to  the other boys are always set against my reuben mrs whitney said because he is a stranger in the village and has no father and whatever is done they throw it on to him the boy is not a bad boy mamnot in any way a bad boy he may get into mischief like the rest but he is not a bit worse than others not half as bad as some of them and those who have told you that he is havent told you the truth  mrs ellison had not liked it she was not accustomed to be answered except by excuses and apologies and mrs whitneys independent manner of speaking came upon her almost as an act of rebellion in her own kingdom she was too fair however to withdraw her custom from the shop but from that time she had not herself entered it  reuben was a source of anxiety to his mother but this had no reference to his conduct she worried over his future the receipts from the shop were sufficient for their wants and indeed the widow was enabled from time to time to lay by a pound against bad times but she did not see what she was to do with the boy almost all the other lads of the village of the same age were already in the fields and mrs whitney felt that she could not much longer keep him idle the question was what was she to do with him that he should not go into the fields she was fully determined and her great wish was to apprentice him to some trade but as her father had recently died she did not see how she was to set about it  that evening at dinner mrs ellison told the squire of the scene in the school room  white must go he said that is quite evident i have seen for some time that we wanted a younger man more abreast of the times than white is but i dont like turning him adrift altogether he has been here upwards of thirty years what am i to do with him  mrs ellison could make no suggestion but she too disliked the thought of anyone in the village being turned adrift upon the world  the very thing the squire exclaimed suddenly we will make him clerk old peters has long been past his work the old man must be seventyfive if hes a day and his voice quavers so that it makes the boys laugh we will pension him off he can have his cottage rent free and three or four shillings a week i dont suppose it will be for many years as for white he cannot be much above sixty he will fill the place very well  i am sure the vicar will agree for he has been speaking to me about peters being past his work for the last five years what do you say my dear  i think that will do very well william mrs ellison replied and will get over the difficulty altogether  so you see wife for once that boy of widow whitneys was not to blame i told you you took those stories on trust against him too readily the boys a bit of a pickle no doubt and i very near gave him a thrashing myself a fortnight since for on going up to the sevenacre field i found him riding bare backed on that young pony i intended for kate  you dont say so william mrs ellison exclaimed greatly shocked i never heard of such an impudent thing i really wonder you didnt thrash him  well perhaps i should have done so my dear but the fact is i caught sight of him some time before he saw me and he was really sitting her so well that i could not find it in my heart to call out he was really doing me a service the pony had never been ridden and was as wild as a wild goat thomas is too old in fact to break it in and i should have had to get someone to do it and pay him two or three pounds for the job  it was not the first time the boy had been on her back i could see the pony was not quite broken and just as i came on the scene was trying its best to get rid of him but it couldnt do it and i could see by the way he rode her about afterwards that he had got her completely in hand and a very prettygoing little thing she will turn out  but what did you say to him william i am sure i should never stop to think whether he was breaking in the pony or not if i saw him riding it about  i daresay not my dear the squire said laughing but then you see you have never been a boy and i have and can make allowances many a pony and horse have i broken in in my time and have got on the back of more than one without my father knowing anything about it  yes but they were your fathers horses william mrs ellison persisted that makes all the difference  i dont suppose it would have made much difference to me the squire laughed at that time i was too fond of horse flesh even from a boy to be particular whose horse it was i got across however of course after waiting till he had done i gave the young scamp a blowing up  not much of a blowing up i am sure mrs ellison said and as likely as not a shilling at the end of it  well mary i must own the squire said pleasantly that a shilling did find its way out of my pocket into his  its too bad of you william mrs ellison said indignantly here is this boy who is notoriously a scapegrace has the impertinence to ride your horse and you encourage him in his misdeeds by giving him a shilling  well my dear dont you see i saved two pounds nineteen by the transaction  besides he added more seriously i think the boy has been maligned i dont fancy hes a bad lad at all a little mischief and so on but none the worse for that besides you know i knew his father and have sat many a time on horseback chatting to him at the door of his mill and drank more than one glass of good ale which his wife has brought out to me i am not altogether easy in my conscience about them if there had been a subscription got up for the widow at his death i should have put my name down for twenty pounds and all that i have done for her is to take eighteen pence a week off that cottage of theirs  no i called the boy to me when he got off and pretty scared he looked when he saw me when he came up i asked him how he dared to ride my horses about without my leave of course he said he was sorry which meant nothing and he added as a sort of excuse that he used from a child to ride the horses at the mill down to the ford for water and that his father generally had a young one or two in that paddock of his by the mill and he used often to ride them and seeing the pony one day galloping about the field and kicking up its heels he wondered whether he could sit a horse still and especially whether he could keep on that ponys back then he set to to try  the pony flung him several times at first and no wonder as he had no saddle and only a piece of old rope for a bridle but he mastered him at last and he assured me that he had never used the stick and certainly he had not one when i saw him i told him of course that he knew he ought not to have done it but that as he had taken it in hand he might finish it i said that i intended to have it broken in for kate and that he had best get a bit of sacking and put it on sideways to accustom the pony to carry a lady then i gave him a shilling and told him i would give him five more when he could tell me the pony was sufficiently broken and gentle to carry kate  mrs ellison shook her head in disapprobation  it is of no use william my talking to the villagers as to the ways of their boys if that is the way you counteract my advice  but i dont always my dear the squire said blandly for instance i shall go round tomorrow morning with my dog whip to thornes and i shall offer him the choice of giving that boy of his the soundest thrashing he ever had while i stand by to see it or of going out of his house at the end of the quarter  i rather hope he will choose the latter alternative that beer shop of his is the haunt of all the idle fellows in the village i have a strong suspicion that he is in league with the poachers if he doesnt poach himself and the first opportunity i get of laying my finger upon him out he goes  a few days later when kate ellison issued from the gate of the house which lay just at the end of the village with the basket containing some jelly and medicine for a sick child she found reuben whitney awaiting her he touched his cap  please miss i made bold to come here to thank you for having cleared me  but i couldnt help clearing you reuben for you see i knew it wasnt you  well miss it was very kind all the same and i am very much obliged to you  but why do you get into scrapes the girl said if you didnt you wouldnt be suspected of other things mamma said the other day you got into more scrapes than any boy in the village and you look nice too why do you do it  i dont know why i do it miss reuben said shamefacedly i suppose its because i dont go into the fields like most of the other boys and havent got much to do but theres no great harm in them miss they are just larks nothing worse  you dont do really bad things the girl asked  no miss i hope not  and you dont tell stories do you  no miss never if i do anything and i am asked i always own it i wouldnt tell a lie to save myself from a licking  thats right the girl said graciously  she caught somewhat of her mothers manner from going about with her to the cottages and it seemed quite natural to her to give her advice to this village scapegrace  well try not to do these sort of things again reuben because i like you and i dont like to hear people say you are the worst boy in the village and i dont think you are goodbye and kate ellison proceeded on her way  reuben smiled as he looked after her owing to his memory of his former position at the mill and to his mothers talk and teaching reuben did not entertain the same feeling of respect mingled with fear for the squires family which was felt by the village in general instead of being two years younger than himself the girl had spoken as gravely as if she had been twenty years his senior and reuben could not help a smile of amusement  she is a dear little lady he said as he looked after her and its only natural she should talk like her mother but mrs ellison means well too mother says and as for the squire he is a good fellow i expected he would have given it to me the other day  well now i will go up to the pony one more lesson and i think a baby might ride it  as he walked along he met tom thorne there had been war between them since the affair of the broken window reuben had shown the other no animosity on the subject as having been cleared he had felt in no way aggrieved but tom thorne was very sore over it in the first place he had been found out and although reuben himself had said nothing to him respecting his conduct in allowing him to be flogged for the offence which he himself had committed others had not been so reticent and he had had a hard time of it in the village secondly he had been severely thrashed by his father in the presence of the squire the former laying on the lash with a vigour which satisfied mr ellison the heartiness of the thrashing being due not to any indignation at the fault but because the boys conduct had excited the squires anger which thorne for many reasons was anxious to deprecate he was his landlord and had the power to turn him out at a quarters notice and as there was no possibility of obtaining any other house near and he was doing by no means a bad trade he was anxious to keep on good terms with him  tom thorne was sitting on a gate as reuben passed  you think you be a fine fellow reuben but i will be even with you some day  you can be even with me now reuben said if you like to get off that gate  i baint afeared of you reuben dont you go to think it only i aint going to do any fighting now feyther says if i get into any more rows he will pay me out so i cant lick you now but some day i will be even with you  thats a good excuse reuben said scornfully however i dont want to fight if you dont only you keep your tongue to yourself i dont want to say nothing to you if you dont say nothing to me you played me a dirty trick the other day and you got well larrupped for it so i dont owe you any grudge but mind you i dont want any more talk about your getting even with me for if you do give me any more of it i will fetch you one on the nose and then you will have a chance of getting even at once  tom thorne held his tongue only relieving his feelings by making a grimace after reuben as the latter passed on in the various contests among the boys of the village reuben had proved himself so tough an adversary that although tom thorne was heavier and bigger he did not care about entering upon what would be at best a doubtful contest with him  contenting himself therefore with another muttered i will be even with you some day he strolled home to his fathers ale house  the change at the school was very speedily made the squire generally carried out his resolutions while they were hot and on the very day after his conversation with his wife on the subject he went first to the vicar and arranged for the retirement of the clerk and the instalment of white in his place and then went to the school house and informed the master of his intention the latter had been expecting his dismissal since mrs ellison had spoken to him on the previous day and the news which the squire gave him was a relief to him his emoluments as clerk would be smaller than those he received as schoolmaster but while he would not be able to discharge the duties of the latter for very much longer for he felt the boys were getting too much for him he would be able to perform the very easy work entailed by the clerkship for many years to come it was too a position not without dignity and indeed in the eyes of the village the clerk was a personage of far greater importance than the schoolmaster he therefore thankfully accepted the offer and agreed to give up the school as soon as a substitute could be found  in those days anyone was considered good enough for a village schoolmaster and the post was generally filled by men who had failed as tradesmen and in everything else they put their hands to and whose sole qualification for the office was that they were able to read and write instead of advertising however in the county paper the squire wrote to an old college friend who was now in charge of a london parish and asked him to choose a man for the post  i dont want a chap who will cram all sorts of new notions into the heads of the children the squire said i dont think it would do them any good or fit them any better for their stations the boys have got to be farm labourers and the girls to be their wives and if they can read really well and write fairly its about as much as they want in the way of learning but i think that a really earnest sort of man might do them good otherwise a schoolmaster in my mind should be the clergymans best assistant i dont know my dear fellow that i can explain in words more exactly what i mean but i think you will understand me and will send down the sort of man i want  the cottage is a comfortable one theres a good bit of garden attached to it and i dont mind paying a few shillings a week more than i do now to get the sort of man i want if he has a wife so much the better she might teach the girls to sew which would be to nine out of ten a deal more use than reading and writing and if she could use her needle and make up dresses and that sort of thing she might add to their income not one woman in five in the village can make her own clothes and they have to go to a place three miles away to get them done  a week later the squire received an answer from his friend saying that he had chosen a man and his wife whom he thought would suit  the poor fellow was rather a cripple he said he is a wood engraver by trade but he fell downstairs and hurt his back the doctor who attended him at the hospital spoke to me about him he said that he might under favourable circumstances get better in time but that he was delicate and absolutely needed change of air and a country life i have seen him several times and have been much struck with his intelligence he has been much depressed at being forbidden to work but has cheered up greatly since i told him of your offer i have no doubt he will do well  i have selected him not only for that reason but because his wife is as suitable as he is she is an admirable young woman and was a dressmaker before he married her she has supported them both ever since he was hurt months ago she is delighted at the idea of the change for although the money will be very much less than he earned at his trade she has always been afraid of his health giving way and is convinced that fresh air and the garden you speak of will put new life into him  the squire was not quite satisfied with the letter but as he told himself he could not expect to get a man trained specially as a schoolmaster to accept the post and at any rate if the man was not satisfactory his wife was likely to be so he accordingly ordered his groom to take the light cart and drive over to lewes the next day to meet the coach when it came in and to bring over the new schoolmaster his wife and their belongings  mrs ellison at once went down to the village and got a woman to scrub the cottage from top to bottom and put everything tidy the furniture went with the house and had been provided by the squire mrs ellison went over it and ordered a few more things to be sent down from the house to make it more comfortable for a married couple and driving over to lewes ordered a carpet curtains and a few other little comforts for it  james shrewsbury was upon his arrival much pleased with his cottage which contrasted strongly with the room in a crowded street which he had occupied in london and his wife was still more pleased  i am sure we shall be happy and comfortable here james she said and the air feels so fresh and pure that i am convinced you will soon get strong and well again what is money to health i am sure i shall be ten times as happy here as i was when you were earning three or four times as much in london  the squire and mrs ellison came down the next morning at the opening of the school and after a chat with the new schoolmaster and his wife the squire accompanied the former into the school room  look here boys and girls he said mr shrewsbury has come down from london to teach you he has been ill and is not very strong i hope you will give him no trouble and i can tell you it will be the worse for you if you do i am going to look into matters myself and i shall have a report sent me in regularly as to how each of you is getting on with a special remark as to conduct and i can tell you if any of you are troublesome you will find me down at your fathers in no time  the squires words had considerable effect and an unusual quiet reigned in the school after he had left and the new schoolmaster opened a book  they soon found that his method of teaching was very different to that which they were accustomed to there was no shouting or thumping on the desk with the cane no pulling of ears or cuffing of heads everything was explained quietly and clearly and when they went out of the school all agreed that the new master was a great improvement on master white while the master himself reported to his wife that he had got on better than he had expected    chapter 2 the poisoned dog   the boys soon felt that mr shrewsbury really wished to teach them and that he was ready to assist those who wanted to get on in the afternoon the schoolmasters wife started a sewing class for the girls and a week or two after he came the master announced that such of the elder class of boys and girls who chose to come in the evening to his cottage could do so for an hour and that he and the boys would read by turns some amusing book while the girls worked only reuben whitney and two or three others at first availed themselves of the invitation but these spoke so highly of their evening that the number soon increased three quarters of an hour were spent in reading some interesting work of travel or adventure and then the time was occupied in talking over what they had read and in explaining anything which they did not understand and as the evenings were now long and dark the visits to the schoolmaster soon came to be regarded as a privilege and proved an incentive to work to those in the lower classes only those in the first place being admitted to them  reuben worked hard all through the winter and made very rapid progress the schoolmaster seeing how eager he was to get on doing everything in his power to help him forward and lending him books to study at home one morning in the spring the squire looked in at mrs whitneys shop  mrs whitney he said i dont know what you are thinking of doing with that boy of yours mr shrewsbury gives me an excellent account of him and says that he is far and away the cleverest and most studious of the boys i like the lad and owe him a good turn for having broken in that pony for my daughter besides for his fathers sake i should like to help him on now in the first place what are you thinking of doing with him  i am sure i am very much obliged to you mrs whitney said i was thinking when he gets a little older of apprenticing him to some trade but he is not fourteen yet  the best thing you can do mrs whitney let it be some good trade where he can use his witsnot a butcher a baker or a tailor or anything of that sort i should say an upholsterer or a mill wright or some trade where his intelligence can help him on when the time comes i shall be glad to pay his apprentice fees for him and perhaps when you tell me what line he has chosen a word from me to one of the tradesmen in lewes may be a help in the meantime that is not what i have specially come about young finch who looks to my garden is going to leave and if you like your boy can have the place my gardener knows his business thoroughly and the boy can learn under him i will pay him five shillings a week it will break him into work a little and he is getting rather old for the school now i have spoken to shrewsbury and he says that if the boy is disposed to go on studying in the evening he will direct his work and help him on  thank you kindly sir mrs whitney said i think it will just be the thing for a year or so before he is apprenticed he was saying only last night that he was the biggest boy in the school and though i know he likes learning he would like to be helping me and feels somehow that it isnt right that he should be going on schooling while all the other boys at his age are doing something not that i want him to earn money for the shop keeps us both but its what he thinks about it  thats natural enough mrs whitney and anything the boy earns with me you see you can put by and it will come in useful to him some day  reuben was glad when he heard of the arrangement for although as his mother had said he was fond of school he yet felt it as a sort of reproach that while others of his age were earning money he should be doing nothing he accepted the offer of the schoolmaster to continue to work at his studies in the evening and in a week he was installed in tom finchs place  the arrangement was not the squires original idea but that of his younger daughter who felt a sort of proprietary interest in reuben partly because her evidence had cleared him of the accusation of breaking the windows partly because he had broken in the pony for her so when she heard that the boy was leaving she had at once asked her father that reuben should take his place  i think he is a good boy papa she said and if he was clever enough to break in my pony i am sure he will be clever enough to wheel the wheelbarrow and pull weeds  i should think he would lassie her father said laughing although it does not exactly follow still if you guarantee that he is a good boy i will see about it  mamma doesnt think he is a very good boy kate said but you see papa mamma is a woman and perhaps she doesnt understand boys and girls as well as i do i think hes good and he told me he never told stories  the squire laughed  i dont know what your mamma would say to that puss nor whether she would agree that you understand boys and girls better than she does however i will take your opinion this time and give reuben a chance  the subject was not mentioned again in kates hearing but she was greatly pleased one morning at seeing reuben at work in the gardens  good morning reuben she said  good morning miss he replied touching his hat  i am glad you have come in toms place and i hope you will be good and not get into scrapes for i told papa i thought you would not and you see if you do he will turn round and blame me  i will try not to get into scrapes miss kate reuben said i dont do it often you know and i dont think there will be much chance of it here  kate nodded and walked on and reuben went about his work  there was however much more opportunity for getting into scrapes than reuben imagined although the scrapes were not of the kind he had pictured being naturally careless he had not been there a week before in his eagerness to get home to a particularly interesting book he forgot to carry out his orders to shut the cucumber frames and a sharp frost coming on in the night the plants were all killed to the immense indignation of the gardener who reported the fact with a very serious face to the squire  i am afraid that boy will never do squire such carelessness i never did see and them plants was going on beautifully  confound the young rascal the squire said wrathfully for he was fond of cucumbers i will speak to him myself this sort of thing will never do  and accordingly the squire spoke somewhat sharply to reuben who was really sorry for the damage his carelessness had caused and he not only promised the squire that it should not occur again but mentally resolved very firmly that it should not he felt very shamefaced when kate passed him in the garden with a serious shake of her head signifying that she was shocked that he had thus early got into a scrape and discredited her recommendation  the lesson was a useful one henceforth reuben paid closer attention to his work and even the gardener who regarded boys as his great trial in life expressed himself satisfied with him  since that affair of the cucumbers i must own squire he said a month later that he is the best boy i have come across he attends to what i say and remembers it and i find i can trust him to do jobs that i have never been able to trust boys with before he seems to take an interest in it and as he is well spoken and civil he ought to get on and make a good gardener in time  i am glad to hear a good account of him the squire replied he is sharp and intelligent and will make his way in life or i am mistaken his father was an uncommonly clever fellow though he made a mess of it just at the end and i think the boy takes after him  among reubens other duties was that of feeding and attending to the dogs these consisted of two setters a pointer and a large house dog who was chained up at the entrance to the stables reuben was soon excellent friends with the sporting dogs but the watchdog who had probably been teased by reubens predecessor always growled and showed his teeth when he went near him and reuben never dared venture within the length of his chain but pushed the bowl containing his food just within his reach  one day he had been sent on an errand to the stables he forgot the dog and ran close to the kennel the animal at once sprang out reuben made a rush but he was not quick enough and the dog caught him by the leg reuben shouted and the coachman ran out and seizing a fork struck the dog and compelled him to loose his hold  has he bit you badly reuben  well he has bit precious hard reuben replied i think he has nearly taken a piece out of my calf as on pulling up his trousers he showed his leg streaming with blood  put it under the pump lad i will pump on it the coachman said hes a badtempered brute and i wonder the squire keeps it  the brute ought to be killed reuben grumbled angrily i have never teased it or worried it in any way i wish you had stuck that fork into him instead of hitting him with it if you hadnt been within reach he would have taken the bit out of me he will kill somebody some day and it were best to kill him first  the gardener pumped for some time on reubens leg and then going into the kitchen he got some strips of rag from the cook and bound it up  you had best go home now he said i will tell the gardener when he comes round what has happened to you i doubt you will have to lay up for a day or two  as reuben limped home he met tom thorne walking with another boy  hello reuben the latter exclaimed whats come to you yer trousers bee all tore  that brute of a house dog at the squires has had hold of me reuben answered the savage beast has had a try a good many times but this time he got hold and he has bit me pretty sharp  reuben had to keep his leg quiet for three days but the third evening he was well enough to go down the village to the schoolhouse after the lesson was over he walked for some distance up the road for his leg was very stiff and he thought it would be a good thing to try and walk it off as he intended to go to work next morning on getting up early in the morning however he found it was still stiff and sore but he thought he had better go and try to work for a bit  i am glad you are back again the gardener said when he saw him for theres a lot of work on hand but i see you are still lame the coachman tells me it were a nasty bite  its pretty sore still reuben replied and i dont think i can walk about much but i thought i might help in some other way  very well the gardener said there are a lot of plants which want shifting into larger pots you do them and i will take up the fork and dig up that piece of ground i want to put the young lettuces into  reuben worked hard till halfpast eight and then went off to his breakfast on his return he was told the squire wished to speak to him  its about that dog i expect the gardener remarked i suppose you know he were poisoned last night  no i didnt know reuben replied but its a precious good job i wish he had been poisoned before he got his teeth into me  reuben on going round to the back door was shown into the library where the squire was sitting the coachman was with him  now then reuben the squire said i want you to tell me the truth about this matter the coachman told me three days ago that you had been bitten by the yard dog and i made up my mind to get rid of him on the first opportunity but i find he was poisoned yesterday evening  he stopped as if expecting reuben to say something but the boy having nothing to say merely replied  yes sir so the gardener has told me  what do you know about it reuben  i dont know anything about it sir reuben replied opening his eyes  now look here lad the squire said gravely i am disposed to think well of you and although i consider it a serious offence your poisoning the dog i shall consider it very much worse if you deny it  but i didnt poison it sir reuben affirmed i never dreamt of such a thing  the squire set his lips hard together  just tell me your story over again he said to the coachman  well yesterday evening squire i went down into the village to buy some bacca just as i got back to the gate out runs a boy it was too dark for me to see his face but i naturally supposed it were reuben so i said hello reuben hows the leg but the moment i spoke he turned off from the path and ran away  well i thought it was queer but i went on to the stable about a quarter of an hour afterwards and as i was acleaning up the bits i heard wolf howl he kept on at it so i took a lantern and went out to see what was the matter he was rolling about and seemed very bad i stood alooking at him wondering what were best to do when sudden he gave a sort of yell and rolled over and he was dead i thought it was no good telling you about it till this morning and thinking it over and seeing how sudden like it was i come to the pinion as how he had been poisoned and naturally thinking that as he had bit reuben and as how reuben said he ought to be killed and seeing as i had met the boy a quarter an hour afore the dog was took bad it came to me as how he had done it  this morning i knew for certain as the dog had been poisoned for just outside of the reach of his chain there was that piece of paper alying as you have got before you  it was a piece of blue paper about four inches square on which was printed rat poison  you hear that reuben what have you to say the squire asked  i have got nothing to say sir reuben answered except that whoever the boy was it wasnt me and that i know nothing about it  well reuben it will be easy for you to clear yourself by saying where you were at the time  what oclock was it robert that you saw the boy  it was just a quarter past eight squire the quarter struck just as i opened the gate  were you out or at home at that hour reuben  i was out sir i went to the schoolmasters  what time did you leave there  i left at eight sir  then if you got in just after eight it is clear that you were not the boy the squire said if your mother tells me that you were in at five minutes past eight that settles the question as far as you are concerned  i didnt get in till halfpast eight sir reuben said i walked about for a bit after i came out from school to try and get the stiffness out of my leg so as to be able to come to work this morning  was anyone with you reuben is there anyone to say what you did with yourself between eight and halfpast eight  no sir reuben said quietly i didnt speak to a soul and didnt see a soul so far as i know from the time i came out of the gate of the schoolhouse till i got home  does your mother sell packets of this poison the squire said pointing to the paper  reuben looked at the paper  yes sir i believe she does  well my lad the squire said you must acknowledge that the case looks very ugly against you you are known to have borne bad feelings against the dog naturally enough i admit a boy about your size was seen by robert in the dark coming out of the gate and that he was there for no good purpose is proved by the fact that he ran away when spoken to a quarter of an hour later the dog dies of poison that poison you certainly could get at home and by your own admission you were out and about at the time the dog was poisoned the case looks very bad against you  i dont care how bad it looks reuben said passionately it wasnt me squire if that were the last word i ever had to speak  very well the squire said coldly in my mind the evidence is overwhelming against you i have no intention of pursuing the matter further nor will i for your fathers and mothers sake bring public disgrace upon you but of course i shall not retain you here further nor have anything to do with you in the future  without a word reuben turned and left the room had he spoken he would have burst into a passion of tears with a white face he walked through the village and entered his mothers shop  what back again reuben she said i thought your leg was too bad to work  it isnt my leg mother he said in a choking voice the squire has dismissed me he says i have poisoned his dog  says you poisoned his dog reuben whatever put such an idea into his head  the coachman saw a boy coming out of the yard at a quarter past eight last night it was too dark for him to say for certain but he thought it was me a quarter of an hour later the dog died of poison and this morning they picked up a cover of one of those rat powders you sell i couldnt say where i was at a quarter past eight when the coachman saw the boy for as you know mother i told you i had walked out a bit after i came out from the school to get the stiffness out of my leg so altogether the squire has made up his mind tis me and so he has sent me away  reuben had summed up the points against himself in a broken voice and now broke into a passion of tears his mother tried in vain to pacify him but indeed her own indignation at her boy being charged with such a thing was so great that she could do little to console him  its shameful she exclaimed over and over again i call it downright wicked of the squire to suspect you of such a thing  well mother it does look very bad against me reuben said wiping his eyes at last and i dont know as the squire is so much to be blamed for suspecting me i know and you know that it wasnt me but theres no reason why the squire should know it somebody has poisoned his dog and that somebody is a boy he knows that i was unfriendly with the dog so putting things together i dont see as he could help suspecting me and only my word the other way it seems to me as if somebody must have done it to get me in a row for i dont know that the dog had bit anyone else if it is anyone i expect its tom thorne he has never been friends with me since that affair of the school window  i will go at once and speak to his father mrs whitney said taking down her bonnet from the wall  no mother you cant do that reuben exclaimed we have got nothing against him the squire has ten times as good reason to suspect me as i have to suspect tom thorne so as we know the squires wrong its ten times as likely we shall be wrong besides if he did it of course he would deny it he is the worst liar in the village and then folks would say i wasnt satisfied with doing it myself but i wanted to throw the blame on to him just as he did on me before no it wont do mother  mrs whitney saw that it wouldnt do and sat down again reuben sat thinking for some time  i must go away mother he said at last i cant stop here every one in the village will get to know of it and they will point at me as the boy as poisoned the squires dog and then lied about it i couldnt stand that mother  and you shant stand it my boy mrs whitney said not a day i will give up the cottage and move into lewes at once i didnt go there before for i am known there and dont like folk to see how much i have come down in the world  no mother you stop here and i will go up to london they say there is lots of work there and i suppose i can get on as well as another  i will not hear of your doing such a thing i should never expect to hear of you again i should always be thinking that you had got run over or were starving in the streets or dying in a workhouse no reuben my plans best its just silliness my not liking to settle in lewes for of course its better going where one is known and i should be lost in a strange place no i daresay i shall find a cottage there and i shall manage to get a living somehowperhaps open a little shop like this and then you can be apprenticed and live at home  an hour later mrs ellison called reuben had gone upstairs to lie down for his leg was very painful mrs whitney did not give her visitor time to begin  i know what you have called about mrs ellison and i dont want to talk about it with you the squire has grievously wronged my boy i wouldnt have believed it of him but hes done it so now mam i give a weeks notice of this house and heres my rent up to that time and i will send you the key when i go and now mam as i dont want any words about it i think it will be better if you go at once  mrs ellison hesitated a moment never from the time she entered the village as the squires wife had she been thus spoken to but she saw at once in mrs whitneys face that it were better not to reply to her and that her authority as the squires wife had for once altogether vanished she therefore took up the money which mrs whitney had laid on the counter and without a word left the shop  i do believe william she said as greatly ruffled and indignant she gave an account of the interview to the squire that the woman would have slapped my face if i had said anything she is the most insolent creature i ever met  well my dear the squire said seriously i can hardly wonder at the poor womans indignation she has had a hard time of it and this must be a sad blow naturally she believes in her sons innocence and we must not altogether blame her if she resents his dismissal its a sad business altogether and i know it will be a worry and trouble to me for months mind i dont doubt that the boy did it it does not seem possible that it should be otherwise still it is not absolutely proved and upon my word i wish now i had said nothing at all about it i like the boy and i liked his father before him and as this story must get about it cannot but do him serious damage altogether it is a most tiresome business and i would give a hundred pounds if it hadnt taken place  i really do not see why you should worry about it william the boy has always been a troublesome boy and perhaps this lesson may do him good  the squire did not attempt to argue the question he felt really annoyed and put out and after wandering over the ground and stables he went down to the schoolhouse after the children had been dismissed  have you heard shrewsbury about that boy whitney  no sir i have heard nothing about him the schoolmaster said he was here yesterday evening as usual his leg is no worse i hope those dog bites are always nasty things  i wish it had been worse the squire said testily then he would have been laid up quietly at home instead of being about mischief  why what has he done sir the schoolmaster asked in surprise  the squire related the history of the dogs death and of his interview with reuben the schoolmaster looked serious and grieved  what do you think of the matter shrewsbury the squire asked when he had finished  i would rather not give any opinion the schoolmaster replied quietly  that means you think i am wrong the squire said quickly well say it out man you wont offend me i am half inclined to think i was wrong myself and i would as lief be told so as not  i dont say you are wrong sir the schoolmaster said except that i think you assumed the boys guilt too much as a matter of course now i have seen a great deal of him i have a great liking for him and believe him to be not only a singularly intelligent and hardworking lad but a perfectly truthful and open one i allow that the circumstances are much against him but the evidence is to my mind completely overbalanced by his absolute denial you must remember that he saw that you were quite convinced of his guilt and that in your eyes his denial would be an aggravation of the offence therefore you see he had no strong motive for telling a lie  who killed your dog i do not know but from my knowledge of his character and assurance of his truthfulness i am perfectly convinced that reuben whitney did not do it the boy is in some ways very superior to the other lads i teach i hear that his father was in a good position as a miller and his mother is of a different class altogether to the other women of the village the boy has a certain refinement about him a thoughtfulness and consideration which set him apart from the others mischievous and somewhat inclined to be noisy as he generally is on days when i have not felt quite equal to my work he would notice it at once and without saying a word would by his quietness and attention to his work try to save me trouble and i have heard him try to quiet the others as they trooped out the boy has a good heart as well as a good intellect and nothing save his own confession would make me believe that he poisoned your dog  but he said he wished it was killed the squire urged as in defence of his own opinion  he said so squire at the time he was smarting with the pain of a severe bite and i think probably he meant no more than a man who under the same circumstances would say confound the dog or even a stronger oath  mr ellison was silenced for when in wrath he was himself given to use strong expressions  i dont know what to say shrewsbury he said at last i am afraid i have made a mess of it but certainly as i first heard it the case seemed to admit of no doubt pon my word i dont know what to do my wife has just been up to see mrs whitney and the woman blazed out at her and wouldnt let her say a word but gave notice that she should give up the house at the end of the week if it hadnt been for that i might have done something but mrs ellison was very much aggrieved at her manner altogether its one of the most annoying things i ever had to do with  in the evening the schoolmaster put on his hat and went up with his wife to mrs whitney the women had seen a good deal of each other as they both stood somewhat apart from the rest of the village and in thought and speech differed widely from the labourers wives and on evenings when the sewing class did not meet the schoolmasters wife often went up for an hour or two to mrs whitneys or the latter came down to the shrewsburys cottage  we have come up mrs whitney the schoolmaster said as they entered to tell you how sorry we are to hear that you are going to leave and that we are still more sorry for the cause of course neither my wife nor myself believe for a moment that reuben poisoned the squires dog the idea is preposterous i told the squire as much today  mrs whitney burst into tears she had kept up all day sustained partly by indignation and partly by the desire that reuben should not see that she felt it but the thought that all the village would believe reuben guilty had cut her to the heart and she had felt so unwilling to face anyone that as soon as mrs ellison had left she had closed the shutters of her little shop but she broke down now from her relief at hearing that someone besides herself believed the boy to be innocent  i dont know what i shall do without you mrs whitney mrs shrewsbury said when the widow recovered her composure i shall miss you dreadfully is it quite settled that you will go  quite settled mrs shrewsbury i wouldnt stop in the squires house for an hour longer than i could help after his believing reuben to be guilty of poisoning his dog and not believing the boy when he said he had nothing to do with it he ought to have known my boy better than that and he coming up only the other day and pretending he felt a kindness for my dead husband  i think the squire was too hasty mrs whitney the schoolmaster said but you see he did not know reuben as we do and i think if you will excuse my saying so you have been a little hasty too the squire came in to me to tell me about it and i could see he was not satisfied in his mind even before i gave him my positive opinion that reuben was innocent and i do think that if you had not given mrs ellison notice so sharply the squire would have taken back his words and said that at any rate as there was nothing absolutely proved he would hold his judgment in suspense until the matter was cleared up  and having everyone pointing the finger at my boy in the meantime no thank you mr shrewsbury that would not do for me i was not a bit hasty mrs ellison came in here prepared to talk to me about reubens wickedness i saw it in her face so i wouldnt let her open her lips if she had i should have given her a piece of my mind that she wouldnt have forgot in a hurry  i can quite understand your feelings mrs whitney the schoolmaster said and i have no doubt i should have acted as you did if a son of mine had been suspected in the same way still i think its a pity for if reuben had stayed here there would have been more chance of the matter being cleared up however we wont talk about that now now tell me what are your plans  mrs whitney told her visitors what she had determined upon as lewes was only four miles off the schoolmaster said that he and his wife would sometimes come over to see her and that he hoped that reuben whatever trade he was apprenticed to would still go on with his studies he would give him any advice or assistance in his power  the next day mrs whitney and reuben moved with all their belongings to lewes    chapter 3 the burglary at the squires   what is that woman whitney going to do with her boy the squire asked the schoolmaster when he happened to meet him in the village about a month after she had left have you heard  nothing is settled yet sir my wife had a letter from her two or three days ago saying that she had been disappointed in getting penfold the mill wright to take him he wanted fifty pounds premium and she could only afford to pay twenty so she is looking out for something else you have heard nothing more that would throw any light on that affair squire  no and dont suppose i ever shall have you any opinion about it  my opinion is that of reuben himself the schoolmaster said he believes that someone did it who had a grudge against him on purpose to throw suspicion on him  who should have a grudge against him the squire asked  well squire there was one boy in the village who had rightly or wrongly a grudge against reuben that is tom thorne reuben has not a shadow of evidence that it was this boy but the lad has certainly been his enemy ever since that affair of breaking the windows of the school just before i came here thorne you know did it but allowed reuben to be punished for the offence and the truth would never have been known had it not been as i heard that your daughter happened to see the stone thrown since that time there has been bad blood between the boys i do not for a moment say that thorne poisoned your dog still the boys are near enough of a size for one to be mistaken for the other in the dark and thorne knew that reuben had been bitten by the dog for reuben spoke to another boy about it that afternoon while thorne was standing by of course this is but the vaguest suspicion still if you ask my opinion i should say that i consider from what i have heard of the character of tom thorne that he would be much more likely to poison the dog in order to get reuben into disgrace than reuben would be to do so out of revenge because the dog had bitten him  the squire took off his hat and passed his hands through his hair in perplexity  i dont know what to think shrewsbury he said it may be as you say i look upon thorne as the worst character in the village and likely enough his son may take after him that ale house of his is the resort of all the idle fellows about i have strong reason to believe he is in alliance with the poachers the first time i get a chance out he goes i have only been waiting for some time for an opportunity i cant very well turn him out of his house without some excuse  what did you say was the name of the mill wright at lewes mrs whitney was wanting to get her son with  the schoolmaster repeated the name which the squire jotted down in a notebook  look here shrewsbury he said dont you mention to mrs whitney that you spoke to me about this matter do you understand  i understand sir the schoolmaster said  and he was not surprised when a few days afterwards his wife received a letter from mrs whitney saying that mr penfold had come in to say that he had changed his mind and that he would take reuben as his apprentice for twenty pounds adding to her surprise that he should give him half a crown a week for the first year and gradually raise his pay as he considered that boys ought to be able to earn a little money for themselves  reuben therefore was going to work on the following week the half a crown a week which he was to earn was an important matter for his mother for although she had found a cottage and opened a little shop as before her receipts were extremely small and she had already begun to fear that she should be obliged to make another move lewes being too well supplied with shops for a small concern like hers to flourish the half crown a week however would pay her rent and she expected that she should make at any rate enough to provide food for herself and reuben  mrs whitney had hoped that although lewes was but four miles from the village the story about the dog would not travel so far for it was not often that anyone from the village went over to the town in this however she was mistaken for a week after reuben had gone to work the foreman went to his master and said  i dont know whether you are aware mr penfold about that new boy but i hear that he had to leave tipping where he was employed by squire ellison for poisoning the squires dog  how did you hear it mr penfold asked  william jenkins heard it from a man named thorne who belongs to the village and whom he met at a public house yesterday  william jenkins had best not spend so much time in public houses mr penfold said shortly i heard the story before i saw the boy and from what i hear i believe he was wrongfully accused just tell jenkins that and say that if i hear of him or any of the hands throwing the thing up in the boys face i will dismiss them instantly  and so reuben did not know till long after that the story of the killing of the dog was known to anyone at lewes  for three years he worked in mr penfolds yard giving much satisfaction to his employer by his steadiness and handiness he continued his studies of an evening under the advice of his former master who came over with his wife three or four times each year to spend a day with mrs whitney reuben was now receiving ten shillings a week and although the receipts of the shop failed he and his mother were able to live in considerable comfort  one day about three years after coming to lewes he was returning to work after dinner when as he passed a carriage standing in front of one of the shops he heard his name pronounced and the colour flushed to his cheek as looking up he saw kate ellison timidly he touched his cap and would have hurried on but the girl called to him  stop a minute reuben i want to speak to you i am glad i have met you i have looked for you every time i have come to lewes i wanted to tell you that i am sure you did not kill wolf i know you wouldnt have done it besides you know you told me that you never told stories so when i heard that you said you didnt i was quite sure about it  thank you miss reuben said gratefully i did not kill the dog i should never have thought of such a thing though every one seemed against me  not every one reuben i didnt think so and papa has told me since that he did not think so and that he was afraid that he had made a mistake  i am glad to hear that miss reuben said the squire had been very kind to me and it has always grieved me very much that he should think me capable of such a thing i felt angry at the time but i have not felt angry since i have thought it over quietly for the case seems so strong against me that i dont see how the squire could have thought otherwise  thank you miss i shant forget your kindness and reuben went on with a light heart just as mrs ellison and her elder daughter came out from the shop  who were you speaking to kate she asked as she took her seat in the carriage  i was talking to reuben whitney mamma he was passing so i called him to tell him that i did not believe he had killed wolf  then it was very improper behaviour on your part kate her mother said angrily for she had never quite recovered from the shock mrs whitney had given to her dignity you know my opinion on the subject i have told you before that it is one i do not care to have discussed and that i consider it very improper for a girl of your age to hold opinions different to those of your elders i have no doubt whatever that boy poisoned the dog i must beg of you that you will never speak to him again  kate leaned back in the carriage with a little sigh she could not understand why her mother who was so kind to all the village people should be so implacable on this subject but kate who was now between fourteen and fifteen knew that when her mother had taken up certain opinions they were not to be shaken and that her father himself always avoided argument on points on which he differed from her talking alone with his daughter the squire had in answer to her sturdy assertion of reubens innocence owned to her that he himself had his doubts on the subject and that he was sorry he had dismissed the boy from his service but she had never heard him do more than utter a protest against reubens guilt being held as being absolutely proved when her mother spoke of his delinquency  but kate was not one to desert a protege and having been the means of reubens introduction to her fathers she had always regarded herself as his natural protector and mrs ellison would not have been pleased had she known that her daughter had seldom met the schoolmaster without inquiring if he had heard how reuben was getting on she had even asked mr shrewsbury to assure him of her belief in his innocence which had been done but she had resolved that should she ever meet him she would herself tell him so even at the risk of her mothers displeasure  another year passed reuben was now seventeen and was a tall powerfullybuilt young fellow during these four years he had never been over to tipping in the daytime but had occasionally walked over after dark to visit the shrewsburys always going on special invitation when he knew that no one else would be there the thornes no longer occupied the little public house tom thorne had a year before been captured with two other poachers in the squires woods and had had six months hard labour and his father had at once been ejected from his house and had disappeared from that part of the country reuben was glad that they had left for he had long before heard that thorne had spread the story in lewes of the poisoning of the dog he felt however with their departure all chance of his ever being righted in that matter was at an end  one evening in winter when reuben had done his work he said to his mother  i shall go over and see mr shrewsbury tonight i have not been over for some time and as it is not his night for a class i am pretty sure not to find anyone there i told him when i was there last that i would take over a few tools and fix up those shelves for him  i dont suppose he will stay very much longer at tipping his health is completely restored now and even his wife admits that he could work at his own business again he has already been doing a little for some of the houses he worked for in town so as to get his connection back again i expect every time i see him to hear that he has made up his mind to go he would have done it two years back but his wife and the two little ones are so well that he did not like the thought of taking them up to london till he was sure that his health was strong enough to stand steady work i shall miss them very much he has been a good friend indeed to me  he has indeed mrs whitney said i think anyhow reuben you would have got on at your trade but you would never have been what you are now if it hadnt been for him your poor father would be proud of you if he could see you and i am sure that when you take off that workmans suit and put on your sunday clothes you look as well as if the mill had never gone wrong and you had been brought up as he intended you to be mrs tyler was saying only the other day that you looked quite the gentleman and lots of people have said the same  nonsense mother reuben answered there is nothing of the gentleman about me of course people say things that they think will please you knowing that you regard me as a sort of wonder i hope i shall make my way some day and the fact that i have had a better education than most young fellows in my position of life of course may make some little difference and will i hope help me to mount the ladder when once i put my foot upon it  but although no doubt mrs whitney was a partial judge her opinion as to her son was not an incorrect one for with his intelligent face and quiet selfassured bearing he looked very much more like a gentleman than many young fellows in a far better position in life  the stars were shining brightly when he started at seven oclock in the evening and he walked with a brisk step until he arrived within half a mile of the village as he passed by the end of a lane which ran into the road he heard a horse impatiently pawing the ground the sound being followed by a savage oath to the animal to stand quiet reuben walked on a few steps and then paused the lane as he knew only led to some fields a short distance away what could a horse be doing there and who could be the man who spoke to it there had lately been several burglaries on lonely houses in that part of the country and the general belief was that these had been perpetrated by men from london  i daresay its nothing reuben said to himself still it is certainly curious and at any rate there can be no harm in having a look  walking upon the grass at the side of the road he retraced his steps to the end of the lane and then stood and listened he heard a murmur of voices and determined to follow the matter up he walked quietly down the lane after going about a hundred yards he saw something dark in the road and approaching it very cautiously found that it was a horse harnessed to a gig as he was standing wondering what to do next he started for the silence was broken by some voices near him  it was a stupid thing to get here so early and to have to wait about for four hours in this ditch  it was the best plan though another voice replied the trap might have been noticed if we had been driving about the roads after dark while in the daylight no one would give it a second thought  thats right enough the first speaker said but its precious cold here hand me that flask again i am blest if the wind does not come through the hedge like a knife  the voices came from the other side of the hedge on the opposite side of the lane reuben crossed noiselessly there was a gate just where the cart had stopped and the men had evidently got over it to obtain the shelter of the hedge from the wind reuben felt the gate which was old and rickety then cautiously he placed his feet on the lower bar and leaned forward so as to look round the hedge  what time are the others to be here tom  they said they would be here at nine oclock we passed them about six miles on the road so they ought to be here to time  i suppose theres no doubt about this here being a good business  i will answer for that the other said i dont suppose as theres much money in the house but theres no end of silver plate and their watches and plenty of sparklers i have heard say as theres no one in the county as has more jewels than the squires wife  you know the house well dont you  i never was inside the other said but i have heard enough from them that has to know where the rooms lie the plate chest is in the butlers pantry and as we are going to get in by the kitchen window we are safe to be able to clear that out without being heard i shall go on directly the others come and chuck this meat to the dogsthat will silence them i know the way there for i tried that on once before  reuben had thought that the voice was familiar to him and the words gave him the cluethe speaker was tom thorneand he and those with him were going to commit a burglary at the squires he was hesitating whether to make off at once to warn the squire of what was intended or to listen and learn a little more of their plan when suddenly a light shone behind him and a voice exclaimed with an oath  who have we here  he leapt down and was in the act of turning round to defend himself when a heavy blow with a cudgel struck him on the head and felled him insensible to the ground while he had been listening to the conversation two men had come quietly up the lane walking on the grass as he had done and their footsteps had been unheard by him for the horse continued at times impatiently to paw the ground the sound of their comrades voices had told them where they were sitting and turning on a bullseye lantern to show them the gate they had seen reuben leaning over it in the act of listening  when reuben recovered consciousness he found that he was lying in the ditch his hands tightly bound to his sides and a handkerchief stuffed into his mouth the four men were gathered close by talking in low tones  i aint going to give up the job now we come so far to do it one said with an oath besides its not only the swag but the grudge i owe the squire if i am ready to go on i suppose you neednt be afraid besides he dont know us  best cut his throat and a done with it a voice which reuben recognized as that of his old enemy said i owe him one and it will be safest to stop his mouth  no no a third voice protested i aint going to have nothing to do with cutting throats i dont mind running the risk of botany bay but i aint going to run the chance of being scragged but lets move a bit away from here while we settle it you hit him pretty hard but he will be coming round presently i thought at first that you had killed him but hes bleeding too free for that  the men moved some little distance away and for some time reuben could hear a murmured talk but could make out nothing of what had been said it was he judged a quarter of an hour before the conversation ceased they did not return to him but remained at some distance off and reuben thought that he heard the footsteps of one of them going down the lane he could feel by a warm sensation across his cheek that the blood was flowing freely from the wound he had received on his temple a dull torpid feeling came over him and after a time he again lost consciousness  how long he remained in this state he did not know but he was at last aroused by being lifted and thrown into the bottom of the cart four men then climbed up into it and the horse was started they drove at a quick pace and reuben wondered why they were taking him away with them his head ached terribly and he suffered much from the tightness of the cords which bound his arms the men seemed in high good humour and talked and laughed in low tones but the noise of the vehicle prevented reuben hearing what was said  it was as far as he could judge full two hours before the vehicle stopped he was roughly taken out of the cart his arms were unbound and the men leaping up drove away at full speed the spot where he had been left was very dark for trees overshadowed it on both sides where he was he had no idea but he judged that he must be fully twenty miles from the village  his first impulse was to take the handkerchief from his mouth and he then walked slowly along the road in the direction from which he had come it was he felt sure no use shouting for they would have been certain to have selected some lonely spot to set him down and there would be no chance of awakening the inhabitants of any distant cottage he walked slowly for he was faint with loss of blood  after proceeding about a quarter of a mile he emerged from the wood and came upon a spot where the road forked having no clue whatever as to the direction in which lewes lay he sat down upon a heap of stones and waited patiently for morning he had no doubt that the burglary had been a successful one and he bitterly regretted his neglect to keep a watch down the lane to see that he was not surprised by the men he had heard were coming at any rate he hoped that he should be able to give such information as would set the constables upon the track  it seemed to him that some three hours passed before a faint light began to dawn in the sky by this he knew that it must be about halfpast six and calculated therefore he must have set out in the trap about halfpast one he now started to walk along the road hoping that he should soon meet some labourer going to work stopping by a small stream which ran across the road he washed his head and face as he had lain on the ground after being struck the blood had not flowed on to his clothes  after the wash he proceeded with a brisker step half an hour later he met a ploughman riding one of his team to the fields  is this the road to lewes reuben asked  lewes noa this baint the road to lewes i dont know nothing about the road to lewes this bee the road to hastings if you goes further so they tell me i aint never been there  is there a village anywhere about here reuben asked  ay half a mile or so on  reuben walked on till he got to the village and then going to a public house obtained some refreshment and learned from the landlord the direction he should take to get to the main road leading to lewes which was as he expected some twenty miles away he found that the cart had not followed the main road towards london but had driven by crossroads for a considerable distance before turning north  it was late in the afternoon before reuben arrived at lewes for he had been obliged to rest often by the way and had made but slow progress when within a few doors of his mothers house one of the constables of the town came up to him and touched him on the shoulder  i arrest you in the kings name  arrest me what for reuben exclaimed  for breaking into the house of squire ellison of tipping thats what its for  reuben laughed  you have got the wrong man this time i have no more to do with the burglary than a child  its no laughing matter the constable said if you are innocent you have got to prove it that aint no business of mine all i have got to do is to arrest you  so saying and before reuben knew what he was about he slipped a pair of handcuffs over his wrists reuben flushed up hitherto he had scarcely taken the matter seriously but to be marched handcuffed through the streets of lewes was an indignity which enraged him  take these off he said angrily i will go quietly with you  you may or you may not the man said doggedly you are younger than i am and maybe can run faster i aint agoing to chance it  reuben saw that it was of no use to argue and silent and pale he walked along by the side of the constable who retained a tight hold of his collar a little crowd gathered speedily round for such a sight was unusual in lewes and reuben felt thankful when they reached the cells and he was sheltered from the gaze of the public a minute later the head constable came in  now my lad dont say anything to criminate yourself he began the less you talk the better for you i am sorry to see you here for i knew your father and i have a good character of you from your employer so i give you my advicekeep your mouth shut  but i am not going to keep my mouth shut reuben said indignantly here am i arrested in the public streets marched handcuffed through the town upon a most monstrous charge which has been brought against me without a shadow of evidence  dont be talking dont be talking the constable said testily you will hear the evidence in time enough  but i will talk i want to tell you whats happened and you will see that i am innocent at once  very well if you will you will but mind dont blame me afterwards  reuben told the story of his adventures from the time of leaving  there he said when he finished isnt that enough to show that i am innocent  no the chief constable said gravely its not enough to prove anything one way or the other i am bound to say the story looks a likely one and if it werent for two or three matters which i heard of from the constable who came over from tipping i should have no doubt about it however all that is for the magistrate to decide there will be a meeting tomorrow  but cant i be taken before a magistrate at once theres captain fidler within a mile  what would be the good the chief constable said you dont suppose anyone would let you out only on the strength of the story you have told me he could only remand you and you could gain nothing by it  can i see my mother reuben asked next  yes the constable said i will send her down a message at once  mrs whitney soon came up a neighbour had brought her in the news when reuben had been arrested and she was on the point of starting to inquire about it when the message arrived she was more indignant than grieved when she heard the charge which had been brought against reuben  the idea of such a thing she exclaimed these constables dont seem to have natural sense the idea of charging anyone who is known as a respectable young man with such a thing as that and shutting him up without a question why there cant be any evidence against you  theres no saying mother reuben replied you mustnt be too sure of that dont you remember that affair of the dog well the same hand is at work now before i only suspected who had done it but i am sure now however whatever evidence they may have got we know it isnt true i have four years good character here to speak for me still it is hard that i should get into positions of this sort without any fault of mine  its better that it is without any fault of yours reuben  that is right enough mother so we will both keep up our spirits    chapter 4 the trial   there were three magistrates on the bench on the following morning when reuben was brought up the justice room was crowded for the series of burglaries had caused some excitement and the news that the house of mr ellison had been broken into and that one of the men who had been taken turned out to belong to lewes had created quite a sensation  mr ellison was the first to give his evidence he testified that on waking on the previous morning he found that someone had been in his room during the night he was not in the habit of locking his door and had not been awakened he found that a box which stood on the dressing table containing some valuable jewelry was gone that his watch and that of mrs ellison had been taken that the drawers had been opened and a case containing the more valuable jewels of his wife had also been abstracted this was not discovered till afterwards he first missed his watch  he rang the servants up for it was still early and it was then discovered that the lower premises had been broken into the plate chest in the butlers pantry broken open and a large quantity of plate stolen  what do you estimate the value of the articles stolen mr ellison  the value of my wifes jewels i should put down roughly at two thousand pounds the silver plate might have been worth three hundred more the watches and other articles so far as i yet miss them say another hundred  the servants proved that they found the kitchen window open on going downstairs it had been opened by the catch being forced back it was not the custom to put up shutters the pantry door which was a strong one had been cut with a saw round the lock the butler testified to the plate having been safe the night before and the strong chest in which it was kept having been forced open  directly it was discovered the constable of the village was placed in charge of the room with orders to admit no one and a man on horseback was sent off to lewes to the chief constable the village constable gave evidence as to the state of the place when he was put in charge  the constable who had been sent over from lewes then stepped into the witness box he testified to the marks of entry of the thieves and said that the manner in which they had gone to work and in which the door had been sawn through and the chest forced open seemed to show that it was the work of practised hands on examining closely the butlers pantry he found a powerful screwdriver and a heavy chisel these corresponded to marks in the lid and had evidently been used for the purpose of forcing it open they had the initials r w burnt in the handles the inmates of the house all denied any knowledge of these tools  mr ellison had been present when he showed them to mrs ellison on looking at them she said at once  r w why that must be reuben whitney that wicked boy again  upon making inquiries he found that the man named worked at mr penfolds the mill wright at lewes he returned there at once and going to mr penfold found the prisoner was absent from work the men identified the brand on the tools as that of the prisoner another constable proved the arrest  the chief constable then read the statement that the prisoner had made to him the magistrates conferred together for a few minutes in an undertone  mrs ellison the senior of them said addressing that lady who was sitting on a chair placed at the upper end of the court we are sorry to trouble you but we must ask you to go into the witness box  i wish to ask you he went on when she had taken her stand in the box how it was you at once connected the initials with the prisoner  because he had at one time lived in the village and was employed assisting our gardener he was discharged on suspicion of having poisoned a watchdog which had bit him and as the three dogs about the place had all been poisoned on the night when the house was broken into his name had been in my mind and on seeing the initials i naturally recognized them at once  there was a deep silence in the court when mrs ellison gave her evidence hitherto the impression had been rather favourable to the prisoner his story though strange had been by no means impossible and if true would have completely accounted for the finding of the tools which were the only evidence against him the evidence of mrs ellison however entirely altered the complexion of the case  reuben had stood quiet and composed during the hearing his countenance had evinced no surprise or emotion when the tools were produced he had indeed upon thinking the matter over before coming into court come to the conclusion that the tools which he had in a small basket at the time he was attacked had been found in or near the house having been left there purposely by tom thorne in order to throw suspicion upon him their production therefore was no surprise to him  a slight shade had passed over his face when mrs ellison entered the witness box glancing at the squire as she gave her evidence reuben saw that mr ellison looked greatly vexed and annoyed as before at the conclusion of the evidence of each witness reuben was asked if he had any question to put he hesitated for a moment and then as before replied in the negative  again the magistrates consulted together  mr ellison we shall be obliged if you will enter the witness box again in your former evidence mr ellison you said nothing in any way relating to the prisoner but it now seems you had a previous acquaintance with him will you tell the court what it is  i have not much to say the squire said as a boy he lived in the village with his mother a most respectable person and widow of jacob whitney a miller in a good way of business who as it may be in your memory was found drowned in his mill pond some seven or eight years ago the widow being in reduced circumstances settled in tipping the boy was an intelligent lad and when the boy employed in my garden left i gave him the place  he gave every satisfaction one day he was severely bitten by the watchdog and three days later the dog was found poisoned my gardener saw a boy running away from the spot a quarter of an hour before the dog died he believed it to be the prisoner but it was too dark for him to distinguish the features  at the time i certainly suspected that he had been guilty of poisoning the dog and in spite of his denying that he had anything to do with it as he was unable to account for where he was at the time the boy was seen i discharged him i wish to say publicly that i have deeply regretted having done so ever since and that i consider i acted hastily and wrongly in so doing considering his previous good character i ought not to have assumed his guilt without more positive evidence than i had before me i may also say that the schoolmaster of our village will give the prisoner the highest character for truthfulness and he has known him ever since his present employer mr penfold is also i believe ready to testify to his excellent conduct during his four years of apprenticeship  i suppose mr ellison the senior magistrate said you have not at any time since the poisoning of the dog obtained any actual evidence which would show that you were mistaken in your first view and that your subsequent change of opinion was due solely to your general view of the boys character so far as you knew it  that is so the squire assented and no further question being asked he resumed his seat his evidence had caused surprise and some little amusement in court it was clear that there was a strong difference of opinion between him and his wife on the subject and that while the lady had something like an animus against the prisoner the squire was strongly impressed in his favour after some consultation the magistrate said  the case will be remanded until this day week to see if further evidence is forthcoming but i may say that under the present circumstances of the case we shall feel ourselves obliged to send it for trial the prisoners account of his proceedings from the time he left lewes on the previous evening up to that of his return and arrest here may be true but so far it is entirely unsupported on the other hand we have the evidence of the tools admitted to belong to him being found on the scene of the burglary we have the further important fact that he had been formerly employed upon the place and had it may be supposed some knowledge of the premises he had been discharged upon a suspicion rightfully or wrongly entertained of his having poisoned a dog belonging to mr ellison and there is reason for the belief that the dogs poisoned before the burglary were got at by some one acquainted with the place  will it be any use my calling evidence as to character at the next meeting reuben asked  no the magistrate said evidence of that kind will be useful at the trial when the matter will be thoroughly sifted we only have to decide that there is prima facie evidence connecting you with the offence and of that there can be no doubt  at the sitting a week later no fresh evidence was produced and reuben was committed for trial at the next assizes public opinion in lewes ran high on the subject of reubens guilt or innocence the other workmen at the mill wrights were strongly in his favourhe was very popular among his fellowsand they pointed out that several hands must have been concerned in the business that he was never seen about in public houses of an evening or was likely to have any connection with bad characters was it probable if he had gone about such a job as that he would have taken tools marked with his own initials or if he had that he would have been fool enough to leave them behind  upon the other hand opinion in general ran strongly against him his story was declared to be utterly improbable and a fellow who had once been dismissed for poisoning a dog would be likely at any future time to revenge himself upon the employer who turned him off as to mr ellisons declaration of his subsequent opinion that he acted hastily little weight was attached to it everyone knew squire ellison was a kindhearted man and as he acknowledged himself that he had obtained no evidence which would satisfy him that he had acted wrongly in the first case it was clear that it was from mere kindness of heart that he had changed his mind on the subject  at tipping the subject was never mentioned the squire and mrs ellison had on the drive home had the most serious quarrel which had ever taken place during their wedded life which had ended by the former saying  if anyone had ever told me before mary that you were a vindictive woman i should have knocked him down i might do so now but i should know in my heart that he had spoken truly for some reason or other you took a prejudice against that boy and you never forgave his mother for standing up in his defence i was shocked downright shocked when you gave your evidence in court  mrs ellison had been too much offended to reply and the rest of the drive had been passed in silence upon their return home the girls were full of eager questions but the squire said shortly  my dears the less we talk about it the better your mother and i differ entirely on the subject she believes that reuben whitney is guilty i am absolutely convinced he is innocent therefore if you please we will not discuss it  the following morning kate ellison went down to the school house  mr shrewsbury she said putting her head in at the door could you come out for two or three minutes i want particularly to speak to you  have you heard what took place yesterday at lewes she asked when he came out  yes miss ellison i saw jones the constable last night and he told me all that had been said in court  and you think reuben whitney is innocent she asked eagerly  i am quite sure of it miss ellisonas sure as i am of my own existence for anyone who knows him to have a doubt is absolutely absurd a finer young fellow than reuben it would be hard to find  but what did he say how did he account for his tools being found there  the schoolmaster repeated the account reuben had given and said  when the trial comes off i shall of course go over and testify both as to his general conduct and to the fact that he had as he said promised to bring over his tools to put up some shelves in my cupboards  do you think he will get off mr shrewsbury she asked anxiously  i should hope so miss ellison but i cant disguise from myself that it is by no means certain that unfortunate old business about the dog will tell terribly against him and though i am perfectly sure that his account of what took place is correct there is nothing to confirm it it is just the sort of story they will say that he would naturally get up to account for his absence and for the tools being found of course if the jury knew him as well as i do the result would be certain but i have been trying to look at the facts as if he were a stranger and i cant say what decision i should come to in such a case still of course the high character that will be given him and the fact that there is no evidence whatever connecting him in any way with bad characters must count immensely in his favour  the assizes were to take place only a fortnight after the date of reubens committal mrs whitney had engaged a lawyer in the town to defend her son and to the surprise of this gentleman mr ellison called upon him two or three days later and said  mr brogden i hear that you have been engaged by mrs whitney to defend her son i dont believe the young fellow is guilty and therefore i authorize you to spend any sum that may be necessary in getting up his defence and i wish you to instruct a counsel to appear for him of course i cannot appear openly in the matter and my name must not be mentioned but i will guarantee all expenses  it seems to me that it would be desirable to find out if possible the village where he says he breakfasted and asked the way to lewes in his story he says he didnt know the name of the village but as he was told it was about twenty miles from lewes and he can describe the road he followed there ought to be no difficulty in finding it  i should advise you to have a chat with shrewsbury the schoolmaster at tipping he is a great friend of the lads and a very intelligent fellow he may be able to suggest some points to be followed up at any rate do all you can  reuben had another adherent who was also acting on his behalf the afternoon before the trial kate ellison stopped before the blacksmith shop in the village and seeing that jacob priestley the smith was at work alone she entered  is it true jacob that you have been summoned on the jury at lewes tomorrow  yes miss it bee true sureley it be four years since anyone in the village was summoned and it be mighty hard that they should have picked upon me still i have never been called before so i suppose i mustnt grumble but it be hard to be taken away from work to waste ones time in a court and they say the sizes ull last for three days  well jacob you know that reuben whitney is going to be tried for robbery at our house  yes miss so they says  well what do you think about it jacob  i dont think nothing one way or the other miss most folks says as how he must have done it cause as how he poisoned squires dog afore  he didnt do anything of the sort jacob and its very wicked of people to say so he is innocent quite innocent i am sure he is and papa is quite sure too and he will be terribly put out if he is found guilty so i want you to promise me that whatever the others think you will hold out that he is innocent  well miss the smith said scratching his head if you be sure of it and squire be sure i suppose there cant be no doubt about it for who should know better than squire and i am sure i wouldnt go to put him about for a better landlord than squire aint to be found in the county so you tell him miss as i will hold out  but papa doesnt know that i have come down here jacob it wouldnt do for him to interfere you know especially as he is a magistrate himself you mustnt mention to anyone that i have spoken to you about itnot to anyone jacob not even to your wifebut i can tell you the squire will be heartily pleased if he is found innocent and he will be terribly put out if he is found guilty  all right miss the smith replied i understand and no one shant know as you have spoken to me aboot it it be quite enough for i to know as the squire knows as hes innocent it aint likely as i should stick my opinion up against his  the day after he heard of reubens arrest the schoolmaster went over to see him and as he was the bearer of a letter from mr ellison to the governor of the jail he was able to obtain admittance  was there ever such an unfortunate fellow as i am reuben exclaimed after the first hearty greeting here am i for the second time accused of a crime of which i am innocent and from which indeed in the present case i am a sufferer and all this has come about simply because i went out of my way to inquire into what seemed to me a suspicious business  tell me all about it reuben i have heard the statement you made to the chief constable but tell it me again with every detail you can think of some circumstance which appears to you as trifling may furnish a clue  i have seen mr brogden the lawyer i have told him all that happened reuben said but of course i will gladly tell you again  and reuben repeated the story of the adventure with every detail that he could think of speaking slowly as the schoolmaster wrote it down at length  i will see what i can make of it when i think it over mr shrewsbury said of course as it stands it is so natural and probable that it would clear you at once had it not been for that unfortunate dog business before and the supposition excited by it that you had a feeling of hostility to the squire i shall be able partly to dispose of that for i can swear that you have frequently spoken to me of the squire in tones of respect and liking and that although you regretted the manner in which you left his service you felt no ill will against him on account of it moreover i shall be able to prove that the reasons you gave for having your tools with you was a true one and although i cannot swear that i expected you specially on that evening the fact that you were in the habit of coming over at times to see me cannot but corroborate your story  i shall get leave for two or three days and will hunt up the village where you breakfasted  thank you very much reuben said though i have been thinking it over and do not see that the evidence of the people at the public house would help me much it will simply prove that i passed through there in the morning but will not show in any way whether i went willingly as far as that as one of the party who broke into the house or whether i was taken there  they can probably prove that you looked pale and exhausted the schoolmaster said  i fancy i should look pale in any case reuben said if i had gone through such a nights work as that of breaking into the squires  well keep up your courage reuben you may be quite sure that your friends will do all in their power for you i shall go now and have a chat with your mother i am afraid that she will want comforting more than you do  yes reuben agreed i am afraid so somehow i dont seem to take it to heart much i shall feel it more afterwards perhaps but at present the whole thing seems so extraordinary that i cant quite realize that i am in danger of being sent to botany bay the worst of it is that even if i am acquitted lots of people will still think i am guilty there is only one thing that can really prove my innocence and that is the arrest of tom thorne and his father  i hear the schoolmaster said that the chief constable has written up to bow street for them to put the runners on the traces of those two scoundrels whether they believe your story or not it is quite evident that more than one person was concerned in the affair their theory of course is that you quarrelled with the others over the division of the spoil and got that knock on the head which is a very severe one i went down yesterday with jones to see the spot where you said you were assaulted there were marks where the horse stopped and marks of feet in the field and a patch of blood all of which goes to prove that your story may be true but unfortunately it doesnt prove that it was because according to the theory against you you might have been assaulted after the robbery as well as before it  but in that case reuben said why should they have taken the trouble to carry me twenty miles away  yes there is of course that question the schoolmaster said thoughtfully but then on the other hand why did they take the trouble in case you were not an accomplice in both cases the answer is the samethey did it to prevent your giving the alarm until they had got far away from the scene they didnt like to murder you because of the consequences to themselves but they would not risk your recovering consciousness and getting up an early pursuit it cuts both ways you see  so it does reuben assented its just a question of belief and i own myself that that old dog business is very much against me and that i cant blame anyone who considers me guilty  reubens was the last case taken at the assizes and occasioned a good deal of interest in that part of sussex partly owing to the position of squire ellison partly to the nature of the defence set up as to which opinion was a good deal divided the evidence for the prosecution was to a great extent similar to that given at the inquiry before the magistrates unfortunately for reuben the judge was notoriously a severe one and his bias from the first appeared to be against the prisoner mr ellison was closely questioned by the prosecutor as to the poisoning of his dog as this was considered to show a particular animus on the part of reuben he again repeated his conviction of reubens innocence in that affair  but what reason have you mr ellison the counsel for the prosecution asked blandly for changing your opinion on the subject  this was just the question which the squire could not answer satisfactorily and was a particularly irritating one because it had often been triumphantly asked by his wife  i can really give no particular reason he said except that on reflection the boys previous character and antecedents convinced me that he could not have done such an act  in fact the counsel said suavely you were influenced by your own goodness of heart mr ellison in thus laying aside a conviction which the facts had at the time forced upon you  i dont look upon it in that light the squire replied shortly i consider that in the first instance i acted hastily and unadvisedly and on consideration i saw that i had done so  i am afraid mr ellison the counsel said that you will not persuade the jury to agree with you  i have only one or two questions to ask you the counsel for the defence said when he rose to crossexamine for indeed your evidence is as i think the jury will agree altogether in favour of the prisoner in the first place was the lad when in your employment ever upstairs in your house  not that i know of the squire replied certainly in the course of his duties he would never be there indeed it would be very seldom that he would even enter the kitchen except to bring in vegetables certainly he would never pass through to go upstairs he could not possibly have done so without exciting attention and remarks  he would therefore mr ellison have no means of possessing any knowledge as to the internal arrangements of your house beyond that possessed by the other people in the village  none whatever mr ellison replied  now as to that unfortunate affair of the poisoning of your dog your opinion as to the innocence of the prisoner in that matter is not a recent onenot the outcome of his after good conduct and character  not at all mr ellison said i changed my opinion on the matter very shortly indeed after the affair  within a few days i think i may say the counsel asked  within a very few days i may almost say within a few hours the squire replied the boys story told not to me but to another that he believed the dog was poisoned by another lad in the village who owed him a grudge and who has since turned out an exceedingly bad character struck me as being very much more probable than that he should do it himself  mrs ellison was next called her evidence as to the robbery was a mere repetition of that given by the squire the counsel then turned to the question of the poisoning  i would rather say nothing about it mrs ellison said it is a matter which has been productive of much pain to me and i would rather say nothing about it  but you must madam the judge said sharply you are here to answer any question which may enable the jury to form an opinion on this case  i am sorry to press you mrs ellison the counsel continued but i really must do so you took a different opinion to that held by your husband  i regret to say that i did mr ellison told me the reasons he had for suspecting the boy i thought those reasons sufficient and have seen no cause for changing my opinion  after the evidence for the prosecution had been given the counsel for the defence pointed out that there was in fact no evidence whatever connecting reuben with the robbery beyond the discovery of his tools on the premises and that as to this trumpery story of the poisoning a dog four years before apparently only for the purpose of showing some sort of animus he regarded it as altogether contemptible when a man meant to commit a burglary in a house he did so in order to obtain possession of the goods and not from any spite against the owner had this young fellow felt any malice for this ridiculous charge on which he had been dismissed he would not have allied himself with burglars to rob the house but would probably have vented his spite in the usual fashion by setting fire to a stack or outhouse but so far as he could see there was no foundation for the charge brought against him and they had already heard mr ellison declare that he regretted he had suspected him and that he believed him to be innocent  but even had it been proved up to the hilt that the prisoner had poisoned the dog he should still hold it as wholly unconnected with the present matter if he had poisoned the dog what then it was not a heinous sin nor would it affect his moral character no boy likes having a piece taken out of his calf by a savage dog and there would have been nothing so very dreadful had he revenged himself it was probable that even among the jury there was one or more who if he had not absolutely set poison for his neighbours cats for destroying his young chickens or scratching up his flower beds had threatened to do so and would not have regarded it as a very serious crime had he done so  therefore he contended that the jury should put this trumpery affair altogether out of their minds on the double ground that in the first place the prisoner at the bar did not poison the dog and that had he done so it would have had nothing whatever to do with the present affair  why gentlemen he said it is an insult to your understanding to ask you to credit that this young fellowwhose character which i shall presently prove to you by unimpeachable evidence is of the highest kindhas for four years cherished such malice against his employer for dismissing him mistakenly that he has become the consort of thieves and burglars has stained his hands in crime and rendered himself liable to transportation for the purpose merely of spiting that gentleman such a contention would be absolutely absurd i must beg you to dismiss it altogether from your mind and approach it from a different standpoint altogether divested of this extraneous business the matter is a most simple one  the prisoner left his mothers cottage at seven oclock in the evening to go over for an hour or two to his friend mr shrewsbury the schoolmaster of tipping he took with him a few tools as he had promised to put some shelves in his friends house on the way he heard some talking down a lane which he knew led to only a field thinking it strange he went to see who it was and some distance down he found a horse and cart standing and listening to the conversation of two men who were sitting under the hedge he heard enough to inform him that a burglary was intended upon the house of mr ellison he was about to make off to give the alarm when he was suddenly attacked by some men who had come up behind and was felled to the ground while lying insensible he was bound hand and foot and left in a ditch where he remained till the burglars returned from completing the work on hand they then threw him into the cart and put him down some twenty miles away being greatly exhausted by loss of blood it was late in the afternoon before he arrived at lewes when he was at once arrested  this gentlemen is the prisoners story as related to the chief constable when he was taken to the lockup nothing can be simpler or more probable and in some points at least i shall be able to confirm it by independent testimony mr shrewsbury will tell you that the prisoner had arranged to come over to see him and bring his tools he will also tell you that two days after the prisoners arrest he went with jones the village constable and found the marks where the horse and trap had stood while just inside the field the grass was trampled with feet and in the bottom of the dry ditch was a great dark patch which he was able to ascertain to be blood doctor hewitt will tell you that he was called in to strap up the prisoners head after his arrest and that the cut was a very severe one and must have been inflicted by a heavy weapon with great force  i am convinced gentlemen that after hearing this evidence you will agree with me not only that the prisoner is perfectly innocent of the charge but that he is a most illused person and that it is a matter of surprise and regret that the magistrates should have committed him for trial when the only shadow of evidence against him was the discovery of these tools a discovery which he at once explained of other evidence there is not one jot or tittle no attempt has been made to prove that the prisoner was in the habit of consorting with bad characters no attempt has been made to show any connection whatever between him and the men who came in a horse and trap across the hills for the purpose of effecting a burglary at mr ellisons and who as we know did effect it no scrap of the property stolen from the house has been found upon him and in order to account for the severe wound on his head the counsel for the prosecution has started the hypothesis that it was given in the course of a quarrel during the division of the plunder  but had that been the case gentlemen the prisoner would not have been standing here alone robbed and illtreated by these companions of his he would naturally have put the officers of justice on their track and as he must have been in communication with them and well acquainted with their ways and haunts he could have given information which would have led to their early arrest he could well have done this for the crown would have made no difficulty whatever in promising a lad like this a free pardon on condition of his turning evidence against these burglars whose mode of procedure shows them to have been old hands and who are no doubt the same who have committed the various robberies which have lately taken place in this part of the country  the prisoner is the son of highly respectable parents his employer will come before you and give you evidence of the extremely high character he bears mr shrewsbury will tell you that he has for the last four years devoted no inconsiderable portion of his leisure time to improve his education and enable him to recover the position occupied by his father who was a muchrespected miller in this neighbourhood i shall leave the case in your hands gentlemen with an absolute confidence that you will without a moments hesitation find a verdict proclaiming the innocence of my client and enable him to leave the dock without a stain upon his character    chapter 5 not guilty   the schoolmaster was the first witness called for the defence after stating that although no evening was actually settled for his coming over he expected the prisoner one evening that week and that he had promised to bring his tools over to do a little job of carpentering he also detailed his visit to the lane and the result of his observation there and then gave reuben the highest character saying that he had known him for five years and that he had an absolute confidence in his integrity and honesty  he has from the first he said proved a most intelligent and hardworking boy anxious to improve himself and to get on in the world he has learnt all that i could teach him and more he is one of the last persons in the world whom i should consider capable of the crime with which he is charged as to his having any animosity to mr ellison i can swear that on many different occasions he has expressed his high opinion of him and has declared that it was quite natural that with the evidence before him he should have thought him guilty of poisoning the dog  the keeper of the wayside public house where he had breakfasted proved that he was struck with the prisoners appearance when he entered that he was very pale and seemed scarcely able to walk he had asked him the nearest way to lewes and had inquired whether there was any chance of getting a lift as he was anxious to get back as soon as possible  mr penfold was the next witness he said that the prisoner had been apprenticed to him four years previously that his general conduct had been most excellent and that he was remarkably quick and intelligent and was an excellent workman during the time that he had been employed he had never lost a day  at the time he was apprenticed to you mr penfold reubens counsel asked were you aware that the lad had been summarily discharged by mr ellison  i was aware of that fact mr penfold answered and reuben with surprise looked at his employer  from whom did you hear of it  i heard of it from mr ellison himself who called upon me about the matter  how was it he came to call upon you mr penfold  the prisoners mother had applied to me about apprenticing her son i had asked 50 pounds premium and said that it wasnt my custom to pay any wages for the first year she said she could only afford pounds and i thought that was an end of the matter until a few days later mr ellison called upon me and said that he had heard from the schoolmaster in his village who was a friend of the boys mother how matters stood and that her application had fallen through owing to her being unable to find more than 20 pounds  i said that this was so mr ellison then said that he was prepared to make up the deficiency that he had a regard for the boys father and that moreover he himself had through a hasty misconception regarding the poisoning of the dog discharged the lad from his service and that he felt uneasy in his mind at having been guilty of a piece of injustice over and above the 30 pounds he gave me six pound ten in order that i might pay the boy half a crown a week for the first year which he said would be a matter of consequence to his mother he requested me on no account to let mrs whitney know that he had intervened in the matter but to represent that i changed my mind and was willing to take the 20 pounds she offered as a premium he was particularly anxious on this point because he said she would certainly refuse to accept assistance from him owing to that unfortunate affair about the dog  i may say that from that time to this i have not mentioned the fact to anyone and the sum of 20 pounds was inserted in the indenture of apprenticeship  there was a little movement of applause in the court as mr penfold gave his evidence and reuben looked gratefully towards mr ellison and said heartily  i thank you sir with all my heart  the foreman of the yard was next examined he confirmed the high character mr penfold had given reuben and adding that he knew the lad never entered a public house but spent his evenings almost entirely at home studying for that he himself had many times called in and had upon every occasion found him so employed  the counsel for the prosecution then addressed the jury and threw discredit upon reubens narrative which he said was unsupported in any material particular that he met the rest of the party in the lane was likely enough he may have returned there with them after the burglary and probably it was there that in a quarrel over the spoil he received the blow of which you have heard  my learned friend has told you to dismiss from your mind the question about that poisoning of the dog four years ago but it is impossible for you to do so you have heard that the dog was poisoned and that the evidence was so strong that his employer at once dismissed him it is true that mr ellison has told you that he afterwards changed his mind on the subject but after the evidence which mr penfold has given of the kindness of that gentlemans heart you will readily understand that no great stress can be laid upon this the matter so far from being trivial as my friend represents it is highly important inasmuch as here we find that again the dogs have been poisoned just as on the first occasion it is clear that burglars from london would be ignorant of the whereabouts of the kennels and were not likely to have come down provided with a store of poisoned meat had they not known from persons well acquainted with the place of the steps that would have to be taken before an entry could be effected into the house you will therefore see the extreme importance of this point  i am perfectly ready to admit that the evidence is of a wholly circumstantial nature but from the nature of the case it is necessary that this should be so had mrs or mr ellison awoke when the thieves entered their room it is probable that much more evidence would be forthcoming it is however for you to weigh the probabilities of the case you have to consider whether the theory which i have laid before you as to the connection of the prisoner with this affair or this wild story which he tells you is the most probable  the judge then summed up with a strong bias against reuben he told them that evidence for character was of course of importance but that it must not be relied upon too far the prisoner appeared undoubtedly to be intelligent and wellconducted but unfortunately his experience told him that many criminals were men of unusual intelligence stress had been laid by the counsel for the defence upon the fact that the prisoner was not known at any time to have consorted with suspicious characters but this after all was only negative evidence affairs of this sort were always conducted with secrecy and had one of these men come down from london as was probable enough to make inquiries as to houses which could be broken into with a prospect of good booty he would naturally not make himself conspicuous  they had heard the two stories and must judge for themselves but he agreed with the counsel for the prosecution that the fact that the prisoner had been discharged by mr ellison for poisoning a dog and that on the night of the robbery other dogs were found poisoned and that probably by some one acquainted with the locality could not but have an influence upon their minds at the same time he would tell them that if they had a doubt in their minds it was their duty to give the prisoner the benefit of that doubt  the jury consulted together for a minute or two in the jury box and then expressed their desire to retire a buzz of talk arose in the court when they had left opinion was divided as to what the verdict would be when the counsel for the defence sat down the general opinion was that the prisoner would be certainly acquitted but the speech of the counsel for the prosecution and the summing up of the judge had caused a reaction and few doubted now that the verdict would be guilty  so reuben himself thought it was he felt hard that standing there to be tried for burglary the decision should in fact depend upon that unjust charge which had four years ago been brought against him reuben was in the habit of what he called arguing things out by himself and as he stood there waiting for the verdict he tried to put himself in the position of the jury and he felt that in that case he should have difficulty in coming to a decision  it was not until after the lamps had been lighted that the jury returned into the box the crier shouted for order and there was not a sound heard as the foreman told the judge that they were not agreed upon their verdict  then you must go back gentlemen until you are the judge said  we are eleven one way and one the other wont that do my lord  no sir the judge replied you must be unanimous  the jury again retired the judge and counsel went off to dine at the hotel and almost all the public trooped out two hours later as the jury did not return reuben whitney was taken back to the jail and the court closed at nine oclock in the morning a warder entered  the jury have come back into the court he said they are going to return a verdict  reuben was again placed in the dock the seats open to the public quickly filled as the news spread through the town several of the members of the bar dropped in and then the judge came in and took his seat  reuben had occupied the time in trying to judge from the faces of the jury what their verdict was going to be they looked sulky and tired but as reubens eye rested on jacob priestley whom he had at once recognized among the jury the smith gave him an encouraging wink at least so reuben thought but as the next moment he was looking as surly as the rest he thought that he must have been mistaken  are you agreed gentlemen as to the verdict you find in this case the judge asked  we are my lord the foreman replied  do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty  not guilty my lord  very well gentlemen the judge said tartly it is your verdict not mine  at the foremans word a thrill had run through the court for when it was known the evening before that eleven were one way and one the other the belief had been general that the majority were for a conviction reuben himself had so understood it and the verdict was a complete surprise to him  illustration reuben whitney acquitted of the charge of burglary  the constable raised the bar for him to leave the dock and as he moved out his friend the schoolmaster pushed forward and shook him warmly by the hand  thank god for that verdict reuben i am indeed rejoiced and i own i hardly expected it  i didnt expect it at all reuben said in a choked voice for his sudden liberation had shaken him more than his arrest or any of the subsequent proceedings had done  i congratulate you heartily reuben mr ellison said putting his hand on his shoulder  the squire had waited at lewes until ten oclock on the previous evening and had driven over again the first thing in the morning so anxious was he about the verdict  i didnt believe you guilty this time my boy from the first i was glad indeed to hear the verdict for after the judges summing up i was sorely uneasy  and now reuben i hope he said as they entered the street that you have quite forgiven me for that old business it has been the unfortunate cause of getting you into this affair had it not been for that no one would ever for a moment have doubted the truth of your story  there is nothing to forgive squire reuben said i never blamed you for it from the first and even had i done so your goodness of which i only heard yesterday would have made up many times for any mistake you may have made then  that is right my lad the squire said i am glad that matter is made up and now i will not keep you for i know you will want to be off home to your mother  reuben walked quietly home so as to give the schoolmaster who had hurried on ahead time to break the news of his acquittal to his mother mrs whitney had remained in court during the trial but had retired when the jury left to consider their verdict being completely overcome with agitation and excitement the schoolmaster had slept in the house and had persuaded her not to go to the court in the morning fearing as he did that the verdict would be a hostile one she completely broke down when she was told the news and was still sobbing when reuben arrived  the schoolmaster at once took his leave leaving mother and son together and promised them to return in a day or two when he again came over he saw at once that mrs whitney was looking depressed and unhappy  what do you think mr shrewsbury reuben says that he shall go abroad out to australia i have talked against it till i am hoarse but its no good i hope you will persuade him to give up such a mad idea  i will hear what he has to say first mrs whitney reuben has generally a good deal to say for his side of a question and i must hear his reasons before i can argue against them  now reuben what have you to say for yourself  i made up my mind while i was in jail reuben replied that if i was acquitted i would go right away these things stick to a man all through his life that first affair four years ago nearly got me transported now and if a small matter like that did me such harm what will this do if i had been proved to be innocent it would have been different but as it is i believe nine people out of ten in court thought i was guilty and i am convinced that the jury were eleven to one against me only the twelfth was more obstinate than they were and so they gave in i believe it was jacob priestley the blacksmith who held out for the sake of old times  at any rate a great many people will think me guilty all their lives unless something turns up to prove my innocence mother says we might settle somewhere else where we aint known but i should never feel safe years on someone from lewes might see me and tell the story or tom thorne might keep on my track i wont risk it  i have been to mr penfold and he says if i am determined to go he will cancel my indenture for me i have no doubt i shall find work of some sort out there i am a pretty good workman now at my own craft and if i cant get work at that i can turn my hand to something else  my only trouble is about mother i want her to go with me i could make a living for her out there but she wont have it she says six months at sea will kill her and then she has all sorts of ideas in her head about the natives however i hope that in two or three years time i shall be able to write and tell her that i have comfortably settled and have a good home ready for her to come to and that then she will join me  never mrs whitney said excitedly i was born at lewes and i have lived near it all my days and i will die here i am not going to tramp all over the world and settle down among black people in outlandish parts i could not do it mr shrewsbury its cruel of him to ask me  the schoolmaster was silent for a minute he saw that reubens mind was firmly made up and he could not deny the force of his reasoning it was true that many people still considered him guilty it was true that this story might crop up again years on and ruin his life it did seem that the best thing he could do was to leave the country  australia is not so bad a place as you fancy mrs whitney he said at last they do have troubles with the natives certainly in the outlying settlements but in the towns you have no more trouble than you have here besides every year the white population is increasing and the black diminishing six months voyage is not so dreadful as it seems and though i do think that if reuben goes out it will be better for you to remain quietly here till he has a home prepared for you i think that when the time comes you will change your mind about it  as to reuben himself i must own theres a good deal of force in what he says and that until those thornes have been sent out of the country his story might follow him and i have no doubt he would do well out there he is a good workman for his age and as he says can turn his hand to almost anything labour is scarce out there and as he has got his head screwed on the right way i have no doubt that he will fall on his feet  i didnt expect this of you mr shrewsbury mrs whitney said beginning to cry i thought you would have taken my part and now you are going right against me  not against you mrs whitney for i think that reubens plan is best for you both he cannot but suffer if he remains here and you will be unhappy in seeing him suffer great as the loss would be to you i believe that you would be happier here alone than you would be were you to see him in constant trouble and worry at any rate you would have the option if you found life intolerably dull here of joining him out there at any time  but how do you intend to get out reuben he asked seeing that mrs whitney made no answer but again relapsed into tears  i shall work my way out reuben replied i can do any rough work as a smith or a carpenter and i should think i ought to get my passage for my work anyhow i have got twelve pounds saved up and if i cant get out free that and my work ought to take me  in a short time mrs whitney finding that reuben was not to be shaken in his determination ceased to oppose it and began to busy herself in preparations for his departure which he had arranged to take place as soon as possible  a day or two before starting he walked over to say goodbye to mrs shrewsbury he stopped as he passed the smithy and seeing jacob priestley at work alone he went in  ah reuben is it you the smith said better here than in the dock at lewes eh i hears a talk of your going to foreign parts  yes i am off reuben said and i have just come over to say goodbye to mrs shrewsbury so i looked in as i passed knowing as you were one of those who found me not guilty and would perhaps give me a shake of the hand before leaving  that will i lad yes i found you not guilty and i jest tipped you a wink from the box to let you know as it were all right but my eye what a game we had had of it never had such a game in all my born days  and the blacksmith sat down on a stool to indulge in a great fit of laughing  what was the game reuben asked  well you know stokes he was the foreman and a cockney sort of chap he be he turns round in the box and says he  in course you are all agreed  agreed as how says i  why agreed as hes guilty in course says he  nothing of the sort says i i believes hes as innocent as a child unborn  then they all comes round me and jaws but seeing as i wasnt going to give in stokes he asked the judge for leave to retire  well when we retires they all pitches into me and says as its monstrous one man should hold out agin eleven and that even if i didnt feel sure myself i ought to go as the others went so i didnt say much but i sits myself down and brings out a big chunk of bread and bacon as my good woman had put into my pocket and i begins to eat  look you here says i i ha got four parcels like this today be friday and i can hold on easy till tuesday thats how i looks at it this young chap aint had nothing to do with this ere robbery and i aint going to see he transported for what he never done  well there we sits sometimes they would all talk at once sometimes two or three of them would give it me ten oclock comes and they got desperate like for only one or two of them had put anything into their pockets thinking that the matter was sure to be finished that night when the messages were sent out again as we couldnt agree i sits down in a corner and says i  i aint a selfish man and any of you as changes your mind can have a share of what i have got  i dozes off but i hears them jawing away among themselves it might have been two oclock when one of them comes to me and gives me a shake and says he  give us a cut of that bread and bacon i am wellnigh starved i have got a wife and children to think of and it dont matter to me whether this chap goes to botany bay or whether he dont it didnt seem to me a certain case all along so i will go along with you  gradually two or three more comes and when it got light i could see as some more was hesitating so says i  lookee here my friends those who has agreed to give this young chap another chance has lessened my stock of bread and bacon pretty considerable and i aint got more than enough for one more so whos the next  four more spoke out at once i divides the bread and bacon among them then as there was nine of us agin three we goes at them and tells them how wrong it is as we was all to suffer from their obstinacy and we works on their feelings about their wives and children and then says i  i call it downright ridiculous when theres a hot breakfast on twelve tables waiting for us as three men should keep the rest from tucking in just acause they wont give an innocent lad the benefit of the doubt  well that finished them the thought of the hot breakfast made the other chaps so ravenous as i believe they would have pitched into stokes and the other two if they hadnt have given in so they comes round and we sends out to say that we had agreed on the vardict it were the best game i ever seed in my life  well jacob i am sure i am heartily grateful to you and i shall not forget your kindness though what made you so sure of my innocence while all the others doubted it i dont know  lor reuben the smith said there aint nothing to thank me about i didnt know nowght as to whether you was innocent or guilty and it was a good job for me as i had made up my mind about that there vardict afore i went into court for i should never have made head or tail of all that talk and the fellows with white hair on the top of their heads as kept bobbing up and down and asking all sorts of questions was enough to turn an honest mans head the question was settled when miss kate ellisonthats the little un you knowcame in here says she  jacob you are on this jury i hear  yes miss says i  well i hope you are going to find reuben whitney innocent says she  i dont know nothing about it says i folks seem to think as he did it  then she went at me and told me that she was sure you was innocent and the squire he was sure and he would be moighty put out if you was found guilty so i told her natural that the squires being a good landlord i wouldnt disoblige him on no account and she might look upon it as good as settled that you should be found innocent so she tells me not to say a word to anyone and i aint not even to the ould woman but in course i dont consider as she meant you  reuben could not help laughing as he learned that he had been acquitted not from any belief in his innocence on the part of the jury but by the intervention on his behalf of the girl who had before fought his battles shaking hands with jacob he went on to the schoolmasters  as he was sitting there chatting with mr and mrs shrewsbury he saw kate ellison come out of her fathers gate along the road with her basket as usual catching up his hat he ran out and stood bareheaded awaiting her  ah reuben she said with a smile and a nod i am glad to see you before you go for mr shrewsbury told me yesterday you were going to leave lewes and emigrate i am gladand she hesitated a littlevery glad that they found you innocent i was quite sure you would not do such a thing  i am glad i came over today miss ellison reuben said quietly very glad that i have met you for i have just learned from jacob priestley that it is to you i am indebted that i am not in the present moment a prisoner in jail under sentence of transportation  the girl flushed up hotly  jacob priestley is very wrong to have spoken about it i told him he was never to mention it  i hope you will not blame him miss ellison he told me he had never spoken a word to anyone else but he thought you did not mean it to apply to me i am very glad he has spoken for i shall carry away with me across the sea a deep gratitude which will last as long as i live for the kindness you have shown me not only now but alwayskindness which has saved me from a terrible punishment for an offence of which i was innocent  may god bless you miss ellison and render your life a happy one  goodbye reuben the girl said gently i hope you may do well in the new land you are going to  so saying she went on her errand reuben stood watching her until she entered one of the cottages then putting on his cap he returned to the schoolmasters  a week later reuben was wandering along the side of the london docks looking at the vessels lying there and somewhat confused at the noise and bustle of loading and unloading that was going on he had come up the night before by the carriers waggon and had slept at the inn where it stopped his parting with his mother had been a very sad one but mrs whitney had so far come round as to own that she thought that his plan was perhaps the best although she still maintained that she should never venture herself upon so distant a journey he had promised that should she not change her mind on this point he would whether successful or not come home to see her  the squire had driven over the day before he left to say goodbye to him he had through mr shrewsbury directly he heard that he was going offered to help towards paying his passage money but this offer reuben had gratefully though firmly declined to accept  well reuben i wish you every good luck on your adventure he said the place you are going to will be a great country one of these days and you are just the fellow to make your way in it i am sorry you wouldnt let me help you because i am in a way you know at the bottom of this business which has driven you from home  thank you squire for your kind intention reuben answered but i am so much in your debt now that i would rather not go further into it i am old enough now to make my own way in life my only regret in the matter is that i cannot persuade my mother to go with me  i think she is right reuben the squire replied you can transplant a young tree easily enough but you cant an old one somehow they wont take root in new soil  well lad i wish you every success i suppose i shall hear through shrewsbury from time to time how you are going on  as reuben walked along the dock he stopped to read the notices of their destination affixed to the shrouds of most of the vessels he had already gone on board three or four which were loading for australia but in none was there a vacancy for a carpenter he stopped before a finelooking barque to which no notice was attached  where is she going to he asked a sailor who was passing along the gangway to the shore  shes bound for sydney the sailor said she warps out of dock tonight and takes on board a cargo of prisoners in the medway  do you mean men sentenced for transportation reuben asked  yes the man said and i wish she had any other sort of cargo i have been out with such a load before and i would as soon go with a cargo of wild beasts  reuben felt a sudden chill as he thought how narrow had been his escape of forming one of a similar party however he stepped on board and went up to the mate who was superintending the cargo  do you want a carpenter for the voyage out  a carpenter the mate repeated well yes we do want a carpenter the man who was to have gone has been taken ill but you are too young for the berth why you dont look more than eighteen besides you dont look like a carpenter  i am a mill wright reuben said and am capable of doing any ordinary jobs either in carpentering or smith work i have testimonials here from my late employers  well you can see the captain if you like the mate said you will find him at mr thompsons office in tower street number 51  reuben at once made his way to the office the captain refused at first to entertain the application on the ground of his youth but ships carpenters were scarce the time was short and there was a difficulty in obtaining men for convict ships therefore after reading the very warm testimonial as to character and ability which mr penfold had given reuben he agreed to take him on the terms of his working his passage  reuben went back at once to the inn where he had stopped and had his chest taken down to the docks and went on board the paramatta which at high water warped out of dock into the stream    chapter 6 on the voyage   the next day the paramatta weighed anchor and proceeded down the river reuben had no time to look at the passing ships for he was fully occupied with the many odd jobs which are sure to present themselves when a ship gets under weigh the wind was favourable and the paramatta ran down to the mouth of the medway before the tide had ceased to ebb she anchored for three hours and then made her way up to chatham where she brought up close to the government yard  it was not till late in the evening that reuben had finished his work and was at liberty to look round and to take an interest in what was going on on deck  this is your first voyage my lad i reckon an old sailor who was standing leaning against the bulwark smoking his pipe remarked  yes reuben said cheerfully this is my first voyage i have shipped as carpenter you know to work my way out to sydney  you could not have chosen a better ship than this ere barkee the sailor said though i wish she hadnt got them convicts on board she will sail all the faster cause you see instead of being choked up with cargo the deck below there has been set aside for them that will make easy sailing and quick sailing but i dont like them for all that they are a lot of trouble and they has to be watched night and day theres never no saying what they might be up to theres mostly trouble on board with them then one cant help being sorry for the poor chaps though they does look such a villainous bad lot they are treated mostly like dogs and i have been on board ships where the rations was not what a decent dog would look at  but i thought there was regular food according to a scale reuben said  ay theres that the sailor replied and the government officers see that the quantitys right but lor bless you they dont trouble as to quality and some of the owners buys up condemned stores and such like anything thinks they is good enough for a convict shipbiscuits as is dropping to pieces salt junk as as been twenty years in cask and which was mostly horse to begin with no wonder as they grumbles and growls a convict is a man you see though he be a convict and it aint in human nature to eat such muck as that without growling  what tonnage is the vessel reuben asked  leven hundred and fifty ton and as fine and roomy a ship as there is in the trade and well officered i have made three vyages with the captain and first mate and the second mate was with us on the last vyage  how many hands are there altogether  twentyfive counting you as one and not acounting the two stewards  we are going to take some passengers i see reuben said i have been at work putting up pegs and shelves for them  yes theres eight or ten passengers i hears the sailor said passengers dont mostly like going by convict ships but then the fares are lower than by other vessels and that tempts a few besides the paramatta is known to be a fast ship and the skipper has a good name so we shall have a better class of passengers i expect than usually voyages with convict ships and besides the passengers there will be the officer of the convict guard and a surgeon so we shall be pretty full aft  and what will my duties be when we are at sea  it just depends on the captain the sailor said you will be put in a watch and work with the others except that they may not send you aloft that depends on the terms that you shipped  i shipped as carpenter and to make myself generally useful and to obey orders i shall be happy to do anything i can hard work is better than doing nothing any day  thats the sort my lad the sailor said heartily now i am sail maker but bless your heart except putting a patch on a sail now and then theres nothing to do that way and when not so wanted i am one of the ordinary crew still if you works your passage it aint to be expected as they will drive you the same as a man as is paid hes a fair man is the skipper and you wont find yourself put upon on board the paramatta  cant i go up aloft now reuben asked i would rather accustom myself to it while we are lying steady than go up when the winds blowing and she is heeling over  go up to be sure you can and i will go up with you and tell you some of the names of the ropes and put you up to things theres a pleasure in helping a lad who seems in any way teachable some of they boys as comes on board a ship aint worth their salt in these days  the sailor led the way up the shrouds reuben found it much more difficult than it looked he had seen the sailors running up and down and it looked as easy as mounting a ladder but the slackness of the ratlineswhich as the sailor told him was the name of the pieces of rope which answered to the rounds of a laddermade it at first awkward when they reached the main top the sailor told him to sit down and look round quietly till he became accustomed to the height  it looks unnatural and risky at first he said but when you get accustomed to it you will feel just as safe when you are astraddle the end of a yard and the ship rolling fit to take her masts out as if you were standing on the deck  as reuben had heard the sailors laughing and joking aloft as they hauled out the earrings of the sails he had no doubt that what the sailor said was true but it seemed to him that he should never accustom himself to sit at the end of a spar with nothing but the water at a vast depth below it would be bad even with the ship lying quiet as at present it would be terrible with the vessel in a heavy sea  the sailor now told him the names of the masts and stays giving him a general idea of the work aloft and presently asked him whether he would like to return to the deck now or to mount a bit higher although reuben was now becoming accustomed to the position he would had he consulted his inner feelings have rather gone down than up but he thought it was better to put a good face on it and to accustom himself at once to what he would probably have to do sooner or later  holding on tight then and following the instructions of his companion he made his way up until he was seated on the cap of the topgallant mast holding tight to the spar which towered still higher above him he was surprised at the size and strength of the spars which had looked so light and slender from below  very well done lad the sailor said approvingly you would make a good sailor in time if you took to a seafaring life theres not one in ten as would get up there the first time of going aloft you dont feel giddy do you  no reuben replied i dont think i feel giddy but i feel a strange shaky feeling in my legs  that will soon pass off the sailor said you look at them hills behind the town and the forts and works up there dont think about the deck of the vessel or anything but just as if you were sitting in a chair watching the hills  reuben did as the sailor instructed him and as he did so the feeling of which he was before conscious passed completely away  i feel all right now he said after sitting quietly for a few minutes  all right then down we go dont look below but just keep your eyes in front of you and never leave go of one grip till you make sure of the next  five minutes later he stood on the deck  well done my lad for the first time the first mate said as reuben put his foot on the deck i have had my eye on you i shouldnt have let you go beyond the top at the first trial but i didnt think you would go higher till you were fairly up otherwise i should have hailed you from the deck  you ought not to have taken him up above the top bill if he had lost his head it would have been all up with him  i could see he wasnt going to lose his head trust me for not leading a young hand into danger he was a little flustrated when he got into the top but after he had sat down a bit his breath come quiet and regular again and i could see there was no chance of his nerve going  the next morning soon after daybreak the dockyard boats began to row alongside with greycoated convicts reuben watched them as they came on board with a sort of fascination with their closely cut hair bullet heads and evil faces although he had no doubt that the repulsive expression was due partly to the closecut hair and shaved faces and their hideous garb he could scarcely repress a shudder as he looked at them in some faces an expression of brutal ferocity was dominant others had a shifty cunning look no less repulsive  there were a few goodhumoured faces one or two so different from the others that reuben wondered whether they were innocent victims of circumstances as he had so nearly been not till now did he quite realize how great his escape had been the thought that he might have had to spend the rest of his life herding with such men as these made him feel almost sick and he thanked god more fervently even than he had done when the verdict was returned which restored him to his liberty that he had been saved from such a fate  a hundred and eighty convicts came on board they were in charge of ten warders with loaded muskets and an hour later a party of twenty marines under the charge of an officer also embarked they were on their way out to join a ship in australian waters and were to aid the warders in keeping the convicts in good order  the wind being favourable no time was lost after the marines had come on board the moorings were cast off and sails hoisted and the paramatta made her way against the tide to the mouth of the medway and there dropped her anchor to wait until the tide began to ebb for the wind was so light that little would have been gained by an attempt to proceed at once sail was made again as soon as tide turned and on turning out next morning at daylight for he had not yet been assigned to a watch reuben found that the ship was lying at anchor in the downs  two or three hours passed  what are we doing here bill  we are waiting for the passengers they are all coming on board here i expect that big lugger you see running out direct for us as got them on board  i wonder they didnt come on board when we started reuben said i should think it would have been pleasanter than coming all the way down to dover by coach  so i should think my lad but you see it aint every time as a ship has the luck weve had its a long job coming down to the downs if the wind dont serve we might have been beating about there at the mouth of the thames for a week so you see most of these longshore chaps like to send their traps on board while the vessels in the docks and then to come down here and stop till she comes round  in a few minutes the lugger was alongside the gangway was lowered and the passengers began to come on board they were as the sailor had said they would be some ten in number there were six men four ladies and three children the latter not counting as regular passengers as they were stowed away in their parents cabins  the convicts who were on deck looked over the bulwarks and cracked coarse jokes among themselves as the passengers ascended the gangway reuben found that only onethird of the number were allowed on deck at once two soldiers paced up and down the deck on guard of the hatchway leading below and two sentries were posted at other points  a number of small boxes bags coats and cloaks were handed up and then the rope was cast off and the lugger made her way back to dover and the paramatta again got under sail while they had been waiting the chief mate had told reuben that according to the captains orders he would henceforth be in his watch  as you are not regularly shipped as a sailor the mate said the captain does not wish you to go aloft unless by your own desire but there will be plenty of work for you to do on deck hauling at the braces scrubbing and so on  i should be glad to do my work with the rest reuben said as soon as i feel i can be useful aloft i was up two or three times yesterday and hope in a few days to be quite accustomed to it  i have noticed you my lad and you could not be in better hands than bills he is a capital sailor and as he has taken to you and you are willing to learn you will be a useful hand before we get to sydney and even if you never go to sea again all your life you will find that you have learned a great deal that is useful on board the paramatta  the fine weather which the paramatta had experienced so far speedily left her the sky grew overcast and the wind freshened fast and the next morning the ship was staggering under closereefed canvas in the teeth of the southwesterly gale  for the next three days reuben made no advance in seamanship being prostrated with seasickness at times he crept out from the forecastle and tried to lend a hand whenever he saw a party of men hauling at a rope but the motion of the ship was so great that he could scarce keep his feet on the slippery decks and at last the mate ordered him to go back to the forecastle and remain there until he recovered somewhat from his sickness  i see you are no skulker my lad but you will do no good on deck here and are not unlikely to get a heavy fall and perhaps a nasty hurt so you had best lie off till you get over your sickness  reuben was already drenched to the skin by the spray and felt so weak that he was not sorry to avail himself of the mates orders and to turn in again to his bunk in the forecastle  on the morning of the fourth day he felt himself again and turned out the gale had almost blown itself out but the sea was very heavy the fresh air was delightful to reuben after the confinement in the forecastle and as his watch was on deck he at once went up to bill and asked him what he could do  glad to see you about agin reuben the sailor said you have had a worse time of it than most there is a lot of difference atween chaps some takes it bad and some is never ill from the first well there aint nothing to do at present but just hold on and get to feel your legs dont you try to go across the deck if the hands are called until you are accustomed to it else you will get a fall to a certainty  is the gale nearly over bill  why its quite over dont you see that for yourself  it seems to me to blow hard now  blow hard why there aint a capful of wind it was blowing pretty hard yesterday if you like but not worth calling a gale if you are lucky you are like to know what a gale is when we get south of the cape the wind does blow there when it has made up its mind thats the place where they say as the helmsman has to have two men regular to hold on his hair  reuben laughed  i think on the whole bill i would rather get to sydney without meeting a storm like that this has been quite enough for me why some of the waves hit the vessels bow as if they would have knocked it in  wait till you have a gale in earnest master reuben and you will know about it then of course it seemed worse to you because you were lying there adoing nothing and was weaklike with heaving yourself up if you had been on deck you would have seen as it was nothing worth talking about  look at the ship everythings in its place and shipshape  why what has become of the tall spars aloft reuben said looking up  oh they were sent down when the wind freshened bill said there aint nothing in that  where are the convicts bill  oh they are all battened down below the sailor said carelessly they only come up for an airing when the weather is fine they are like the passengers only instead of pleasing themselves their ways are marked out for them  have any of the passengers been up  two or three of the men have shown and a gal it aint her first voyage ill bet a pretty thing she is and as straight as a mast shes been on deck off and on ever since we started  the next morning the sea moderated greatly and the wind having gone round to the southeast the paramatta made the most of it to get west as far as possible before turning her head to the south  thats a slice of luck bill hardy said to reuben theres nothing like getting well off at the start with luck now we oughtnt to see the land till we make the cape  but i would rather see the land bill when one is going half round the globe it is pleasant to touch at ports on the way and to get a glimpse at foreign peoples and ways  ay i like a spree on shore bill agreed but after all it dont last long and when you are near land theres always the chance that the wind may shift round and you may find yourself dead on a lee shore the skipper gets anxious and the mates out of temper and if it does come on to blow hard from the wrong quarter theres never no saying what will come of it  no my lad theres nothing like a good open sea with no land within five hundred miles of you at the least the coast of africa aint a pleasant neighbour what with the low shores which you dont see till you are pretty nigh close to them what with the currents and the changeable winds and the precious bad lookout there is if you do get cast ashore i tell you the wider berth you gives it the better  the next morning was so fine and bright that all the passengers were on deck and after breakfast the word was passed forward that the carpenter was wanted reuben found that he was wanted to nail some strips of wood on the floor of some of the cabins to prevent the boxes from shooting out from under the berths when the vessel rolled as he was at work at one of these a young lady came to the door of the cabin and uttered a little exclamation of surprise at seeing reuben kneeling on the floor then seeing what he was doing she said  oh you are the carpenter i suppose  yes miss  i wish you would screw on some pegs i brought with me to hang things upon everything does get thrown about so when the ships rolling they are in that trunk if you will not mind pulling it out  reuben pulled out the trunk which the girl opened and after some search produced halfadozen iron clothes pegs she showed him where she wished them screwed on and stood looking on while he carried out her instructions  are you the ships carpenter  yes miss  you seem very young for a carpenter dont you  i am young reuben replied smiling and this is my first voyage fortunately for me the hand who was engaged hurt himself just as the vessel was sailing so i obtained the berth so far it does not appear that it is a difficult one  the girl looked at him a little curiously his manner of talk and conversation differed so much from the sailors in general  are you really a carpenter she asked you dont look like a carpenter  yes i am really a carpenter reuben answered at least i am a mill wright by trade we are a sort of half and half between carpenter and smith  is there anything else he asked as he finished screwing the last screw  no nothing else thank you the girl answered that will do very nicely and i am much obliged to you  after finishing his work in the cabins reuben went forward  captain the young lady said as she went upon deck i have been talking to that young carpenter of yours i am quite interested in him is he really a carpenter he does not talk a bit like one  i believe so miss hudson the captain replied at least he produced an excellent testimonial from his last employer when i engaged him of course it might not have been genuine if there had been time i should have made more inquiries but he was well spoken and had an earnest look about him but now you mention it i dont know that it is very wise letting him go into all the cabins when i know so little about him  oh i never thought of that the girl exclaimed i am sure he looks honest it was only because he spoke so well that i mentioned it  he seems to be a sharp young fellow the captain remarked and i see that he has taken to going aloft with the rest of the crew already he is an emigrant rather than a sailor for he has only shipped for a passage i dont know whether he is going to join a man out there but if not he is certainly young to go out on his own account i do not think hes more than eighteen he looks so young he cannot have served all his time at his trade  i really feel quite interested in him captain wilson the girl said turning to a gentleman standing by who had been listening to the conversation i wish if you get an opportunity you would get into conversation with this carpenter of ours and find out something about him  i will if you like miss hudson but i dont suppose theres much to find out and what there is hes not likely to tell me from what you say i should guess that he had had a bad master and had run away  but the captain said he had good testimonials miss hudson persisted  as to testimonials the gentleman said anyone can write a testimonial  how suspicious you are captain wilson the girl laughed thats the worst of being a police officer and having to do with criminals you think whoever you come across is a rogue until you find out he is an honest man now i think everyone is honest till i find him out to be a rogue  my way is the safest the officer laughed at any rate on board this ship there are five rogues to each honest man  ah but thats not a fair average the girl objected of course in the colony one has to be careful considering that half the shepherds and stockmen are convicts and i must own that the natives are nearly all thieves but how could it be otherwise when england sends all its rogues out to us you see when free labour gets more abundant and we can do without convicts the colonists will protest against it  very likely they will the officer agreed but what is england to do if she has nowhere to send her rogues  that is her business miss hudson said carelessly there is no reason why they should be shoved on to us in the old time when there were no colonies england managed somehow and i suppose she could do so again  she managed in a very short way captain wilson said she hung them as fast as she caught them it did not matter much what the offence was whether stealing a loaf or killing a man but she could hardly go back to that now  no she could not miss hudson agreed but i have no doubt she can find something useful for them to do when she has to keep them at home  dont you think so captain  i daresay she could the captain answered certainly if i were a colonist living in a lonely part of the country i should object to transportation for what with the natives and bush rangers and bad characters generally no one can say their life is safe  oh its not so bad as that captain miss hudson said indignantly you are giving the place a bad character  i think captain wilson will agree its a true one the captain said smiling  eh captain wilson  i am afraid so the latter replied i know they keep me pretty busy however after a years holiday i must not grumble if i find plenty to do when i get there  the voyage down to the cape was wholly uneventful the paramatta was most fortunate in her weather and beyond trimming the sails the crew had a very easy time of it captain wilson had as he promised miss hudson taken the opportunity when reuben was sitting idly on deck of having a chat with him but he did not learn much in the course of the conversation  your young carpenter puzzles me miss hudson he said to her at dinner he is certainly an altogether exceptionally wellspoken young fellow for his condition of life but i cant quite make him out i think that he has worked as a mill wright he spoke openly and without hesitation as to his work but how it is he has thrown it up and emigrated so young i cant make out of course he cannot have served his time and yet somehow i dont think that he has run away from the manner in which he spoke of his employer  he has no friends whatever in the colony as far as i could learn i should say he has certainly been fairly educated and yet he seems from his own account to have worked three or four years at his trade  i certainly like the lad though i own that so far i cannot altogether make him out perhaps i shall learn somewhat more about him before we get to the end of the voyage and in that case i will tell you all i know  miss hudson was the daughter of a wealthy flock owneror as he was called squatterin new south wales her father and mother were on board the ship with her this was her fifth voyage she had gone out as a baby with her parents and had returned to england at the age of ten to be educated when eighteen she had joined her mother and father in australia and two years later had come with them to europe and had spent some months travelling on the continent they were now on their way back to the colony  the only other single lady among the passengers of the paramatta was going out under the charge of the captain to fill a place as governess in a family in sydney miss furley was somewhat quiet but a friendship had naturally sprang up between her and miss hudson as the only two young women on board the ship and the life and high spirits of the young colonist and the musical acquirements of miss furley helped to make the voyage pass pleasantly for the passengers in the paramatta  captain wilson had a good tenor voice and sang well and one of the other passengers was able to furnish a bass almost every evening as the ship was running down the tropics before a gentle favouring breeze the sound of solo and glee singing rose from the little party gathered on the poop and even the convicts on deck forward ceased their talk and listened to the strains  although the passage had been a pleasant one there was a general feeling of satisfaction when the ship dropped her anchor in table bay most of the passengers went on shore at once to take up their quarters at the hotel till she sailed again the captain said that it would take at least a couple of days to fill up the water tanks and take in a supply of fresh provisions  on the afternoon of the second day reuben asked permission of the first mate to go ashore for a few hours  certainly whitney the officer said you have proved a very useful hand on the way out which is more than most do who work their passage nine out of ten of them are not worth their salt to say nothing of the rest of their rations you can stay on shore tonight if you like but you must come off early in the morning we hope to get away in good time  on landing reuben was much struck with the variety of the scene in the streets of cape town were men of many types here was the english merchant and man of business looking and dressing just as he would at home names over the shop doors were for the most part dutch as was the appearance of the majority of the white men in the streets dutch farmers in broad hats and homespun garments mounted on rough ponies clattered along through the streets the manual work was for the most part done by swarthy natives while among the crowd were numbers of malays with dark olive skins small eyes and jetblack hair their women being arrayed in every shade of gaudy colour  for some time reuben wandered about the streets greatly amused at all he saw towards evening he turned his face towards the sea as he had no wish to avail himself of the permission given him to sleep on shore presently he encountered miss hudson and miss furley walking the other way the former nodded brightly for she had several times spoken to reuben since their first acquaintanceship  reuben touched his hat and proceeded on his way he had gone but a few yards when he heard a loud cry and everyone darted suddenly into shops or round corners  looking round in surprise reuben saw what had caused the movement a malay with his long hair streaming down his shoulders was rushing down the street giving vent to terrible yells in his hand he held a crease with which just as reuben looked round he cut down a native who had tried too late to make his escape  the two english girls confused and alarmed at the sudden outburst and unable until too late to comprehend the cause of it stood alone in the middle of the street and too terrified now to move clung to each other regardless of the shouts to fly raised by people at the windows and doors  illustration the ladies saved from the malays crease  the malay with a howl of exultation made at them with uplifted crease reuben sprang forward passed the terrified women when the malay was within four paces of them and threw himself with all his force upon him the malay whose eyes were fixed upon the ladies was taken by surprise by the assault and his crease had not time to fall when reuben sprang upon him  the shock threw both to the ground reuben as he fell throwing both arms round his adversary the malay struggled furiously and the combatants rolled over and over on the ground strong as reuben was the frenzy of the malay gave him greater power and the lad felt he could not long retain his grip of the arm with which the malay strove to use his crease  help however was not long in coming a native policeman ran up at full speed and brought his heavy club with his full force down on the head of the malay the latters limbs at once relaxed and reuben sprang to his feet breathless but not seriously harmed although the blood was freely flowing from some slight wounds he had received from the malays sharpedged weapon    chapter 7 gratitude   reuben looked round upon gaining his feet he saw miss hudson standing by the side of her companion who had fallen fainting to the ground mr hudson and captain wilson running at their full speed were within a few paces of the girls they had entered a shop to make a purchase while the ladies strolled on and although they had rushed out on hearing the alarm they were too far off to render assistance and impotent to help had seen with horror the terrible death which threatened the ladies  frances hudson had not uttered a word from the moment when the malay rushed down upon them but as her father came up she turned round and burst into tears as he clasped her in his arms  as soon as it was seen that the malay was no longer dangerous the people poured out again from the houses and shops it was no very unusual thing in cape town for the malays to run amuck and many of those in the streets hurried off in the direction from which the man had come to inquire how many victims had fallen to his deadly crease and to see whether any friends were among them on the malay himself no one spared a moments attention a second tremendous blow with the policemans club had dashed out his brains for malays running amuck were always killed upon the spot partly in order to save further trouble with them partly to strike terror into others  many of the bystanders gathered round reuben seized him by the hand patting him on the shoulder and praising him for the courage with which he had faced the maddened savage a minute later mr hudson forced his way through the crowd miss furley had already been raised and carried into a shop  go in with her my dear mr hudson said to his daughter i will bring him to you directly  my brave fellow he exclaimed as he made his way to reuben and grasped his hand how can i thank you for saving my childs life it seemed to us that she was lost and that nothing could save her when we saw you dash past her and throw yourself unarmed upon the madman it was a noble deed indeed  you are not badly hurt i hope he added as he saw the blood streaming down reubens face and arm  nothing to speak of sir reuben replied at least i think not but i feel rather queer from this loss of blood i had better get myself bandaged up  and indeed reuben was turning very pale partly from the relaxation of the tension of the struggle partly as he said from loss of blood  stand back mr hudson cried dont press upon him the lad is nearly fainting one of you help me get him into a shop where is the nearest surgeon to be found  it was as much as reuben could do to walk across the street aided by his two supporters a strong glass of cape smoke as the native spirit is called and water revived him somewhat it was some minutes before a surgeon arrived for five persons had been terribly wounded and two killed by the malay on his course and the surgeons near were busily employed  not very serious the surgeon said as soon as he examined reubens wounds very different affairs from those i have just come from  i had hold of his hand reuben said so that he couldnt strike they are only cuts he made in trying to get his arm free  that on your arm will not trouble you though it has bled pretty freely the one down your face is fortunately of no great consequence except that it has cut down to the bone on the brow and cheek if it had been an inch further back it would have severed the temporal artery you have had a narrow escape of it as it is you will get off with a scar which may last for some time but as it is an honourable one perhaps you wont so much care however i will bring it together as well as i can and stitch it up and it may not show much  the wound was sewn up and then bandaged as was that on the arm the other and slighter wounds were simply drawn together by slips of plaster when all was done reuben said to mr hudson  i shall do very well now sir i am sure you must wish to go to miss hudson i will sit here a bit longer and then go on board the ship  you will do nothing of the kind mr hudson said i have just sent for a vehicle and you will come to the hotel and get into bed at once you are not fit to stand now but i hope a good nights rest will do you good  reuben would have protested but at this moment a vehicle arrived at the door and with it captain wilson entered  i have just taken your daughter and miss furley to the hotel hudson he said they are both greatly shaken and no wonder so i thought it better to see them back before coming in to shake hands with our gallant young friend here  he has lost a good deal of blood wilson and i am just taking him off to get him to bed in the hotel  so we wont do any thanking till the morning mr hudson said seeing that reubens lip quivered and he was incapable of bearing any further excitement do you take one of his arms and i will take the other and get him into that trap  a quarter of an hour later reuben was in bed at the hotel mr hudson brought him up a basin of clear soup having drunk this he turned over and was in a very few minutes asleep the captain and most of the other passengers were at the same hotel and there was great excitement when the news arrived of the terrible danger the two girls had run mrs hudson had from her early life been accustomed to emergencies and the instant the girls arrived she took them up to the room they shared between them and insisted upon their going at once to bed after partaking of a cup of tea  what am i to do for this young fellow wilson mr hudson asked as having seen his patient comfortably in bed he returned downstairs and took a seat in the verandah by his fellow passenger i owe frances life to him and there is nothing i wouldnt do for him the question is what one does not like to offer money to a man for such a service as this  no mr wilson agreed especially in his case the young fellow appears to me very much above his condition your daughter first pointed it out to me and i have since chatted with him several times and find him a very superior young fellow certainly his education has been very different from that of most men in his condition of life and i should have taken him for a gentleman who had got into some scrape and run away had it not been that he seems to have been regularly apprenticed to his trade still there is something a little mysterious about him i asked him casually what part of the country he came from he hesitated a moment and then said from the south of england of course i did not ask any further questions as it was clear he did not care about naming the precise locality or he would not have given so vague an answer i feel as deeply indebted to him as you do  mr hudson nodded only the evening before arriving at cape town captain wilson had spoken to him on the matter of his affection for his daughter and had asked his permission to speak to frances they had known each other in the colony but had not been intimate until thrown together on board the paramatta seeing that she was an only child and that her father was considered one of the wealthiest squatters in the colony captain wilson had feared that mr hudson would not approve of him as a suitor and had therefore broached the subject to him before speaking to her mr hudson however had raised no objections  you have taken a manly and proper course in speaking to me first he said just what i should have expected from you i own that with the fortune the girl will have some day i have always looked for her making what they call a good match and settling down in the old country but i may tell you that while she has been in europe she has had several opportunities of so doing if she would have taken them she did not think fit to do so and i have always made up my mind not to influence her in any way providing she didnt fix her choice upon one whose character i disapproved certainly i have no reasons for so doing in the present case your character stands high in the colony and personally as you are well aware i like you exceedingly  what frances feelings in the matter are i have no means of knowing there is no doubt she likes you but as to anything more it is for you to find out you will have plenty of time between this and sydney anyhow you have my hearty approval of your wooing  i think between ourselves you know you must not expect at first any very cordial approval on the part of her mother she had an idea you know that frances would marry a duke at least and an offer from a prince of the blood would not have surprised her it is a great disappointment to her that she should have returned unmarried and she has already been talking to me about our returning to england in another couple of years so she will not take quite kindly to it at first but you mustnt mind that fond of frances as she is she will soon come round if she finds that the girls happiness is really concerned in the matter  take my advice and dont push it till we get near the end of the voyage if frances says yes she is the sort of girl to stick to it and as i am with you you may be quite sure it will come right in the long run but we might not have a very pleasant time of it during the remainder of the voyage you know and as things have gone on so pleasantly it would be a pity to spoil them  thus it was that mr hudson nodded when the young officer of the constabulary said that his indebtedness to reuben was equal to his own  yes he said if it had been one of the sailors i could have set the matter right by drawing a big cheque and i shouldnt have cared how big but with this young fellow i do not quite see my way however i will shift the responsibility by leaving the matter in frances handswomen are much better hands at things of this sort that require a light touch than we are i do not wonder that she and miss furley are shaken i feel shaken myself i shall never forget that scene and the two girls standing there and that wild malay rushing at them my legs seemed to give way under me and i thought i should have fallen down  i felt bad myself sir captain wilson said i have been in some tough fights with bush rangers and natives but i never had that sort of feeling before  one ran but one felt it was no use running as all must be over before we could get there when it was over i felt as weak as a child  dont let us talk any more about it mr hudson said rising i doubt whether i shall get a wink of sleep now and i am sure i shant if we go on talking any more about it let us take a turn and have a stiff glass of brandy and water afterwards to settle our nerves before turning in  the passengers by the paramatta were up early in the morning for the ship was to sail at nine but early as they were reuben was before them and on mr hudson inquiring about him as he turned out he was informed that he had already gone on board the ship  the two girls both looked pale when they came down to their early breakfast both declared however that they had slept well  you must give us time dad to get up our roses frances hudson said in reply to her fathers remarks as to their appearance i have no doubt a few days at sea will do it but of course it is only right and proper that young ladies should be pale after going through such an adventure as we had yesterday  but do not let us talk about it she said with a shudder i should like not to be able to think about it again for six months you used to say dad that i was plucky because i wasnt afraid of wild cattle and not very afraid of the natives or bush rangers but i am sure i cannot lay claim to any special courage in future for no one in the world could feel more frightened than i did yesterday  well my dear you were no worse than anyone else for everyone else bolted at the first alarm the way that street was cleared was something marvellous  yes dad but i was too frightened to run not that it would have been any use if i had for he was close to us before we knew what was the matter and if i could have run i dont think emma could  no indeed miss furley said i had no idea of running and even had there been plenty of time i am sure i could not have got out of the way somehow i seemed to lose all power to move i had just shut my eyes and thought it was all over when there was a shout and a rush and i saw the malay roll over and then i made a snatch at frances and rolled over too  it was a terrible moment mr hudson said but i agree with frances that it is better for you to try and think nothing more about it until you have perfectly recovered your health and spirits  i hear dad that the young man that saved us has gone on board ship i asked directly i was up because i wanted to see him  and i expect my dear that he slipped away because he didnt want to see you it sounds rude doesnt it but i can perfectly understand it  so can i the girl agreed did you see him this morning  no my dear i came downstairs only a minute or two before you did and then found that he was gone  have you thought over what you are going to do dad for him  wilson and i have talked it over frances but at present we dont see our way it is too serious a matter to make up our minds in a hurry your mother is in favour of giving him a handsome present but i dont think myself that that would do men who will do such deeds as that are not the sort of men to be paid by money  oh no dad surely not that any other possible way but not money  no my dear so i thought i have chatted it over with wilson and we have agreed that the best plan is to leave it entirely in your hands  i will think it over dad the girl said gravely it is a serious thing we owe him our lives and the least we can do is not to hurt his feelings by the way in which we try to show our gratitude  reuben had slept well and on waking soon after daylight jumped at once out of bed and was glad to feel that except for a certain amount of weakness in the legs and stiffness in his wounds he was all right again he dressed quietly and as soon as he heard persons moving about in the hotel made his way down to the shore and sat down there to wait for a boat from the ship which was lying some distance out and would he was sure be sending off early as there would be many things to bring on board before she sailed  it was not long before he saw the men descending the gangway to the boat alongside which was soon rowing towards the shore as she approached reuben saw the steward and first mate sitting in the stern seats and when the officer jumped ashore his eye fell on reuben  ah whitney he said i am glad to see you about when the captain came off last night he told me all about your gallant rescue of the two ladies i am sorry to see you bandaged up so much the captain said you had some nasty cuts but i didnt think they were so bad  they are nothing to speak about sir reuben replied although you would think so from seeing those bandages all over one side of the face and my arm in a sling but they are no great depth and dont hurt to speak of they were clean cuts with a sharp edge and dont hurt half as much as many a knock i have had with a hammer  well we all feel proud of you my lad it isnt everyone who would face a malay running amuck without weapons i can tell you  i think any english sailor would do so sir if he saw the malay rushing down upon two ladies there was no time to think about danger one way or the other the only thing to be done was to rush at him and so i rushed as anyone else would have done  ah its all very well to say so whitney but i have my doubts about everyone else rushing however i mustnt stand talking about it now as i have my hands full of work the sooner you get on board the ship the better  row whitney back to the ship lads and come back again in an hours time none of the things will be down here before that  reuben stepped into the boat which at once pushed off the men rowed easily for they were anxious to hear the particulars of the report which had circulated through the ship bill hardy was rowing the stroke oar and did the questioning  you may try to make little of it he said but i tell you reuben it were a right down good thinga thing any man would have right to be proud of  what do you say mates  there was a general chorus of ay ay  i took you in hand when you came on board young un bill went on and i looks upon you as my chick and i tell you i feel proud on you i felt sure you would turn out a good un some day but i didnt look to see it so quick  in oars  the boat ran up alongside the gangway and reuben was soon upon deck he was there met by the captain who had just come up as the boat rowed alongside he shook reubens hand heartily  you are a fine young fellow whitney and your mother if you have one ought to be proud of you i should be if you were a son of mine it was a lucky day for us all when i shipped you on board the paramatta for it would have been a heavy day for us if those two young ladies had been killed by that madman yesterday  you look pale lad as much as one can see of you and you will have to lie by for a bit i hear you lost a great deal of blood  steward bring another cup of cocoa with mine a large one and put plenty of milk in  the captain insisted on reuben coming to his cabin to drink his cocoa  you had best knock off your allowance of spirits till your wounds have healed up lad i will tell the second mate to serve you out port wine instead  reuben now went forward feeling very much the better for the cocoa he again had to receive the hearty congratulations of the men and then rather to escape from this than because he felt he needed it he turned into his bunk and was soon sound asleep  three hours later he was awakened by the tramp of men overhead and knew that they were shortening the anchor chain and preparing to be off going out on to the deck he saw that the courses had been dropped and the topsails were lying loose in their gaskets the crew were singing merrily as they worked the capstan three of the boats already hung from the davits and two large boats were bringing off the passengers and were already within a hundred yards of the ship while the remaining ships boat with the steward crowded with fresh stores was but a short way behind them as soon as the passengers were up and the shore boats had left she came alongside  hook on the falls at once the first mate ordered and run her up as she is you can get the things out afterwards  the anchor was by this time under the foot  up with it lads and the sailors again started at full speed on the capstan  the jibs were run up the courses and topsails shaken out and braced and the paramatta began to steal through the water again for the second portion of her voyage mr hudson and his friend very soon made their way forward and the ship was scarcely under way when reuben who was gazing over the bulwark at the shore felt a hand laid on his shoulder  how are you today reuben better i hope it was too bad of you to run off in that way this morning  i am all right now thank you sir reuben answered i felt just a little shaky at first but the captain gave me a cup of cocoa when i came on board and i feel now as if i were fit for duty again  oh nonsense mr hudson exclaimed you mustnt think of work for days yet no you must come aft with me my daughter and miss furley are most anxious to see you and my wife too is longing to add her thanks to mine  you are very good sir but really i would rather not if you will excuse me it is horrid being thanked and made a fuss about just because on the spur of the moment one did ones duty  thats all very well reuben but you see it wouldnt be fair to my daughter if anyone did you a great service you would want to thank them would you not  yes i suppose so sir reuben answered reluctantly but really i hate it  i can understand your feelings my lad but you must make up your mind to do it when anyone puts others under a vast obligation to him he must submit to be thanked however much he may shrink from it come along it will not be very dreadful  reuben saw that there was no getting out of it and followed mr hudson along the deck feeling however more ashamed and uncomfortable even than he did when standing in the dock as a criminal captain wilson walked beside him hitherto he had not spoken but he now laid his hand quietly upon reubens shoulder  my lad he said i am not a man to talk much but believe me that henceforth i am your friend for life  reuben looked up with a little smile which showed that he understood he had often indeed watched the young officer and miss hudson together and had guessed that they were more than mere acquaintances  the passengers were with the exception of the three ladies all gathered on the poop but frances had proposed to her mother that they should see reuben in the cabin alone as she felt that it would be a severe ordeal to the lad to be publicly thanked captain wilson ascended to the poop and joined the others there while mr hudson went alone into the cabin  the three ladies were awaiting him there frances came forward first the tears were standing in her eyes  you have saved my life she said softly at the risk of your own and i thank you with all my heart not only for my own sake but for that of my father and mother who would have been childless today had it not been for you  i need no thanks miss hudson reuben said quietly  his shyness had left him as he entered the cabin  it will all my life be a source of pleasure and gratification to me that i have been able to have been of service to so bright and kind a lady  i am not less grateful miss furley said advancing also i shall never forget that dreadful moment and the feeling which darted through my mind as you rushed past us and threw yourself upon him and i felt that i was saved almost by a miracle  and you must accept my thanks also mrs hudson said the thanks of a mother whose child you have saved from so dreadful a death believe me that there is nothing that my husband or myself would not do to show how deeply and sincerely we are grateful to you  mrs hudson indeed felt rather aggrieved that she could not at once take some active steps towards rewarding the young man for saving her daughters life and she had been unable to understand the scruples of her husband and daughter on the subject it was only indeed at their urgent entreaty that she had given way on this point  i call it monstrous frances she said almost angrily of course the young man will expect something more substantial than words it is only natural that we should reward him for preserving your life and it would be a crime if we didnt do so of course he didnt do it for money at the time but it is absurd to suppose that a young carpenter like this working his way out on board a ship will object to receive a handsome present for such a service as this our feelings have a right to be considered as well as his and a nice thing it will be for people to say that ralph hudson and his wife were so stingy and ungrateful that they did nothing for the lad who had saved their daughters life  there is no fear of their saying that mother everyone in the colony knows that there are no more openhanded people in new south wales than you and my father besides i do not say that we are to do nothing for him on the contrary i agree with you that it would be wrong indeed if we did not i only say please dont let there be a word said about reward now let us thank him as one would thank a gentleman who had done us a great service  of course i will do as your father wishes frances but i call it nonsense if he were a gentleman it would of course be different but he is a young carpenter and though you wont see it that seems to me to make all the difference  from what i have seen of him mother frances persisted i am sure that he has the feelings of a gentleman even if he is not one by birth about which i am not certain anyhow i am much obliged to you for letting me have my own way  you always do have your own way frances her mother laughed you get round your father first and then you come to me and what can i do against the two of you  reuben briefly answered miss furley and mrs hudson and mr hudson feeling that the lad would rather get over the scene as soon as possible slipped his arm though his and said  now reuben you must just come up for a minute on the poop the other passengers are all waiting to shake you by the hand and they would not forgive me if i were to let you run off as i know you are wanting to do without a word  accordingly reuben was taken up to the poop where the passengers all shook hands with him and congratulated him upon his courage  now i suppose i can go sir he said with a smile to mr hudson when this was over  yes you can go now mr hudson laughed most young fellows at your age would be glad of an opportunity for figuring as a hero but you talk as if it was one of the most painful businesses imaginable  anyhow i am glad its over mr hudson i can assure you and now i think i will turn in again considering what a night i had i feel wonderfully sleepy  it was not until the sun was setting that reuben appeared again on deck shortly after he did so captain wilson strolled up to the place where he was standing  i wish reuben he said after a few remarks on other subjects that you would tell me a little more about yourself you understand that i do not ask from mere inquisitiveness but after what has happened you see we seem to have got into close relationship with each other and if i knew more about you i could the easier see in what way i could most really be useful to you out there are you what you appear to be  i am indeed reuben replied with a smile my history is a very simple one my father was a miller with a good business and up to the age of ten it did not appear that i should ever be working as a craftsman for my living unhappily at that time my father slipped one night into the mill pond and was drowned and when his affairs came to be wound up it was found that he had speculated disastrously in wheat and that after paying all claims there was nothing left  my mother took a little village shop and i went to the village school at first i think i did not work very hard but fortunately there was a change in masters and the new one turned out one of the best friends a boy ever had he pushed me on greatly and when i was apprenticed to a mill wright he urged me to continue my education by working of an evening i stuck to it hard and with his help learned therefore a good deal more than was usual in my station of life my mother was always particular about my speaking and what with that and the books i suppose i talk better than they generally do  and is your mother alive  yes sir  but how came you to think of emigrating at your age when indeed you cannot have served out your full time  that sir reuben said gravely i cannot tell you some day perhaps if you care to know i may bring myself to do so i may say that it was a serious matter but that i was really in no way to blame whatever people may think my conscience is absolutely clear and yet i would rather that the story which i left england to escape should not be known to anyone  i do not seek to know further reuben i think i know enough of you to be perfectly sure that you would do nothing that was wrong and i am perfectly willing to take your word in the matter however i am glad that you have told me as much as you have your early rearing your mothers care and the education you have had perfectly account for what seemed strange about you before you have no objection i hope to my repeating your story to mr hudson who is as much interested in you as i am  and now another thing i know that it is painful to him that one to whom he is so indebted should be forward here in the forecastle instead of being in the cabin he was afraid of hurting your feelings by speaking to you about it but i know that it would be a great relief and pleasure to him and mrs hudson if you would allow them to make an arrangement with the captain that for the remainder of the voyage you should be a passenger  i am much obliged to them reuben said quietly but i could not think of accepting such an offer i am working my way out independently sir and i owe no one anything i am really enjoying the passage and so far there has been no hardship worth speaking of even putting aside the fact that i should not like to accept an obligation which would to most people look like a payment for the service i was fortunate enough to be able to render to mr hudson i should feel out of my element i am very comfortable and get on very well with the men while in the cabin i should feel strange and out of place  i dont think you would seem out of place anywhere reuben no one from your manner and conversation would judge you to be otherwise than a gentleman by birth while there are several of the passengers aft whose talk and methods of expression are by no means up to the level of yours  i should feel uncomfortable myself reuben said even if i didnt make other people uncomfortable so i think that with all gratitude for the offer i would very much rather remain as i am accustomed as i have been to hard work during my apprenticeship the life here appears to be exceedingly easy  then we will say no more about it captain wilson said it would have been a pleasure both to me and the hudsons to have you aft and i am sure you would be well received by all the passengers however as you think you would not be comfortable we will let the matter drop  however as to your work in the colony we must have a say in that and i hope that when i thoroughly understand your wishes we shall be able to help you forward there  for that i shall be extremely obliged sir it would be a great thing indeed for anyone on landing to have gentlemen ready to assist him and push him forward this is so at home and is of course still more the case in a strange country i am very anxious to get on and am ready to work my hardest to deserve any kindness that may be shown me  well we shall have plenty of time to think it over before we arrive  i fancy captain wilson went on looking upwards at the sky that our wonderful run of good luck with regard to the weather is likely to end shortly and that we are in for a gale  do you think so sir  i do indeed and if we do get a gale it is likely to be a serious one the cape you know was much feared for its terrible storms by the portuguese and it has kept up its reputation ever since i think it is going to give us a taste of its quality    chapter 8 a gale   wilson tells me he thinks we are going to have a gale bill  ay ay reuben anyone with half an eye could see that  which way is it likely to come  most likely from the north or northwest at least thats the quarter its likely to settle into but there aint no saying which way it may take us i thought things had been going on too smooth to last now you are going to see what a storm is my lad you thought it was blowing when we went down the channel  is it likely to be much heavier than that bill  heavier the sailor repeated scornfully why theres as much difference between a capful of wind in the channel and a gale off the cape as there is between a newborn baby and me  do they last long generally  last why they goes on for weeks there aint no end to them ive wondered sometimes to myself where all the wind comes from and where it goes to onlass it works round and round  but it does work round and round bill  ay when you are near the centre of it why lad in three hours i have gone round the compass three times with the wind dead aft all the time but thats only when you are near the centre when you aint it blows straight and i have known vessels run for daysay for weekswith the wind blowing all the time in the same quarter some have been blown down right to the edge of the ice south i have been among the icebergs myself two or three times and i guess that many a ship has laid her bones down in the ice fields there and no news ever come back home as to whats come to them and what makes it worse is as we have convicts on board  what difference does that make bill  it dont make no difference as long as all goes straight and fair i have heard in course of risings but thats only when either the guard are very careless or the men is so bad treated that they gets desperate and is ready to die on the off chance of getting free so far we aint had no trouble with them the ship is kept liberal and the poor wretches aint cheated out of the rations as government allows them the officer in charge seems a good sort and theres no knocking of them about needless so there aint no fear of trouble as long as things go square but when things goes wrong and a vessel gets cast away or anything of that kind then theres wellnigh sure to be trouble the convicts seize their opportunity and it aint scarce in human nature for them not to take it and then there aint no saying what will happen  why what a croaker you are bill i didnt expect that from you  i aint no croaker reuben but i knows what i knows i have been through a job like that i am telling you of once and i dont want to do it again i will tell you about it some day i aint saying as i expect any such thing will happen on board the paramatta god forbid shes a tight ship and shes got as good officers and crew as ever i sailed with she has as good a chance as ever a ship had but when i sees that ere sort of sky in these latitudes i feels as we are in for a tough job  the conversation was broken off abruptly by the call of the first mate  all hands aloft to shorten sail  the bells is ringing up for the beginning of the performance reuben here goes aloft  the next minute the whole of the crew were climbing the shrouds for the watch off duty were all on deck and the order was expected for the signs of the weather could by this time be read by every sailor on board above the sky was still bright and blue but around the whole circle of the horizon a mist seemed to hang like a curtain  smartly lads smartly the captain shouted dont hurry over your work but do it with a will  i hope we have not left it too long mr james i have held on longer than i ought for every mile we get away from land is an advantage and we have been running nearly due south ever since i noticed the first falling of the glass when we got up in the morning  i think we shall have time sir the mate said we are going to have it and no mistake presently but it dont seem to be coming up fast  the glass is going down rapidly the captain said its down an inch already and is still falling  mr mason he went on to the officer in command of the detachment of marines will you kindly place your men under the orders of mr james i am going to send down all the upper spars and they can be useful on deck  never was the paramatta stripped more rapidly of her sails for every man was conscious of the urgency of the work as soon as the sails were furled the yards were sent down the upper spars followed them and in little over half an hour from the time the men began to ascend the shrouds the paramatta was metamorphosed her tall tapering masts and lofty spread of sail were gone every spar above the topmasts had been sent down to the deck and she lay under closereefed topsails a stay sail and a storm jib the captain gave a sigh of relief as the men began to descend the rigging  thank god that is safely accomplished now we are in readiness for whatever may come  he dived into his cabin and returned almost immediately  the glass has fallen another half inch mr james he said gravely i have never but once seen it as low  ladies and gentlemen he went on addressing the passengers who were gathered in a group talking in low tones and anxiously watching the wall of vapour which now seemed to rise from the waters edge and reach far up into the sky the circle of view extending scarce half a mile in any direction i must ask you to go below at once the storm may strike us any moment now and when it does come it will come heavily i should like the deck perfectly clear and nothing to disturb my thoughts from the working of the ship  reuben had not gone aloft as he was called back just as he began to ascend the shrouds by the first mate and ordered to go round the cabins and fasten the dead lights securely when this was done he aided the marines in nailing tarpaulins over the cabin skylights and then went round the deck seeing that every movable article was securely lashed when this was done he joined bill who with some others had been at work securing all the hatches the convicts had long since been all sent below  shall i send my men down captain mr mason asked  there is no occasion for it just at present but you had better pass the word for all of them to hold on when the gale strikes her that will be the critical moment once past that she will be all right till the sea begins to rise then you had best get them below for we shall have the water sweeping knee deep along the waist in no time  i should say send them down at once but i know many of them have been to sea before and may be useful in cutting away if anything goes  she looks snug enough captain the young officer said glancing up at the diminished spread of canvas  she is snug enough for any ordinary gale the captain said but this is not going to be an ordinary gale when we once get her before it it will be all right  do you think we have another five minutes mr james  theres no saying sir but i should think so what do you want sir  i want that top sail off her altogether  i will do it sir the mate said and calling bill hardy and two others of the best sailors he led the way up the main shrouds  every eye on deck was fixed on the four seamen as rapidly but steadily they proceeded to furl and stow the sail there was still not a breath of wind but a low humming noise was heard  quick mr james never mind the sail all hands on deck the captain shouted but the work was just done and the sailors ran quickly down the ratlines on to the deck  thank god the captain said reverently that is done  the ship was now under the closereefed foretop sail a diminutive try sail on the mizzen and the jib the hum had increased to a roar but still not a breath of wind stirred the sails  look up bill said to reuben you may be at sea fifty years and never see that again  reuben looked up immediately overhead was a small circle of blue sky round and round whose edge the edging of cloud seemed to be circling with extreme velocity the light seemed to pierce straight down onto the vessel and she stood pale and white while all around her a pitchy blackness seemed to prevail  we are in the eye of the storm my lad here it comes now hold on for your life  in another moment it seemed to reuben that the end of all things was come he was pinned against the bulwark as if by a mighty invisible hand and the vessel heeled over and over until the deck seemed to rise in a wall above him then the water poured over him and though he still held on he thought the vessel had capsized then he felt her rising beneath his feet and his head emerged from the water  the captain the first mate and two seamen were at the wheel reuben saw the captain wave his hand but his words were lost in the fury of the wind the second mate bill hardy and two or three other sailors knew what was required and hauled upon the lee brace of the foretopsail yard the paramatta was still lying nearly over on her beam ends but gradually her head began to pay off and she slowly righted a minute later she was tearing directly before the gale scarcely had she done so when the foretop sail blew out of the bolt ropes with a report that was heard even above the howl of the tempest  its done its work bill shouted in reubens ear i thought she was gone just a little more and she would have turned turtle  the captain had used almost precisely the same words to the first officer adding  she will do now but we shall have to try to get a little more head sail on her when the sea gets up call some of the hands aft and get this try sail down she yaws so now the foretop sails gone there is no steering her  this was soon done and under bare poles the storm jib now the only sail upon her the paramatta tore through the water there was little motion for the sea had not begun to get up seeming to be pressed flat by the force of the wind the captain now left the helm two or three of the male passengers were standing at the top of the companion peering out  you can come out gentlemen for a bit she is running on an even keel now though that wont last long no one hurt below i hope  two or three of us have got bruised a little captain and i think we have all of us got a severe fright we thought she was over  i thought so too the captain said luckily she has got three hundred tons of iron on board and its all stowed at the bottom of the cargo so that helped her up again but it was touch and go with her for half a minute  and now gentlemen if you will take my advice you will just look round and then go below and turn in now you can do so easily another hour and there will be no keeping a footing  the captain was right in less than the time he named a terrific sea had got up the paramatta had already made more than one circuit of the compass there was no regularity in the sea it seemed to rise suddenly in heaps now striking the ship on one side now on another and pouring sheets of water over her bulwarks the motion of the vessel was so tremendous that even bill hardy and the older seamen could only move along with the greatest difficulty to carry out the orders of the captain while reuben clung to the shrouds now half buried in water now almost hanging in the air with the sea racing along under his feet  as yet no more sail had been put upon her for there was no following sea although running almost before the gale a slight helm was kept upon her so as to edge her out from the centre of the storm and the second circle of the compass took more than twice as long as the first to complete although the vessel was proceeding with equal speed through the water  hour after hour the sea got upa wild cross broken seaand the motion of the vessel was so terrific as to be almost bewildering to the oldest hands there was none of the regular rise and fall of an ordinary sea the vessel was thrown with violent jerks now on one side now on the other now plunging her bow so deeply down that she seemed about to dive head foremost beneath the waves now thrown bodily upwards as if tossed up by some giant hand beneath her the watch off duty was sent below for there was nothing that could be done on deck and the water swept over her in such masses as to threaten at times to carry everything before it one man had had his leg broken several had been seriously bruised and hurt  this is terrible bill reuben said as he went below  ay lad i have been at sea man and boy over forty years and its the worst sea i ever saw i expect to see her masts go out of her before long nothing could stand such straining as this you had best turn in at once unless i am mistaken it will be all hands to the pumps before long if she hadnt been one of the tightest crafts afloat she would have been making water at every seam by this time  reuben felt the instant he lay down that sleep was out of the question for it needed all his strength to prevent himself from being thrown out of his bunk the noise too was terrificthe rush and swell of the water overhead the blows which made the ship shiver from stem to stern the creaking of the masts and howling of the wind night had set in now it was pitch dark in the forecastle for the swinging lantern had been dashed so violently against the beams that the light was extinguished  half an hour after reuben turned in a crash was heard a moment later the door was opened and there was a shout  the mizzen has gone all hands to cut away the wreck  the watch turned out and began to make their way aft and were soon engaged with knife and hatchet in cutting away the wreck of the mizzen which towing behind threatened with each heavy following sea to plunge into the vessels stern a cheer broke from the men as the last rope was cut and the wreck floated astern the mast had gone close to the deck smashing the bulwark as it fell over the side the motion of the ship was easier for its loss  mr james the captain shouted we must get preventer stays at once upon the fore mast the main mast may go if it likes and at present we shall be all the better without it but the foremast we must keep if we can  ay ay sir i will set about it at once  picking out a few of the best hands the first mate proceeded about the work  go and sound the well reuben the captain said  reuben went off at once and returned in two or three minutes  there are four feet of water in it sir  four feet are you sure the captain exclaimed  quite sure sir  the captain handed over the command of the deck to the second officer and went below with reuben first wiping the rod carefully he sounded the well  you are right he said it is three inches over the four feet i fear that the bumping of the mizzen before we got rid of it must have started a butt she could hardly have made so much water from straining  the captain made his way aft the saloon was empty the passengers one by one had retired to their cabins he knocked at the doors of mr mason and the chief warder  the ship is making water fast he said we must rig the maindeck pumps i cant spare any of the crew their hands are full will you set the convicts to work  in a few minutes the clank of the pumps was heard very irregularly were they worked for it was next to impossible for the men to stand to them with the vessel throwing herself about so wildly  the captain had remained on deck he placed his hand on the shrouds of the main mast one moment they hung loosely and then as the vessel rolled over tightened themselves with a sudden jerk till they were as stiff as iron rods he shook his head  reuben make your way up to the chief officer and tell him that i am going to get rid of the maintop mast tell him to see that everything is cut free from the fore mast  reuben made his way aloft with difficulty it needed all his strength to prevent the wind from tearing him from his grasp of the shrouds but at length he reached the fore top where the mate was at work he delivered the captains message  ask the captain to wait five minutes till i get the back stay secured i will send a man down as soon as i am ready  you take this axe the captain said when reuben regained the deck and stand by this stay when you see me ready to cut the other cut at the same moment  in a few minutes bill came down with a message to the captain that all was ready the latter raised his arm to reuben he waited till the vessel rolled over and then lifted his axe the two blows fell together on the stays a moment later the vessel began to rise again as the jerk came there was a crash above and the maintop mast fell over the side clear of the deck having snapped off at the cap like a pipe stem  thank god for that the captain said as he cut away the connections on the other side and the spar drifted astern that is off our minds  the loss of the maintop mast and mizzen greatly relieved the strain on the ship and she worked much easier in half an hour the first officer returned on deck with his party and reported that he had done all he could to secure the fore mast  the sea is becoming more regular the captain said now that we are getting further away from the centre of the storm we shall soon have the waves racing behind us like mountains and we shall have to shake out the fore sail to keep ahead of them now let us see how they are getting on below  the well was again sounded and it was found that the water had gained two or three inches  when the motion gets a little more regular reuben you must take two or three hands and work your way aft in the hold and try and find out where the water is coming in  i will go at once sir if you like  no the captain replied it must not be thought of everything will be adrift and you would be crushed to death to a certainty you must wait till we are out of this tumble if the water gains no faster than it does now two or three hours will make no material difference and by that time i hope we shall have got a regular sea  finding that there was nothing for him to do reuben again turned in the motion was still tremendous but he could feel a sensible change from what it was before the motion of the ship was less sudden and violent and although she rolled tremendously she rose each time with an easier motion  an hour later the watch turned out and the others took their place the wind was blowing as heavily as when the hurricane began but the aspect of the sea had changed it was no longer a mass of leaping tumbling water but was running in long waves following each other rising high above the vessels stern as they overtook her having lashed himself to the side he remained for an hour watching the sea the first mate then came up to him  the captain thinks you might manage to get aft now i will send bill and dick whistler with you to help you move any boxes or bales  reuben went back in the forecastle and got some tools a piece of old sailcloth and a large bundle of oakum and then made his way with the two sailors down into the after hold the way in which the upper tier of cargo lay heaped against the sides showed that it would as the captain said have been impossible to enter while the motion was at its worst the rolling however had greatly diminished the vessel rising and falling with a regular motion as each wave passed under her the men each carried a lantern and with some difficulty made their way to the stern  ay its somewhere about here bill said i can hear the rushing of water somewhere below now the first thing is to move these bales  they worked for a time and then bill returned on deck to fetch two more hands they brought hand spikes and bars as the bales were wedged so tightly together that it was difficult in the extreme to move them it took two hours hard work before they reached the leak as the captain had supposed the head of one of the planks had been started at the stern post by a blow from the wreck of the mizzen and the water was rushing in with great force  a few hours of this would have settled her bill said all the pumps in the ship would not keep down such a leak as this  reuben at once set to work cutting a deep groove in the stern post he butted some stout pieces of wood into this and wedged the other ends firmly against the first rib then he set to work to jam down sail cloth and oakum between this barrier and the plank that had started driving it down with a marlinespike and mallet it was a long job but it was securely done and at last reuben had the satisfaction of seeing that a mere driblet of water was making its way down behind the stuffing into the ship  thats a firstrate job lad bill said approvingly half an hours work once a week will keep her dry if there is no water finds its way in anywhere else  reuben went aft to the well the pump was now working steadily the gangs of convicts relieving each other by turns on sounding the well he found that the water had fallen nine inches since he had last ascertained its depth going on deck he found that a misty light filled the air and that morning was breaking  the captain had two or three times come down to the hold to watch the progress of the work reuben reported to him its completion and the fall in the water  yes its been falling the last hour the captain said she will do now but shes making water still some of the seams must have opened i have been looking her over and cant find out where it is and we can do nothing until the gale has blown itself out and we can get below and shift the cargo  reuben found that the fore sail had been set while he was below and the vessel was running some twelve knots an hour before the wind at one moment she was in a deep valley then her stern mounted high on a following wave and she seemed as if she must slide down head foremost higher and higher the wave rose sending her forward with accelerated motion then it passed along her and she was on a level keel on its top and seemed to stand almost still as the wave passed from under her  in spite of the extra lashing which had been given the hen coops spars and everything loose upon the decks had been swept away and the bulwarks had in several places been stove in the galley had been carried away but the cook had just made a shift to boil a cauldron of coffee below and a mug of this was served out to all hands as reuben broke a biscuit into his portion and sipped it he thought he had never enjoyed a meal so much he had now been for eighteen hours wet through to the skin and the coffee sent a warm glow through him  the captain ordered all hands save a few absolutely required on deck to turn in and reuben was soon in a glow of warmth beneath his blankets and lulled by the now easy motion of the ship was fast asleep in a few minutes  after four hours sleep he was again on deck the gale was blowing as strongly as ever three men were at the helm and the vessel was still tearing along at great speed several of the male passengers were on the poop and the contrast between the appearance of the paramatta at the same hour on the previous day and that which she presented now struck reuben very strongly sadly indeed she looked with mizzen mast gone the main mast shortened to the cap and all the upper spars and rigging of the fore mast gone she was however making good weather of it for her hold was now so dry that the pumps were worked only on alternate hours and the relief afforded by the loss of all her top hamper was very great  for a week the paramatta ran before the gale at the end of the fourth day its force somewhat abated but it still blew much too hard for anything to be done towards getting up fresh spars while the lost mizzen rendered it impossible for them to bring her up into the wind  its bitterly cold bill reuben said its been getting colder every day but this morning it is really bitter  and no wonder lad seeing that we have been racing south for pretty nigh a week we have been making a little easting but that is all and we are getting into the region of ice we may see some bergs any time now  i should like to see an iceberg reuben said  the fewer we see of them the better bill replied for they are about as nasty customers as you want to meet i expected we should have seen them before but this gale must have blown them south a bit they work up with the northwesterly current but i expect the wind will have carried them back against it no i dont want to see no icebergs  but if it were a very big one we might get under its lee and repair damages a bit bill might we not  no my lad the lee of an iceberg aint a place one would choose if one could help it there you are becalmed under it and the berg drifting down upon you going perhaps four knots an hour no the farther you keep away from icebergs the better but if you have got to be near one keep to windward of it at least thats my speryence  they have been having some trouble with the convicts i hears they worked well enough at first as long as they knew that there was a lot of water in the hold but since then they have been agrumbling and last night i hear there was a rumpus and six of them was put in irons thats the first of it and the sooner the gales over and we shapes our course in smooth water for sydney heads the better i shall be pleased  an hour later bill pointed to the sky ahead  do yer see nothing odd about that ere sky  no reuben replied except that its very light coloured  ay thats it my lad thats what they call the ice blink you see if we aint in the middle of bergs before night comes on i have not been whaling for nothing  a few minutes later the first mate was heard to be shouting orders  just as i thought bill said we are going to try to rig a jury mizzen so as to help us claw off the ice if need be  a spare top mast was got up from below guys were fixed to one end and with the help of the marines and a party of convicts the spar was raised alongside the stump of the mizzen mast and was there lashed securely the guys being fastened as stays to the bulwarks blocks had been tied to the top before it was raised and ropes rove into them and a try sail was brought on deck and laid ready for hoisting  the first mate ascended to the fore top and at once hailed the deck that ice was visible ahead the captain joined him and for some minutes the two officers carefully examined the horizon no sooner did the captain regain the deck than he ordered the try sail to be hoisted on the jury mast and a haul to be given upon the braces of the fore sail while the ships course was laid a little north of east  it is lucky the wind has gone down as much as it has he remarked to mr hudson the sea is still heavy but if that jury mizzen stands we shall be able to claw off the ice  is there much of it captain  we could see a good many bergs and from the look of the sky i should say there was an ice field lying beyond them however i think we shall do if the wind does not freshen again if it does we must do our best to make a group of islands lying down to the southeast and there refit they are a rendezvous for whalers in summer  why not do so now captain  i would if it were not for the convicts but unless as a last resource i would not run the risk of touching at any island with them on board as long as we are at sea they are comparatively harmless and unless there is gross carelessness on the part of their guard there is little fear of an outbreak but once let them get on land the matter is changed altogether they are nearly three to one as against the warders marines and crew and i would not run the risk on any account if it can be possibly avoided no no mr hudson unless it be a matter of life and death we will put in nowhere till we are in sydney harbour    chapter 9 two offers   at nightfall the paramatta was in the midst of the icebergs and reuben soon understood the antipathy which bill had expressed for them as a spectacle they were no doubt grand but as neighbours to a halfcrippled ship with half a gale blowing their beauty was a very secondary consideration to those on board  additional stays were fixed to the jury mast as it might be necessary at any moment to attempt to bring her up into the wind and the word was passed that both watches must remain on deck fortunately the night was a light one for the moon was up and the sky almost cloudless the mate stood with two of the best hands at the wheel while the second mate took his place in the fore top with a lantern to signal the position of ice ahead fortunately there were but few small floating blocks about and the paramatta threaded her way through the larger bergs without once approaching near enough to render danger imminent it was a long and anxious night but when morning broke it was seen that the sea was now open ahead and by the afternoon they had left the last berg behind  two days later the wind went completely down and the crew at once set to work to repair damages reuben with two men under him filled up the breaches in the bulwarks a respectable jury mast was rigged by the stump of the main mast and the spar which had done such good service among the bergs was replaced by a longer and heavier one all hands worked vigorously and the sailors were assisted in the heavier work by parties of convicts  after two days toil all was completed sail was hoisted again and under a greatly reduced spread of canvas to that which she had carried before the gale burst the paramatta proceeded on her way the weather continued favourable and without further adventure the paramatta arrived off sydney heads having made the voyage in a hundred and three days which was under the circumstances a quick one  the last evening captain wilson asked reuben to go with him to the poop as he and mr hudson wanted to have a chat with him  now reuben mr hudson said sit yourself down here we must have a talk together now we want to know exactly what you are thinking of doing  i am thinking of getting work sir reuben said at my own trade  well my lad i dont think you will make much at that there are mills of course but not a great many of them and i fancy you would find it difficult to get anything like regular work the distances here are tremendous and you would spend the money you made in one job in looking out for another  that is the first view of the case the second is that neither captain wilson nor i mean to let you try it you have saved my daughters life and i am not going to let the man who did that tramp about the country looking for a days work captain wilson is going to marry my girl shortly and of course he feels just the same about it so the next question is what is the best thing we can do for you now if you have a fancy for squatting you can come with me up country and learn the business and this day twelvemonth i will hand you over the deeds of a range with five thousand sheep upon it now thats my offer  now dont you be in a hurry to refuse it and dont let me have any nonsense about your not liking to accept it ten such farms would not pay the debt i owe you and i tell you i should think it downright mean if you were to refuse to let me pay you a part of my debt now you shall hear wilsons proposal  my offer is not so brilliant reuben indeed as far as making money the pay would probably be no higher at first than you might earn at your trade i am as you know assistant superintendent to the constabulary force of the colony now if you like i will obtain you a commission as an inspector the pay is not high but by good conduct you may rise to a position such as i hold it is the position of a gentleman and the life is full of excitement and adventure now what do you say  reuben was silent for a minute or two  i am greatly obliged to you both he said more obliged than i can tell you your offer mr hudson is a most generous one but i have not been accustomed to farming and i would rather have such a life as that which captain wilson offers me although the pay may be very much smaller  but sir he said turning to the officer of constabulary i fear that i cannot accept your offer because in the first place you see i am not a gentleman  oh nonsense reuben your manners and language would pass you as a gentleman anywhere besides which there are several officers in the force who have risen from the ranks and who have had nothing like the education you have had you can put that aside at once is there any other reason  yes sir reuben said quietly i had never intended to have spoken of it and i came out to australia in order that i might be away from everyone who knew the story but i couldnt accept your offer without your knowing it i am leaving england because i have been tried for burglary  nonsense both reubens listeners exclaimed incredulously  if you dont mind i will tell you the whole story reuben said and then you can judge for yourselves  reuben then related at length the whole circumstances with which the reader is already acquainted  i remember reading your story in the papers reuben captain wilson said being in the force you know i take an interest in these things i own i was puzzled at the timebecause you see i did not know youbut how anyone who did know you could think you guilty passes my comprehension  i call it infamous mr hudson added warmly they must be a pack of fools down at that place lewes  well captain wilson said i am glad you have told me your story for i have all along been puzzled as to what made you give up your trade and emigrate at your age however the matter is explained now but now you have told me i see no reason whatever why you should not accept my offer in the first place no one but ourselves will know your history in the next if they did so that is no reason why you should not hold the appointment no man is free from the risk of being suspected unjustly you have been acquitted by a jury of your countrymen and even did everyone know it no one dare throw it in your teeth  no i repeat if you like i have no doubt that i can obtain for you an appointment as officer in the constabulary you need not give me an answer now think it over for a week you will have plenty of time for mr hudson insists upon your taking up your abode with him when you land  that i do mr hudson said i have a place a mile out of sydney and there you will stop for a bit then i hope you will go up the country with me for a month or two and learn the ways of the place till captain wilson has got an appointment for youthat is if you quite decide to accept his offer instead of mine but remember if ever you get tired of thief hunting the offer will still be open to you  sydney was at that time but a very small place for the great wave of emigrants had not yet begun to flow and the colony was in its early infancy as soon as the vessel cast anchor mr hudson and his party landed taking reuben with them and an hour later he found himself installed as a guest at the squatters house  it was large and comfortable surrounded by a broad verandah and standing in a garden blooming with flowers many of which were wholly unknown to reuben he had of course before landing laid aside the suit he had worn on board ship and had dressed himself in his best and the heartiness and cordiality of his host his wife and daughter soon made him feel perfectly at his ease  we are in the rough you know mr hudson said to him everyone is in the rough here at present twenty years hence things may settle down but now we all have to take them as we find them the chief difficulty is servants you see almost every other man here is either a convict an exconvict or a runaway sailor about as bad material as you could want to see for the formation of what they call at home a genteel establishment the number of emigrants who come out is small for the most part they have a little money and take up land or at any rate go up country and look for work there a few of course who have been sent out by their friends at home to get rid of them loaf about sydney and spend their money till they are driven to take the first job that offers well they may do for shepherds in places where no drink is to be had for love or money but you would scarcely care about having them as butlers so you see we are driven to the three classes i spoke of i have been exceptionally lucky the man who carried the things upstairs just now and who is my chief man here is an exconvict  reuben looked surprised  he was assigned to me when he first got his ticket of leave i found him a good hand and he stood by me pluckily when my station was attacked by the blacks so next time i came down to the town i asked what he had been sent out here for i found it was for having been concerned in a poaching fray in which some of the game keepers got badly hurt well that wasnt so much against him you know so i got talking to him one day and found out that he came from my part of england i found he had a wife so i sent home money to some friends and asked them to send her out which they did and finding she had before she married him been cook in a gentlemans family i engaged her here and sent up the country for watson to come down i had told him nothing about it for i thought perhaps his wife might refuse to come out or might have married again or anything else  well the meeting was a happy one as you may suppose and i then settled him down hereat least it wasnt here but a smaller place i had thenand he has been with me ever since his time was out some years ago but that has made no difference nothing would induce him to leave me and i would not part with him for any amount for a more faithful and trusty fellow never lived and when i go away i know everything will go along like clockwork as for his wife shes a treasure and she knows how to cook a dinner as you will acknowledge presently  they form the mainstay of my establishment besides that theres an old chap who looks after the garden goes down to the town and does odd jobs he was a sailor he was landed here when his vessel came into port five years ago he had fallen off the yard on to the deck and had broken half his ribs he was taken to the government hospital they did not think at first that he would ever get over it but though he pulled through it was clear he would never be fit for any hard work so the surgeon of the hospital spoke of the case to me and i said i thought i could find a job that would suit him and here he has been he is quite strong enough for all the work i want him to do and i can trust him about the place of course he breaks out and gets drunk occasionally but one cannot expect to find a man perfect  then there is a black boythey call them all boys herehe looks after the horses and has two black boysthey are boysunder him i found him out on the plains he had been shot by some bushranging scoundrels out of pure mischief i should say he was insensible when i found him but i saw that he was alive and managed to get him up on my horse and took him home we were six weeks getting him round for the bullet had gone through his body it would have killed a white man in an hour but these black fellows are as hard as nails  my wife nursed him for she was living up the country with me at that time and when he got well he declared that he would never leave us i dont know that i was much gratified at the news at first but i soon found out that sam as i called him was a valuable fellow about a place he could turn his hand to everything but i found he was specially happy when he was engaged about the horses so at last i handed over that department to him and when we set up this place here i brought him down with me and made him head of the stables its fifteen years since i first picked him up and i dont think i have ever had cause to find fault with him since  so you see though my establishment cant be called a genteel its a thoroughly goodworking one and i doubt if theres a man in the colony who is as well off as i am  when we go up country they all go with me except the sailor who remains in charge hes a great man i can tell you when hes left in what he calls command of the ship hes got hold of two old muskets and a brace of pistols and these he always loads before we start so as to be ready to repel boarders he looks out sharply too for i have never lost a thing since he came and when you consider what a number of gentry there are about here with experience in housebreaking i think thats pretty well he is always drunk and incapable for three or four days after our return as a reward to himself for having kept from drink all the time we are away  dinner is ready frances hudson said running into the room here you are papa talking away as usual whenever you get the chance now run upstairs quickly both of you for rachel will not be pleased if you let the first dinner get cold after she has been doing her best to turn out something special in honour of the occasion ever since she heard the paramatta was in port  i wont be a minute frances  ah here comes wilson i was wondering what had become of him he promised to come on as soon as he had seen his chief  the dinner was an excellent one and fully bore out mr hudsons assertion with respect to his cook all were in high spirits with the exception of mrs hudson who was cool in her manners to the young officer and was evidently desirous of showing her disapproval of his engagement to her daughter which had only taken place two days before  i have news for you reuben captain wilson said in the first pause of conversation i saw the chief and told him i wanted an appointment for a young friend of mine who had come out in the paramatta and who had shown great pluck and presence of mind in an affair at the cape which i described to him he said that he could appoint you at once as young houghton a district superintendent was killed three weeks ago in an affair with the bush rangers up country he said he was very glad to hear of someone likely to make a good officer to fill his place so if you make up your mind to be a constable the place is ready for you  thank you very much sir reuben said i was thinking the matter over last night and quite made up my mind to accept the place you were kind enough to offer me if you think me fit to fill it  i have no fear on that score reuben i am sure you will do credit to my recommendation so then we may consider that as settled  there grumbled mr hudson thats just like you wilson you upset all my plans it was arranged he was to come up to my station and there before you are on shore two hours you arrange the whole business and i suppose you will be wanting him to get into his uniform and be off before a weeks out  i daresay we can manage a fortnight captain wilson laughed and i have no doubt he will have plenty of opportunities for visiting you later on indeed i dont know why he should not be able to look you up as soon as you get there he will of course be placed under an old hand for six months to learn his duties and get to speak a little of the native lingo  hartwell who has your district is as good a man as he can be put with he is a careful officer though perhaps a little slow but he will be a good man for reuben to serve under and i know the chief will put him with him if i ask him as it cant make any difference where he goes first  well if you can arrange that wilson i will forgive you and now where are you going to  for the time i am not going anywhere in particular captain wilson replied the chief says he thinks that things have got rather slack since i have been away there are several bands of bush rangers who have been doing a deal of mischief up country so to begin with he wishes me to make a tour of inspection and to report generally after that i think i shall be settled here for a time at any rate it will be my headquarters i think it probable the chief himself will be going home on leave before very long  the sooner you are settled here the better mr hudson said for i know i shall get no peace now till frances is settled too ever since she was a child when she once made up her mind that she wanted a new toy she worried me till i got it for her and you are the last new toy  oh papa how can you say so frances said laughing and colouring as far as i am concerned it may be months and months  oh that is all very well mr hudson broke in i know what you want you want wilson here to be always neglecting his duty and galloping over from the other end of the colony to see you no no my dear if wilson is a wise fellow he will bring you to book as soon as i can either build or get hold of a place fit for you we shall be having no peace now every time he is off on duty you will be picturing him as engaged in some dreadful struggle with bush rangers and blacks and if letters dont come as often as you expect them you will be fretting yourself into a fever  what nonsense papa i know of course george will have to do his duty i dont suppose hes always going to be tied to my apron string  you take my advice reuben mr hudson said dont you go and lose your heart for if you once do theres a police officer spoiled it dont so much matter with wilson because he has done his share of dangerous work and is pretty well up at the top of the tree but a man that has to tackle bush rangers and blacks ought not to have a woman at home thinking of him  there is no fear of that for a good many years to come reuben laughed are these blacks really formidable fellows captain wilson  formidable to the settlers captain wilson said but not to us they drive off cattle and sheep and sometimes attack solitary stations and murder every soul there but they seldom stand up in fair fight when we come down upon them but they fight hard sometimes when they are acting with bush rangers  bush rangers are mostly escaped convicts are they not  almost always captain wilson replied except that of course they have among them a few men such as runaway sailors and neerdowells who get sick of shepherding and take to the bush but the great proportion are convicts it is not to be wondered at when you look at the life many of these men have led at home and the monotony and hardship of their lives in many of the upcountry stations allotted to men as ignorant and sometimes almost as brutal as themselves  some of them too escape from the road gangs and these are generally the worst for as often as not they may have killed a warder in making their escape and know that it will go hard with them if they are caught  it may be said that there are two sorts of bush rangers the one are men who have taken to the bush simply from a desire of regaining their liberty sometimes they join parties of blacks and live with them sometimes two or three get together and all the harm they do is to carry off an occasional sheep for food and the other kind are desperadoesmen who were a scourge in england and are a scourge here who attack lonely stations and are not content with robbing but murder those who fall into their hands  they are in fact wild beasts to whom no mercy is to be extended and who knowing it will fight to the last they are not easy to hunt down their instinct having made them wary and being generally in league with the blacks who are as cunning as foxes and can run pretty nearly as fast as a horse can gallop they are kept very well informed as to our movements and the country being so immense we should never run them down were it not for our native trackers  these fellows are to the full as sharp as the red indians of north america they seem in fact to have the instinct of dogs and can follow a track when the keenest whites eye cannot detect the smallest trace of a footprint it is something marvellous what some of them will do  have you many of these trackers in your employment  there are one or two attached to every upcountry station they are in fact our bloodhounds and although some of our men pick up a little of their craft we should do nothing without them  the next morning reuben met captain wilson down in sydney and was taken by him to the chief of the constabulary who at once made out his appointment on his return mr hudson again started with him for the town and insisted upon ordering his equipment as reuben saw that he would be hurt by any shadow of denial he accepted mr hudsons kind offer although he had intended to ask captain wilson to make an advance of pay in order that he might get what was necessary he could not however have purchased such an outfit as mr hudson insisted on getting for him the latter ordering not only uniforms but suits of plain clothes together with saddlery holsters a sword and a brace of excellent doublebarrelled pistols he did not need to buy a horse having in his stables one in every way suitable being at once quiet and fastit was indeed one of the most valuable animals in the colony  you will have to keep your eyes open reuben he said as he gave him the horse or he will be stolen from you these bush ranger fellows are always well mounted and anyone at an upcountry station who has an animal at all out of the ordinary way has to keep his stable door locked and sleep with one eye open and even then the chances are strongly in favour of his losing his horse before long these fellows know that their lives often depend upon the speed of their horse and naturally spare no pains to get hold of a good one  ah i have a good idea  jim he shouted to one of the black boys come here  the lad who was about eighteen years of age trotted up  jim this gentleman is going to be a police officer and hes going to take the bay with him now he wants a good servant will you go with him  the lad looked longingly at the horse which he had groomed and was very fond of but he shook his head  i no leave massa hudson  yes but i wish you to go jim this gentleman is a great friend of mine and when bad black man attacked young missy he saved her life so i want him to be taken good care of and the horse too and to see no one steals it so someone i can trust must go with him if you dont like him for a master after you have tried him jim you can come back to me again you have been a good boy and i have no wish to get rid of you but this gentleman dont know the ways of the country and i want to be sure he has someone with him he can trust  the lad looked at reuben gravely with his small eyes deeply sunken under the projecting eyebrows  jim will go he said he look after white man and tartar to please massa hudson and young missy  thats right jim his employer said  thats a good stroke of business he went on as he turned away with reuben if you treat these black fellows well and they get attached to you they are faithful to death  you will see that fellow will never let your horse out of his sight if you ride twenty miles across country there he will be by your side as you dismount ready to take it and looking as fresh as paint at night he will sleep in the stable and will be ready at all times and places to make a fire and cook a damper or a bit of meat if you are lucky enough to have one by you all the people about the place would do anything i believe for frances and the fact that you have saved her life will bind this boy to you at first afterwards he will get to care for you for yourself  a fortnight later reuben in his uniform as an officer of the constabulary rode out of sydney his baggage had been sent on three days before by a waggon returning up country jim trotted with an easy stride behind him reuben at first was inclined to ride slowly in order to give his attendant time to keep up with him but he soon found that whatever pace he went the lad kept the same distance behind without any apparent exertion and he was therefore able to choose his own pace without reference to jims comfort  four years passed reuben whitney gave every satisfaction to his superiors and was considered a zealous and effective young officer so far he had not been placed in a position of great responsibility for although for the last two years he had been in charge of a district it was not far from sydney and his duties consisted principally in hunting for convicts who had made their escape in looking after refractory ticketofleave men and in ordinary constabulary work he had learned in that time to become a firstrate rider and a good shot with a pistol accomplishments which would be of vital service when he was ordered to an upcountry station for his pistols he had as yet however had no actual use as neither bush rangers nor natives penetrated so far into the settlement  at the end of the four years service he received a letter from captain wilson who had just succeeded to the chief command of the constabulary ordering him to hand over charge of the district to the young officer who was the bearer of the letter and to report himself at headquarters  reuben was now nearly threeandtwenty and had grown into a very powerful young man a life spent for the most part on horseback had hardened his muscles and filled out his frame he stood about five feet nine but looked shorter owing to his great width of shoulders he was still quiet in manner but he had the same bright and pleasant expression which had characterized him as a boy and his visits to sydney where he was introduced by captain wilson and mr hudson into the best society had given him ease and self possession  the native jim was still with him he had become greatly attached to his master and his fidelity and devotion had been of the greatest service to him and go where he would the black was always at his heels  on his presenting himself at sydney captain wilson said after the first greetings  i know you have been a little disappointed reuben because hitherto you have been at stations where you have had but little opportunity of distinguishing yourself however i thought better to keep you at quiet work until you were thoroughly master of your duties and had moreover got your full strength i dont know whether you have quite arrived at that yet but i think you will do anyhow and he smiled as he looked at reubens shoulders  i think i am as strong as most of them reuben said smiling too four years millwrights work and four years on horseback in this bracing air ought to make one strong if theres anything in one to begin with i think i shall do in that respect  i think so reuben i dont think there are many men in the force who could hold their own with you in a grapple  and now to business you have heard of that affair of inspector thomas in the goora districtit was a bad business he and two of his men were out after some natives who had driven off cattle and he was set upon by a party of bush rangers and he and his men killed  so i heard sir reuben said quietly  well i have decided in sending you up in his place it is a bad districtthe worst we have at presentand it needs a man of great resolution and intelligence i am sure that you have plenty of both and that i cannot make a better choice than in sending you there your age is the only thing against younot with me you know but others may think that i have done wrong in selecting so young an officerbut you see i know my man i know too that several of the inspectors are getting too old for this sort of work i do not mean too old perhaps in point of years but they are married men with families and for desperate work i prefer men without encumbrances  the post should be held by an inspector but i cannot promote you at present it would be putting you over the heads of too many but you will have a good chance of earning early promotion and i know that is what you like  thank you very much captain wilson i will do my best to show myself worthy of your confidence  you will have all your work cut out for you reuben the district has all along been a most troublesome one the number of settlers at present is small there is a good deal of higher bush than usual about it which makes it very difficult to run these fellows down and the natives are specially troublesome besides which at present there are two or three of the worst gangs of bush rangers in the colony somewhere in that country you will have to be cautious as well as bold reuben it is a dangerous service i am sending you on still the more danger the more credit to you  you could not have given me a station i should have liked better and i hope ere long i may be able to give you a good account of the bush rangers  and now reuben if you will call again in an hour i shall be free and then i will drive you home you need not start for a day or two and you will of course stay with me till you do    chapter 10 an upcountry district   mrs wilson received reuben as usual with the greatest cordiality but she exclaimed loudly when she heard that he was going to the goora district  you dont mean it george you cant mean that you are going to send reuben to that dreadful place why we are always hearing of murders and robberies there and you know the last inspector was killed and the one before recalled because you said he had lost his nerve and now you are sending reuben there  but i look upon it as the greatest honour mrs wilson being chosen for such a station and you see there will be capital chances of distinguishing myself and getting promoted  and capital chances of being killed mrs wilson said in a vexed tone i do call it too bad george  but my dear we want a man of pluck and energy besides you know we have been getting into hot water over that district the press have been saying very severe things about our incompetence to protect the outlying settlements and i was obliged to choose a man who will give satisfaction and you will agree with me that reuben will do that  of course he will mrs wilson agreed i shouldnt be alive now if he hadnt had plenty of pluck and energy but for that very reason you ought not to send him to such a dangerous post  but i wish to give him an opportunity for distinguishing himself he wants to get on and i want to push him on but you see i cant promote him over the heads of some eight or ten men senior to him unless he does something a little out of the way  well i dont like it george i tell you frankly i always thought he was wrong to go into the constabulary at all instead of accepting papas offer i cant think why you men are so fond of fighting when you could choose a quiet and comfortable life  but it is not always so quiet and comfortable frances as a good many have found in the district he is going to and after all it is less dangerous fighting bush rangers and natives when you are prepared for it than to be woke up of a night with a band of them thundering at your door and with no assistance within twenty miles  as frances wilson remembered how in her childish days her fathers place had been for three days beset with blacks she had no answer ready for the argument  well i do hope reuben she said if you do go to this horrid place you will take care of yourself and not be rash  hes going to take care of others frances you know if he had taken care of himself and hadnt been rash you would not have come so well out of that malay business i am sure he looks as if he could take care of himself doesnt he  yes he is big enough and strong enough mrs wilson agreed but thats no good against spears or boomerangs to say nothing of rifles and pistols  why frances you are not generally a croaker her husband said lightly but for once you seem to be determined to do your best to frighten reuben before he starts  mrs wilson laughed  no i dont want to frighten him george i only want to make him careful  i will be as careful as i can mrs wilson that boy jim is a treasure i will warrant if there are any black fellows about he will sniff them out somehow that fellow has a nose like a hound he has always been most useful to me but he will be invaluable at goora  two days afterwards reuben left for his new command it took him eight days to reach it his headquarters were at goora a settlement of some twenty houses besides the barracks in which the constabulary force consisting of a sergeant eighteen constables and two native trackers were quartered the sergeant a northcountry irishman named oconnor was somewhat surprised when reuben rode up to the station for the officers previously in command had been much older men  reubens own quarters were in a cottage close to the main building and he asked the sergeant to come in the evening  now sergeant he said after a little preliminary talk i have been sent up by captain wilson with instructions to root out these bands of bush rangers  the sergeant smiled grimly  we have been doing our best for the last three years sir but we have not made much of a hand at it  no reuben agreed and i dont suppose of course that i am going to succeed all at once in the first place tell me frankly what sort of men have we got  the men are good enough sir but they have certainly got disheartened lately one way and another we have lost something like ten men in the last two years and of course that last affair with poor mr thomas was a bad one  i understand reuben said quietly some of them are not quite so eager to meet the bush rangers as they used to be  well that is perhaps about it sir but i must say the men have been tremendously hardly workedpretty nigh night and day in the saddle often called out by false news to one end of the district and then to find when they return that those scoundrels have been down playing their games at some station at the other end its enough to dishearten a man  so it is sergeant i was speaking to captain wilson about it and saying that if we are to succeed we ought to have some fresh hands who will take up the work with new spirit we are seven below our force at present and he has promised to send me up fifteen new hands so there will be eight to be relieved i will leave it to you to pick out the men to go mind put it to them that they are to be relieved simply because captain wilson thinks they have had their share of hard work and should therefore be sent to a quiet station for a time just pick out the men whom you think would be most pleased to go  very well sir i am glad to hear the news for to tell you the truth i do think we want a little fresh blood amongst us  three days later the new detachment arrived and reuben saw at once that captain wilson had chosen a picked set of young men about half of them were freshly enlisted in the force the others had all been employed at upcountry stations and were well acquainted with the nature of the work before them the same afternoon the eight men picked out by sergeant oconnor as being the least useful on the station started for sydney most of them well pleased at being relieved from their arduous duties  reuben found that there were in the office a great many letters from settlers asking for protection it was impossible to comply with all these but after consultation with oconnor he sent five parties of three men each to as many exposed stations keeping ten in hand to move as required  taking jim and two of the constables who had been longest on the station he spent two months in traversing his district from end to end and making himself thoroughly acquainted with its geographical features for he felt that until he had mastered these he should only be working in the dark for a time the outrages had ceased the bush rangers having shifted their quarters and the natives withdrawn after the murder of the late inspector this was a great relief to reuben as it permitted him to gain an insight into the country before setting to work in earnest  upon his tour he and his followers were everywhere most hospitably received at the stations at which they halted everywhere he heard the same tale of sheep killed cattle and horses driven off and the insolent demeanour of the natives  i was thinking of giving it up and moving back into the more populated districts one of the settlers said to reuben but now you have come i will hold on for a bit longer and see how it turns out you look to me the right sort of fellow for the post but the difficulty is with such a large scattered district as yours to be everywhere at once what i have often thought of is that it would be a good thing if the whole district were to turn out and go right into the heart of the black country and give them a lesson  from what i hear reuben said it will be next to impossible for us to find them the country is so vast and covered with bush that there would be no searching it they have no fixed villages and the want of water would render it impossible for us to go very far but the worst point would be that they all seem to be well informed as to what is going on i suppose they get warnings from the native herdsmen and servants and if we were all together to enter their country we must leave the stations unprotected and we should find them in ashes on our return  yes that is true the settler said i suppose it couldnt be done but its anxious work sleeping here night after night with ones rifle by ones bedside never certain at what hour one may be woke by the yelling of the blacks but they are not as bad as the bush rangers if the blacks can but drive off your cattle they are contented you have got nothing else that is much use to them the bush rangers dont want your cattle beyond a head or two for present use but they want everything else youve got and whether you like it or not is quite immaterial to them thank god i have got no money in the place and i and my three men can make a pretty good fight of it but i pity the men with wives and daughters  well i hope we shall soon put a stop to it reuben said cheerfully we will give them a lesson if we catch them you may be quite sure  i hope so the settler said but you folks have been mighty unlucky lately never seem to have been at the right place at the right time not that i am surprised at that in such a district but somehow they never come up with the fellows afterwards  no they seem to have had bad luck reuben agreed i hope we shall do better now  three days after his return from his last visit of inspection of his district a settler rode at full speed up to the station  captain he saidfor although reuben had no right to that title he was always so called by the settlersthe blacks have been down at my place they have killed my two shepherds and driven off the sheep  sergeant oconnor turn out the men at once reuben shouted see that their ammunition is all right and let each man take a water skin and four days provisions in his haversack  when was it he asked turning to the settler again  some time yesterday afternoonat least i judge so one of the men was to have come in for supplies and when night came and he hadnt come in i began to be afraid something was wrong for i knew that they were getting short so this morning at daybreak i rode out with the hands i have about the house we could see nothing of the sheep so we rode straight to the mens hut there lying some twenty yards away was the body of one of the men riddled with spear holes he had evidently been running to the hut for shelter when he was overtaken i did not stop to look for the other for no doubt he had been killed too  well we will do what we can for you reuben said i will be ready in five minutes  he ran into the house buckled on his sword put some cold meat and a small bag of flour into his haversack together with some dampers jim had just cooked and then went out again jim had already brought his horse round to the door before mounting he took the pistols out of the holsters and examined them carefully  by this time the sergeant and ten men were in the saddle and placing himself at their head with the settler whose name was blount he rode off at full speed followed by his men the two native trackers and jim reuben soon reined his horse in  it will not do to push them too hard at first there is no saying how far we shall have to go  do you mean to follow them into their own country mr blount asked  i do reuben said i will follow them till i catch them if i have to go across australia  thats the sort mr blount said i expect you will find halfadozen other fellows at my station by the time you get there i sent my hand off on horseback to the stations near to tell them what had taken place and that i had ridden off to you and asking them to come round  how far is it reuben asked  about forty miles  but your horse will never be able to do it reuben said  i got a fresh horse at a friends four miles from your station so i am all right  they will have more than a days start of us reuben remarked presently  yes thirtysix hours for you will have to stop at my place tonight but they cant travel very fast with sheep you know  no reuben agreed if they had had cattle it would have been useless following them but with sheep we may come up to them especially if they dont think they will be followed far  no thats my hope they will know i had forty miles to ride to your station besides had it not been that i was expecting the shepherd in for supplies i might not have found it out for two or three days so i expect they will think that they are pretty safe from pursuit they have never been followed far into the bush its nasty work you see  its got to be done reuben said it is impossible to keep guard everywhere and the only way to put a stop to these outrages is to teach the blacks that punishment will follow wherever they go  it was late in the afternoon before they arrived at mr blounts station they found fourteen or fifteen of the neighbouring settlers gathered there they came out as the sound of the trampling of the horses was heard several of them were known to reuben from his having stopped at their stations  glad to see you captain but i am afraid you are too late said dick caister a young settler whose station lay about twelve miles away  that remains to be proved reuben replied as he dismounted  oh they have got twentyfour hours start and its too late to do anything tonight they must be thirty miles away in the bush already  if they were a hundred i would follow them reuben said  there was an exclamation of surprise and something like a cheer on the part of some of the younger men  the difficulties are very great one of the elder settlers said there is neither food nor water to be found in the bush  i know its not an easy business reuben said quietly but as to food we can carry it with us as to water there must be water in places for the natives can no more go without drinking than we can there must be streams and water holes here and there but however difficult it is i mean to attempt it it is the only way of bringing the blacks to book there can never be safety among the outlying settlements unless the fellows are taught a lesson  and now gentlemen before we go further i want to say this i know that you are all ready to help that you are all thirsting to wipe out old scores with the blacks but at the same time i would point out to you that it is likely enough that the bush rangers who certainly work with the blacks will follow up this stroke therefore it will not do to leave the stations defenceless i do not want a large force with me if we once overtake the blacks i have no fear whatever of being able to give a good account of them therefore i would urge upon all of you who are married men that it is of the first importance that you should stay at home in case the bush rangers take the opportunity of our being away to pay you a visit that is the first thing to be thought of if any of the others like to go with us i shall be very glad of their assistance we may be away for a week or more for ought i know  that is certainly the best plan captain dick caister said as you say let the married men stop at home and guard their stations i think the rest of us will all go with you  there was a chorus of approval eight of those present were married men and though reluctant to give up the thought of punishing the blacks they were yet glad that they were not called upon to leave their wives and families with many good wishes for the success of the expedition they at once mounted and rode off to their respective stations some of which were more than twenty miles away  now for ways and means reuben said what spare horses have you mr blount  i have only two besides the one i am riding  i should like to take at least six we must carry a good store of provisions  i dont think you need trouble about that mr blount said we must take a supply of flour with us and of course tea and sugar and a few bottles of rum will not be amiss all these i can furnish but as to meat i do not think we need trouble going as fast as the blacks will travel there are sure to be lots of the sheep fall by the way the blacks will eat as many as they can but even a black cannot stuff himself beyond a certain extent and there will be plenty for us  yes i did not think of that reuben replied in that case two spare horses will be enough  it would be a good thing to have a few with us though one of the young men said my place is only six miles off i will ride over and bring back three with me they are all good ones and i should be sorry to find they were gone when i get back i can lead one my black boy can ride another and lead the third it is likely enough some of the horses may give out or get speared if the blacks make a fight of it and half a dozen spare horses would come in very handy  reuben thought the plan was a good one whereupon two of the others also volunteered to ride over and fetchthe one three and the other twohorses  that will make ten altogether with blounts two we shall travel all the faster because we can ride the spare horses by turns  the three settlers rode off at once and returned late at night with the spare horses they had not been idle at mr blounts a bullock had been killed and cut up and a considerable portion cooked so that each of the twenty men going on the expedition would start with ten pounds of cooked meat in order to save the time that would be spent in halting to cook the carcass of any sheep they might come upon the question of weight was immaterial as the meat could be packed on the spare horses  as soon as day broke the party were in their saddles mr blount led them first to the hut near which he had found his shepherd killed the native trackers now took up the search the body of the other shepherd was found half a mile away it was in a sitting position by a tree the skull was completely smashed in by the blow of a waddy and it was evident that a native had crept up behind him and killed him before he was conscious that any danger was at hand the trackers were not long in finding the place where the sheep had been collected together and driven off and a broad track of trampled grass showed clearly enough the direction which had been taken  how many of the black fellows do you think there were reuben asked one of the trackers  great many black fellow captain he replied  what do you call a great many reuben asked  twenty thirty captain cant say how many no use captain look for dem gone right away into de bush never find them  i am going to try anyhow reuben said now do you lead the way  i tink dere are more dan thirty black fellow jim said to reuben as they started quite a crowd of dem me no much like those two black fellow and he nodded towards the trackers who were running on ahead no good those fellows  what makes you think that jim  two days ago jim saw dem talking wid black fellow half a mile from the station not know jim saw dem secret sort of talk why dey never find de tracks before black fellows and bush rangers always get away jim tink those fellows no good  reuben himself had often thought it singular that such continued bad luck should have attended the efforts of his predecessor to hunt down the bush rangers but the thought that they had been put off their scent by the trackers had not occurred to him he had the greatest faith in jims sagacity and now that the idea was presented to him it seemed plausible enough  very good jim you keep your eye on those fellows i will do the same we shall soon find out if they are up to any tricks  jim had been running by his masters stirrup while this conversation had been going on and he now dropped into his usual place at the rear of the party for some miles the trail was followed at a hand gallop for the grass was several inches in height and the trail could be followed as easily as a road the country then began to change the ground was poorer and more arid and clumps of low brush grew here and there still there was no check in the speed the marks made by the frightened flock were plain enough even to the horsemen and bits of wool left behind on the bushes afforded an unmistakable testimony to their passage  they were not going so fast here mr blount said after dismounting and examining the footprints do not go in pairs as they did at first the flock has broken into a trot ah there is the first ahead  in a hundred yards they came upon the skin and head of a sheep nothing else remained unable to keep up with the flock it had been speared cut up and eaten raw by the blacks in the next mile they came upon the remains of two more then the track widened out and the footprints were scattered and confused the horses were reined up and jim and the trackers examined the ground jim returned in a minute or two  black fellows give em a rest here could no go any furder lie down and pant  one of the trackers then came up  they stop here captain five six hours till moon rise make fire kill sheep and have feast  reuben and some of the settlers rode over to the spot to which the tracker pointed  confound them blount exclaimed look there there are at least twenty heads  so there are reuben said there must have been a lot of natives  yes there must have been a good many the settler agreed but not so many perhaps as you would think nobody has ever found out yet how much these blacks can eat when they make up their mind to it but two could certainly devour a sheep they will eat till they cant sit upright  they would hardly eat as much as that with a long journey before them reuben said but allow only three to a sheep there must be sixty of them my man said there were a good many more than the trackers put it down at  so much the better i only hope they will show fight  after five minutes halt the ride was continued for the next three hours then three dead sheep were passed this time the flesh had not been devoured but the poor beasts had in every case been speared  savage brutes reuben exclaimed they might at least have given the sheep a chance of life when they could go no further instead of wantonly slaughtering them  thats their way always mr blount said they kill from pure mischief and love of slaughter even when they dont want the meat but i dont suppose it makes much difference i expect the sheep have dropped as much from thirst as from fatigue and they would probably have never been got up again after they once fell i fancy we shall come upon a stream before long i have never been out as far as this before but i know that there is a branch of the nammo crosses the bush here somewhere  another five miles and they came upon the river the wet season was only just over and the river was full from bank to bank it was some thirty yards wide and from two to three feet deep a score of sheep lay dead in the water they had apparently rushed headlong in to quench their thirst and had either drunk till they fell or had been trampled under water by their companions pressing upon them from behind  for the next ten miles the track was plain enough then they came to a series of downs covered with a short grass at the foot of these another long halt had been made by the blacks  we must have come twentyfive miles reuben said  quite that captain the flock must have been dead beat by the time they got here i should think they must have stopped here last night we will soon seethere is one of their fireplaces  the settler dismounted and put his hand into the ashes  yes he said they are warm still they must have camped here last night they started when the moon rose no doubt thus they have eight or nine hours start of us only and as they cant travel fast after such a journey as they had yesterday we ought to be able to catch them long before night  they will go better today than they did yesterday mr blount said they were overdriven to start with and that was what knocked them up but the blacks will begin to feel themselves safe today and will let them go their own pace sheep can do twenty miles in a day if not hurried  well at any rate reuben said we will give our horses a couple of hours rest it is just eleven oclock now and i should think everyone is ready for a meal  there was a chorus of assent the troop dismounted at once the girths were loosened the bits taken from the horses mouths and they were turned loose to graze in the long grass at the foot of the hill there was no fear of their attempting to stray after their journey of the morning some of the men set to to cut brush and in a few minutes a fire was lighted one of the sheep of which there were several lying about was skinned and cut up and slices on skewers of green wood were soon frizzling over the fire  twenty minutes later the water in a large pot hanging over the fire was boiling three or four handfuls of tea were thrown in and with the fried mutton cold damper and tea a hearty meal was made then pipes were produced and lighted while several of the men lying down and shading their faces with their broad hats indulged in a doze  one oclock reuben said at last looking at his watch it is time to be moving again  the horses were fetched in the bridles replaced and the girths tightened  now which way reuben asked the trackers  along here captain by de foot of de hill de trail is plain enough  it was so a track of some width was trampled in the grass  reuben was about to give the order to proceed when he caught jims eye and saw that the black wished to speak to him privately  what is it jim he asked going apart from the rest  that not de way captain a hundred two hundred sheep gone that way wid four or five black fellow de rest have all gone over de hill  are you sure jim  me quite sure sar de ground very hard but while de captain smoke him pipe jim went over de hill saw plenty sign of sheep went straight uphill and then turned away to de left dis little party here hab only gone to frow white man off de trail  the trackers ought to have seen that as well as you jim reuben said angrily  dey see sar sure enough could no help seeing wid half an eye you see sar dose fellows up to no good lead party wrong if dey can dont say sar jim told you if you say dat put em on their guard massa ride along the trail for a bit just as if talk wid jim about odder affair den after little way begin to talk about trail being too small den turn and come back here and go over de hill  a very good idea jim i will do as you say    chapter 11 the black fellows   a few minutes after his conversation with jim the party started following the broad track through the grass along the foot of the hill reuben informed mr blount of what jim had told him  by jove i think he is right the settler said the track is as broad as it was but it is nothing like so much trampled down but if your fellow says the main body have gone over the hill why are you following this track  reuben gave his reasons and said that his man had before had suspicions that the trackers were in communication with the wild blacks  he thinks thats why it is that they have so frequently failed here to catch any of these fellows  i shouldnt be at all surprised mr blount said savagely the best thing would be to put a bullet into each of the rascals heads  i think jims idea is best reuben said now that we have once got our eyes open they wont be able to do us any more harm and my black fellow will see we follow the trail right i dont want them to see we have any suspicions of them as that would put them on their guard and by keeping our eye upon them we may be able to turn the tables  that is so mr blount agreed what are you going to do then  i will call to them in a minute or two and tell them that it is your opinion that only a small portion of the flock have come this way then we will have a consultation and no doubt some of your friends will notice that the ground is not much trampled then we will decide to ride back to the point from which we started and will follow the other trail  yes that will do very well the settler agreed  reuben at once called to the trackers who were trotting on ahead and then ordered a halt the two blacks came back  joe reuben said mr blount thinks that the main body of the flock have not come this way he says he thinks only a hundred or two have come the ground does not look to me anything like so much trampled as it was before we halted  i tink most of dem hab come along here the tracker said sullenly  what do you think reuben asked the other settlers who had gathered round  i did not notice it before dick caister said but now blount has pointed it out i agree with him entirely there are nothing like the full number of sheep have passed along here i should say that they have not gone along more than two or three deep  there was a general chorus of assent  you cant have been keeping your eyes open reuben said to the trackers sharply if you dont look sharp in future we shall quarrel  come gentlemen let us ride back to the halting place and see if we cannot find out which way the main body have gone  ten minutes riding took them back to their starting place  they must have gone over the hill reuben said they certainly have not kept along at the foot or we should see their tracks in this long grass  the trackers had exchanged a few words in a low tone and they now moved up the hill and began to examine the ground carefully  some of dem have gone this way captain  of course they have mr blount said a blind man might see that  the marks of the sheep were indeed plain enough to all when their attention had once been drawn to the subject on getting beyond the crest the trackers turned to the left and reuben saw that they felt it would be hopeless to attempt further to mislead a party containing several settlers who were perfectly capable of following the trail  jim had since speaking to his master remained in the rear of the troop after three miles riding across the downs they again came down upon a flat country thickly covered with brush here and there pieces of wool sticking to thorns were visible and the trackers went steadily on for some little time then their pace became slower and finally they stopped  trail ended captain  what do you mean by the trail ended reuben asked angrily why i can see a piece of wool on there ahead  dat so captain but only a few sheep hab passed here  some of the settlers dismounted and having examined the ground carefully declared that they were of the same opinion as the trackers  very well reuben said then in that case we must go back again to the foot of the hill they were all together there and we must take up the trail afresh  on reaching the foot of the hill jim and some of the settlers joined the trackers and penetrated the bush in all directions each returned bringing in pieces of wool  it is plain enough reuben said what they have done they have broken up into small parties and have scattered the question is what are we to do now  what do you think mr blount you have had more experience than anyone here and you are the most interested in our overtaking these rascals what do you recommend  i dont know what to recommend the settler said they have no doubt done it to confuse us in case we should follow so far and avoid being thrown off the scent the other side of the hill the band may really have scattered and gone off in small parties to different parts of the bush or again they may have scattered with the understanding that they will meet again at some given spot which may be ten and may be fifty miles ahead  the worst of it is reuben said i fear now that there is an end of all chance of coming up with them today and now the question of water comes in if we could have caught them before nightfall the horses having had a good drink at that stream could have done very well till wed gone another thirty miles but as that seems hopeless now we must consider seriously what we had best do before we go any further does anyone here know anything of the country ahead  there was a general silence  the horses can do very well tomorrow without water mr blount said they will chew the leaves of this scrub and can if pressed hold on for even two or three days upon it  in that case reuben said let us go on we will break up into three parties one shall go straight forward the other two moving to the right and left each following the tracks as well as they can we will not go much beyond a walk we have five more hours of daylight yet and the horses can manage another fifteen miles i will halt an hour before it gets dark and light a fire the smoke will be a guide to the other two parties who should not be more than a couple of miles to the right and left and they will then close in  if you can suggest any better plan than that mr blount please do so of course i see the objection that the blacks may make out the smoke and will know that they are being followed  yes that is an objection mr blount said but the chances are that they will know it without your telling them it is more than probable that some of them have remained behind on the watch and that they will have signalled our coming long ago  dey have done that sar jim who was standing close to reubens elbow put in jim saw smoke curl up from the top of de hill just when we turned when we lost the trail  why didnt you tell me before jim reuben asked  de captain didnt ask jim any question jim thought de captain see it for sure  i didnt see it jim i dont think any of us saw it we were all too much occupied looking for the trail another time you tell me what you see without my asking  well in that case mr blount there can be no harm in my making a smoke as they know already that they are pursued will you take charge of the right hand party sergeant oconnor will take command of the left do you each take a tracker with you i will take my boy three constables will go with each of your parties and four with me  will you gentlemen please to divide up so as to make seven altogether in each party without the natives  i need not tell you to keep a sharp lookout captain whitney we know the blacks are a very strong party and now they know that they are pursued they may as likely as not make a stand  yes that is quite possible reuben agreed will you please be careful that neither of your parties get more than two miles at the outside away from mine we can hear the sound of rifles at that distance if either party fires the others will of course hurry to their assistance now let us move forward  with jim in advance reubens party moved on the black carefully examining the ground and bushes as he went and occasionally somewhat to reubens surprise rising from the stooping position in which he was walking and looking back over his shoulder the motive was explained when jim exclaimed  dere captain dere are de signals again  reuben turned in the saddle on the crest of the hill behind him were three columns of smoke scarcely had he looked at them when the smoke ceased to ascend as if the fires had been suddenly put out  thats to tell them that we have divided in three parties reuben asked the black  jim nodded and proceeded on his way again  thats awkward reuben said i must warn the other two parties  so saying he at once ordered two of the constables to ride right and left and warn the others who were not as yet more than a quarter of a mile on either hand that the natives were aware that they had broken up and that the greatest caution must therefore be observed in ten minutes the two constables returned having performed their mission  although he had no reason to believe that the blacks were within ten miles of him reuben now took the precaution of sending one constable out on each flank to a distance of fifty yards a third was directed to keep with jim fifty yards ahead of the main body consisting of reuben himself a constable and two colonists occasionally reuben rode forward to question jim  how many sheep do you think have gone along the track you are following  about thirty sheep and three black fellow  how do you know there are three black fellows jim i can see marks sometimes of the sheeps feet but i have not seen a mans footprint at all  jim see em captain plain enough when dey all follow sheep not very plain to see but sometimes when de sheep want to scatter jim see one footmark on one hand and one on the other and sure to be one man behind  how far are the sheep ahead jim have you any idea  six eight hours sar when dey pass here but deres no saying how far they are now may be long way on may be only little way me tink dat they hab not gone so berry far dat smoke berry thin not see him more than ten miles  i wish you had said that before jim reuben said we would have kept together and have galloped on and taken our chance of finding them  might have found four or five of dem jim replied but de others all scattered no good to find dem till dey come together again  no you are right there jim we must catch them all together if we can there are some twelve hundred sheep somewhere ahead mr blount said there were about fifteen hundred driven off we have come upon a hundred dead ones and two or three hundred may have taken that turn to the right as you say it would be no good coming upon thirty  for four hours the party continued their journey  it is six oclock reuben said looking at his watch we will halt now and light that fire  two of the constables were told off to keep watch some fifty yards in front and the others dismounted and gathered together materials for a fire this was soon done and the smoke mounted straight and clear a signal to the other two parties to close in  suddenly a cry was heard from one of the sentries the men stooping round the fire leaped to their feet just in time to see one of the constables struck from his horse by a boomerang while a dozen spears whizzed through the air at the other he fell forward on his horse which carried him up to the fire as he fell from the saddle as it stopped he was caught by two of the others three spears had pierced him  stand to your arms steady for your lives reuben shouted  jim throw the horses at once and fasten their legs  we must defend ourselves here he continued turning to the others until help comes  not a moment was lost the little party threw themselves down in a circle each taking shelter behind a bush and jim speedily got the eight horses down in the centre for each party had with it three of the spare animals the whole time from the first alarm until all was ready to receive the natives did not occupy two minutes  the horses of the sentries had galloped wildly on both having been struck by spears and jim had no difficulty with the remainder which were all standing in a group when the alarm was given the owners not yet having removed their saddles  all was done without flurry or excitement although the yells of the natives rose from the bush all round them the bush was fortunately not very thick at the point where they had halted reuben having selected it for that very reason but the bushes were sufficiently near to each other to enable an enemy to creep up within thirty yards or so without being seen  dont throw away a shot reuben called out but pick off the blacks as they stand up to throw their spears  ah  the exclamation was accompanied by a shot from his rifle as a native rose suddenly from the bush and hurled his spear it missed reuben by an inch or two only but as his rifle flashed out the black threw up his hands and fell back in the bush  here sah dis make good shelter and jim propped up his saddle almost in front of him  thats a good idea jim help the others in the same way  illustration a fight with the black fellows  the five men were all engaged now the spears whizzed fast over and among them but most of them were thrown almost at random for the blacks soon learned that to raise themselves above the bushes to take aim was to court sudden death jim after distributing the saddles to their owners had lain down by the side of his master and loaded his rifle as fast as he discharged it reuben using his pistols as effectually as the rifle in the intervals  fortunately all the party were provided with these weapons had it not been so each man would have been liable to be rushed by the blacks every time he discharged his rifle as far as possible they fired by turns so that each man while loading was covered by the fire of those on his right and left  for half an hour the fight continued many of the blacks had fallen but they continued the assault as vigorously as before and all the defenders had received more or less serious wounds from the spears  the others ought to have been here long before this reuben said if they had followed my instructions i only hope they have not been attacked too but as we dont hear any firing that can hardly be so  i hope they will be up before dusk dick caister said it will be dark in another half an hour these fellows are only waiting for that to make a rush if they do it is all up with us  they will find it a tough job even then reuben said but the others must be here long before that i told them to keep within two miles of us they have had time to ride double that distance since we made the smoke for them  another ten minutes elapsed  hurrah reuben exclaimed i can hear the trampling of horses hoofs the moment they arrive make a rush for your horses and charge  i am afraid the horses are killed dick said ruefully  in that case reuben said we must get to our feet and pick off the blacks as they run they will get up like a covey of partridge as the horsemen come among them  a loud cheer was heard and the little party with an answering shout sprang to their feet and rifle to shoulder stood expecting the blacks to rise but the ears of the natives were sharper than those of the whites and they had begun to crawl away before the latter heard the approaching horsemen  finding this to be the case the party ran to their horses four exclamations of wrath and grief were heard for seven of the horses were completely riddled with spears  tartar however at his masters voice struggled to rise to his feet reuben aided by jim quickly threw off the hobbles and leaped on to its back as it rose to its feet just as mr blount with his party rode up  keep close together reuben exclaimed as he dashed forward we may find some of the scoundrels  but the chase was in vain it was already growing dusk and there was no saying in which direction the natives had crawled away in the bush after riding for a mile reuben reined in his horse  it is no use he said we may as well get back to the fire  what made you so late mr blount we were fighting for three quarters of an hour before you came up  i am very sorry mr blount replied somehow or other we went wrong altogether there is nothing to guide one in this flat bush and the tracker who was leading the way said he was certain he was going as you ordered him just before six oclock we halted and looked in the direction in which we expected to see your smoke but there were no signs of it presently one of the constables exclaimed  theres the smoke sir right behind us  i looked around and sure enough there was a column of smoke and a long way off it was  what have you been doing you rascal i said to the black theres the smoke right behind us you have been leading us wrong altogether  the black insisted that he was right and that the fire must have been made by the black fellows i didnt know what to make of it it was two or three minutes past six and i noticed when we halted before that your watch was exactly with mine so i said to the men  we will wait five minutes longer and if we see no other smoke you may be sure that that is made by captain whitney  we waited the five minutes and then i gave the word to start when one of the men exclaimed  the black fellows gone  sure enough he had slipped away without being noticed while we were looking for the smoke i felt sure now that something must be wrong and we galloped towards your smoke as fast as the horses could lay their feet to the ground when we were about half way we heard the sound of firing and i can tell you that we didnt lose a moment on the way after that have you had any losses  two of the constables are killed reuben said and we have all got some more or less ugly scratches my left arm is useless for a time i am afraid a spear went right through it i fear some of the others have worse hurts  what can have become of the sergeants party mr blount said  they must have gone the wrong way too reuben replied i told you i suspected those trackers of being in league with the blacks and i have no doubt your fellow led you purposely astray in order to give them an opportunity of cutting us off before you could arrive to our assistance i suppose the other party has been misled in the same way it is fortunate indeed that you made up your mind to ride for our smoke when you did a quarter of an hour later and you would have found only our bodies and would probably have been ambushed in turn  yes it has been a close thing indeed mr blount said i was wrong after what you told me to trust that black scoundrel so entirely but i own it never entered my mind that he was leading us astray  by this time they had reached the fire which was blazing high  how are you all reuben asked nobody badly hurt i hope  nothing very bad captain dick caister replied cheerfully we have all had our skin ripped up a bit but nothing very deep that dodge of the saddles of your black fellow saved us mine was knocked over half a dozen times by spears each of which would have done its business if it hadnt been for it i owe him my life so completely that i forgive him for making our horses a barricade to save yours  reuben laughed he had noticed when he ran for his horse that jim had thrown him in the centre of the others and their bodies completely sheltered him from the spears of the natives  it was not fair perhaps he said but my horse would have been killed as well as yours had he not done so and jim loves him almost as well as he does me he has watched over and guarded him for the last three years  i am not angry with him dick said nothing could have saved our horses from being killed and if one was to be saved it is as well it should be tartar and not one of the others as yours was far the most valuable of the five  pile on the bushes reuben said to one of the constables make as big a blaze as you can it will act as a beacon to the sergeant and his party  half an hour later the trampling of horses hoofs was heard and a few minutes later the sergeant and his party rode up  i am sorry i am so late sir the sergeant said somehow or other we went wrong altogether and saw nothing of your smoke i was afraid something was wrong but did not know what to do so we halted till it came on dark and presently made out a fire but it was miles away and right in the direction from which we had come i did not think it could be you but whether it was you or the blacks that was the place to ride to  have you got the tracker with you sergeant  yes sir at least i saw him trotting ahead ten minutes ago why where has he got to  the tracker was not to be seen  he has made off to join the blacks i expect reuben said you have been led astray purposely we have been attacked and brown and simpson are killed  an exclamation of rage broke from the men who were in the act of dismounting  i expect reuben said turning to mr blount that the fellows noticed the talk i had with jim before we turned back from the false trail and concluded that we had some suspicion that they were in league with the blacks and so when the party separated they determined to lead the two flanking columns astray so as to give their friends a chance of attacking us and then to bolt  i expect that is it mr blount agreed and now the first thing is to get something to eat when that is done we will have a consultation  while the meat was cooking over the fire reuben told off a party of eight men to bury the bodies of the two constables who had fallen the task was speedily completed two holes being easily scraped in the light sandy soil  after supper was over the settlers gathered round reuben  now captain what do you mean to do mr blount asked i have given up all hope of seeing my sheep again so dont let them influence you but just do as you think best the blacks are in strong force that is evident and it will be a serious business pursuing them any further in their own country  i am going to pursue them till i catch them reuben said that is to say as long as there is a sheep track to serve as a guide i dont ask you gentlemen to go further for i know it is a serious risk but it is my duty to hunt those fellows down and give them a lesson and i mean to do it we shall never have safety in the settlements until those fellows come to understand that whenever they attack us they will be hunted down  i think you are right dick caister said and as long as you go on i go with you for one whatever comes of it but how i am to go without my horse i dont know  there are the spare horses reuben said fortunately we have still got six of them  so we have dick exclaimed joyfully i had forgotten all about them what luck our bringing them with us  the other settlers all announced their intention of continuing the chase as long as reuben was willing to push on  i will tell you what my idea is reuben said the horses are already worn out and by the end of another day they will be half mad with thirst i propose that we take two days supply for ourselves in our water bottles and that we push forward on foot sending two of the constables back to the stream with our horses i propose that we should push forward tonight i expect the track we are following is the true one and the stars will do as a guide  at daybreak we will lie down in the bushes the blacks will probably leave some fellows behind as scouts they seeing nothing of us will suppose we have given it up and gone home and they will make but a short journey at night we will go on again and the chances are that before morning we shall catch sight of their fires and will fall upon them at daylight what do you think of the plan  i think it is a good one mr blount said warmly a capital plan of course we dont much like leaving our horses for in this country one almost lives on horseback still it will be the best plan certainly for as you say the poor brutes will be half mad by tomorrow night with thirst  it will be a long tramp back again a settler said dismally  we wont tramp all the way reuben said with a smile directly we have overtaken the blacks and given them a lesson i will send jim back again for the horses he can cover the ground at a wonderful pace and coming back he will ride one of them and help the two constables to keep them together they will have had two days rest and plenty of food and water and will meet us before we get halfway back there will be no fear of the blacks attacking them  all agreed that the plan was excellent and half an hour later the whole partywith the exception of the two constables who were to start at daybreak with the horses for the riverset out on their march the sky was cloudless and the stars would have been a sufficient guide even had they not had jim with them the black however took his place at the head of the party and strode along as unhesitating as if it had been broad daylight    chapter 12 the bush rangers   scarce a word was spoken as the little party marched along it was possible although very improbable that the natives on scattering before the charge of mr blount and his companions might have left some of their number behind to watch the movements of their pursuers they would however certainly not anticipate the whites pushing forward that night the fire had been piled high the last thing before leaving and the two men left there were told to keep it burning brightly till morning and to start before anyone watching in the distance would be able to see whether the horses were mounted or not should any natives approach the fire after they had gone they would take it for granted that the whole party had ridden back to the settlement  all night reuben and his companions marched steadily forward and were glad to throw themselves down on the ground at the first appearance of daybreak four sentries were placed with strict orders to keep a bright lookout through the bushes but on no account to raise their heads above their level and arrangements having been made for their relief every two hours the rest of the party were soon sound asleep  except to relieve the sentries there was no stir among them until late in the afternoon then there was a general movement and soon all were sitting up and appeasing their appetite upon the cold meat and dampers they had brought with them  there is no harm in a pipe i suppose captain dick caister said laughingly  no i think we can risk that reuben replied the eyes of the savages may be wonderfully keen but they would be a great deal sharper than i can give them credit for were they to notice the smoke of a dozen pipes curling up among the bushes  i suppose mr blount reuben said as after the meal was finished the party lighted their pipes and drew closely round the fire you have heard of a good many bad businesses with the blacks and bush rangers in your time  i have indeed mr blount replied in the early days the settlers had a hard time of it with the blacks who were of course stronger than they are now and after they had got over their first fear of firearms more fearless of the whites the bush rangers too were when first they began to send convicts here more numerous than at present i do not know that they were as desperate as they are nownot so ready to take life without provocation you see there was a very much larger run of country open to them and many convicts who escaped and took to the bush were content to have gained their freedom some of them took black gins and never troubled the colonists again beyond perhaps coming down to a station and carrying off a sheep or two or a bullock when they got sick of kangaroo meat and wanted a change  you see the first settlers were generally poor and hardworking men young men with a little capital had not as yet been attracted here so there was but little inducement for the escaped convicts to meddle with them there were of course some notorious scoundrels who seemed to murder for the pure love of the thing the worst of them i think was a fellow who went by the name of cockeye what his real name was i never heard  that man was a perfect devil and was for a long time the terror of the settlers he never worked with other white men but lived among the blacks of course in those days the police system was in its infancy and we had to rely upon ourselves i had a narrow escape once of losing my life from him and his blacks  when i was about seventeen i lived with my father and mother in a station about fifty miles from sydney or as it was called then port jackson it was at that time quite an outlying station we had two convicts allotted to us both of them honest fellows enough who had been transported for poaching or something of that kindanyhow they were not old hands and gave no trouble my father was a kind master and we always felt that in case of need we could rely upon them just as upon ourselves in those days it was next to impossible to get hired hands for as there was plenty of land for anyone to squat upon comparatively close to the port the men who came out generally set up for themselves at once  one day i had been out on horseback to look for a couple of bullocks which had strayed away and was on my way back when ahead of me i heard the cooey of the blacks i didnt think much of it because they were common enough at that time and a party had made a sort of encampment at a stream about a mile from the house but when a minute later i heard a gun fired i guessed that there was mischief  the sound seemed to come from away towards the right where i knew that one of our men was out herding the bullocks so i clapped spurs to my horse and rode in that direction when i got near i saw the cattle running wildly about and a mob of black fellows among them i could see no signs of our man and guessed that he must have gone down and that i had best ride and warn them at the house  the blacks saw me and started at a run in my direction but i soon left them behind i was within a quarter of a mile of the house when a native yell burst out ahead of me followed by two shots i rode on and when i got near the house saw a lot of black fellows round it  then came a flash from one of the upper windows and i saw one of them roll over that was a satisfaction for i knew they hadnt caught my father asleep i knew the doors and shutters were strong and that he could make a good fight of it still there was only him and my mother at home for both the men had gone out before i left in the morning and one man hasnt much chance of holding a house attacked on all sides so i made up my mind to try to dash through them when the shutter opened a little and my father shouted out  ride for help bill i will keep them off till you get back  so i turned but when i had gone a few yards i looked over my shoulder and i saw a man dash out from behind the house on horseback and start at a gallop after me it was a bay with a white leg and i knew that cockeye used to ride such a horse and that there wasnt a better in the colony almost at the same moment i heard a shot again but i didnt look round  i can tell you i felt pretty badly frightened for there was no mercy to be expected from that scoundrel and i knew that he was a good deal better mounted than i was the next station was about four miles off and i had about two hundred yards start but before i had gone half a mile he was within fifty yards of me i could hear him cursing and swearing and shouting to me to stop but i had made up my mind i would not do that  i had got a brace of pistols with me but i wasnt much of a shot i had soon after i started pulled them out of the holsters and shoved them into my belt in front of me so that as he came up he shouldnt see my hand go down for them my hope was that he would ride straight up to the side of me not knowing that i was armed and that would give me a chance of suddenly letting fly at him  you would think the chance was a poor one and that he would to a certainty shoot me down before he got up i did not much think he would do that for i guessed that the scoundrel would do with me as he had in some other cases namely take me and carry me back to the house and there either threaten to shoot me or hang me up over a fire or some such devilry to make those inside give in i was determined this shouldnt be and that if i could not shoot him i would be shot myself for otherwise he would have got my father and mother and it would have been three lives instead of one  presentlycrackcame the sound of a pistol and i heard the bullet whiz close by i expect that it was only to frighten me into stopping but in a second or two he fired again and the shot just grazed my shoulder so he was in earnest that time  i bent low on my saddle got a pistol out of my belt and prepared there was another shot the horse gave a spring and i knew he was hit but for a time he went faster than ever still the last shot wasnt from more than twenty yards behind and i expected every minute to see his horses head coming up beside me then i heard a curse and a sudden fall and looking round saw his horse was down  cockeye was on his feet in a moment and drew another pistol from his holster so i concluded to keep on as hard as i could go without waiting to make inquiries i guessed pretty well what had happened the shot i had heard my father fire as he started after me had hit the horse and the poor brute had kept on until he dropped i understood the fellows firing now he felt his horse was failing under him and his only chance was to stop me  i kept on till i got safe to the station the three men there started in different directions to fetch assistance and by the evening we had a score of men assembled there and started back to our station we heard a cooey when we were within a mile of the place and guessed it was a fellow on the watch by the time we got there they had all cleared off but it was a close thing  my mother was a courageous woman and had defended the back of the house and my father the front the blacks had made several attempts to burn the place down but the roof like the walls was made of solid timber which is the only safe way to build a house when you are exposed to attacks of the blacks  as long as daylight lasted the old people had done very well and had kept the blacks at a distance and we saw by the marks of blood in the morning that they must have killed or wounded eight or ten of them but if we hadnt come up before the blacks had darkness to cover them it would have gone hard with them of course we knew that and calculated so as to get there before nightfall  what became of the bush ranger reuben asked  well curiously enough that was the last time he ever troubled the settlements we never knew exactly what became of him but it was said that the blacks killed and eat him i know that was very often the end of those fellows as long as all went on well the blacks were friendly enough with them and were glad to follow their lead but after a repulse like that they got at our station or perhaps as a result of some quarrel about the division of the plunder or their gins or something of that sort they would fall suddenly on their white friends and make cooked meat of them  i suppose the blacks seldom spare any whites who fall into their hands reuben asked  scarcely ever mr blount replied that was why they were more dreaded than the bush rangers the latter would kill if they were in the humour for it but if there was no serious resistance and none of their number got hurt more often than not they contented themselves by leaving everyone tied hand and foot till somebody came to unloose them  i remember one horrible case in which they so tied up three white men at a lonely station and nobody happened to go near it for three weeks afterwards it struck someone that none of them had been seen for some time and a couple of men rode over and to their horror found the three men dead of hunger and thirst  now the black fellows dont do that sort of thing when they do attack a station and take it they kill every soul man woman and child  i suppose in that affair you were telling us of reuben asked both of your ticketofleave men were killed  yes one seemed to have been surprised and speared at once the other had made a stout fight of it for the bodies of three natives were found near him  i remember one case one of the others said in which the blacks did spare one of the party in a station which they attacked it was a little girl of about three years old why they did so i dont know perhaps the chief took a fancy to her maybe he had lost a child of the same age and thought his gin would take to the little one anyhow he carried her off  the father happened to be away at the time he had gone down to sydney with a waggon for stores and when he got back he found the house burned and the bodies of his wife two boys and two men but there was no trace of that of the child  he was nearly out of his mind poor fellow the neighbours all thought that the body must have been burned with the house but he would have it that there would have been some sign of her no one else thought so and besides it wasnt the custom of the blacks to carry off anyone the father got a party to try and follow the blacks but of course it was no use they had pretty near two days start  the father never took to his farm again but hung about the out stations doing a job here and there for his grub sometimes he would be away for a bit and when he came back though he never talked about it everyone knew he had been out hunting the blacks  i do not know how many of them he killed but i know he never spared one when he got him outside the settlement after a time the blacks never troubled that part so many of them had been killed that they got a superstitious fear of the man and believed he was possessed of an evil spirit and i dont believe twenty of them together would have dared to attack him  at last from some of the halftamed blacks in the settlement he got to hear some sort of rumour that there was a white girl living with one of the tribes far out in their country and he set out he was away four months and he never said what he had been doing all the time in fact he started almost directly for the port and went home by the next ship  however he brought his child back with him it was four years since she had been carried off and she was a regular little savage when she arrived in the settlement with him of course she could not speak a word of english and was as fierce as a little wildcat i expect she got all right after a bit  i didnt see the man but i heard he was worn to a shadow when he got back he must have had an awful time of it in the bush what with hunger and thirst and dodging the blacks i dont know how he lived through it but he looked contented and happy in spite of his starvation and they say it was wonderful to see how patient he was with the child  they got up a subscription at sydney to send them both home i heard that the captain of the ship he went in said when he came back the next voyage that the child had taken to him and had got civilized and like other children before they got to england  of course such fellows as cockeye and fothergill are the exceptions and not the rule mr blount said were there many of such scoundrels about we should have to abandon our settlements and make war upon them for there would be no living in the colony till they were exterminated most of these fellows are the colonial version of the highwaymen at home it is just stand and deliver they content themselves with taking what they can find in a travellers pockets or can obtain by a flying visit to his station  yes i had several of those in my last district reuben said they were just mounted robbers and gave us a good deal of trouble in hunting them down but none of them had shed blood during their career and they did not even draw a pistol when we captured them that style of bush ranger is a nuisance but no more men seldom carry much money about with them here and no great harm was done  you see dick caister said these fellows have a remarkable objection to putting their necks in the way of a noose so that although they may lug out a pistol and shout bail up they will very seldom draw a trigger if you show fight so long as they do not take life they know that if they are caught all they have to expect is to be kept at hard work during the rest of their sentence and perhaps for a bit longer they dont mind the risk of that they have had their outing sometimes a long one but if they once take life they know its hanging when they are caught and are therefore careful not to press too hard upon their triggers  but once they have killed a man they dont generally care how many more lives they take they are desperate then and seem to exult in devilry of all kinds as to being stuck up by an ordinary bush ranger one would think no more of it than of having ones pockets picked in england  its lucky for us on the whole that the black fellows have such a hatred of the white men were it not for that a good many of these fellows would go all lengths relying on taking to the bush when they had made the colony too hot to hold them but there are only a few of them that have ever got on well with the blacks and many a man who has gone out into the bush has found his end there you see theres no explaining to a dozen natives who jump up and begin to throw spears and boomerangs at you that you are a bad white fellow and not a colonist on the search for fresh runs  no the bush rangers on the whole are not such a bad lot of fellows i suppose there is not one of us here who hasnt had men ride up and ask for food who were he knew pretty well bush rangers of course they got their food as anyone else would who rode up to a station and asked for it  once only i was told to hand over any money i had in the house as fortunately i had only a few pounds i gave it up without making a fight for it its no use risking ones life unless for something worth fighting for i suppose most of us here have had similar experiences  there was a general chorus of assent among the settlers  many of them are poorspirited wretches two of them bailed up a waggoner of mine coming out with a load from the port he pretended to give in and as they were opening some of the boxes he knocked one over with the butt end of his whip the other fired a hasty shot and then jumped on to his horse and galloped off again and my man brought in the fellow he had stunned  did you hand him over to the police reuben asked  not i the settler laughed i thought he had got what he deserved so i bandaged up his head and let him go those poor beggars of convicts have a dreadful hard time of it and i dont think there are many settlers who would hand over any man who had escaped and taken to the bush even if he had occasionally bailed up a waggoner or so we know what a flogging the poor wretch would get and as long as its only an occasional robbery to keep themselves from starving we dont feel any great animosity against them its different altogether when they take to murder then of course they must be hunted down like wild beasts  and now i vote that we have a nap my pipes out and i suppose we shall be on the tramp again as soon as it is dark    chapter 13 bush rangers   as soon as it became dark the journey was renewed  now jim you must keep your eyes well open reuben said there is no saying when we may come upon them now  i tink dey not berry far off sah dose sheep too tired to go far black fellow glad to stop and rest when he see no one coming after him  de ground more up and down here must no make noise may come upon dem sudden  it was nearly midnight when jim suddenly halted  what is it jim reuben asked in a low voice  jim stood sniffing the air  me smell fire captain  reuben sniffed the air but shook his head  i dont smell anything jim  i smell him sah sure enough not very close perhaps but in de air  what is it captain whitney mr blount asked as he came forward and joined them  jim says he smells fire but i cant smell it  oh you can trust jims nose the settler said it is wonderful how keen is the scent of these natives they are like dogs in that respect and can perceive the smell of a fire when the wind brings it down to them miles away  dis way now sah jim said turning off to the left at right angles to the course which they had been pursuing smell come down the wind dats sartin we follow him far enough we sure to catch dem  for fully two miles reuben followed the black without speaking then he said  i dont smell any smoke jim are you quite sure you are right about it  quite sure sah de smoke much stronger than he was some of dese bushes make very sharp smell can smell him very far away  thats all right jim on we go then i must take your word for it  after another halfanhours walking reuben thought that he too could smell an odour of burning wood and soon afterwards he became convinced that it was so the ground on which they were crossing was slightly undulated and on nearing the crest of one of the slight rises jim said  de smoke am getting strong now sah and jim can hear de bleating of de sheep if de captain will wait here jim will go on ahead and find out where dey lie  but perhaps you wont be able to find us again  der no fear of dat sah but if i not come straight back i give a little whistlelike thiswhen i get on to a rise and if the captain answer in just the same way then i come straight back to him  so saying jim glided away in the darkness while reuben gave the word for the men to halt and lie down till his return there was however no occasion for a signal for in little over half an hour from the time of jims leaving he rejoined them again his coming being unnoticed until he stood among them so noiseless were his footsteps  we hab dem dis time sure enough captain  why is that you jim you quite startled me well what is your news  de black fellows and de sheep are a little over a mile away sah dey got a big fire down in a bottom some of dem eating still but most of dem fast asleep round de fire  how many are there of them  about fifty sahat least dat about the number jim saw i expect i was right when i tell you dat there was well nigh a hundred at fust some ob them go off wid de sheep de odder way and we kill over twenty in dat fight  do you think we killed so many as that jim  i went round sah and counted sixteen of dem and some sure to have crawl away and die in de bush dere were over twenty killed altogether for sure and i specks dat some more hab left de party today and gone off wid dere share of de sheep to der people  well what do you think mr blountshall we attack them tonight or wait till morning  i should say wait till morning certainly the settler said we might shoot a few if we attack them now but the rest would be all off at the first flash of our gun and we should never get another shot i think our best plan would be to remain where we are for another couple of hoursit is two oclock nowthen jim will guide us to the place and we can take up our position as close as we can get and wait for daylight  there is no fear of their making a move before it is light jim  no sah dey tink dey am safe now and eat one big feast dey not move till light sartain  very well mr blount then we will do as you say when we get near them we will divide into four parties you with four men shall move up close to the sheep sergeant oconnor with four others shall work up from the other end of the bottom five others shall make a detour and get right on the other side of their fire and i with the other three and jim who you see has got one of the constables rifles and ammunition will come down on them from this side  jim will place all the parties taking them by turns as near the fire as he thinks safe and will then return to me only as we shall attack them from four sides let everyone be careful about his shooting otherwise we shall have casualties from our own shots  all will remain quiet until i fire then a general volley must be poured in with bullet and buckshot and when the rifles and guns are empty go right at them with pistol and sword  the plan was carried out as arranged and before daybreak the four parties were lying in the positions allotted to them within forty yards of the blacks a few of these were seen sitting by the fire the rest were all asleep  gradually the light began to creep over the sky and as it became lighter there was a movement among the blacks as soon as he could see perfectly reuben was about to fire in the air for he did not like to fire at unsuspecting men in spite of the deeds of blood and rapine they had performed in the settlement  presently however his eye fell upon one of the treacherous trackers who had so nearly brought destruction upon them he levelled his rifle and fired and the man fell dead in his tracks  as the rest of the blacks leapt to their feet a volley from nineteen guns was poured into themfollowed by seven or eight more as most of the settlers were armed with doublebarrelled guns a few buckshot being dropped into each barrel over the bullets then came the sharp cracks of the pistols as the whites rushed down to the assault  the natives attempted no resistance panic stricken at the sudden appearance of the foe whom they imagined by this time far back on their way to the settlements and paralysed by the slaughter made by the first volley they thought only of flight a few caught up their spears and waddies as they made a dash for the bushes and strove to effect their escape between the parties advancing on each side of them but the latter were now close at hand and for a minute or two a fight took place between the whites with their clubbed muskets and the natives with their spears and waddies but it was soon over for the natives only fought to escape and as soon as they saw an opening bounded away into the bushes  only one of the assailants was killed but several were more or less severely wounded by the spears while no less than thirtyfour of the blacks were killed the victors made no attempt at pursuit but as soon as the last of the natives had escaped they gathered to ascertain what loss had taken place on their side  poor phillips is killed mr blount said as he examined the body the spear has gone right through his throat fortunately he was a single man he has only been out here a few months and was staying down at dick caisters  poor tom dick said in feeling tones he was a capital young fellow and i am deeply sorry fortunately he has left no one behind to grieve more than i do for him for he lost his father and mother shortly before he came out and was alone in the world  i am thankful its no worse mr blount said we have given the blacks a terrible lesson i think as far as they are concerned we can sleep in peace for a long time of course we have not done with them for they are very revengeful but a blow like this will render them careful for a long time how they attack us  how many of them have fallen  thirtyfour reuben said jim has just been counting them up  now mr blount we will have another of your sheep for breakfast and then well be off  the sheep had scattered somewhat at the alarm of the fire but were soon driven together again one was caught and killed and slices of the meat were stuck up on ramrods and were soon frizzling before the fire  well mr blount how many sheep do you think there are here  i have just been looking them over the settler replied and i should say there must be nearly twelve hundred so that allowing for two hundred driven off in the other direction and a hundred dropped by the way the whole flock are accounted for i am indeed obliged to you and to my friends here i never expected to see a tail of them again when i found they were off  i am very glad you have recovered so many of them reuben said and still more that we have given the blacks such a lesson we will as soon as we have finished be on the march jim will go on ahead at once as we agreed and he tells me will get to the stream where the horses are before night and will start out with them at once so that we may be able to meet them tomorrow early i fancy our water bottles are all getting very low but we can hold on for today  as soon as he had finished eating jim started off at a run which reuben knew he would keep up for hours the body of young phillips was buried and then collecting the flock and driving it before them the rest started upon their return the sheep could not travel fast for many of them were footsore with their hurried journey but they had found plenty of nourishment in the grass at the bottoms and in the foliage of the bushes and being so supplied had suffered little from thirst  jim before starting had pointed out the exact line they were to follow and this they kept by compass with only one or two short halts they kept on until nightfall and leaving the sheep in a grassy bottom lit their fire on the crest above it in order that its flame might serve as a guide to jim should he get back with the horses before daylight  there was but little talking before each stretched himself at length before the fire they had been twentyfour hours without sleep and all were now suffering severely from thirst the last drops in the water bottles had been emptied early in the day and they were parched not only by the heat of the sun but by the stifling dust raised by the flock as they travelled  there had been but little supper eaten indeed most of them contented themselves with chewing pieces of raw meat to satisfy their thirst rather than their hunger although they had no fear of the return of the natives reuben thought it only prudent to keep watch and each of the party had half an hour on sentry duty  the day was just beginning to break when the man on guard exclaimed  i can hear the trampling of horses  the news brought everyone to their feet and in a few minutes the two constables and jim rode up driving before them the horses of the rest of the party  well done jim reuben exclaimed now the first thing get one of the water skins off  one of the skins was unfastened in a minute and after copious draughts everyone felt refreshed and ready for work again  we cannot start for a few hours reuben said the horses must have come over forty miles and wont be fit to travel till the afternoon fortunately there is plenty of grass for them in the bottom and now that my thirst is allayed i begin to discover that i am hungry  there was a general chorus of assent the fire was made up again the men went down to the bottom and killed and brought up a sheep and all were soon engaged in making up for their twentyfour hours fast  in the afternoon a start was made but although they travelled all night they did not reach the stream until the following afternoon as they were obliged to accommodate their pace to that of the sheep the following morning reuben rode forward to the settlements leaving mr blount with two of his friends to come on with the flock at his leisure  at the first farm he reached reuben heard that as he feared the bush rangers had taken advantage of so many of the settlers being away to recommence their attacks at the first two houses they visited they had found the inmates on the watch and had moved off without making any attack at the third they had surprised and killed a settler his wife and two hired men and had sacked and burned the house reuben learned that some of the police had gone off in pursuit  leaving his horse to the care of the settler reuben borrowed a fresh animal and rode off to the scene of the outrage which was some thirty miles distant just as he arrived there he met the party of eight police who had been in pursuit of the bush rangers and they reported that they had lost all trace of them  for the next two or three weeks reuben did not return to his headquarters spending the time in riding from station to station with a small party of police and urging upon the settlers the necessity not only of strongly barricading their houses but of keeping a watch by turns as the bush rangers seldom attack a place unless they can gain the advantage of a surprise  as nothing had been heard of the bush rangers reuben determined to return to his barrack he was spending the last night at dick caisters when just as they were about to turn in the sound of a horses hoofs at full gallop was heard  something is the matter dick said men dont ride like that at night for nothing  he went to the door and opened it just as the horseman stopped in front  quick caister the man said as he leaped down the bush rangers are not fifty yards behind  and indeed the sound of the trampling of other horses sounded close behind  come in come in dick cried ah is it you shillito never mind the horse he must look after himself luckily the captains here and we will give it them hot just run round and see that all the shutters are fastened  as dick spoke he was barring the door and he now shouted at the top of his voice to the two hired men who were in bed upstairs but before any answer could be returned there was a thundering knocking at the door  what is it dick shouted  open the door and be quick about it or it will be worse for you we want that chap thats just ridden up and we mean to have him so he had best come out at once if you dont open the door at once we will cut the throats of every soul in the house  you have got to get at our throats first my fine fellow dick said jeeringly  the knocking was at once renewed but with greater violence  the doors a strong one dick said to reuben and it will stand a good deal of that sort of thing but we may as well move the table and benches up against it then we can see how things stand  reuben had been busy taking down the guns which hung over the fireplace dropping a ramrod into them to see that they were charged and putting fresh caps on to the nipples his own rifle stood in the corner and was he knew ready for service  what arms have you altogether caister  i have that rifle and doublebarrel gun both my hands have got muskets i got them up from sydney a few months back  the two men now came running down from above each with his musket  where is jim reuben said looking round  he went out about ten minutes ago dick said i fancy he went to look after your horse he takes as much care of that animal as if it were a child  i hope they wont find him in the stable and cut his throat reuben said he is wonderfully faithful and attached to me i would not have harm come to him for anything  now i will go upstairs and reconnoitre now those fellows have left off knocking at the door they are a good deal more dangerous than when they were kicking up all the row  mind how you show yourself captain as likely enough one of them is on the watch expecting that we should be sure sooner or later to take a look out of that window so keep well back the night is pretty light so i expect you will be able to make them out  can we get a view of the stable from that window  yes dick replied i rather had that in my minds eye when i put the stable up its always a good thing men knowing that their master can have an eye upon them when they least expect it why do you ask  because if the window commands the stable door we can prevent them getting the horses out  yes dick said after losing two in that last affair it would be a serious matter to have the rest of them carried off  reuben went up the stairs and made his way towards the window standing a short distance back he could see no one moving about in the yard and he was about to move close to it when a tremendous crash took place below followed by loud shouts he ran downstairs again  the bush rangers had moved round to the back of the house and there picking up a young tree which had been brought in to saw up into billets for firewood they used it as a battering ram against one of the shutters and at the very first blow broke it off its hinges and then made a rush at the window two shots rang out almost together and then firing a hasty volley into the window the bush rangers began to climb in but by this time reuben had arrived and the sharp cracks of his pistols rang out  they have got the police here one of the men exclaimed as he caught a sight of reubens uniform  draw off lads i expect its that accursed captain another voice exclaimed hes always riding about with nobody but that black fellow with him he has got to go down that fellow has or he will give us no end of trouble but draw off from that window for a moment  what will they do next i wonder dick caister said as leaving the two hands to guard the window he returned into the other room with reuben  i rather expect they are going to try to burn us out we must keep them from that if we can  mr shillito will you go up to the upper room and keep an eye on the stables shoot down anyone who may pass your line of sight  havent you got any loopholes caister  yes of course i have dick replied i had forgotten all about them yes there are two loopholes in the logs in each side of the house upstairs they have been shut up by wisps of straw ever since the house was built  giving strict orders to the two men to shout instantly if anyone moved near the window the two young men went upstairs  have you seen anything shillito  not a thing one would almost think that they have bolted  they will hardly do that i fancy reuben said there are ten or twelve of them but i think one or two must have got a bullet in them  i wish they would come on dick said as he pulled out the straw from the loopholes  reuben went to them all in succession and looked out but nothing could be seen of their assailants presently however a number of dark figures appeared each bearing a burden  they have been cutting brush wood reuben exclaimed i was right you see they are going to try to smoke or burn us out now i think its time to give them a lesson  look look  the exclamation was excited by a sudden glare of light on the other side of the stables  the scoundrels have set fire to the stables shillito said  what shall we domake a sally caister asked i am ready for it if you think right  no reuben said they would only shoot us down as we come out they must guess that some of us are up at this window or they would try to carry the horses off instead of destroying them  i only wish we were on the poor beasts backs we would go for them though they were twice as many  i dont see the others nowthey must have gone round to the other side of the house  scarcely had reuben taken up his station at one of the loopholes behind than he again saw the dark figures he took steady aim and fired there was a sharp cry and one of the fellows fell to the ground the others at once threw down their burdens and fled three minutes later there was a shout  look here you policeman and you caister you shall pay dearly for this nights work i swear it and bill fothergill never forgets his word in that way its your turn this time it will be mine the next and when it is take care  the only reply was a shot from reuben aimed in the direction from which the voice came a minute later there was a trampling of horses  they are gone shillito exclaimed  perhaps it is only a trick to draw us out dick suggested  no i dont think its that reuben said they are not strong enough to send a party off and to attack us with the rest no i think they have gone they know that we cant follow them  they have taken good care of that he added bitterly as he glanced at the stables which were now a sheet of flame however we will look round and see  the three men descended to the room below and being joined by the two hands removed the furniture piled against the door and threw it open  we mustnt go round to that side of the house so as to get into the glare of the fire till we have looked round reuben said i believe they are all gone but they may have left a couple of them lurking somewhere about to pick us off when we show in the light  i will take one of your hands caister and scout round on one side do you three go the other side  a quarter of an hour later the two parties met near the stables where the fire was now burning low the roof had fallen in and only some of the uprights were erect with flicking flames licking them as they stood glowing above the mass of still blazing debris  i wonder whether that poor fellow is under that reuben said  i hope not indeed i fancy he must have got away he might have slipped off when they first rode up he may be hiding somewhere round afraid to come near till he knows how matters have turned out  so saying he gave a loud cooey they stood silent for a minute but no answer came back  there is nothing to be done till morning dick said and its no use hanging about here before it gets light i will start for watsons there are two of your men there and they with the two watsons and ourselves can set out after these fellows if you are agreeable that is as soon as we get hold of some horses  i hardly think i shall be justified in taking you reuben said as he walked back towards the house these scoundrels are all armed to the teeth and they are firstrate shots they know every foot of the country and against anything like equal numbers they would make a desperate fight of it even if they did not thrash us of course in anything like an equal number of my own men i should not hesitate but i dont think it will be fair for you settlers to undertake such a service as that  listen shillito exclaimed they are coming back again  surely enough on the night air the sound of horses galloping at full speed could be heard  i dont think it can be them reuben said they would have no motive in coming back after they once rode off they would know we should be ready for them  i dont see who else it can be at any rate all our guns are loaded and if it is them all the better  suddenly a loud cooey was heard  thats jim reuben exclaimed i should know his call among a thousand he must have made off to get help at once but i dont know how he can have done it in time  why its the watsons and my men he exclaimed as the party rode up into the light  all safe one of the settlers cried as he jumped from his horse  all safe thank god reuben replied did jim bring you news that we were attacked  yes fortunately we were sitting up late talking when he rode up so there was not a minute lost  rode up reuben repeated in surprise why where did you get a horse jim  rode masters horse jim said  what reuben exclaimed in delight what is tartar safe i was afraid his body was under those ruins why how did you get him out  jim was in de stable sah when bush ranger ride up de horses was stamping and i not hear dem till dey come quite close den it was too late to run out  de moment dat dey began to make bobbery at door i opened stable door and bring out de three horses  what did you get mine out too dick shouted jim you are a trump and no mistake  den jim went on paying no attention to the interruption me led de other two hosses little way and let them go loose sure not go far from home and i jump on tartar and ride like de debel to watsons for de police  well done jim you have done capitally now let us talk over what we had better do  the party reentered the house fresh wood was thrown on to the fire and one of dicks hands proceeded to put food on the table and prepare tea while the others consulted what course should be pursued  it was agreed at once that more aid would be necessary before they could think of attacking the bush rangers but all were ready to join in the hunt for them therefore it was decided that dick shillito and the two watsons should each ride at once to neighbouring stations to bring aid at one of the stations two more policemen would be found and as in the pursuit they should probably pass near other stations their numbers would swell as they went when this was settled the party sat down to the meal  how did you come upon them shillito caister asked  i had been spending the day with the wilkinsons i did not start to ride home till it was rather late and i was riding fast when about a quarter of a mile before i got to my place i rode right into the middle of a lot of men on horseback they evidently hadnt heard me coming and were as much surprised as i was  there was a general shout of bail up and i saw at once what sort of gentry they were however i didnt stop but in the confusion dashed through  a few shots were fired at me i suppose they were too surprised to aim straight then they started off after me i knew it was no use making for home for there was only one man there so i swept round and made for your place my horse is a good one you know and i gained on them all except one man who must have been capitally mounted for he gradually crept up to me he wasnt twenty yards behind me when he shouted  stop or i fire  i pulled straight up and as he came up to me let fly at him he tumbled off his horse and i galloped off till i got here  what has become of your horse i wonder  i gave him a cut with my whip as i jumped off he cantered away of course they may have caught him but i dont think its likely  you will find him somewhere about at daylight i expect i will ride caisters spare horse now  for jim with one of the hands had gone out to fetch in the two horses from the spot where they had been turned loose    chapter 14 an unexpected meeting   as soon as it was light the party were assembled and started jim leading the way at a swinging pace which kept the horses going at a hand canter the marks were for a time perfectly easy to follow five miles on the tracks led to a shepherds hut at their call the man came out  you had a visit from bush rangers last night  what if i did the man replied gruffly i cant help where the bush rangers pay their visits yes they came in here and said they wanted some supper and you may guess i did not keep them waiting long for they were not in a particularly good temper from what they said three of their men had been killed  this was already known to the party as jim had found three bodies at a short distance from the house two of these had evidently been carried there from the back window where they had been killed in trying to effect the entry the other had been shot when approaching to fire the house  the captain of the gang was terrible put out and was acussing and swearing as to what he would do to those as did it i wouldnt be in their shoes if they were to fall into his hands  they didnt say anything which would give you an idea as to the direction they were taking  not they the man replied you dont suppose they would be such fools as that and if they had you dont suppose as i should be such a fool to split on em not likely i aint no desire to wake up one night and find the door fastened outside and the thatch on fire  we may as well ride on reuben said we shall learn nothing here the fellow is a ticketofleave man and as likely as not in league with these scoundrels  i wonder what they came here for he added as they started again  i tell you sah jim said dat fellow has driven his herd ober their trailall stamped outno saying where they hab gone to  we must follow the herd then reuben said if we look sharp we ought to be able to see the traces where they left them  jim shook his head  no find he said decidedly plenty places where de ground am berry hard and horse feet no show dey choose some place like dat and turn off perhaps put rug under horses feet so as to make no mark me sarch sah jim look him eyes very hard but tink no find  and so to their great disappointment it turned out they followed the tracks of the herd three miles until they came upon them quietly grazing but nowhere could they see any trace of a party of horsemen turning off all the party were greatly vexed at the ill success of their expedition for all had hoped that they were at last going to overtake the gang who had done such mischief in the colony  reuben was especially disgusted he had only the day before received a letter from his chief acknowledging the receipt of his report describing the pursuit of the blacks and congratulating him warmly upon his success the letter ended  if you can but give as good an account of the bush rangers we shall be indeed grateful to you as it is you have more than justified my selection of you for the post  leaving two constables as guards at dick caisters station in case as was probable enough the bush rangers should return to take revenge for the repulse they had experienced there reuben rode back to his headquarters from which he had now been absent some time the evening after his return he called jim into his room  jim he said i want your advice as to the best way of finding out where these bush rangers are quartered how do you think we had better set about it would it be of any use do you think for you to go among the natives and try and find out there is no doubt they know for they have often acted with the bush rangers do you think you could pass among them  no sah jim said at once me no speak deir way me understand black fellow me talk dar language but not same way they find out difference directly and kill me de wild black fellows hate those who hab lived wid de white men we hate dem just de same way we say dem bad black fellow dey say we no good  but those rascally trackers who led us wrong that day of the fight they were friendly with them  yes sah but dey not so very long away from the bush and always keep friends wid the others meet dem and talk to dem and tell dem dey set the white men on wrong tracks  well jim but could not you do the same  no good sah me brought up among de whites eber since me little boy dey not believe me if i go and say dat to dem jim ready to get killed if de captain want him but no good at all him getting killed in dat way  i dont want you to get killed in any way jim and if thats your opinion about it we will give up the plan at once can you think of any other way  me tink a lot about him me know de captain want very much to catch dose fellows but jim no see how dat can be done for sure but de best plan me can see is for jim to go out by himself and search de country outside white mans bounds if he find de track of horses he follow dem up me know about de way dey ride off after dey be killing people at de stations if jim look and look and look berry sharp he find dar track for sure and once he find dem he follow dem up must be water for sure where dey live dat good guide to begin with  but captain must not hurry jim may be long time before he find dem dar no saying how long captain wish jim to go  well jim i dont want you to go that is to say i should miss you very much but if you could find out the haunts of these scoundrels you would be doing me a very great service as well as the people of all the stations  jim no care about oder people the black said he care for de captain and will go out and try and find tracks  be careful jim and dont get into trouble with them if you were to fall into their hands and they were to find out you were connected with the police they would shoot you like a dog  dey wont find out white man not understand black fellow all one to him you hab no fear for jim who look after hoss while jim away  i shall appoint one of the policemen as my orderly jim and he will look after him  jim made a contemptuous gesture to signify that he had little confidence in the power of any white man to look after tartar for the rest of the evening jim was occupied in cooking and in the morning he was gone  a week later reuben was among the outlying stations again he had heard nothing of the bush rangers and no fresh attacks had been made by them since that upon dick caisters station  one evening just as he had gone up to bed he was roused by a sharp knocking at the door of the house in which he was stopping the settlers had grown cautious now and an upper window was opened and reuben heard the questions who is there and what is it  is captain whitney here  yes do you want him  yes i want to see him directly  in a minute reuben had opened the door  i am captain whitney he said what is it  i am glad i have found you sir they told me at the next station you were here yesterday but they did not know whether you were here now  well sir i am shepherding some twenty miles away and this afternoon just as i had got back to my hut in runs a black fellow it is a lonely spot and i reached for my gun thinking there was more of them when he said  no shoot me friend me sarve captain whitney of de police you know him  i said i had heard your name  you know where he is the black asked  i said i did not know for certain but that when my mate went in for grub two days before he had heard say that you had been along there that morning  the black said good you run and find him  thank you says i what for  i find out about the bush rangers he said you go and tell captain dat tomorrow morning before de day begins dey attack the station of donalds  are you quite sure says i  quite sure says the black me heard dem say so  so as i hates the bush rangers like poison i saddles up and rides into the station and when i had told the boss he said i better ride and find you if i could you would be at one of the stations this way i stopped at three of them and at the last they told me you was here  thank you greatly my good fellow donalds i dont know the name where do they live  they have only been here a couple of months reubens host who was standing beside him replied they bought that station of andersons he was a chickenhearted young fellow and sold out because of the bush rangers there is a man his wife and her sister i believe i fancy they have got a pretty fair capital they took andersons stock and have been buying a lot more thats why the bush rangers are going to attack them  i thought reuben said that andersons was not one of the most exposed stations  no that was what everyone told him before he sold it  how far would you say it was from here  thirtyfive miles the settler said its ten miles from barkers and i reckon thats twentyfive from here  well of course i shall ride at once as there are women there it makes the case all the more urgent i have got my orderly and there are two more men at the station this side of barkers  i will go of course reubens host said and will bring two men with me  you had best stop here for the night he added turning to the shepherd you have ridden pretty well thirty miles already and that at the end of your days work  not i the man replied jim walsh is not going to be lying in bed with the thought of two women in the hands of them murderous bush rangers you might lend me a fresh horse if you have got one if not i must try and pick one up at one of the stations as we go along  i have plenty of horses in the yard the settler said  well let us be off as soon as possible reuben put in its past twelve oclock now and we have thirtyfive miles to ride and to stop at two or three places so we havent a minute to lose  in a few minutes the horses were saddled and the six men dashed off at full gallop at three stations which they passed on the way to barkers they picked up seven more there was but little delay as the instant the news was told the men hurried up saddled their horses and rode after the party who pushed straight on when they had told their story at barkers they were joined by barker himself and two men two constables had also been picked up on the way  the others overtook them here and the party now numbered twenty men there was a pause to allow all to come up and to give the horses breathing time for they had traversed twentyfive miles at a rapid pace with scarce a halt  mrs barker herself prepared a meal to which while the horses got their breath their riders did justice then they mounted again and rode for donalds  it all depends reuben said as to our being there in time whether the man keeps a careful watch if he does they may not attack till the doors are opened and then make a sudden rush and catch them unawares if when they arrive there they find the whole house is asleep they may burst in at once  i think they will be careful mr barker said i know donald is very anxious and no wonder with two women with him both young and prettyquite out of the way indeed in fact he told me the first day i rode over he had no idea of the unsettled state of the district and wouldnt have taken the place if he had not even if anderson had given it as a gift and he wrote down at once to some agent and told him to sell the place again for whatever he can get for it but i expect there will be some trouble in finding a purchaser the district here has had a bad name for some time and if donald had not arrived fresh from england he must have heard of it  listen i thought i heard the sound of firing  there was a momentary pause but no one could hear anything nevertheless they went on at redoubled speed they were now within three miles of the station  suddenly on coming over a crest a faint light was seen ahead it increased rapidly and a tongue of flame leapt up  come on lads reuben exclaimed the scoundrels are at their work  at a hard gallop they crossed the intervening ground until they were within half a mile of the station from which a broad sheet of flame was leaping up then reuben drew rein for he had outridden the rest of his party and it was important that all should ride together  now he said when they were gathered let us keep in a close body  if they ride off as we arrive there do you jones and wilkins stop at the station and see if you can render any help if not follow us at once  let the rest keep on with me straight after the bush rangers there is already a faint light in the east in half an hour it will be broad day so even if they have got a start we shall be able to follow them now come on  at the head of his party reuben rode at full speed down to the station as he neared it he saw to his satisfaction that the flames arose from some of the outbuildings and that the house itself was still intact but as no firing had been heard he hoped that it still resisted  there was a shrill whistle when the party approached within a hundred yards men were seen to dash out of the house and to leap upon their horses  with a shout reuben rode down he did not pause for a moment but dashed past the house in the direction in which the bush rangers had fled they were he knew but a hundred yards ahead but it was not light enough for him to see them especially after riding through the glare of the fire the sound of the horses feet however afforded an indication but as there was no saying in which direction they might turn he was forced to halt every two or three minutes to listen  to his mortification he found that each time the sound was getting more indistinct for the speed at which they had travelled had taken so much out of the horses that they were unable to compete with the fresher animals ridden by the bush rangers who were all well mounted many of the best horses in the district having been stolen by them at last the sound could be heard no longer and reuben was reluctantly obliged to give the order to halt for he feared he might override the trail  it is no use he said as he reined in his horse they will know as well as we do that they are out of hearing now and might turn off anywhere it is terribly annoying we are too late to save the station and the bush rangers have escaped  however we will take up their trail as soon as it is daylight indeed i am expecting every moment to be joined by jim who is sure to be somewhere near and can perhaps guide us direct to their hiding place  deeply disappointed the party dismounted from their horses  the scoundrels must have had someone on the watch reuben said or they would never have taken the alarm so soon i am sorry now that we did not send a party round to the other side before we charged down upon them but my blood was on fire at the sight of the burning station and at the thought of the women in the hands of those scoundrels  a minute later a man rode up at full speed from behind  is that you jones reuben said stepping forward  yes sir the man replied reining in his horse i left wilkins behind and rode on to tell you what had happened  what has happened jones  its a bad business sir a shocking bad business but it might have been worse it seems they broke in about half an hour before we got there one of the hands was supposed to be on watch in the stockyard but either he was asleep or they crept up to him and killed him before he could give the alarm then they got up to the house and burst in the door before the others were fairly awake  they shot the two hands at once but i suppose as their blood wasnt up and no resistance was offered they thought they had plenty of time for fooling for they must have reckoned that no force they need be afraid of could be got together for three or four hours so they made donald and his wife and sister get breakfast for them the women it seemed had got pistols and both swore they would blow out their brains if any man laid a hand on them however the bush rangers did not touch them though they told them they would have to go off with them  they made donald sit down at one end of the table while their captain took the other and the two women half dressed as they were waited on them it was lucky for them that we were so close when the alarm was given for all made a rush to get to their horses only the captain stopping a moment to let fly at donald  did he kill him reuben asked  no sir the bullet hit him in the body and the ladies were crying over him when i went in thinking he was dead i thought so too but i found he was breathing they poured some brandy down his throat and presently he opened his eyes then as there was nothing for me to do i thought i had best gallop on and give you the news for i knew that you would be anxious to know what had taken place  thank you jones you did quite right what an escape those poor ladies have had another quarter of an hour we might have been too late for those villains would not have kept up the farce long  no sir especially as they were drinking wine the table was all covered with bottles  you did not see anything of jim did you reuben inquired  no sir i did not see or hear anyone stirring about the place  reuben gave a loud cooey  that will bring him if he is anywhere within hearing  but no answering call came back  i hope nothing has happened to the poor fellow reuben said after a pause  he could not possibly be here by this time mr barker said the place where he warned the shepherd must be sixty miles from here  yes quite that but he can run nearly as fast as a horse can go and he would be ten miles nearer here in a straight line than the way the man went round to fetch me  as soon as it became light they followed the track which was plainly visible but when they had gone half a mile further there was a general cry of dismaythe ground was trampled in every direction  confound it mr barker said they have done us do you see they have ridden right into the middle of a large herd of cattle and have driven them off in every direction and have no doubt themselves scattered among the cattle they may go like that for three or four miles and then draw off from the cattle at any spot where the ground is hard and no tracks will be left to meet again at some appointed place maybe fifty miles away  then you dont think its any use in pursuing them reuben asked in a tone of deep disappointment  not a bit in the world mr barker replied decisively if we had a native tracker with us he might possibly follow one horses track among those of all the cattle discover where he separates from them and take up his trail but i doubt even then if he would be successful these fellows know that a strong party is in pursuit of them and each of them will do everything they can to throw us off the scent they are sure not to go straight to their place of meeting but each will take circuitous routes and will make for thick bush where it will be next to impossible for even a native to follow them no they have done us this time  well gentlemen i hope you will all wait as long as you can at the station here if my boy has not been shot by those scoundrels he is sure to find his way here and will be able in all probability to set us on the right track  at any rate though the bush rangers have given us the slip we may congratulate ourselves on our mornings work we have at least saved those poor ladies  so saying reuben turned and with the party rode slowly back to the station on arriving there they dismounted and unsaddled their horses and turned them into a paddock close to the house to feed reuben and mr barker then went up to the house the constable who had been left behind came out  well wilkins how is mr donald and how are the ladies  he is sensible now sir but i dont think theres much chance for him  we ought to get a surgeon at once reuben said  who is the nearest mr barker  the nearest is ruskin  is there no one nearer than that reuben asked why he lives about halfway between where i was sleeping last night and my own place it must be seventy miles away  hes the nearest mr barker said take my word for it  ill tell you what will be the best plan reubens host of the night before said i will ride at once to mr barkers and if he will let me get a fresh horse there i will gallop straight back to my place and will send a man off the moment i arrive there to fetch ruskin  it is only eight oclock now i can be home before noon and my man will do the next stage in a little over four hours if he finds ruskin in he can get to my place by ten oclock at night and can start again at daybreak so by eleven oclock tomorrow he can be here if he isnt here by that time it will be because he was out when my man got there at any rate he is sure to start directly he gets the message  that will be the best plan reuben agreed and i am sure the ladies will be greatly obliged to you when i tell them what you have undertaken  oh thats nothing the settler said we dont think much of a seventy miles ride here  without any further delay the settler saddled his horse and went off at a gallop towards mr barkers where he was to get a fresh mount  and now how are the ladies wilkins  they are keeping up bravely sir i think as far as they are concerned donalds being hit has done them good it has given them something to do and they have not had time to think about what they have gone through and what a narrow escape they have had  which room are they in wilkins  in there to the left sir  as you have seen them wilkins you had better go in and tell them that we have sent off at once to fetch a surgeon and that they may rely upon his being here some time tomorrow we hope before noon ask if there is anything that we can do for them or for mr donald  the policeman went in and reuben called one of his other men  perkins do you jones and rider go in and fetch out the bodies of the men who have been killed dont make more noise than you can help about it carry them out to that shed there and then get a bucket and wash down the floors wherever there are bloodstains about i want to have the place straight so that those poor ladies may avoid seeing anything to recall the scene they have passed through of course you wont go into the room where they are now  three or four of the settlers at once volunteered to set to work to dig a grave  choose a place a bit away from the house one of them said the farther the better it will remind them of this affair whenever they see it  while reuben was arranging this point the constable had come out and told mr barker the ladies would be glad to see him  its a terrible business the settler said to reuben as he turned to go into the house i feel downright afraid of facing them to think how bright and pretty they looked when i rode over here ten days ago and now there they are broken hearted  he returned in a few minutes  how is donald was the general question  he is hard hit the settler said just under the ribs on the righthand side i expect the fellow aimed at his head but he was starting from his seat at the moment he isnt in much pain i have told them they must keep him perfectly quiet and not let him move till the surgeon comes  they have asked me to see about everything its better we should not be going in and out of the house as he must be kept perfectly quiet so i think we had better establish ourselves under that big tree over there there are some sheep half a mile over that rise if two of you will go over kill one and fetch it in if you will light a fire under that tree i will hand out from the house flour tea sugar and some cooking things  there was a general murmur of approval for all felt silent and awed at being so close to the house of death and sorrow two men got their horses and rode off to fetch the sheep the others carried the various articles requisite up to the place fixed for the bivouac while wilkins was installed in the house to assist in anything that might be required there  the poor things told me to tell you captain how grateful they felt to you for the exertions you have made i told them how it was we came to be here and how you had ridden when you got the news to be here in time mrs donald did not say much poor thing she seemed half dazed but her sister who seems wonderfully cool and collected quite realized what they had escaped and theres many a young fellow who would give a good deal to win that look of gratitude she gave me when she said  i shall never forget what i owe you all  i am just going to send off one of my men to fetch my wife over here it will be a comfort to the two girls for they are little more to have a woman with them  theres nothing to be done for donald i suppose reuben asked  nothing the wound is hardly bleeding at all i told them that as far as i knew the best thing was to keep on it a flannel dipped in warm water and wrung out and that they should give him a little broth or weak brandy and water whenever he seemed faint my surgery does not go beyond that if it had been a smashed finger or a cut with an axe or even a broken limb i might have been some good for i have seen plenty of accidents of all kinds since i came out twenty years ago but a bullet wound in the body is beyond me altogether  after the meal was cooked and eaten there was a consultation as to what had best be done next two or three of the settlers who were married men said that they would go home as their wives would be anxious about them the rest agreed to stop for at any rate another day  mr barker had found out from mrs donalds sister the direction in which the sheep and cattle were grazing and two or three of the party rode off to tell the shepherds and herdsmenfor there were three men on the farm in addition to those who had been killedwhat had happened and to tell them that they had better bring the sheep and cattle up to within a mile or so of the house and come in themselves for their stores when required  a grave was now dug and the three men buried in the afternoon mrs barker arrived and at once took charge of the affairs of the house in the evening mr barker came up to the fire round which the men were sitting  will you come down to the house captain whitney the ladies have expressed a wish to see you they want to thank you for what you have done  there is nothing to thank about reuben said i only did my duty as a police officer and am disgusted at those scoundrels having got away i have done all i could since i arrived but i cant help feeling being in command of the force here that we are to some extent to blame for these fellows carrying on as they have done for months without being caught  i think you had better come down whitney mr barker said there is something bright and hopeful about you and i think that a talk with you might cheer the poor things up a bit when people are in the state they are they seem to turn to everyone for a gleam of hope and comfort  oh if you think i can do any good of course i will go though i would rather stop here by a good way  so saying reuben went down with mr barker to the house a lady met them at the door  arthur has just dozed off she whispered mrs barker is sitting by him she insisted on our coming out will you come in here  as silently as possible the two men followed her into the kitchen and closed the door after them the fire was blazing brightly wilkins having piled on some fresh logs before going out to smoke a pipe mrs donald was sitting in a dejected attitude by its right when her sister entered with mr barker and reuben she rose and coming towards reuben said  how can we thank you sir for the exertions you have made and for having saved us from i dare not think what fate as long as we live my sister and i will bless you  i can assure you mrs donald reuben said that i have done nothing but my duty and i only regret that we did not arrive half an hour earlier  ah if you had mrs donald said but therewe must not repineeven in my sorrow i feel how much we have to be thankful for  yes indeed her sister said we have truly reason to be grateful  as she spoke reuben looked at her more and more intently he had started when she first spoke outside the house  good heavens he exclaimed is it possible or am i dreaming surely you are miss kate ellison  certainly i am she said in surprise at his tone but i dont thinki dont rememberwhy surely it is not reuben whitney    chapter 15 at donalds   it is difficult to say whether kate ellison or reuben whitney was the most surprised at this unexpected meeting the former indeed was aware that reuben had come out to australia but that the boy whose cause she had championed should now stand before her as the officer to whose energy and activity she and her sister owed so much seemed almost incredible  but the surprise of reuben was at least equal to that which she felt he could scarcely credit the evidence of his senses at seeing before him the young lady whom he had believed to be thousands of miles away in england as is usual in these cases the girl was the first to recover from her surprise  and it is to you we owe so much she said holding out her hand mr barker spoke of our preserver as captain whitney but somehow it never for a moment occurred to me to connect the name with you  is it not extraordinary alice she said turning to her sister  the surprise to me is even greater than to you miss ellison reuben said mr barker always spoke of mrs donald and her sister and i had not the least idea that you were in the colony my mother wrote to me a year ago telling me of the changes which have taken place but although she said that you had left tipping she said nothing about your coming out here  reuben had in fact been much disturbed in his mind a year previously by hearing from his mother that mr ellison had died suddenly he had it seemed lost a large sum of money from the failure of a bank in which he was a shareholder and the blow had killed him the estate was when mrs whitney wrote for sale  reuben had written back begging his mother to send him all particulars that she could gather but communication between australia and england was in those days very slow and no answer had yet been received another letter had indeed told him that the estate had been sold mrs ellison he knew had died a few weeks after he had left england  it is very simple kate ellison said quietly although of course it seems so strange to you our being here my sister was engaged to mr donald before papas death and as you know almost everything went owing to that bank and as i had no reason for staying in england i came out here with them  reuben subsequently learned that mr ellison had disapproved of the engagement of his daughter with mr donald who was the younger son of a neighbouring squire when after his death mr ellisons affairs were wound up it was found that there remained only the six thousand pounds which his wife had brought him to be divided between her daughters mr donald possessed no capital and had no prospects at home he and alice were quietly married three months after her fathers death and had sailed a week later for new south wales where as land could be taken up at a nominal price it was thought that her little fortune would be ample to start them comfortably all this however reuben did not learn until some time later  after chatting for a short time he returned to the camp fire  this is very awkward mr barker mrs donald said do you know that captain whitney was at one time gardeners boy to our father  oh alice her sister exclaimed what difference can that make  it seems to me mrs donald said that it makes a very great difference you know mamma never thought well of him and it is very awkward now finding him here in such a position especially as he has laid us under an obligation to him  do you not think so mr barker  i do not pretend to know anything about such matters mrs donald mr barker said bluntly and i shouldnt have thought it could have made any difference to you what the man was who had saved you from such a fate as would have befallen you had it not been for his energy i can only say that captain whitney is a gentleman with whom anyone here or in the old country would be glad to associate i may say that when he came here three or four months ago my friend mr hudsonone of the leading men in the colonywrote to me saying that captain whitney was one of his most intimate friends that he was in every respect a good fellow and that he himself was under a lifelong obligation to him for he had at the risk of his life when on the way out saved that of his daughter when she was attacked by a mad malay at the cape  more than that i did not inquire it was nothing to me whether he was born a prince or a peasant  mrs donald coloured hotly at the implied reproof of mr barkers words she had always shared her mothers prejudices against reuben whitney and she had not been long enough in the colony to become accustomed to the changes of position which are there so frequent  you do not understand mr barker she said pettishly it was not only that he was a boy employed in the family there were other circumstances  oh alice kate broke out how can you speak of such things here are we at present owing more than our lives to this man and you are going now to damage him by raking up that miserable old story  mr barker she said impulsively my father one of the most just as well as one of the most kind of men had the highest opinion of reuben whitney believe me there was nothing in the circumstances to which alice alludes which could cast the slightest slur upon his character  i feel certain of that my dear young lady mr barker said even without your assurance your sister is shaken by the events of the day and no wonder and i am quite sure that when she thinks this matter over she will see that whatever her preconceived ideas may be it would be most ungrateful and ungenerous to breathe a single word in disparagement of captain whitney  so saying he turned on his heel and left the room and kate wishing to avoid further words on the matter with her sister followed his example  mrs donalds reflections were not pleasant she felt that mr barkers reproof was well deserved and that she had acted ungratefully and ungenerously as a rule mr ellisons elder daughter was by no means of an unkind disposition but she was essentially her mothers child  the question of reuben whitney had been one which had caused more serious dissension between her father and mother than any she ever remembered she had taken her mothers view of the case while kate had agreed with her father and although the subject had been dropped by mutual consent it had been a very sore one and at the sight of reuben the remembrance of the old unpleasantness had caused her to play a part which she could not but feel was mean and unworthy she felt angry at herselfangry with mr barker with her sister and with reuben  she was standing there with her lips pressed together as she thought over the matter when mrs barker came into the room  he is awake now my dear perhaps you had better go in to him  then she dismissed from her mind the events of the last few minutes and went in to take her place by the side of her husband but as during the long hours of the night she sat there and thought over what had passed since the preceding evening the thought of how much she owed to reuben whitney was uppermost in her mind and when in the morning mrs barker relieved her she went into the other room where mr barker and kate were about to sit down to breakfast and said  mr barker i thank you for what you said to me last night you were right and i was wrong i was ungrateful and ungenerous i can only say that it was a very sore subject and that in my surprise i thought of the past and not the present believe me i am very sorry for what i said  that is quite enough mrs donald mr barker said heartily i am very glad you have said what you have i was sure that you would upon reflection feel that whatever the old grievance might have been it could not weigh an instant against what you owe to that young fellow now let us say no more on the subject you were shaken and not yourself and i was wrong in taking you up so sharply under the circumstances  kate said nothing but her face showed that she was greatly pleased at her sisters change of tone  what is going to be done mr barker mrs donald asked of course the friends who came to our rescue cannot stay here and there is no chance of my husband being moved for a long time  i am afraid not indeed mr barker said most of them will leave this afternoon in time to get back to their stations tonight  i have been speaking with captain whitney and he says that he with his men will certainly stay here for the present he sent off a messenger last night for six more of his men to join him here for he still hopes to get news from his native boy which may set him on the tracks of the bush rangers you need however be under no alarm for i think there is no chance whatever of the bush rangers returning  by the way whitney would like to speak to you after breakfast he wants you to give him as minute a description as you can of the fellows you saw we have already descriptions of four or five of them given by men whom they have stuck up but the band must have increased lately and any particulars might be useful  reuben came round in a quarter of an hour later mr barker fetched him into the room where mrs barker and kate were sitting  mr donald is no worse i am glad to hear he said as he shook hands with the two ladies  i see no change whatever mrs barker said he is conscious but does not speak much he asked me this morning to tell you and all your friends how deeply he feels indebted to you  his thanks are due to the settlers rather than to me mrs barker they were volunteers you know while i was simply on duty we had however one common interestto get here in time to save the station and above all to catch and break up this gang of scoundrels  and now miss ellison if you feel equal to it would you kindly give us an account of what happened mr barker said that he would not ask you yesterday but something perhaps let drop by chance might serve as an indication to us as to the direction in which these fellows have gone  i will tell you certainly the girl said her face paling a little although it is dreadful even now to think of we of course had no idea of attack and had gone to bed as usual one of the men was always on guard on the outside of the house for these attacks made mr donald nervous for the safety of my sister and myself simpson was on guard that night whether he went to sleep or not i cannot say  he did miss ellison reuben interrupted we found his body round by the end of the house he had evidently been sitting down on a log against the house and had been killed by a crushing blow with some heavy instrument probably one of the tools they used for breaking in  the first we knew about it kate went on was a tremendous crash downstairs which was followed by a continuous thundering noise i think they must have burst the door in with crowbars or somethingthat was the first noise we heardbut a strong wooden bar inside kept the door in its place till they battered it down with a log  i hurried on some things just as i had doneit was not a minute i think from the time i wokealice ran in partly dressed too i had heard mr donald shout to the men then there was another great crash as the bar gave way and then some shots were fired  mr donald had been standing just behind the door and had fired through it the moment before it gave way he had not time to step back and was knocked down by the door it was fortunate for him for the bush rangers rushed in and shot down the two men instantly  alice would have run down to see what had happened to her husband but i would not let her out of my room she could have done no good and might have been shot then we heard them moving about the house swearing and using all sorts of horrible language then they shouted up to us to come down or else they would come and fetch us so we opened the door and came down at once  alice gave a little cry of joy as she entered the room and saw her husband standing unhurt though still looking dazed and confused from his blow  the leader of the bandi suppose you have not seen him captain whitney  no indeed reuben said i would give a good deal to catch sight of him  what do you know about him  i only know that he is a young fellow not much older than i am myself his was a life sentence he was concerned in a burglary in the country in which two old ladies were killed two of his accomplices were hung for it but in consideration of his youth and as it was not proved that he took an absolute part in the murder he got off with a life sentence i heard about the case from captain wilson  he came out here about a year after i did he had not been here a month when he killed one of the guard and made his escape since that time he has been a scourge to the colony not a week has passed without complaints of his bailing up and robbing teamsters on their way down to sydney he soon gathered two or three others about him and his daring and impudence soon made him a noted character several times he with two other men rode into goodsized villages and pistol in hand went from house to house and carried off every shilling in the place he has ridden into large stores single handed and compelled the storekeepers to hand over the contents of their tills sometimes they bring spare horses with them and ride off laden with groceries and stores he has committed at least a score of murders always using his pistol at the slightest show of opposition and sometimes murdering apparently from pure love of the thing  do you know his name kate asked  his real name no i dont know that i ever heard it he is always spoken of as fothergill  i will tell you his real name presently kate said as my sister and i came into the kitchen he took off his hat and made a deep bow and said  ladies me and my mates are sorry to put you to any inconvenience but as we happen to be hungry we must trouble you to get us some supper you need not bother to make tea wine is good enough for us  of course as we were in their hands there was nothing to do but to obey his orders so we spread the cloth and brought out what there was in the larder then we fetched in the wine and i brought several bottles of spirits for as i whispered to alice if they get drunk we may be able to get away from them  before they sat down the captain told two of his men to go upstairs with us and fetch down our watches and jewelry and the money there was in the house mr donald had already told them where they would find that  we lit four candles and put them on the table the captain ordered mr donald to sit down facing him saying with a sort of mock politeness that they should not really enjoy their food unless their host took the head of the table several times while they were eating i saw the captain looking hard at alice and me presently he said  i have it now why you are the ellison girls aint you  i was astonished as you may suppose but i said  i am miss ellison and mrs donald is my sister  by jove who would have thought it he said do you know who i am  i said i didnt although really i seemed to have some sort of recollection of his face  why he said dont you remember tom thorne whose father the squire turned out of the public house and to think now that the squires daughters are waiting on me this is a piece of luck  well my dears he went on with a horrible grin you need not tell me how you came here now you will have plenty of time for that we have made up our minds to take you both with us for its a horrible lonely life in the bush without the pleasure of ladies society but i never dreamt that i was in for such a slice of luck as this  mr donald jumped from his seat as the fellow spoke but in a moment he levelled a pistol at him and shouted  sit down or i fire  alice rushed to her husband and pushed him down into his seat  i had rather die than go with you i said to him quietly  perhaps so my dear he replied but you see you havent got the choice  then he went on taunting us about old times and especially reminding me that i had got him a thrashing over breaking the school house window when i went out to get them some more wine for they wouldnt touch the spirits i got a knife and hid it in my dress for i made up my mind to kill myself rather than that  a little later i stole upstairs and brought down a brace of pistols which mr donald kept under his pillow and slipped one into alices hand presently they began to get noisy and the captain ordered me to come and sit on his knee then alice and i showed the pistols and said we would shoot ourselves if one of them laid a finger on us  the captain muttered some order to his men which i didnt hear but i guessed it was to leave us alone for the present i had no doubt what they intended to do was to catch us off our guard and wrench the pistols from us and i was glad i had the knife hidden away for if they did carry us off i was sure to be able to find some opportunity for using that  it was awful the girl said putting her hand to her face awful to be standing there and hearing them laughing and shouting and cursing i was tempted to go behind him and shoot him suddenly but the others would have been just as bad and we should have gained nothing by it i would not go through that half hour again for all the money in the world  the men had just finished and were getting up from the table and i knew the moment was coming fast when we heard a sudden shout outside my heart gave a bound as they rushed to the door the captain fired a shot at mr donald just as he was getting up and as he ran out shouted to me  i will come back for you missy  if it had not been for mr donald falling to the ground i should have fainted but alice called me as she ran to him and i think i was trying to lift him up when the constable ran in and i knew we were saved  reuben had given a sudden start when kate ellison mentioned the name of tom thorne but he had not interrupted her  i had a score against that scoundrel before he said as she finished and by heavens i will settle accounts with him when i meet him i could have forgiven him for the wrongs he did me but now and his fingers closed on the hilt of the pistol in his belt  kate who had been looking down as she told her story raised her eyes at the tone of intense passion in the young officers words and a sudden flush of colour mounted into her cheeks which were pale from the terror and excitement through which she had gone  i say ditto to captain whitney mr barker said i dont know anything about his previous doings against him but i know that if ever i come across the scoundrel i will shoot him as a dog  even you cant say anything against that wife though you are always on the side of mercy  no mrs barker agreed i would say nothing to stay your hand there john even putting this aside he has committed a score of murders and there will be no more wrong in shooting him than there would be in killing a wild beast  that is the sound of a horse coming at a gallop perhaps it is the doctor  hurrying to the door they found to their great satisfaction that mrs barkers guess was verified the surgeon had been at home when the messenger arrived and had started five minutes later arriving three or four hours earlier than they had even ventured to hope  mrs barker at once led the way into the next room and a few minutes later came out again for hot water and sponges kate had stolen away upstairs when the surgeon had entered the house the two men remained to hear the verdict  he is going to probe the wound he can give no opinion yet till he discovers what course it has taken but he says that it is a favourable symptom that the pulse is so strong and regular he wishes you both to come in as it will be necessary to hold his patients hands while he is making the examination  i cannot give any positive opinion the surgeon said when he had finished the examination i cant find the ball and i cannot tell for certain what course it took after entering but i think judging from the pulse and i may say from the expression of his face that no vital part is injured  an exclamation of thankfulness broke from mrs donald  we must not be too sanguine mr ruskin went on but there is certainly strong ground for hope i shall be able to give a more definite opinion in the course of a few hours he must of course be kept perfectly quiet with no more nourishment than is absolutely necessary and that in the shape of beef tea i should make him a bed here we will manage to slide a door under him and lift him on to it with as little movement as possible  at any rate madam he said turning to mrs donald i can congratulate you upon the fact that the bullet did not strike a couple of inches higher had it done so my ride would have been a useless one  a bed was at once brought from a room above and made up and mr donald was placed upon it in the manner which mr ruskin had suggested then with lightened hearts the party with the exception of his wife left the room  kate and mrs barker at once set to to prepare a meal for the surgeon while reuben went over to give his companions the good news that the surgeon had strong hopes that mr donald would recover  in the afternoon all the party with the exception of mr and mrs barker and the constables rode off to their respective stations assuring reuben of their readiness to assemble again at once should he obtain news which would afford a hope that the gang could be traced  a few hours later the other four constables for whom reuben had sent rode up an outhouse was now prepared for the reception of the police reuben himself taking up his abode there although mrs donald strongly urged him to come into the house but with mr and mrs barker and the surgeon there and the time of one of the ladies taken up with the wounded man reuben thought that their hands were perfectly full and said that he should prefer to mess and sleep with his men  you see mrs donald he said as she tried to induce him to alter his determination i shall have to be sending out men and receiving reports and may be obliged to ride out in the middle of the night therefore you see as absolute quiet is ordered for your husband it will be far better for me to be outside the house as the coming and going would be sure to disturb him and he would naturally want to know what is going on  you will not i hope take all your party away in pursuit of these men captain whitney she said anxiously they might get up some false alarm to take you away and then come down upon the house again i have been too much taken up with my husband to think much about it but although kate keeps up bravely i know that she is greatly shaken and terribly anxious i dont know whether she told you but it was to her chiefly that horrible man spoke and it was she he told as he rushed out that he would come back to fetch her she will never have a moments peace or tranquillity till we hear that he is either killed or taken  nor shall i reuben said i do not think that the scoundrel will dare to attempt to carry out his threat to come back again but with so daring a villain it would be rash to omit the smallest precaution you may be quite sure mrs donald that in no case will i leave the house unprotected and that if i should be called away i will leave two men here who during my absence will remain in the house and with them mr barker and the doctor you may feel perfectly assured that no open attack will be made  but i cannot impress too strongly upon you that seeing the man with whom we have to deal your sister should not stir outside the house until we have caught him or until mr donald is so far recovered as to be able to be removed i will not tell her so myself because i see that now the strain is over she is greatly shaken and i would not add to her anxiety but if you could break it to her as if it were your own idea that she had better keep within doors until this fellows caught i am sure that it will be well  you will come in this evening i hope and always of an evening captain whitney it will make a change and cheer us up besides we want to hear all about your adventures since we saw you last  this reuben gladly promised and after it was dark and he had placed a sentry he came into the house mrs barker was on duty in the sick room and reuben at mrs donalds request gave them an account of the voyage out and of the circumstances which had led to his entering the police  he would have passed very briefly over the affair at the cape but by many questions mrs donald succeeded in eliciting from him all the details of the story  it was a gallant action indeed she said warmly you certainly saved the lives of those two girls at a terrible risk of your own  to make the romance complete whitney mr barker remarked you ought to have married miss hudson  unfortunately you see reuben said with a smile in the first place i was only a boy and she was two years my senior in the next and much more important place she happened to be in love with someone else and i did not happen to be in love with her though she was i admit a very charming young lady and had been extremely kind to me  how was that whitney mr barker asked eighteen is a susceptible age i can only account for your coldness on the supposition that you had left your heart in england  i fancy my heart was then where it is now reuben rejoined with a slight smile  in the right place eh whitney  in the right place reuben repeated quietly  at this moment mrs barker entered and said that mr donald would be glad if reuben would come and sit with him for a little time  dont let him talk much mr ruskin said the less he talks the better but your talking to him for a time will cheer him up and do him good  i am glad to see you going on so well mr donald reuben said heartily as he entered the doctor says you are not to talk much but you are to play the part of a listener  do you think you will catch these fellows was mr donalds first question  i will catch them sooner or later reuben said i will run them down if they are above ground but i can take no steps in the matter until i hear from my black boy i have been expecting him to turn up ever since i got here and shall begin to be afraid that those scoundrels have ill treated him if he does not turn up before long  my wife has been telling me that they knew you at home whitney and that she and her people did you some terrible injustice somehow but she wouldnt go into the matter curious isnt it your meeting at this end of the world and that too at such a moment  it is curious reuben said what people call a coincidence but mrs donald is mistaken in telling you that her people did me an injustice her father was one of the kindest friends i ever had and although mrs ellison somewhat misjudged me and her daughter naturally shared her feeling they were not in anyway to be blamed for that for they only thought as ninetynine people out of a hundred did  whitney whitney mr donald muttered to himself i seemed to know the name though i cannot recall where  ah he said suddenly of course i remember now for i was in the court when and he stopped  when i was tried reuben put in quietly yes that was me i was acquitted as you know principally from the way in which mr ellison stood up for me thank god that he never for an instant believed that i was guilty  and to think it should be you mr donald said how strange things turn out i remember i could not make up my mind about it it seemed so strange either way  we had better not talk about it now reuben said quietly i said then and i say now that i knew the people who did it and strange as the circumstances have already been you may think them stranger still some day if i bring one of them before you alive or dead  at this moment there was a knock at the door and mrs donald came in and said that one of the constabulary wished to speak to reuben  then i will say goodnight i hope i shall find you getting on nicely in the morning mr donald  will you say goodnight to miss ellison and mrs barker for me mrs donald and tell mr barker that i shall be ready in five minutes to smoke that pipe we talked about with him outside    chapter 16 jims report   jones what is it  your black has just come sir i would not let him come in for the fact is he aint a figure to introduce among ladies  whats the matter with him jones not hurt i hope  he has been knocked about a bit sir and he is done up with travelling the poor fellow can hardly crawl and was half starved so i set him to work eating and came off to fetch you  by this time they had arrived at the door of the shed jim was sitting by a fire eagerly devouring a hunch of cold meat the men were standing round waiting till he had appeased his hunger before they asked any question he looked up and nodded when reuben entered  well jim i am glad to see you back reuben said heartily i was beginning to be afraid about you i hope you are not hurtfor the black had a handkerchief tied round his head  jim gave a grunt but continued stuffing great lumps of meat into his mouth reuben saw that he must wait till the blacks hunger was satisfied and stood quietly looking on until having devoured some five pounds of meat he gave a sigh of contentment and then took a long draught of rum and water which constable jones handed to him  jim better now he said  thats right jim now tell us all about it  jims story was a long one and it took more than an hour in the telling for his english was not always distinct and it often required much questioning on reubens part before he could quite make out its meaning the substance was as follows  on leaving some ten days before on the mission of discovering the haunt of the bush rangers he knew that it was of no use to go among the wild blacks their allies as the hostility against their semicivilized fellows was so great that he would at once have been killed he resolved to go back to the spot where the track had been obliterated by that of the flock of sheep to make a wide circuit and pick it up beyond and if possible follow it until he found them the difficulties were great for the bush rangers had spared no pains in hiding their trail keeping always upon hard high ground and at one time getting into the bed of a running stream and following it for two miles before they again struck for their rendezvous  however step by step jim had tracked them sometimes losing the trail altogether sometimes guided merely by a freshmade scratch on the surface of a stone or by a broken twig or bruised blade of grass at last he traced it far out into the bush many miles beyond the furthest range of settlements and then he lost it altogether there had been a halt for some time at this spot  beyond this jim was entirely at fault he made circle after circle round the spot but could find no trace whatever of their passage and returned to the point where he had missed the trail he relit the embers of the fire which the bush rangers had made cooked some food and laid himself downfirst to think it over then to sleep for it was now just the close of day  it was clear to him that here more than anywhere else the bush rangers had made a great effort to throw anyone who might be pursuing them off the trail he had no doubt that the bush rangers had muffled their horses hoofs with cloth and had proceeded with the greatest care through the bush so as to avoid breaking a single twig in their passage and the only reason for such greater caution could be that it was here and here only that they wished to throw the pursuers off the trail it would have seemed to a white man that they had done this before especially when they had kept in the water course but to black jims perception it appeared that they had been more careless than would be expected and that while apparently doing their utmost to conceal their tracks they had really left sufficient indications to allow a practised tracker to follow them  why then now that they were far beyond the settlements and fairly in the country of their native allies should they for the first time so hide their trail that he could not discover it  the result of jims thoughts was that when he awoke at daybreak he started back towards the settlements when he came to the river which the party had passed in pursuit of the natives he kept along its bank scrutinizing the ground with the greatest care after six miles walking he suddenly stopped at a point where the soft turf near the margin was cut up by the passage of the party of horsemen here was the confirmation of his ideas  arguing the matter out with himself jim had arrived at the conclusion that hitherto the trail had been a false one the bush rangers object being to lead their pursuers to believe that they had gone far out into the native country whereas in fact their hiding place was somewhere among the settlements should this be so the only way to find them was to search for their back track this he had now found and with a shout of triumph at his own cleverness jim forded the river and followed the track of the horses  this was now clear enough the horsemen taking no pains whatever to conceal their traces feeling perfectly confident that any pursuers must now be thrown off the scent jim followed it till sundown when he had made some thirty miles and then withdrawing some little distance from the tracks he made his fire and camped for the night  he was now inside the line of the outlying stations and had approached to the edge of a bit of wild and broken country which offered so few inducements to settlers that it had been passed by for the better land beyond although occasionally when herbage was scarce the settlers in the neighbourhood drove the animals up to feed among its hills the black had no doubt that the gang of which he was in pursuit had their haunt somewhere in the heart of this wild and littleknown tract  in the morning he again started and after travelling several miles entered a narrow valley with very steep sides with trees and brushwood growing wherever they could get a foothold he now adopted a careless and indifferent carriage and although he kept a sharp lookout no one who saw him would have supposed that he had any particular object in view  presently he noticed that the tracks turned sharply off from the line he had followed in the centre of the valley and entered the trees which grew thickly here at the foot of the hills he made no halt even for an instant but walked straight on half a mile further he sat down and lit his fire and began to cook some food he had no doubt that he was watched for just after he passed the point where the track turned off he heard a very low whistle among the trees  as he sat by the fire he kept his back towards the direction from which he had come and when he presently heard footsteps no change in his attitude betrayed that he was conscious of the fact that persons were approaching him until two men stopped beside him then with a cry as of sudden alarm he leapt to his feet  lor a mussy he exclaimed de white man frighten me bery much what for dey no say dey come  who are you nigger and where do you come from and what are you doing here  my name jim he said me going tro the country looking for place to tend hosses me bery good at hosses me look arter de hosses ob mr hudson  what did you leave him for one of the men asked sternly  someting lost from de house jim said quietly massa hudson tink me took it he make bobbery so jim ran away and look for nodder place  um the man said i wonder whether you are speaking the truth if i thought you werent i would put a bullet through your head in doublequick time  no sah jim said in great terror dat de truth sure nough jim try to get work at sydney couldnt get so start away and ask at all de stations no one want black boy for hosses so keep on and tink dere more chance out furder does massa want a boy for hoss  what do you think bill the man who had spoken asked his companion shall we put a bullet in this fellows head at once or make him useful  i dussay he is a liar the other replied but then all these black fellows are liars so that does not make much difference a black fellow would certainly be useful for the horses and to look after the fire we can always shoot him when we have done with him we shall soon see by the way he handles the horses whether he has been accustomed to them  all right the other said you come along with us then  what wages massa pay jim asked  anything you may be worth dont you fret about wages  jim pretended to hold out for a fixed sum but the man said in stern tones  come along we dont want no more jaw so you had best hold your tongue  no other words passed till they got back to the trees and then turned off where the horses had previously done so two minutes walk brought them to a roughlymade shed built against the almost perpendicular side of the hill it was built of logs and there was nothing to show that it was inhabited no smoke curled up from the chimney the door and shutters were closed anyone who passing through the valley had turned among the trees and accidentally come upon it would have taken it for some hut erected by a wood cutter  one of the men knocked three times at the door and it was at once opened jim was pushed inside the men followed him and the door was shut  who have you got here a man sitting by the side of a large fire some distance inside the cottage asked angrily  its a nigger who wants work he says he is accustomed to horses so as it was the choice between shooting him and bringing him here we thought we might as well bring him to you it would be handy to have a fellow to look after the horses and cut the wood and make himself useful if we find he is of no use there will be no great trouble in getting rid of him  that is true enough the other said and i dont think theres much risk about it  come here you fellow and let me look at you  jim stepped forward towards the fire he saw now that the hut was built against the entrance to a cave of considerable size in the centre was a great fire the smoke of which probably made its way to the surface through crevices in the rock above four other men besides the one who had addressed him were lying on sheepskins against the wall there was an opening at the further end of the cave into an inner chamber and here jim knew by an occasional snort or an impatient pawing the horses were stabled  the chief of the party asked a few more questions as to where jim had come from and how he chanced to be passing through so unfrequented a country as the black had already decided upon his story the questions were answered satisfactory enough  i think hes all right the man said at last at any rate here he is and hes not likely to go out again we have been talking of getting a black fellow for some time and as here is one ready to hand we may as well make the best of him  look you here he went on sternly to the black you come of your own free will and here you have got to stop you will have as much to eat as you can stuff plenty of rum to drink and bacca to smoke and if theres anything else you fancy no doubt you can have it only look you if you put your foot outside that door unless you are ordered to do so i will put a bullet through your black brain  all right jim said plenty eat plenty drink plenty smoke dat suit jim bery well he no want to go out of de house if massa say no  thats settled then now put some more logs on that fire  jim at once assumed his new duty and the bush rangers who all hated the slightest work were soon well satisfied with their new acquisition there were several carcasses of sheep hanging from hooks placed in the roof where they were slowly smoked by the fumes from the wood a pile of logs were heaped up in one corner and these had to be cut up into sizes and lengths suitable for the fire at one end a space was roughly partitioned off and this was filled with groceries flour and cases of wine and spirits which had been taken from waggons going up country  in the stable were several sacks of oats and a barrel filled with water which was drawn from a spring a short distance from the hut the first time jim went into the stable the captain accompanied him and soon saw by the blacks handling of the horses that his account was so far accurate and that he was thoroughly accustomed to stable work  the cooking was also handed over to him and the gang passed their time in sleeping drinking playing cards and discussing plans of robbery for the first few days a sharp watch was kept up on the black and the men went out themselves to chop wood or bring in water when it was required after a few days however they relaxed their vigilance and jim gradually took these tasks also upon himself  he was perfectly aware although he pretended to be unconscious of it that the first few times he went out one or other of the bush rangers stole quietly after him and watched him at work but as nothing suspicious was observed in his conduct this supervision was gradually given up  its time to be moving again the leader of the band said about a week after jim had joined them we settled the next job should be donalds station we know for certain that he generally has money by him and there will be the watches and trinkets of the women that fellow thompson who worked for them at first says he has got a firstrate cellar of wine and that the women were both outandouters if they are as pretty as he says we will have them here lads to do the housekeeping we want something to liven us up besides we shall forget our company manners if we dont get some ladies to keep us up to the mark a little  there was a burst of coarse laughter  what do you say boys shall we start tomorrow its a long ride and we had best leave about noon we must get into the neighbourhood before dark so as to give the horses twelve hours rest before we begin for we may have to ride for it  it aint likely barkers is the nearest station and it would be hours before they could get together men enough who would dare to follow us but still its just as well to be prepared and since that confounded new police officer has been on the station theres never been no certainty about things we owe him one for that last affair which cost smith wilson and mulready their lives but we will pay him out yet who would have thought of his being there just on that very night i swear if i ever catch him i will roast him alive  he is no fool one of the others said he gave it those black fellows hot and no mistake the sooner hes put out of the way the better hes a different sort of chap than the last fellow i shant feel comfortable till hes got either a spear or a pistol bullet in him  illustration jim notes the bush rangers plans for mischief  jim who was squatting in the corner apparently half asleep was listening intently to every word they did not heed his presence in the slightest for indeed he had since his arrival so mixed his talk with native words that the bush rangers had no idea that he could follow their conversations  he was thinking now what was his best course to adopt in the first place he had gathered from their talk that this was only one of their hiding places and that they seldom stayed very long in one neighbourhood the question therefore was whether they would return it was of no use his going to give the alarm unless he could return before his escape was suspected or they would have made off before he could get back again  as for the donalds whose station was to be attacked it gave him no concern whatever for the australian blacks had little or no regard for life except those of people to whom they were attached it was reubens mission to capture the bush rangers and had it been necessary jim would have remained quiet while a dozen families were slain until he found an opportunity of bringing the police down upon them  he listened now intently for any word which might afford an index to their intentions presently the question he hoped for came  i suppose you will not come back here again tom  no i thinks its getting too hot to hold us in these parts we might ride back here give our horses a rest and load up with a few things we may want we can bring two or three spare horses from donalds the weather is pleasant now and we might very well put in a few weeks with the blacks that last haul we made of traders goodscottons and beads and trumperies for the gins and brass rings and such like for the menwill put them in the best of humours you may be sure there will be a hot chase after us after this business and i should propose that we try our luck down south for a bit  i agree with you one of the others said we have had a very good spell here for the last ten months and it dont do to tempt luck too long that losing three of our number last week looked as if it was going to turn  whats it matter the captain laughed so much the more for us to divide we have got a goodish bit of brass now to say nothing of the goods we have got at each of our places we can fill up their places easy enough any time and those who come in are free to their share of what there is in the way of grub and goods but they only share in the brass from the time they join  jim had heard what he wanted and he now lay down and thought it out they were only coming back for a short time possibly they might change their minds and not return at all it would be a risky thing to depend upon it besides his master might be blamed if this attack on the donalds succeeded  it would be better then to try to get word to him in time for him to be there before the bush rangers arrived he himself would return to the hut so that if the police arrived too late he would be able to continue with the bush rangers till some fresh opportunity occurred for bringing his master upon them it was possible of course that one of the men would be left in the hut in which case he had only to wait  the next morning the men busied themselves examining and cleaning their arms and after dinner they went to the inner cave and led out their horses  now look here the leader said to him we are going away you see  jim nodded  we come back again tomorrow i lock this place up you stop quiet till we come back if anyone comes and knocks while we away dont jim answer let them think place empty  all right jim said shortly and went and sat down by the fire as if he had no further interest in their proceedings  the windows he had already noticed had not only shutters outside but they were firmly closed within with massive planks securely nailed and fastened jim heard the last of the party go out and then the door was shut and the lock turned jim heard the party ride off and then threw himself on the ground and listened to assure himself that they kept steadily on their way  the moment he was sure they were gone he began to search the place for a tool which would fairly suit his purpose presently he found a large butchers knife with which they cut up the carcasses and with this he set to work to dig a hole in the ground close to the wall of the hut the bottom log was only sunk a few inches in the soil and in two hours he had burrowed under it and made his way out beyond then he crept back again scraped the earth into the hole again as tightly as he could crawling out backwards he then placed a piece of turf over the outside hole and stamped it down flat  it was possible that after he had started they might change their mind and send one of their number back again that however had to be risked and at a steady run he set off for the settlements he did not make for the nearest for he had gathered from the talk of the men that the convict labourers of most of the settlements in the neighbourhood were in league with them  after three hours steady running in which he had covered over twenty miles he saw a shepherds cottage and making for it gave the man the message which he had taken to reuben he had no sooner done so and had found that the man was willing to set off with it at once than he turned and retraced his steps to the hut as rapidly as he had come it was already dusk when he reached it  instead of approaching boldly he made a circuit and crawled up to it on his belly and lay for some time listening intently with his ear to the door he felt convinced that no one was there but to make sure he knocked and then withdrew among the trees but all was still and feeling sure now that the place was untenanted he removed the piece of turf from the hole and made his way back into the hut again carefully replacing the piece of turf and then packing earth under it so that it would not give way if trodden upon this however was a very unlikely occurrence as he had made the opening where some bushes screened it from view  he swept up every scrap of soil from the floor inside filled up the hole there and trampled it down and then after indulging his appetite to the fullest threw himself down and went to sleep  when he awoke a few streaks of light streaming through the cracks of the door showed that it was day and he made up the fire and awaited the return of the bush rangers  it was four or five hours before they returned and the instant they opened the door and entered jim was sure that they had failed but to his disappointment all were there and his plan of taking them in a trap had not succeeded at this he was not surprised for his own calculations as to the distance to be traversed had shown him that it was very questionable whether even under the most favourable circumstances reuben could have got there in time with his men  without speaking a word to him the men led their horses through to the inner cave and then threw themselves down by the fire jim at once proceeded to unsaddle the horses and rub them down keeping an ear open all the time to what was being said by the bush rangers their remarks however were for a time confined to terrible curses as to their luck  how did it come about thats what i want to know the leader said this is the second time that accursed police fellow has turned up and put a spoke in our wheel why it was not more than half an hour after the first shot was fired before they was down upon us there must have been pretty nigh twenty of them how could they have got such a lot of men as that together if they hadnt known that we were coming it beats me altogether  so it does me was the general exclamation  they seemed regularly to jump out of the ground just when all was going pleasant never knew such a bit of luckthat is if it was luck and not done o purposeand yet i dont see as they could have known possible as we was going there why we didnt know ourselves till yesterday not what day it was to be and except ourselves and that black fellow no one could have known it  well its certain none of us blabbed and i dont see as how he could have told anyone  not exactly the leader said considering hes been shut up here ever since we have been away besides i dont believe he knew anything about it he dont make out half we say to him and when we are talking together he minds us no more than if he had been a black monkey but if he did its no odds he could not have passed through these walls and back again and if he could who was he to tell it to the men round here are all our pals and would have cut his jaw short with a bullet but there its no use talking about it hes not been out and theres an end of it  still it beats me altogether that police fellow seems to know what we are up to just as well as we do ourselves i would give all my share of the swag we have made for the last six months for a shot at him  i dont like it one of the others said i dont blest if i do and i says as the sooner we are out of here the better after whats happened i shant feel safe till i am well out in the blacks country if he knows what we are going to do there aint any reasons why he shouldnt know where we are  why johnson his leader sneered you dont really believe the fellows a sort of conjurer do you  i dont know the man said doggedly after he has turned up twice as he has i shouldnt be surprised at nothingnot if i heard the sound of him and his men galloping up outside now  there was a moments silence as each involuntarily listened  we are getting to be like a pack of gals the leader said savagely and i agree with you the sooner we are out of this the better as soon as it gets dark we will be on the move but i tell you directly we get out among the blacks i shall come back again i am going to carry off that gal somehow ive owed her one for years and years and i always pays my debtsat least that sort of debt  now then you black just leave them horses for the present and come and cook us some food the quicker the better  jim hurried about but in the bush rangers present state of temper nothing would satisfy them and when in his hurry to satisfy their angry orders he stumbled and upset a glass of spirits and water he was handing to the captain the latter caught up a brand from the fire and struck him so violent a blow on the temple with the glowing end that he fell senseless on the ground  he must have lain there a long time he was brought to his senses by a bucket of water being dashed over him and he found when he staggered to his feet that the band were preparing to depart they had already packed up the bales of presents for the blacks and placed them on the horses some of their more valuable belongings were packed away in a secret hiding place the rest were left to take their chance till they returned and indeed except by their friends among the shepherds there was little probability of anyone paying a visit to the hut however long their absence might be  had it not been that jim had proved himself a really useful fellow for the last week they would have shot him at once and tossed his body in the wood but they found it so pleasant having all their work taken off their hands that after a short discussion they decided to take him with them  the door was locked and they started at a trot but evening was closing in their horses had already performed two long journeys in the last twentyfour hours and they soon settled into a walk they travelled for some hours and it being then evident that the horses could proceed no further a halt was called no fire was lighted for they were scarcely beyond the settlements and for aught they could tell an active search might still be carried on for them  so anxious were they that they agreed to keep watch by turns but when morning broke it was discovered that the black was missing the next quarter of an hour was spent in angry recriminations but as none could say in whose watch he made his escape their quarrel ceased  its no use bothering about it the leader said theres one thing he knows nothing and can tell nothing against us he may guess what he likes but people dont waste time in listening to black fellows stories i expect he has only given us the slip because of that lick across the head i gave him last night i admit i was a fool to do it but i wasnt in the best of tempers  however if the worst comes to the worst he can only lead them to the hut and they wont find much worth taking there when we once get out to the blacks we can snap our fingers at them  it was indeed about midnight when jim had stolen away he was still faint and giddy and his face was terribly burned by the blow which had been dealt him but when once fairly away from the bush rangers he set out in the direction in which he knew the donalds station lay and never halted until he arrived there on the following evening utterly wearied and worn out for he had eaten nothing on the previous day  then they have got away after all jim reuben said when he had listened patiently to the long narration you have done all that was possible jim you have done splendidly my poor fellow and although we were just too late to catch the bush rangers we saved the people here but it is indeed unfortunate that they should have got off  jim knows where dey hab gone the black said dey hab gone to de country of bobitui heard dem say de name jim know dat country wellhe come from der  further question showed that jim had indeed belonged to bobitus tribe and had come with a party of his people down to the settlements where he was taken ill and left to die but was picked up and nursed by mr hudson  and you could take us there  jim nodded  bery long march massa tree days with horses plenty bad people much fight  i dont care how far it is or how much fighting we have got to do i am bound to hunt down that fellow however far hes gone i suppose there is no trouble about water if they can go there we can  four six water holes jim said no trouble about dattrouble from de black fellow  well we must risk it anyhow we cant start for a day or two i must send and fetch up all the police and i daresay some of the colonists will join the news of this business here has maddened everyone and as it is not likely that the blacks will give any trouble for some time and as we know the bush rangers have left for the present no one need be afraid of leaving their station for a week or two  the next day mounted messengers were sent off in all directions giving notice that the police would start in three days time for a hunt after the bush rangers and that there was this time every prospect of success as their hiding place was known  on the day named no less than thirty settlers assembled together with the whole of the police force all were well armed and had brought several days provisions with them mr donald had made marked progress and the surgeon had now every hopes of his recovery but as he could not be moved and it was just possible the bush ranger might return to carry out his threat during their absence two constables were left in the house and kate was charged on no account to put her foot outside the door    chapter 17 in pursuit   the last thing before the party started reuben went into the house mr barker was going to remain behind he was past middle life and the expedition was likely to be a very toilsome one and reuben was glad when he said that he thought six days severe riding would be rather too much for him and that he should constitute himself the guardian of the ladies  my wife has arranged to stay here while you are away so i shall ride over to my place and see that all is going on straight every day and sleep here at night  well ladies reuben said as he entered the room we are just off so i will say goodbye to you and i hope that on my return i shall find mr donald much better i am sure that mr ruskin would not have left this morning unless he felt that he had quite turned the corner pray take care of yourselves while we are away you know i dont want to alarm you but pray be careful i shall not feel comfortable as to your safety till i have that villain safely in my hands  goodbye captain whitney you know you have all our best wishes mrs barker said we will take care of ourselves till we hear that you have destroyed the band and above all its leader  the news that you have done so mrs donald said will do more i think for my husband than anything in the way of doctoring but take care of yourself captain whitney i know from what mr barker said that although you make light of your expedition it is a dangerous one he said the police had never ventured so far in the bush and you may expect sharp fighting with the blacks  we may have a brush with them reuben said lightly but do not be anxious about us we are a very strong party and you need have no fear of the result  goodbye miss ellison pray be careful till i return  the last words were said in an undertone as he held her hand  goodbye captain whitney she said god bless you all and bring you safely back  two minutes later the party rode off jim was like the rest mounted as they would travel fast four led horses carried provisions for they would not as before find food by the way it was two oclock in the day when they started and they rode thirty miles before they halted for the night at a water hole they had seen no signs of natives during the day but reuben at once posted four men as sentries  it was a merry party round the fire for all were in high spirits at the prospect of an expedition to a point far beyond that to which any white men with the exception of fugitives from justice had penetrated and they were delighted with the thought of putting a stop at last to the operations of the band who had so long been a scourge to the settlement  mr blount dick caister and several others who had formed part of the last expedition were of the party and the confidence which these felt in their young leader and in the sagacity of his native follower communicated itself to those who had not formed part of the previous expedition  must start early jim said to reuben the last thing long way to water ride all day not get dere before dark  they rode rapidly for some time after starting so as to allow the horses to take it easily during the heat of the day when there was a halt of three hours but in the afternoon they quickened their pace again and men and horses were jaded and done up when just as the sun was setting they arrived at their destination  how that black fellow of yours finds his way through this bush is a perfect marvel to me dick caister said the country has become more undulating this afternoon but the first thirty miles were almost perfectly level and i could see nothing whatever that could serve as an index except of course the sun still that is only a guide as to the general direction it must have been nine or ten years since that fellow was here and yet he led us as straight as if he was making for a church steeple  it seems to be a sort of instinct reuben said although possibly for the last part of the distance he may have seen signs of the passage of the natives as far as i can understand he tells me at this time of year there is no other water hole within a long distance so that naturally there will be many natives making for it i am glad there are not any of them here now  why isnt that horse hobbled like the rest reuben asked suddenly whose is it  that is the one your black fellow rode sir sergeant oconnor said  jim where are you reuben called but no reply came  what has become of him i wonder reuben said has anyone seen him since we rode up  he jumped off the instant we came here one of the policemen replied and said to me look after captain horse and i havent seen anything of him since  there has been somebody here sir another policeman said coming up heres the remains of a fire behind this bush  yes mr blount said examining them and pulling out a brand that was still glowing do you see a lot of sand has been thrown over it whoever was here must have seen us coming and tried to extinguish the fire when they caught sight of us  that is most unfortunate reuben said the fellows must have made off to carry the news of our coming to their friends however its too late to do anything now its already getting dark and they must have got a quarter of an hours start we have taken quite enough out of the horses and can do no more with them if they have to travel tomorrow but i would give a years pay if this hadnt happened  well theres nothing to do for it but to light our fires and camp  the knowledge that they had been seen and that the news would be carried to those of whom they were in search acted as a great damper on the spirits of the party and the camp was much more quiet and subdued than it had been on the previous evening  all is not quite lost reuben said when two hours later he found that jim was still absent from the camp i can only account for his stealing away from us in that manner by supposing that he must either have caught sight of the natives or come upon their trail and at once set off in pursuit i dont see what it could be otherwise  but if he saw them why didnt he tell you whitney mr blount said tired as our horses were they could have got up a gallop for a bit  yes but for a very short distance dick caister put in and as it was getting dusk if the blacks had had anything like a start we could not have overtaken them before it had got quite dark those blacks can run like the wind it takes a wellmounted man to overtake them  an hour after the party had lain down one of the sentries challenged and the answer which came back all right me jim at once brought everyone to their feet  well jim what is it where have you been reuben asked  jim hungry  that you may be quite sure dick caister said with a laugh was there ever a native who wasnt hungry unless he had stuffed himself half an hour before  yes i kept some supper for you jim reuben said but before you begin to eat just tell me if everything is all right  everyting all right jim said squatting himself beside the still glowing fire and beginning to eat  reuben knew by experience that it was of no use questioning him until he had finished and he therefore waited patiently although one or two of the settlers grumbled at being kept waiting for the news when jim had finished his meal he looked round reuben knew what he was expecting and handed him a hornful of rum and water the black took a draught and then without any further delay began to tell his story  he had while still some distance from the halting place seen a light smoke coming up and was sure that a party was already there  but why did you not tell us jim reuben interrupted we might have galloped on and caught them  no sah no catch dem horses too tired black fellow run away when see white men coming dat no do at all only one way to do let em tink dat no one saw dem else dey run and run all de way to bobitu  when get near camp jim see dat smoke not come up know de black fellow see white man and put out um fire when jim come here he jump off hoss find fire and follow de track dey four men one go one way one go anoder two men go straight on dey go on to tell bobitu de oders go to black fellows in de bush jim not care for dem follow de two  but how could you follow them in the dark  jim were sure de way dey go dat enough for jim he suppose dat dey top after a bit and when dey see de white men all top quiet at de water hole and light fire dey tink it all right no make hurry perhaps top and light a fire demselves  so jim go on quiet for two tree hour den at last he see fire sure nough he crawl up quiet and see two black fellow dar and hear what em say dey tired make long walk today to water hole say no hurry white men all go sleep round fire not go on till sun get up so dey stop for two tree hour to rest demselves  jim get quite close and jump up den cut off one black fellow head with sword run sword through de body of other finish em both and den come back to camp  well done indeed jim reuben exclaimed and a chorus of satisfaction rose from all the party at hearing that the menwho had they reached the bush rangers would have given the alarm and so enabled them to make their escape before the expedition arrivedhad been killed the news however that two of the party had escaped and might bring the blacks down upon them before morning necessitated an increase of precautions  reuben at once divided the force into four parties each consisting of five constables and seven settlers one party were at once placed on watch and were to be relieved in two hours time  i not tink dey come before morning sah jim said no water hole near here tomorrow plenty black fellow come  all right jim we dont care for them in the daylight and now that i know the bush rangers wont be alarmed i dont mind  jims prediction proved correct the night passed off quietly and the party again started at daylight the country became more and more broken as they proceeded the undulations became hills some of these were so steep that all had to dismount and lead their horses up  is bobitus camp among these hills jim  ober toder side sah him place in valley toder side bush plenty game for black fellow  how far is it to this valley jim  jims ideas of figures were but vague and he could only say that they would get there somewhere about sunset  that would be a bad time to get there jim we must halt a mile or two this side of them and you must lead half the party round so as to cut off their retreat even if we dont attack them till the morning on their fresh horses those fellows will gallop right away from us if they once get a start  there is no fear i hope of any of the other blacks getting there before us and giving the alarm  jim shook his head  no we come straight from water hole black fellow go round long way no fear dey get dere dey fight when we go back  thats all right bobitus fellows and the bush rangers will be quite enough to tackle at once as for the others we will make short work of them if they venture to attack us on the march back they fight pluckily enough against men on foot because they know they can make off when they like but they cant stand a charge of horsemen  although not so long as the journey on the preceding day the men were heartily glad when at about four oclock in the afternoon the halt was called and they heard that the place where the bush rangers were supposed to be was but four miles away after some consultation it was decided that jim should lead half the bandconsisting of ten constables under oconnor and fifteen colonistsround through the hills to a position near the mouth of the valley in which the blacks and bush rangers were likely to be and that when he had posted them there he should come back again to their present halting place and lead forward the party under reuben  mind reuben said before the others started we dont want to attack the blacks unless they show fight our object is the bush rangers jim says that by what he heard they have got some sort of houses they have built there let us make straight for them if the blacks attack drive them off but we can settle with them afterwards the great point is to capture or kill the bush rangers  all agreed to this for although the blacks gave great trouble by driving off the sheep and cattle and sometimes killing the shepherds there was not the same feeling of hatred entertained for them as for the bush rangers it was felt to be natural that the natives should resent the occupation of their hunting grounds and although they were shot down without mercy in fair fight or if overtaken while carrying off cattle there was no active feeling of animosity against them and they were generally kindly treated when they called unarmed at the stations and asked for food  against the bush rangers on the other hand a deadly hatred was felt by the colonists and the fact that these were constantly aided by the ticketofleave labourers increased the hostility with which they were regarded  jim left his horse behind him when he started with his party saying that coming back at night in the dark he would rather be without it after their comrades had set out those who remained behind posted two men as sentries and then as soon as they had cooked and eaten a meal laid themselves down to sleep until the time should come for their advance  it was just midnight when jim returned he reported that he had seen no blacks by the way and that he believed he had posted his party without their being observed he himself instead of returning by the same route that he had taken them had come straight up the valley  there were he said two huts which had been built by the bush rangers and these were now occupied by them there were great fires blazing and he thought that the natives had probably only arrived there that evening he had got near enough to find that they were in a high state of delight at the presents which their white friends had brought them  did you catch sight of any of the bush rangers jim reuben asked  two ob dem came out and spoke to black fellows at fire but too far off to see which dey were  an hour before daybreak the party moved forward and halted within half a mile of the bush rangers camp there they stopped till they could see the sunlight touch the top of the hill at the righthand side of the valley this was the signal agreed upon and mounting they rode forward at full speed  just as they got within sight of the huts they heard a wild shouting followed instantly by the crack of rifles another minute and they had reached the scene and joined the other party who had made straight to the huts the blacks awakened suddenly as they were sleeping round the embers of their fires had hastily thrown a volley of spears and had darted away among the bushes  surrender in the queens name reuben shouted and i promise you that you shall be taken down and have a fair trial  the answer came in the flash of a rifle from the window of one of the huts and a constable immediately behind reuben fell dead with the ball through his head  dismount reuben shouted and break in the doors  with a shout the men threw themselves from their horses and rushed at the doors of the huts  sergeant oconnor reuben said do you with six of your men keep up a fire at the windows dont let a man show himself there  let ten of the others look after the horses we shall have the blacks back in no time  so saying he ran forward and joined those who were battering at the doors several of them had brought stout axes with them and the doors speedily gave way there was a rush forward  mr blount fell dead and dick caisters shoulder was broken by a bullet but there was no check as the colonists poured into the huts there was a short sharp fight but in two minutes it was over three of the gang had been shot as they leapt from the windows four more lay dead or dying in the huts  one of them had thrown down his arms and shouted for mercy he had been knocked down and stunned by the butt end of a rifle but was otherwise unwounded  short as was the fight it had given time to the blacks to rally their shouts were ringing in the air and the spears were flying thickly as the party having finished their work rushed outside again to assist the constables who were guarding the horses  pour a volley into the bushes reuben shouted then mount and charge them  the order was executed and in a minute the horsemen were dashing hither and thither among the bushes shooting down with their pistols the blacks who resisted or dealing tremendous blows among them with their hunting whips the charge was irresistible and in five minutes the main body of the blacks were flying at full speed up the steep hillsides  the victors soon gathered round the huts several men and horses had been wounded with spears but none of the injuries were of a serious character  well how about the prisoners reuben asked the sergeant who had arrived before him  theres only one prisoner sir all the rest are accounted for  is it their captain  i dont know sir i have never set eyes on him but if hes a young chap as they say it aint him  jim reuben said just go round and examine the bodies and see which of them is the captain  jim returned in a couple of minutes  none of dem aint him sah he not dere  reuben started  are you quite sure jim  quite sure sah  are you sure none of them escaped sergeant  i am quite sure of that sir no one came out of either of the doors and there were only three who tried to bolt through the windows and we accounted for them all perhaps that chap who is prisoner can tell you where to find the captain its a bad job indeed if he has escaped  is the man recovering his senses  yes sir hes just coming round  reuben stepped into the hut the escape of thorne destroyed all the satisfaction which his success would have given him he had good reason to know the fiendish malignity of the man and in spite of the warnings he had given kate ellison and his strict orders to the police on guard he felt a thrill of anxiety now that he was aware her enemy was still at large  the prisoner was sitting up in a corner of the hut a policeman with drawn sword standing near him  where is your leader reuben asked sternly the man you call fothergill  he went away yesterday morning the man said with a grin of satisfaction you havent caught him yet and you will hear more of him before you do  where was he going reuben demanded  you wont get nothing out of me the fellow said hes been a good mate and a true and i aint going to put you bloodhounds on his scent hes gone awooing thats where hes gone and that wont help you much  reuben at once went outside and called the settlers round him  i am sorry to say he said that the leader of the party has got away he rode off yesterday morning and although the prisoner we have taken did not say where he has gone i have not the least doubt he has ridden back to the donalds to try and carry out his threat to return for miss ellison  therefore gentlemen may i ask you to start homeward at once the horses have only done a few miles and if we press forward we may manage to get to our camp of the evening before last we have no more to do here except to see if there are any valuables hidden in the huts and set fire to them  i expect that we shall have fighting with the blacks on our way back those parties the two fellows who got away went to fetch will likely enough bar our way if it were not for that i should ride on by myself but my duty is to stop with my men until at any rate we have passed the place where the blacks are likely to attack us that done i shall push on it is annoying indeed to think that that fellow must have passed us somewhere on the way yesterday  the settlers agreed at once they all sympathized with reuben in his disappointment at the escape of the leader of the bush rangers and regretted the matter deeply on their own account they were too now that the work was done anxious to be off not only because they wished to return to their stations but because they felt that their position was a dangerous one they had penetrated to a distance hitherto unattempted into the country of the natives and they knew that these would gather round them like hornets on their return march  ten minutes were spent in the search of the huts the police probed the ground with their swords and closely examined the walls they found under some sheepskins in one corner a bag containing upwards of two hundred pounds which was doubtless the amount which the bush rangers had brought back with them from their last plundering expedition and had not yet been added to their main store wherever that might be this however was a welcome find to the police and they abandoned the idea of searching further and were about to set fire to the hut when the prisoner said  lookee here i may as well tell you where the lot is hidden it may do me good when it comes to the trial and you may as well have it as for it to lay there you dig up the ground in front of that tree behind the hut and you will find it  five minutes later a large leather bag containing a considerable quantity of gold and notes and a number of watches chains and other trinkets was brought to light  dont stop to count the money now reuben said fasten it on one of the horses and let us be off  sergeant let jones ride beside the prisoner and be responsible for his safety see that his hands are tied behind him and his ankles tied securely to stirrup leathers let four men take charge of the eight horses of these bush rangers do you ride ahead with four others and keep a sharp lookout as you go dont press the horses but we must go at a smart pace for we have a long days march before us it is fully sixty miles to the water hole where we camped the night before last  a few minutes later the party were in motion although disappointed at the escape of the leader of the band they were well satisfied with the result of the expedition and at the small amount of loss at which it had been accomplished there was general regret at the death of mr blount but two lives were considered to be but a small loss for the capture of so strong a body of bush rangers who knowing that they fought with ropes round their neck always made a desperate resistance  half the journey was accomplished without incident and reuben felt satisfied that they would at least have no trouble with the tribe they had scattered in the morning the speedy start that they had made had taken them beyond their pursuit and if attacked it would be by other tribes  after an hours halt to feed the horses and cook some meat for themselves the party proceeded again another fifteen miles were passed then reuben saw the sergeant with the little party ahead suddenly draw rein he galloped forward to them  what is it sergeant  i am pretty sure i saw a black fellows head over that rock sir its a nasty piece of ground i noticed it yesterday as i came along it would be the worst place to be attacked in of any we have passed if the blacks are here in force they know what they are doing  reuben examined the position it was certainly a nasty place to be attacked in the valley was narrow and thickly strewn with boulders of all sizes which had rolled down from the hillsides among these the bush grew thickly and it was only down a narrow path in the centre formed by a winter stream now dry that horsemen could pass  i dont think it would do to make a bolt through that sir the sergeant said shaking his head we could only ride two abreast and if they are strong we should be riddled with spears before we got through and theres no charging them among those stones and bush  that is so sergeant we shall have to dismount and drive them out foot by foot theres nothing else for it  by this time all the party had come up and reuben explained to them the situation all at once agreed that they could do nothing on horseback on such ground  the whole party therefore dismounted the horses were tied to bushes and the prisoner securely fastened to a tree then rifle in hand they moved forward  the sergeants eye had not deceived him for as they approached the spot where the boulders and bush grew thickest a shower of spears was thrown and the native cry rose shrill in the air the party were advancing in skirmishing order and most of them threw themselves down or dodged behind rocks as the blacks rose to throw their spears and a moment later the rifles cracked out several of the blacks fell and the rest disappeared among the bushes  make your way forward steadily and carefully let each man watch his neighbour to the right and left and keep in line as much as you can  the fight now commenced in earnest but the settlers and police gradually made their way forward not only had they the advantage in weapons but the fact that they were able to fire while lying down or stooping gave them an immense advantage over the blacks who had to expose themselves when rising to throw their spears or take aim with their bows  several times emboldened by their superior numbers the blacks attempted a rush but the heavy fire from rifle and pistol which greeted them each time sent them back in diminished numbers at last the resistance became feebler as the natives seeing that they were being driven out of their shelter began to slink off so as not to be exposed to the fire of the white men in the comparatively open ground beyond many however were not quick enough and were shot down as they scaled the steep hillside  the party of whites gathered and compared notes many had received wounds more or less severe but none of a nature to prevent them from continuing their journey they quickly returned to their horses and mounting continued their way  there is no fear of any farther attack i should think sergeant  i should think not sir the beggars must have had enough of it they must have lost from forty to fifty men  two hours later the party arrived at the halting place  now sergeant reuben said i shall hand over the command to you and shall ride on at once with my boy i am most anxious about the man who has escaped i shall take four of the bush rangers horses they have not been ridden and having had three or four days rest are comparatively fresh the fellow has had only one days start and if i push straight on i may be there before him  reuben briefly bade adieu to his friends while jim was transferring the saddles to two of the bush rangers horses and leading two others they started together in darkness changing saddles every ten miles they rode on till past midnight when they halted for the horses accustomed as they were to long journeys were now completely broken down and jim and his master could scarce keep their seats  too much long jim said as he threw himself down after taking off the saddles and hobbling the horses too much long sah  it is long jim reuben replied people in england would hardly believe horses could go a hundred miles in a day even if led a part of the distance another fifty miles will take us to donalds it is about twenty miles to the water hole where we camped the first night and that was about thirty miles from the station  shall jim light a fire sah  no jim it isnt worth while there is some cold meat in my haversack if you are hungry but i am too tired to eat if there are any natives prowling about a fire might bring them round on us  no tink black fellows near massa  i dont think so either but i dont want to run the risk jim besides i am sure neither of us can be trusted to keep watch  reuben in spite of his fatigue was some time before he could get off to sleep the thought that probably tom thorne was at that time camped at the water hole twenty miles ahead and that in the morning his horse would be far fresher than those he had ridden was maddening to him at one time he thought of getting up and pursuing his way on foot but he was stiff in every limb and felt that the journey was beyond him moreover if the bush ranger had taken some other line and was not camping there he would have no means of pursuing his journey  at the first gleam of daylight they were afoot the saddles were put on the horses and they continued their way reuben soon found however that the five hours he had rested had been insufficient to restore the horses and even by riding them alternately he could get them but little beyond a walk  on arriving at the water hole the remains of a fire were found jim examined the ground carefully and found the tracks of a horse and was of opinion that the rider had started three or four hours previously reuben carried a large flask of spirits and having poured what remained in it down the throats of the horses and given them a drink at the pool he again pressed on  ten miles farther he arrived at the first outlying station the owner of this had not joined in the expedition being a married man and unwilling to leave his wife in such an exposed position but upon reubens arrival he at once agreed to lend him two fresh horses and to take care of those which reuben brought with him  while the settler was driving them in from the paddock his wife busied herself in preparing two huge bowls of bread and milk these were thankfully swallowed by reuben and jim and five minutes later they started on the fresh horses  it was indeed a relief to reubens anxiety to find himself again flying over the ground at a rapid gallop after the slow and tedious pace at which he had travelled since morning his spirits rose and the fears which had oppressed him seemed lifted as if by magic he assured himself that he had no cause for anxiety for that the two constables would assuredly be on the watch and kate had promised not to venture beyond the doors of the house until his return    chapter 18 settling accounts   reuben soon checked the speed of his horse anxious as he was to arrive as soon as possible he might for aught he knew yet have occasion to try the animal to the utmost and he therefore reduced the almost racing pace at which he had started into an ordinary steady gallop the horses were fresh and in good condition and for several miles kept up the pace without flagging then they were allowed to ease down into a walk until they got their wind again and then started at the pace half canter half gallop which is the usual rate of progression of the colonial horses they drew rein at last on a slight eminence from which the donalds station a mile or so distant could be perceived  thank god reuben muttered to himself i am back here at last there is no occasion for further hurry and the horses were allowed to go at an easy walk  man on horseback jim suddenly said touching reubens arm  wherewhere jim  gone from de house sah trough dem trees dare he go again he gallop fast  reuben had not caught sight of the figure but he pressed his spurs against the horses sides  i will see who it is at any rate jim do you ride straight on to the house and say i shall be there in a few minutes  as reuben rode at a headlong gallop towards the point where his course would probably intersect that of the horseman riding in the direction jim had pointed out he turned over rapidly in his mind the thought whether his anxiety for kate ellison was not making a fool of him why should he turn from his course just at the end of a long journey to start at full speed on the track of this figure of which jim had caught only a glance it might be a stockman or someone who had ridden over from one of the neighbouring stations to see how donald was getting on but even so he told himself no harm was done by his assuring himself of that  it was not the way mr barker would take to his station had it been a neighbour who had come over he would not be likely to leave again so early neither of the constables would be riding away in defiance of his orders on no account to stir any distance from the house  presently he caught a glimpse of the horseman he was not more than half a mile away now but the view he obtained was so instantaneous that he could not distinguish any particulars  he is riding fast anyhow he said faster than a man would travel on ordinary business he is either a messenger sent on urgent business or it is thorne  he slightly altered the direction of his course for the speed at which the horseman was travelling must take him ahead of him at the point where reuben had calculated upon cutting him off in a short distance he would get a view of him for the trees ended here and the plain was open and unbroken save by low bush  when the figure came clear of the trees he was but a quarter of a mile away and reuben gave a start for he recognized at once the uniform of his own corps it could only be one of the men left at donalds and with an exclamation of anger reuben pressed his horse to the utmost in pursuit of the man who was now almost directly ahead at the same time uttering a loud call  the man glanced back but to reubens surprise instead of stopping waved his hand above his head and pressed forward two miles were traversed before reuben was beside him  what do you mean sir he thundered out  but the man pointed ahead  he has carried off miss ellison sir and has shot brown dead i will tell you afterwards  there do you see sir over that brow there  at the moment reuben saw a figure on horseback rise against the skyline fully two miles in front  ride steadily smithson he said keep me in view and i will keep him we must overtake him in time for his horse is carrying double i shall push on for i am better mounted than you are and he may try to double and throw us off his traces if anything happens to me dont stop for a moment but hunt that fellow down to the end  reuben had been holding his horse somewhat in hand during the last mile for he thought there must be some reason for the constables strange conduct but he now let him go and urging him to his full speed soon left the constable behind he knew that for some distance ahead the country was flat and unbroken and that the fugitive would have no chance of concealment whichever way he turned  upon reaching the spot where he had seen the bush ranger pass the wide plain opened before him and he gave a shout of exultation as he saw that he had gained considerably the fugitive indeed had evidently not been pressing his horse  he thinks he has a long journey before him reuben muttered i fancy hes mistaken he thinks hes only got a constable after him and that he can easily rid himself of him whenever he comes up to him no doubt he learned from some of the convicts that everyone is away and therefore thinks himself safe from all pursuit when once he has wiped out smithson all the better i shall overtake him all the sooner  such indeed was the view of the bush ranger who kept along at a steady canter troubling himself very little about the solitary constable whom he believed to be in pursuit of him when indeed on glancing round he saw that his pursuer was within a quarter of a mile of him he reined in his horse and turning calmly awaited his coming  reuben at once checked the speed of his horse he knew that the man was said to be a deadly shot with his pistol but he was confident in his own skill for with constant and assiduous practice he had attained a marvellous proficiency with his weapon but he did not care to give his foe the advantage which a man sitting on a steady seat possesses over one in the saddle of a galloping horse he therefore advanced only at a walk  the bush ranger put down the change in speed to fear caused by his resolute attitude and shouted  look here constable you had best turn your horses head and go home again you know well enough that one constable is no match for me so you had best rein up before i put a bullet in your head if you shoot you are just as likely to kill the young woman here as you are me and you know i dont make any mistake  reuben was already conscious of his disadvantage in this respect for the bush ranger held the girl on the saddle in front of him so that her body completely covered his she was enveloped in a shawl which covered her head as well as her figure her captor held her tightly pressed to him with his left arm while his right was free to use a pistol  reuben checked his horse at a distance of some fifty yards while he thought over the best course to pursue as he paused thorne for the first time noticed that it was an officer with whom he had to deal and not with the constable who as he believed was the only one in the district he uttered a savage exclamation for he felt that this materially altered the conditions of the affair  oh its you is it he said i thought it was only one of your men but the advice i gave is as good for you as for him i advise you to turn back before all my mates are down on you  your mates will never be down on anyone again tom thorne reuben said sternly we have wiped out seven of them and the other is a prisoner  its a lie the bush ranger said furiously they are two hundred miles away in the bush  with your friend bobitu eh yes they were but they are not now thorne they are lying under the ashes of that hut of yours close to the tree where you buried your treasure and its i who am going to have help not you my man will be up in a few minutes and he glanced round at the constable whom the bush ranger now perceived for the first time less than half a mile away  reubens words had the effect they were intended to excite they filled the bush ranger with fury and desire for vengeance while the sight of the approaching constable showed him that unless he took prompt measures he would have two adversaries to fight at once  without a moments hesitation he set spurs to his horse and dashed at reuben when within twenty yards he fired  reuben felt a sharp pain as if a hot iron had been passed across his cheek thorne uttered a shout of exultation as he saw him start but as he kept his seat again raised his hand to fire in an instant reuben discharged his pistol and the bush rangers weapon dropped from his hand for reubens bullet passed through his wrist  throwing the burden before him headlong to the ground thorne drew a pistol with his left hand and the two shots rung out again at almost the same instant reuben however was slightly the quickest and this saved his life his bullet passed through the bush rangers body while thornes pistol was diverted somewhat from its aim and the bullet struck reubens left shoulder instead of his head in an instant he had drawn another pistol  surrender or i fire and then seeing by the change in the bush rangers face and by his collapsing figure that he was badly hit he waited still keeping thorne covered with the muzzle for the bush ranger had a charge left in the pistol which he still grasped in his left hand  twice thorne tried to raise it but in vain then he reeled in the saddle the pistol dropped from his hand and he fell heavily over on to the ground  reuben at once leaped from his horse and ran to raise kate ellison who lay motionless on the ground as she had been thrown removing the shawl wrapped round her head he found she was insensible kneeling beside her he raised her head to his shoulder and a minute later the constable galloped up  badly hurt captain he asked as he leaped off his horse for the blood was streaming down reubens face and his left arm hung useless  nothing to speak of smithson see to miss ellison first there is some water in my flask in the holster just bring it here and sprinkle her face i hope she is only stunned but that scoundrel threw her off with such force that she may well be badly hurt  is he done for captain the man asked glancing at the prostrate figure of the bush ranger as he proceeded to obey reubens instructions because if you aint certain about it i had better put a bullet into him these fellows are very fond of playing possum and then turning the tables upon you  there is no fear of that smithson hes hard hit i hope hes not dead for i would rather that he were tried for his crimes  it was some time before kate ellison opened her eyes for a moment she looked vaguely round then as her eyes fell upon reubens face she uttered a little cry and raised herself into a sitting position  what is it captain whitney are you badly hurt  thank god you have recovered miss ellison you began to frighten me horribly i was afraid you were seriously injured  do not look so alarmed i can assure you i am not much hurt only a flesh wound i fancy in the cheek and a broken collarbone  and you have saved me again captain whitney  yes thank god i have had that good fortune reuben said quietly and this time for good for tom thorne will never molest you again  but cant i do something your face is bleeding dreadfully please let me bind it up and tearing a strip off the bottom of her dress she proceeded to bandage reubens face  the constable took off the black silk handkerchief which he wore round his neck  i think miss this will make a sling for his arm and when that is done the captain will be pretty right  do you think you can ride back sir he asked when he had fastened the handkerchief or will you wait till i ride back to the farm and fetch help  i can ride back well enough reuben said trying to rise to his feet but he found himself unable to do so  the ball after breaking his collarbone had glanced downwards and the wound was a more serious one than he had imagined  no i dont think i can ride back smithson  there is a light cart at the farm kate ellison said please fetch that i will stop here with captain whitney till you come back  i think that will be the best way miss the constable agreed and mounting he rode off at once  it was an hour and a half before he returned bringing the cart but before he arrived mr and mrs barker had ridden up on horseback the former having returned from his visit to the farm just as the constable rode in while they had been alone reuben had heard from kate what had taken place  i did as you told me captain whitney and did not go once outside the door the constables kept a very sharp lookout and one of them was always on guard by the door so there really did not seem any possibility of danger  this morning as i was washing up the breakfast things with mrs barker a shot was suddenly fired outside the door and before i had time to think what it meant that man rushed in he caught me by the wrist and said  come along its no use your screaming  mrs barker caught up something and rushed at him but he knocked her down with the butt end of his pistol then he caught up her shawl which was lying on the chair close by and threw it right over my head and then caught me up and carried me out  i tried to struggle but he seemed to hold me as if i were in a vice i heard alice scream and then i must have fainted for the next thing i knew was that i was being carried along on horseback i was so muffled up and he held me so tight that i felt it was no use to struggle and i made up my mind to lie quite still as if i was still insensible till he put me down and theni think i intended to try and seize his pistol or to get hold of a knife if there was one and if i could not kill him to kill myself  there did not seem the least hope of rescue mr barker was away and would not be back for hours i supposed that the constables were shot and all the men round were away with you and from the distance you said you were going i did not think you could be back for days  presently i felt him stop and turn his horse and then when he spoke i knew that he had not killed both the constables and that one of them had followed him when you answered i thought it was your voice though it seemed impossible but i could not be sure because i could not hear plainly through the shawl then the pistols were fired and i suddenly felt myself falling and i did not know anything more till i saw you leaning over me  but where are all the others and how is it you are here alone of course you must have turned back before you got to where the bush rangers were  no i am glad to say we succeeded with that part of the work miss ellison and have wiped out the bush rangers altogether we have got one of them a prisoner but all the rest of the gang are killed  the distance is not quite so far as we thought it was it was a thirty miles march and two sixties we attacked them at daybreak on the third day after leaving  but it is only the fourth day today is it not at least it seems so to me  it is the fourth day miss ellison when we found that the leader of the gang was not with them and i learned from the man we had taken prisoner that he had started to ride back here twentyfour hours before i was naturally very anxious about you knowing as i did what desperate actions the man was capable of so we started at once and after a sharp fight with the blacks got down in the evening to the water hole sixty miles on our way back where we had camped the second night out  of course the horse i had ridden could travel no further but i pushed on with my black boy on two of the horses which we had taken from the bush rangers and which had been led so far we made another forty miles by midnight and then halted till daybreak to give the horses rest but they were so done up this morning that we could not get them much beyond a foot pace when we came to the first settlement we exchanged them for fresh ones and galloped on and thank god we are just in time  the tears were standing in the girls eyes and she laid her hand on his and said quietly  thank you then you have ridden a hundred and fifty miles since yesterday morning besides having two fights and all because you were uneasy about me  i had as you see good reason to be uneasy miss ellison  at this moment a horses hoofs were heard approaching and jim galloped up he had on arriving at the station been unable to obtain any information as to what had taken place mrs donald was in a dead faint mrs barker had just before he arrived ridden off to meet her husband but the dead body of the constable by the door and the disappearance of kate showed him what had taken place and he at once started after his master  his horse however was a very inferior one to that ridden by reuben and until he met the constable returning he had been obliged to follow the track of the horses in front so he did not arrive at the scene of the fray till half an hour after its conclusion he uttered exclamations of dismay at seeing his masters condition for reuben had been gradually growing faint and could now scarcely support himself on his elbow  jim however had taken the precaution to snatch a bottle of spirits from the shelf before he started having an eye to his own comforts as well as to the possibility of its being required he now knocked off the neck and poured some into the cup of reubens flask and put it to his lips  thank you jim that is just what i wanted  massa lie down quiet jim said no good sit up and gathering a large bunch of grass he placed it under reubens head and reuben lay quiet in a half dreamy state until mr and mrs barker rode up  kate rose to her feet as they approached but she was so stiff and bruised with her fall that she could scarcely move forward to meet mrs barker and burst into tears as her friend threw her arms round her  thats right my poor child mrs barker said a cry will do you good thank god my dear kate for your rescue  i do indeed mrs barker it seems almost a miracle  captain whitney seems to spring out of the ground whenever hes wanted he seems hurt badly the constable said it was a broken collarbone but it must be something a good deal worse than that  oh dont say so mrs barker after what hes done for me if he were to die  there there dont tremble so child we must hope that it is not so bad as that but he would hardly be looking so bad as he does for only a broken collarbone my husband broke hisone day the horse ran away with him among some treesand he was up and about again in a day or two  is he badly hurt do you think john she asked her husband who was kneeling beside reuben  i hope not the settler said he ought not to be like this only from a wound in the collarbone but of course it may have glanced down and done some internal mischief i am inclined to think that it is extreme exhaustion as much as anythingthe reaction after a tremendous nervous excitement  he has ridden a hundred and fifty miles since yesterday morning kate said and has had two fights besides this directly he knew that the leader of the bush rangers had escaped he came on by himself  oh they caught the bush rangers did they mr barker said joyfully i was afraid by his getting back here so soon that they must have missed them somehow and found they were on the wrong scent  and he has ridden all the way back has he a very zealous officer miss ellison a very zealous young officer indeed  but kate was too anxious and shaken to mark the significance of mr barkers tone  dont tease her his wife said in a low voice she is terribly upset and shaken and can hardly stand  ah what is that  the interruption was caused by a low groan from the fallen bush ranger  shoot him dead sah jim who was supporting his masters head exclaimed dont let dat fellow come live no longer  i cant do that jim mr barker said moving towards the fallen man the man is a thorough scoundrel a murderer and a robber but he is harmless now one cannot wish he should recover even for his own sake for there is enough against him to hang him ten times over however we must do what we can for the poor wretch  so saying he mixed some brandy with a little water in the cup and poured it between the bush rangers lips  is it mortal mrs barker asked as he rejoined her  i think so he said i fancy he is shot through the lungs  you must really sit down miss ellison you look as white as a ghost and we cannot have you on our hands just now we have got them pretty full as they are  ah here comes the cart  the constable had put a quantity of straw in the bottom of the light cart and barker and jim raised reuben and laid him in it  we must take the other too mr barker said the man is alive and we cant leave him here  yes kate said he must go too he did reuben a great wrong years ago i hope he will confess it before he dies  mr barker glanced at his wife as kate used the young officers christian name but she was not thinking of captain whitney of the police but of the boy reuben who had been accused of poisoning her fathers dog and of committing a burglary from his house  you had better get up in front with the constable miss ellison the settler said when the two wounded men had been placed in the cart you certainly are not fit to ride  or look here the constable shall take my horse and i will drive and then i can look after you and you can use me for a prop if you feel weak but before we start i must insist on your taking a sip of brandy and water  it is no use your saying no he persisted as the girl shook her head we shall have you fainting before you get home if you dont  kate did as she was ordered mr barker then helped her up to her seat as she got up her eyes fell upon reubens face  oh mr barker she said he looks dead you are not deceiving me are you  bless me no the settler said cheerfully my opinion is that hes dead asleep the loss of blood the sudden reaction after the long excitement and the exhaustion of his ride have completely overcome him and my opinion is that he is sound asleep  jim do you lead your masters horse while the constable takes the other and then you two had better ride on and help mrs donald get things ready get a bed up at once for captain whitney and get some clean straw in the outhouse with one of the rugs over it for the other  so saying he touched the horse with the whip and the cart moved slowly on with mrs barker riding beside it she would have gone on ahead to have assisted in the preparations but she expected momentarily to see kate faint and thought it better to remain with her in case her assistance should be required  the journey occupied some time for mr barker picked the way carefully so as not to jolt the cart mrs barker endeavoured to keep kates attention fixed by asking her questions as to what she had heard about the expedition wondering when it would return and whether any of the settlers were hurt when they got within half a mile of home she said  i think dear you are looking a little better now i will ride on fortunately there is the beef tea we made last night for mr donald i will get it made hot and i will get a cup of strong tea ready for you that will do wonders  when the cart arrived mrs donald ran out and as kate descended clasped her in a long embrace  come straight in here my dear mrs barker said i have got a basin of cold water and a cup of strong tea and the two together will do marvels we will attend to your wounded hero  reuben remained perfectly quiet and inert as he was lifted out and carried into the house where a bed had been made up for him in a room on the ground floor  just lay him down throw a blanket over him and let him lie perfectly quiet  do you think he is really asleep mrs barker asked as she looked at the quiet face  i do really her husband replied put your ear close to his mouth he is breathing as quietly as a child  and he added placing his fingers on reubens wrist his pulse is a little fast but regular and quiet twentyfour hours of sleep will set him up again unless i am greatly mistaken i dont expect that his wound will turn out anything very serious  let me think was it not this afternoon that ruskin said he would be back again  yes either yesterday or today  that is lucky he will be surprised at finding two new patients on his hands now  i will go and have a look at that poor wretch in the shed give me a cupful of beef tea i will pour a spoonful or two between his lips you had better go and look after kate you will not be needed here at present  if your master wakes jim let us know directly he said to the black who had seated himself on the ground by the side of reubens bed  i cant call the poor fellow away from his master he added to his wife as he closed the door behind them but i am really anxious to know what has taken place out in the bush and whether many of our fellows have been killed if as kate said she heard the captain tell the bush ranger that all his band had been killed except one who is a prisoner it has indeed been a most successful expedition and we colonists can hardly be sufficiently grateful to whitney for having rid us of these pests what with that and the thrashing the blacks have had we shall be able to sleep quietly for months which is more than we have done for a long time  kate came out of the room with mrs donald a minute later the basin of cold water and the tea had had the effect mrs barker predicted a little colour had returned into her cheeks and she looked altogether more like herself  how is he mrs donald asked  in my opinion hes doing capitally mrs donald his pulse is quiet and even and hes breathing as quietly as a child and i believe he is simply in a state of exhaustion from which he is not likely to wake till tomorrow morning and i predict that in a few days he will be up and about indeed if that bullet hasnt misbehaved itself i see no reason why he shouldnt be up tomorrow  that is indeed a relief to us both mrs donald said while kate could only clasp her hands in silent thankfulness  and now how is your husband i hope he is none the worse for all this exertion  he was terribly agitated at first mrs donald said i fainted you know and he got out of bed to help me up and it was as much as i could do when i recovered to get him to lie down for he wanted to mount and ride after kate although of course he is as weak as a child and even with my help he could scarcely get into bed again  fortunately mrs barker ran in before she started on horseback to fetch you to say that the constable was off in pursuit and that quieted him then i think he was occupied in trying to cheer me for as soon as he was in bed i broke down and cried till the constable came back to say that captain whitney had overtaken and shot the bush ranger  three hours later to the great relief of all the surgeon arrived he was first taken in to look at reuben having been told all the circumstances of the case and he confirmed mr barkers opinion that he was really in a deep sleep  i would not wake him on any account he said it is a great effort of nature and he will i hope awake quite himself of course i cant say anything about the wound till he does  now for his antagonist  the bush ranger was still unconscious though occasionally broken words came from his lips the surgeon examined his wound  he is shot through the lungs he said and is bleeding internally i do not think that there is the shadow of a chance for him and no one can wish it otherwise it will only save the colony the expense of his trial  and now for my original patient  he was some time in mr donalds room and when he came out proceeded at once to mix him a soothing draught from the case of medicines he carried behind the saddle  we must get him off to sleep if we can he said or we shall have him in a high state of fever before morning a man in his state cant go through such excitement as he has done without paying the penalty  and now i suppose i have done he said with a smile as mrs donald left the room with the medicine  yes i think so mrs barker said if you had come an hour earlier i should have put this young lady under your charge but i think that the assurance of my husband that captain whitney was doing well has been a better medicine than you could give her  no wonder she is shaken mr ruskin remarked  mrs barker tells me you had a heavy fall too miss ellison  yes she replied i was stunned for a time but beyond being stiff and bruised i am none the worse for it  look here miss ellison the doctor said after putting his fingers on her wrist i suppose you will want to be about tomorrow when our brave army returns now there is nothing you can do here mrs donald can nurse her husband the other two require no nursing mrs barker i am sure will take charge of the house and therefore seriously i would ask you to take this draught i am about to mix for you and to go upstairs and go to bed and sleep till morning  i could not sleep kate protested  very well then lie quiet without sleeping and if in the evening you find you are restless you can come down for an hour or two but i really must insist on your lying down for a bit  now mrs barker will you take this medicine up and put this young lady to bed  i hope she will get off to sleep mrs barker said when she came downstairs again  i have no doubt whatever about it mr ruskin replied i have given her a very strong sleeping draught far stronger than i should think of giving at any other time but after the tension that the poor girl must have gone through it would need a strong dose to take effect i think you will hear nothing more of her till the morning  indeed it was not until the sun was well up the next morning that kate ellison woke she could hardly believe that she had slept all night but the eastern sun coming in through her window showed her that she had done so she still felt bruised and shaken all over but was otherwise herself again she dressed hastily and went downstairs  thats right my dear mrs barker who was already busy in the kitchen said you look bonny and like yourself  how are my brother and captain whitney kate asked  i dont think mr donald is awake yet mrs barker replied but captain whitney has just gone out to the shed with my husband and the surgeon  gone out to the shed kate repeated in astonishment  yes my dear that poor wretch out there is going fast he recovered consciousness about two hours ago the constable was sitting up with him he asked for water and then lay for some time quite quiet  then he said am i dreaming or was it reuben whitney i fought with  yes it was captain reuben whitney our inspector the constable replied  for a time he lay quiet again and then said i want to see him  the constable told him he was asleep and couldnt be woke  is he badly wounded the man asked i know i hit him  not very badly i hope the constable answered  when he wakes ask him to come to me the man said i know i am dying but i want to see him first if he cant come let somebody else come  the constable came in and roused the doctor who went out and saw him and said he might live three or four hours yet  soon afterwards just as the sun rose jim came out to say that his master was awake mr ruskin went in to him and examined his wound and probed the course of the bullet it had lodged down just at the bottom of the shoulder bone i am glad to say he was able to get it out when he had done he told his patient what the bush ranger had said and captain whitney insisted upon going out to him  it wont do him any harm will it kate asked anxiously  no my dear or mr ruskin would not have let him go i saw him as he went out and shook hands with him and except that nasty bandage over his face he looked quite himself again as i told you a broken collarbone is a mere nothing and now we know where the bullet went and have got it out there is no occasion for the slightest anxiety  here they come again so you can judge for yourself  a very few words passed between reuben and kate for mrs barker who saw how nervous the girl was at once began to ask him questions about what the bush ranger had said  he has made a confession mrs barker which your husband has written down and mr ruskin and smithson have signed it is about a very old story in which i was concerned when a boy but it is a great gratification for me to have it cleared up at last i was accused of poisoning a dog belonging to miss ellisons father and was tried for a burglary committed on the premises and was acquitted thanks only to miss ellisons influence exerted on my behalf  i fear he said with a slight smile somewhat illegally  however the imputation would have rested on me all my life if it had not been for thornes confession i thought that he did the first affair i knew that he was concerned in the second although i could not prove it but he has now made a full confession saying that he himself poisoned the dog and confirming the story i told at the trial  oh i am glad kate exclaimed you know captain whitney that i was sure of your innocence but i know how you must have longed for it to be proved to the world  what will you do mr barker to make it public  i shall send a copy of the confession properly attested to the magistrates of lewes and another copy to the paper which captain whitney tells me is published there weekly  it is curious he went on that the sight of whitney should have recalled those past recollections while so far as i could see everything that has happened afterwards his career of crime and the blood that he has shed seem altogether forgotten  i suppose there is no hope for him kate asked in a low voice  he is dying now mr barker said ruskin is with him he was fast becoming unconscious when we left him and ruskin said that the end was at hand  a quarter of an hour later the surgeon came in with the news that all was over  now captain whitney you must come into your room and let me bandage up your shoulder properly i hadnt half time to do it before  but you wont want me to lie in bed or any nonsense of that sort reuben asked  i would if i thought you would obey my orders but as i see no chance of that i shall not trouble to give them seriously i do not think there is any necessity for it providing always that you will keep yourself very quiet i shall bandage your arm across your chest so there can be no movement of the shoulder and when that is done i think you will be all right  there was only one more question which reuben had to ask with regard to the event of the preceding daywhy it was that smithson did not go to his comrades assistance he then learned that thorne rode quietly up to the back of the house and dismounted then went to the stable where smithson was asleephaving been on guard during the nightand pushed a piece of wood under the latch of the door so that it could not be raised having thus securely fastened smithson in he had gone to the front of the house and had apparently shot down the constable there before the latter was aware of his presence  smithson awakened by the shot tried in vain to get out and was only released by mrs barker when she recovered from the effect of the stunning blow which the bush ranger had struck her he had then mounted at once and followed in pursuit  in the afternoon the party returned from the bush having experienced no further molestation from the natives nothing occurred to interfere with the progress of reubens wound and in the course of a fortnight he was again able to resume his duties  the complete destruction of the gang of bush rangers and the energy with which they had been pursued into the very heart of the bush country made a vast sensation in the colony and reuben gained great credit and instant promotion for his conduct  a month after the return of the party from the bush mr donald was about again and as the danger was now past he abandoned his idea of selling his property the course which events took can be judged by the following conversation between mrs donald and her sister three months later  well kate after all he has done for us of course i have nothing to say against it and i dont suppose you would mind if i had still i do think you might have done better  i could not have done better kate said hotly not if i had had the pick of the whole colony  well not in one way my dear for you know that personally i like him almost as well as you do still i do think it is a little unfortunate that we ever knew him before  and i think its extremely fortunate kate said stoutly if it hadnt been that he had known us before and cared for mehe says worshipped but thats nonsenseever since i was a child he would never have made that terrible ride and i  oh dont talk about it kate its too dreadful even to think of now  well my dear no doubt its all for the best alice said philosophically at any rate you are quite happy and he is a noble fellow but i hope for your sake that he wont stay in the police it would be dreadful for you when he was riding about hunting after bush rangers and blacks for you know my dear there are plenty of others left in the colony  i told him so yesterday kate said shyly i said of course that i didnt want to influence him  alice broke into a laugh  you little goose as if what you say doesnt influence him  three weeks later reuben received a letter from mr hudson  my dear whitney i am glad to hear from you that you are engaged to be married and the circumstances which you tell me of make it a most interesting affair if i were you i should cut the constabulary i enclose a paper from wilson giving you three weeks leave come down to sydney at once and talk it over with me you know i regard you as my son and i am going to have a voice in the matter  reuben went down to sydney and after ascertaining his views mr hudson went into town and forthwith arranged for the purchase for him of a partnership in the chief engineering firm in the town when he told captain wilson what he had done the latter declared that he had robbed the colony of its best police officer reuben protested against the generosity of the old settler but the latter declared he would have no nonsense on the subject  i am one of the richest men in the colony he said and its hard if i cant spend my money as i choose  there is little more to tell reuben became one of the leading citizens of sydney and twenty years afterwards sold his business and returned to england and bought an estate not far from lewes where he is still living with his wife and family he was accompanied from australia by his mother who in spite of her strong objections to the sea went out to live with him two years after his marriage  the only point upon which reuben whitney and his wife have never been able to come to an absolute agreement is as to which owes most to the other
