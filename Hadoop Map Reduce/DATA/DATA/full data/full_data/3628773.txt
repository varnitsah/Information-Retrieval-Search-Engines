            preface  this book is a record of a pleasure trip  if it were a record of a solemn scientific expedition it would have about it that gravity that profundity and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper to works of that kind and withal so attractive  yet notwithstanding it is only a record of a picnic it has a purpose which is to suggest to the reader how he would be likely to see europe and the east if he looked at them with his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those countries before him  i make small pretense of showing anyone how he ought to look at objects of interest beyond the seaother books do that and therefore even if i were competent to do it there is no need  i offer no apologies for any departures from the usual style of travelwriting that may be charged against mefor i think i have seen with impartial eyes and i am sure i have written at least honestly whether wisely or not  in this volume i have used portions of letters which i wrote for the daily alta california of san francisco the proprietors of that journal having waived their rights and given me the necessary permission  i have also inserted portions of several letters written for the new york tribune and the new york herald  the author san francisco      chapter i  for months the great pleasure excursion to europe and the holy land was chatted about in the newspapers everywhere in america and discussed at countless firesides  it was a novelty in the way of excursionsits like had not been thought of before and it compelled that interest which attractive novelties always command  it was to be a picnic on a gigantic scale  the participants in it instead of freighting an ungainly steam ferryboat with youth and beauty and pies and doughnuts and paddling up some obscure creek to disembark upon a grassy lawn and wear themselves out with a long summer days laborious frolicking under the impression that it was fun were to sail away in a great steamship with flags flying and cannon pealing and take a royal holiday beyond the broad ocean in many a strange clime and in many a land renowned in history they were to sail for months over the breezy atlantic and the sunny mediterranean they were to scamper about the decks by day filling the ship with shouts and laughteror read novels and poetry in the shade of the smokestacks or watch for the jellyfish and the nautilus over the side and the shark the whale and other strange monsters of the deep and at night they were to dance in the open air on the upper deck in the midst of a ballroom that stretched from horizon to horizon and was domed by the bending heavens and lighted by no meaner lamps than the stars and the magnificent moondance and promenade and smoke and sing and make love and search the skies for constellations that never associate with the big dipper they were so tired of and they were to see the ships of twenty naviesthe customs and costumes of twenty curious peoplesthe great cities of half a worldthey were to hobnob with nobility and hold friendly converse with kings and princes grand moguls and the anointed lords of mighty empires it was a brave conception it was the offspring of a most ingenious brain  it was well advertised but it hardly needed it the bold originality the extraordinary character the seductive nature and the vastness of the enterprise provoked comment everywhere and advertised it in every household in the land  who could read the program of the excursion without longing to make one of the party  i will insert it here  it is almost as good as a map  as a text for this book nothing could be better                     excursion to the holy land egypt       the crimea greece and intermediate points of interest

days  captain      marryatt writes i do not know a spot on the globe which so much      astonishes and delights upon first arrival as madeira a stay of      one or two days will be made here which if time permits may be      extended and passing on through the islands and probably in sight      of the peak of teneriffe a southern track will be taken and the      atlantic crossed within the latitudes of the northeast trade winds      where mild and pleasant weather and a smooth sea can always be      expected         a call will be made at bermuda which lies directly in this route      homeward and will be reached in about ten days from madeira and      after spending a short time with our friends the bermudians the      final departure will be made for home which will be reached in      about three days         already applications have been received from parties in europe      wishing to join the excursion there         the ship will at all times be a home where the excursionists if      sick will be surrounded by kind friends and have all possible      comfort and sympathy         should contagious sickness exist in any of the ports named in the      program

selected by a pitiless committee on applicationsthe vessel to be as rigidly selected by as pitiless a committee on selecting steamer human nature could not withstand these bewildering temptations  i hurried to the treasurers office and deposited my ten percent  i rejoiced to know that a few vacant staterooms were still left  i did avoid a critical personal examination into my character by that bowelless committee but i referred to all the people of high standing i could think of in the community who would be least likely to know anything about me  shortly a supplementary program was issued which set forth that the plymouth collection of hymns would be used on board the ship  i then paid the balance of my passage money  i was provided with a receipt and duly and officially accepted as an excursionist  there was happiness in that but it was tame compared to the novelty of being select  this supplementary program also instructed the excursionists to provide themselves with light musical instruments for amusement in the ship with saddles for syrian travel green spectacles and umbrellas veils for egypt and substantial clothing to use in rough pilgrimizing in the holy land  furthermore it was suggested that although the ships library would afford a fair amount of reading matter it would still be well if each passenger would provide himself with a few guidebooks a bible and some standard works of travel  a list was appended which consisted chiefly of books relating to the holy land since the holy land was part of the excursion and seemed to be its main feature  reverend henry ward beecher was to have accompanied the expedition but urgent duties obliged him to give up the idea  there were other passengers who could have been spared better and would have been spared more willingly  lieutenant general sherman was to have been of the party also but the indian war compelled his presence on the plains  a popular actress had entered her name on the ships books but something interfered and she couldnt go  the drummer boy of the potomac deserted and lo we had never a celebrity left  however we were to have a battery of guns from the navy department as per advertisement to be used in answering royal salutes and the document furnished by the secretary of the navy which was to make general sherman and party welcome guests in the courts and camps of the old world was still left to us though both document and battery i think were shorn of somewhat of their original august proportions however had not we the seductive program still with its paris its constantinople smyrna jerusalem jericho and our friends the bermudians what did we care     chapter ii  occasionally during the following month i dropped in at 117 wall street to inquire how the repairing and refurnishing of the vessel was coming on how additions to the passenger list were averaging how many people the committee were decreeing not select every day and banishing in sorrow and tribulation  i was glad to know that we were to have a little printing press on board and issue a daily newspaper of our own  i was glad to learn that our piano our parlor organ and our melodeon were to be the best instruments of the kind that could be had in the market  i was proud to observe that among our excursionists were three ministers of the gospel eight doctors sixteen or eighteen ladies several military and naval chieftains with sounding titles an ample crop of professors of various kinds and a gentleman who had commissioner of the united states of america to europe asia and africa thundering after his name in one awful blast  i had carefully prepared myself to take rather a back seat in that ship because of the uncommonly select material that would alone be permitted to pass through the camels eye of that committee on credentials i had schooled myself to expect an imposing array of military and naval heroes and to have to set that back seat still further back in consequence of it maybe but i state frankly that i was all unprepared for this crusher  i fell under that titular avalanche a torn and blighted thing  i said that if that potentate must go over in our ship why i supposed he must but that to my thinking when the united states considered it necessary to send a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean it would be in better taste and safer to take him apart and cart him over in sections in several ships  ah if i had only known then that he was only a common mortal and that his mission had nothing more overpowering about it than the collecting of seeds and uncommon yams and extraordinary cabbages and peculiar bullfrogs for that poor useless innocent mildewed old fossil the smithsonian institute i would have felt so much relieved  during that memorable month i basked in the happiness of being for once in my life drifting with the tide of a great popular movement  everybody was going to europei too was going to europe  everybody was going to the famous paris expositioni too was going to the paris exposition the steamship lines were carrying americans out of the various ports of the country at the rate of four or five thousand a week in the aggregate if i met a dozen individuals during that month who were not going to europe shortly i have no distinct remembrance of it now  i walked about the city a good deal with a young mr  blucher who was booked for the excursion  he was confiding goodnatured unsophisticated companionable but he was not a man to set the river on fire  he had the most extraordinary notions about this european exodus and came at last to consider the whole nation as packing up for emigration to france  we stepped into a store on broadway one day where he bought a handkerchief and when the man could not make change mr b said  never mind ill hand it to you in paris  but i am not going to paris  how iswhat did i understand you to say  i said i am not going to paris  not going to paris  not g well then where in the nation are you going to  nowhere at all  not anywhere whatsoevernot any place on earth but this  not any place at all but just thisstay here all summer  my comrade took his purchase and walked out of the store without a word walked out with an injured look upon his countenance  up the street apiece he broke silence and said impressively it was a liethat is my opinion of it  in the fullness of time the ship was ready to receive her passengers i was introduced to the young gentleman who was to be my roommate and found him to be intelligent cheerful of spirit unselfish full of generous impulses patient considerate and wonderfully goodnatured not any passenger that sailed in the quaker city will withhold his endorsement of what i have just said  we selected a stateroom forward of the wheel on the starboard side below decks  it bad two berths in it a dismal deadlight a sink with a washbowl in it and a long sumptuously cushioned locker which was to do service as a sofapartly and partly as a hiding place for our things  notwithstanding all this furniture there was still room to turn around in but not to swing a cat in at least with entire security to the cat  however the room was large for a ships stateroom and was in every way satisfactory  the vessel was appointed to sail on a certain saturday early in june  a little after noon on that distinguished saturday i reached the ship and went on board  all was bustle and confusion  i have seen that remark before somewhere  the pier was crowded with carriages and men passengers were arriving and hurrying on board the vessels decks were encumbered with trunks and valises groups of excursionists arrayed in unattractive traveling costumes were moping about in a drizzling rain and looking as droopy and woebegone as so many molting chickens  the gallant flag was up but it was under the spell too and hung limp and disheartened by the mast  altogether it was the bluest bluest spectacle  it was a pleasure excursionthere was no gainsaying that because the program said soit was so nominated in the bondbut it surely hadnt the general aspect of one  finally above the banging and rumbling and shouting and hissing of steam rang the order to cast offa sudden rush to the gangwaysa scampering ashore of visitorsa revolution of the wheels and we were offthe picnic was begun  two very mild cheers went up from the dripping crowd on the pier we answered them gently from the slippery decks the flag made an effort to wave and failed the battery of guns spake notthe ammunition was out  we steamed down to the foot of the harbor and came to anchor  it was still raining  and not only raining but storming  outside we could see ourselves that there was a tremendous sea on  we must lie still in the calm harbor till the storm should abate  our passengers hailed from fifteen states only a few of them had ever been to sea before manifestly it would not do to pit them against a fullblown tempest until they had got their sealegs on  toward evening the two steam tugs that had accompanied us with a rollicking champagneparty of young new yorkers on board who wished to bid farewell to one of our number in due and ancient form departed and we were alone on the deep  on deep five fathoms and anchored fast to the bottom  and out in the solemn rain at that  this was pleasuring with a vengeance  it was an appropriate relief when the gong sounded for prayer meeting the first saturday night of any other pleasure excursion might have been devoted to whist and dancing but i submit it to the unprejudiced mind if it would have been in good taste for us to engage in such frivolities considering what we had gone through and the frame of mind we were in we would have shone at a wake but not at anything more festive  however there is always a cheering influence about the sea and in my berth that night rocked by the measured swell of the waves and lulled by the murmur of the distant surf i soon passed tranquilly out of all consciousness of the dreary experiences of the day and damaging premonitions of the future     chapter iii  all day sunday at anchor  the storm had gone down a great deal but the sea had not  it was still piling its frothy hills high in air outside as we could plainly see with the glasses  we could not properly begin a pleasure excursion on sunday we could not offer untried stomachs to so pitiless a sea as that  we must lie still till monday  and we did  but we had repetitions of church and prayermeetings and so of course we were just as eligibly situated as we could have been any where  i was up early that sabbath morning and was early to breakfast  i felt a perfectly natural desire to have a good long unprejudiced look at the passengers at a time when they should be free from selfconsciousness which is at breakfast when such a moment occurs in the lives of human beings at all  i was greatly surprised to see so many elderly peoplei might almost say so many venerable people  a glance at the long lines of heads was apt to make one think it was all gray  but it was not  there was a tolerably fair sprinkling of young folks and another fair sprinkling of gentlemen and ladies who were noncommittal as to age being neither actually old or absolutely young  the next morning we weighed anchor and went to sea  it was a great happiness to get away after this dragging dispiriting delay  i thought there never was such gladness in the air before such brightness in the sun such beauty in the sea  i was satisfied with the picnic then and with all its belongings  all my malicious instincts were dead within me and as america faded out of sight i think a spirit of charity rose up in their place that was as boundless for the time being as the broad ocean that was heaving its billows about us  i wished to express my feelings i wished to lift up my voice and sing but i did not know anything to sing and so i was obliged to give up the idea  it was no loss to the ship though perhaps  it was breezy and pleasant but the sea was still very rough  one could not promenade without risking his neck at one moment the bowsprit was taking a deadly aim at the sun in midheaven and at the next it was trying to harpoon a shark in the bottom of the ocean  what a weird sensation it is to feel the stem of a ship sinking swiftly from under you and see the bow climbing high away among the clouds  ones safest course that day was to clasp a railing and hang on walking was too precarious a pastime  by some happy fortune i was not seasickthat was a thing to be proud of  i had not always escaped before  if there is one thing in the world that will make a man peculiarly and insufferably selfconceited it is to have his stomach behave itself the first day it sea when nearly all his comrades are seasick  soon a venerable fossil shawled to the chin and bandaged like a mummy appeared at the door of the after deckhouse and the next lurch of the ship shot him into my arms  i said  goodmorning sir  it is a fine day  he put his hand on his stomach and said oh my and then staggered away and fell over the coop of a skylight  presently another old gentleman was projected from the same door with great violence  i said  calm yourself sirthere is no hurry  it is a fine day sir  he also put his hand on his stomach and said oh my and reeled away  in a little while another veteran was discharged abruptly from the same door clawing at the air for a saving support  i said  good morning sir  it is a fine day for pleasuring  you were about to say  oh my  i thought so  i anticipated him anyhow  i stayed there and was bombarded with old gentlemen for an hour perhaps and all i got out of any of them was oh my  i went away then in a thoughtful mood  i said this is a good pleasure excursion  i like it  the passengers are not garrulous but still they are sociable  i like those old people but somehow they all seem to have the oh my rather bad  i knew what was the matter with them  they were seasick  and i was glad of it  we all like to see people seasick when we are not ourselves playing whist by the cabin lamps when it is storming outside is pleasant walking the quarterdeck in the moonlight is pleasant smoking in the breezy foretop is pleasant when one is not afraid to go up there but these are all feeble and commonplace compared with the joy of seeing people suffering the miseries of seasickness  i picked up a good deal of information during the afternoon  at one time i was climbing up the quarterdeck when the vessels stem was in the sky i was smoking a cigar and feeling passably comfortable  somebody ejaculated  come now that wont answer  read the sign up thereno smoking abaft the wheel  it was captain duncan chief of the expedition  i went forward of course  i saw a long spyglass lying on a desk in one of the upperdeck staterooms back of the pilothouse and reached after itthere was a ship in the distance  ah ahhands off  come out of that  i came out of that  i said to a decksweepbut in a low voice  who is that overgrown pirate with the whiskers and the discordant voice  its captain bursleyexecutive officersailing master  i loitered about awhile and then for want of something better to do fell to carving a railing with my knife  somebody said in an insinuating admonitory voice  now saymy frienddont you know any better than to be whittling the ship all to pieces that way  you ought to know better than that  i went back and found the deck sweep  who is that smoothfaced animated outrage yonder in the fine clothes  thats captain l the owner of the shiphes one of the main bosses  in the course of time i brought up on the starboard side of the pilothouse and found a sextant lying on a bench  now i said they take the sun through this thing i should think i might see that vessel through it  i had hardly got it to my eye when someone touched me on the shoulder and said deprecatingly  ill have to get you to give that to me sir  if theres anything youd like to know about taking the sun id as soon tell you as notbut i dont like to trust anybody with that instrument  if you want any figuring doneaye aye sir  he was gone to answer a call from the other side  i sought the decksweep  who is that spiderlegged gorilla yonder with the sanctimonious countenance  its captain jones sirthe chief mate  well  this goes clear away ahead of anything i ever heard of before do younow i ask you as a man and a brotherdo you think i could venture to throw a rock here in any given direction without hitting a captain of this ship  well sir i dont knowi think likely youd fetch the captain of the watch may be because hes astanding right yonder in the way  i went belowmeditating and a little downhearted  i thought if five cooks can spoil a broth what may not five captains do with a pleasure excursion     chapter iv  we plowed along bravely for a week or more and without any conflict of jurisdiction among the captains worth mentioning  the passengers soon learned to accommodate themselves to their new circumstances and life in the ship became nearly as systematically monotonous as the routine of a barrack  i do not mean that it was dull for it was not entirely so by any meansbut there was a good deal of sameness about it  as is always the fashion at sea the passengers shortly began to pick up sailor terms a sign that they were beginning to feel at home  halfpast six was no longer halfpast six to these pilgrims from new england the south and the mississippi valley it was seven bells eight twelve and four oclock were eight bells the captain did not take the longitude at nine oclock but at two bells  they spoke glibly of the after cabin the forrard cabin port and starboard and the focastle  at seven bells the first gong rang at eight there was breakfast for such as were not too seasick to eat it  after that all the well people walked arminarm up and down the long promenade deck enjoying the fine summer mornings and the seasick ones crawled out and propped themselves up in the lee of the paddleboxes and ate their dismal tea and toast and looked wretched  from eleven oclock until luncheon and from luncheon until dinner at six in the evening the employments and amusements were various  some reading was done and much smoking and sewing though not by the same parties there were the monsters of the deep to be looked after and wondered at strange ships had to be scrutinized through operaglasses and sage decisions arrived at concerning them and more than that everybody took a personal interest in seeing that the flag was run up and politely dipped three times in response to the salutes of those strangers in the smoking room there were always parties of gentlemen playing euchre draughts and dominoes especially dominoes that delightfully harmless game and down on the main deck forrard forrard of the chickencoops and the cattlewe had what was called horse billiards  horse billiards is a fine game  it affords good active exercise hilarity and consuming excitement  it is a mixture of hopscotch and shuffleboard played with a crutch  a large hopscotch diagram is marked out on the deck with chalk and each compartment numbered  you stand off three or four steps with some broad wooden disks before you on the deck and these you send forward with a vigorous thrust of a long crutch  if a disk stops on a chalk line it does not count anything  if it stops in division no 7 it counts 7 in 5 it counts 5 and so on  the game is 100 and four can play at a time  that game would be very simple played on a stationary floor but with us to play it well required science  we had to allow for the reeling of the ship to the right or the left  very often one made calculations for a heel to the right and the ship did not go that way  the consequence was that that disk missed the whole hopscotch plan a yard or two and then there was humiliation on one side and laughter on the other  when it rained the passengers had to stay in the house of courseor at least the cabinsand amuse themselves with games reading looking out of the windows at the very familiar billows and talking gossip  by 7 oclock in the evening dinner was about over an hours promenade on the upper deck followed then the gong sounded and a large majority of the party repaired to the after cabin upper a handsome saloon fifty or sixty feet long for prayers  the unregenerated called this saloon the synagogue  the devotions consisted only of two hymns from the plymouth collection and a short prayer and seldom occupied more than fifteen minutes  the hymns were accompanied by parlororgan music when the sea was smooth enough to allow a performer to sit at the instrument without being lashed to his chair  after prayers the synagogue shortly took the semblance of a writing school  the like of that picture was never seen in a ship before behind the long dining tables on either side of the saloon and scattered from one end to the other of the latter some twenty or thirty gentlemen and ladies sat them down under the swaying lamps and for two or three hours wrote diligently in their journals  alas that journals so voluminously begun should come to so lame and impotent a conclusion as most of them did  i doubt if there is a single pilgrim of all that host but can show a hundred fair pages of journal concerning the first twenty days voyaging in the quaker city and i am morally certain that not ten of the party can show twenty pages of journal for the succeeding twenty thousand miles of voyaging  at certain periods it becomes the dearest ambition of a man to keep a faithful record of his performances in a book and he dashes at this work with an enthusiasm that imposes on him the notion that keeping a journal is the veriest pastime in the world and the pleasantest  but if he only lives twentyone days he will find out that only those rare natures that are made up of pluck endurance devotion to duty for dutys sake and invincible determination may hope to venture upon so tremendous an enterprise as the keeping of a journal and not sustain a shameful defeat  one of our favorite youths jack a splendid young fellow with a head full of good sense and a pair of legs that were a wonder to look upon in the way of length and straightness and slimness used to report progress every morning in the most glowing and spirited way and say  oh im coming along bully he was a little given to slang in his happier moods  i wrote ten pages in my journal last nightand you know i wrote nine the night before and twelve the night before that why its only fun  what do you find to put in it jack  oh everything  latitude and longitude noon every day and how many miles we made last twentyfour hours and all the domino games i beat and horse billiards and whales and sharks and porpoises and the text of the sermon sundays because thatll tell at home you know and the ships we saluted and what nation they were and which way the wind was and whether there was a heavy sea and what sail we carried though we dont ever carry any principally going against a head wind alwayswonder what is the reason of thatand how many lies moult has toldoh every thing  ive got everything down  my father told me to keep that journal  father wouldnt take a thousand dollars for it when i get it done  no jack it will be worth more than a thousand dollarswhen you get it done  do youno but do you think it will though  yes it will be worth at least as much as a thousand dollarswhen you get it done  may be more  well i about half think so myself  it aint no slouch of a journal  but it shortly became a most lamentable slouch of a journal  one night in paris after a hard days toil in sightseeing i said  now ill go and stroll around the cafes awhile jack and give you a chance to write up your journal old fellow  his countenance lost its fire  he said  well no you neednt mind  i think i wont run that journal anymore it is awful tedious  do you knowi reckon im as much as four thousand pages behind hand  i havent got any france in it at all  first i thought id leave france out and start fresh  but that wouldnt do would it  the governor would say hello heredidnt see anything in france  that cat wouldnt fight you know  first i thought id copy france out of the guidebook like old badger in the forrard cabin whos writing a book but theres more than three hundred pages of it oh i dont think a journals any usedo you  theyre only a bother aint they  yes a journal that is incomplete isnt of much use but a journal properly kept is worth a thousand dollarswhen youve got it done  a thousandwell i should think so  i wouldnt finish it for a million  his experience was only the experience of the majority of that industrious night school in the cabin  if you wish to inflict a heartless and malignant punishment upon a young person pledge him to keep a journal a year  a good many expedients were resorted to to keep the excursionists amused and satisfied  a club was formed of all the passengers which met in the writing school after prayers and read aloud about the countries we were approaching and discussed the information so obtained  several times the photographer of the expedition brought out his transparent pictures and gave us a handsome magiclantern exhibition his views were nearly all of foreign scenes but there were one or two home pictures among them  he advertised that he would open his performance in the after cabin at two bells nine pm and show the passengers where they shall eventually arrivewhich was all very well but by a funny accident the first picture that flamed out upon the canvas was a view of greenwood cemetery  on several starlight nights we danced on the upper deck under the awnings and made something of a ballroom display of brilliancy by hanging a number of ships lanterns to the stanchions  our music consisted of the wellmixed strains of a melodeon which was a little asthmatic and apt to catch its breath where it ought to come out strong a clarinet which was a little unreliable on the high keys and rather melancholy on the low ones and a disreputable accordion that had a leak somewhere and breathed louder than it squawkeda more elegant term does not occur to me just now  however the dancing was infinitely worse than the music  when the ship rolled to starboard the whole platoon of dancers came charging down to starboard with it and brought up in mass at the rail and when it rolled to port they went floundering down to port with the same unanimity of sentiment  waltzers spun around precariously for a matter of fifteen seconds and then went scurrying down to the rail as if they meant to go overboard  the virginia reel as performed on board the quaker city had more genuine reel about it than any reel i ever saw before and was as full of interest to the spectator as it was full of desperate chances and hairbreadth escapes to the participant  we gave up dancing finally  we celebrated a ladys birthday anniversary with toasts speeches a poem and so forth  we also had a mock trial  no ship ever went to sea that hadnt a mock trial on board  the purser was accused of stealing an overcoat from stateroom no 10  a judge was appointed also clerks a crier of the court constables sheriffs counsel for the state and for the defendant witnesses were subpoenaed and a jury empaneled after much challenging  the witnesses were stupid and unreliable and contradictory as witnesses always are  the counsel were eloquent argumentative and vindictively abusive of each other as was characteristic and proper the case was at last submitted and duly finished by the judge with an absurd decision and a ridiculous sentence  the acting of charades was tried on several evenings by the young gentlemen and ladies in the cabins and proved the most distinguished success of all the amusement experiments  an attempt was made to organize a debating club but it was a failure there was no oratorical talent in the ship  we all enjoyed ourselvesi think i can safely say that but it was in a rather quiet way  we very very seldom played the piano we played the flute and the clarinet together and made good music too what there was of it but we always played the same old tune it was a very pretty tune how well i remember iti wonder when i shall ever get rid of it  we never played either the melodeon or the organ except at devotionsbut i am too fast young albert did know part of a tune something about o somethingorother how sweet it is to know that hes his whatshisname i do not remember the exact title of it but it was very plaintive and full of sentiment albert played that pretty much all the time until we contracted with him to restrain himself  but nobody ever sang by moonlight on the upper deck and the congregational singing at church and prayers was not of a superior order of architecture  i put up with it as long as i could and then joined in and tried to improve it but this encouraged young george to join in too and that made a failure of it because georges voice was just turning and when he was singing a dismal sort of bass it was apt to fly off the handle and startle everybody with a most discordant cackle on the upper notes  george didnt know the tunes either which was also a drawback to his performances  i said  come now george dont improvise  it looks too egotistical  it will provoke remark  just stick to coronation like the others  it is a good tuneyou cant improve it any just offhand in this way  why im not trying to improve itand i am singing like the others just as it is in the notes  and he honestly thought he was too and so he had no one to blame but himself when his voice caught on the center occasionally and gave him the lockjaw  there were those among the unregenerated who attributed the unceasing headwinds to our distressing choirmusic  there were those who said openly that it was taking chances enough to have such ghastly music going on even when it was at its best and that to exaggerate the crime by letting george help was simply flying in the face of providence  these said that the choir would keep up their lacerating attempts at melody until they would bring down a storm some day that would sink the ship  there were even grumblers at the prayers  the executive officer said the pilgrims had no charity  there they are down there every night at eight bells praying for fair windswhen they know as well as i do that this is the only ship going east this time of the year but theres a thousand coming westwhats a fair wind for us is a head wind to themthe almightys blowing a fair wind for a thousand vessels and this tribe wants him to turn it clear around so as to accommodate oneand she a steamship at that  it aint good sense it aint good reason it aint good christianity it aint common human charity  avast with such nonsense     chapter v  taking it by and large as the sailors say we had a pleasant ten days run from new york to the azores islandsnot a fast run for the distance is only twentyfour hundred miles but a right pleasant one in the main true we had head winds all the time and several stormy experiences which sent fifty percent of the passengers to bed sick and made the ship look dismal and desertedstormy experiences that all will remember who weathered them on the tumbling deck and caught the vast sheets of spray that every now and then sprang high in air from the weather bow and swept the ship like a thundershower but for the most part we had balmy summer weather and nights that were even finer than the days  we had the phenomenon of a full moon located just in the same spot in the heavens at the same hour every night  the reason of this singular conduct on the part of the moon did not occur to us at first but it did afterward when we reflected that we were gaining about twenty minutes every day because we were going east so fastwe gained just about enough every day to keep along with the moon  it was becoming an old moon to the friends we had left behind us but to us joshuas it stood still in the same place and remained always the same  young mr blucher who is from the far west and is on his first voyage was a good deal worried by the constantly changing ship time  he was proud of his new watch at first and used to drag it out promptly when eight bells struck at noon but he came to look after a while as if he were losing confidence in it  seven days out from new york he came on deck and said with great decision  this things a swindle  whats a swindle  why this watch  i bought her out in illinoisgave 150 for herand i thought she was good  and by george she is good onshore but somehow she dont keep up her lick here on the watergets seasick may be  she skips she runs along regular enough till halfpast eleven and then all of a sudden she lets down  ive set that old regulator up faster and faster till ive shoved it clear around but it dont do any good she just distances every watch in the ship and clatters along in a way thats astonishing till it is noon but them eight bells always gets in about ten minutes ahead of her anyway  i dont know what to do with her now  shes doing all she canshes going her best gait but it wont save her  now dont you know there aint a watch in the ship thats making better time than she is but what does it signify  when you hear them eight bells youll find her just about ten minutes short of her score sure  the ship was gaining a full hour every three days and this fellow was trying to make his watch go fast enough to keep up to her  but as he had said he had pushed the regulator up as far as it would go and the watch was on its best gait and so nothing was left him but to fold his hands and see the ship beat the race  we sent him to the captain and he explained to him the mystery of ship time and set his troubled mind at rest  this young man asked a great many questions about seasickness before we left and wanted to know what its characteristics were and how he was to tell when he had it  he found out  we saw the usual sharks blackfish porpoises c of course and by and by large schools of portuguese menofwar were added to the regular list of sea wonders  some of them were white and some of a brilliant carmine color  the nautilus is nothing but a transparent web of jelly that spreads itself to catch the wind and has fleshylooking strings a foot or two long dangling from it to keep it steady in the water  it is an accomplished sailor and has good sailor judgment  it reefs its sail when a storm threatens or the wind blows pretty hard and furls it entirely and goes down when a gale blows  ordinarily it keeps its sail wet and in good sailing order by turning over and dipping it in the water for a moment  seamen say the nautilus is only found in these waters between the 35th and 45th parallels of latitude  at three oclock on the morning of the twentyfirst of june we were awakened and notified that the azores islands were in sight  i said i did not take any interest in islands at three oclock in the morning but another persecutor came and then another and another and finally believing that the general enthusiasm would permit no one to slumber in peace i got up and went sleepily on deck  it was five and a half oclock now and a raw blustering morning  the passengers were huddled about the smokestacks and fortified behind ventilators and all were wrapped in wintry costumes and looking sleepy and unhappy in the pitiless gale and the drenching spray  the island in sight was flores  it seemed only a mountain of mud standing up out of the dull mists of the sea  but as we bore down upon it the sun came out and made it a beautiful picturea mass of green farms and meadows that swelled up to a height of fifteen hundred feet and mingled its upper outlines with the clouds  it was ribbed with sharp steep ridges and cloven with narrow canyons and here and there on the heights rocky upheavals shaped themselves into mimic battlements and castles and out of rifted clouds came broad shafts of sunlight that painted summit and slope and glen with bands of fire and left belts of somber shade between  it was the aurora borealis of the frozen pole exiled to a summer land  we skirted around twothirds of the island four miles from shore and all the opera glasses in the ship were called into requisition to settle disputes as to whether mossy spots on the uplands were groves of trees or groves of weeds or whether the white villages down by the sea were really villages or only the clustering tombstones of cemeteries  finally we stood to sea and bore away for san miguel and flores shortly became a dome of mud again and sank down among the mists and disappeared  but to many a seasick passenger it was good to see the green hills again and all were more cheerful after this episode than anybody could have expected them to be considering how sinfully early they had gotten up  but we had to change our purpose about san miguel for a storm came up about noon that so tossed and pitched the vessel that common sense dictated a run for shelter  therefore we steered for the nearest island of the groupfayal the people there pronounce it fyall and put the accent on the first syllable  we anchored in the open roadstead of horta half a mile from the shore  the town has eight thousand to ten thousand inhabitants  its snowwhite houses nestle cosily in a sea of fresh green vegetation and no village could look prettier or more attractive  it sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills which are three hundred to seven hundred feet high and carefully cultivated clear to their summitsnot a foot of soil left idle  every farm and every acre is cut up into little square inclosures by stone walls whose duty it is to protect the growing products from the destructive gales that blow there  these hundreds of green squares marked by their black lava walls make the hills look like vast checkerboards  the islands belong to portugal and everything in fayal has portuguese characteristics about it  but more of that anon  a swarm of swarthy noisy lying shouldershrugging gesticulating portuguese boatmen with brass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts climbed the ships sides and various parties of us contracted with them to take us ashore at so much a head silver coin of any country  we landed under the walls of a little fort armed with batteries of twelveandthirtytwopounders which horta considered a most formidable institution but if we were ever to get after it with one of our turreted monitors they would have to move it out in the country if they wanted it where they could go and find it again when they needed it  the group on the pier was a rusty onemen and women and boys and girls all ragged and barefoot uncombed and unclean and by instinct education and profession beggars  they trooped after us and never more while we tarried in fayal did we get rid of them  we walked up the middle of the principal street and these vermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street  it was very flattering to me to be part of the material for such a sensation  here and there in the doorways we saw women with fashionable portuguese hoods on  this hood is of thick blue cloth attached to a cloak of the same stuff and is a marvel of ugliness  it stands up high and spreads far abroad and is unfathomably deep  it fits like a circus tent and a womans head is hidden away in it like the mans who prompts the singers from his tin shed in the stage of an opera  there is no particle of trimming about this monstrous capote as they call itit is just a plain ugly deadblue mass of sail and a woman cant go within eight points of the wind with one of them on she has to go before the wind or not at all the general style of the capote is the same in all the islands and will remain so for the next ten thousand years but each island shapes its capotes just enough differently from the others to enable an observer to tell at a glance what particular island a lady hails from  the portuguese pennies or reis pronounced rays are prodigious  it takes one thousand reis to make a dollar and all financial estimates are made in reis  we did not know this until after we had found it out through blucher  blucher said he was so happy and so grateful to be on solid land once more that he wanted to give a feastsaid he had heard it was a cheap land and he was bound to have a grand banquet  he invited nine of us and we ate an excellent dinner at the principal hotel  in the midst of the jollity produced by good cigars good wine and passable anecdotes the landlord presented his bill  blucher glanced at it and his countenance fell  he took another look to assure himself that his senses had not deceived him and then read the items aloud in a faltering voice while the roses in his cheeks turned to ashes  ten dinners at 600 reis 6000 reis  ruin and desolation  twentyfive cigars at 100 reis 2500 reis  oh my sainted mother  eleven bottles of wine at 1200 reis 13200 reis  be with us all  total twentyone thousand seven hundred reis  the suffering moses there aint money enough in the ship to pay that bill  goleave me to my misery boys i am a ruined community  i think it was the blankestlooking party i ever saw  nobody could say a word  it was as if every soul had been stricken dumb  wine glasses descended slowly to the table their contents untasted  cigars dropped unnoticed from nerveless fingers  each man sought his neighbors eye but found in it no ray of hope no encouragement  at last the fearful silence was broken  the shadow of a desperate resolve settled upon bluchers countenance like a cloud and he rose up and said  landlord this is a low mean swindle and ill never never stand it heres a hundred and fifty dollars sir and its all youll getill swim in blood before ill pay a cent more  our spirits rose and the landlords fellat least we thought so he was confused at any rate notwithstanding he had not understood a word that had been said  he glanced from the little pile of gold pieces to blucher several times and then went out  he must have visited an american for when he returned he brought back his bill translated into a language that a christian could understandthus  10 dinners 6000 reis or     600  25 cigars 2500 reis or       250  11 bottles wine 13200 reis or  1320  total 21700 reis or        2170  happiness reigned once more in bluchers dinner party  more refreshments were ordered     chapter vi  i think the azores must be very little known in america  out of our whole ships company there was not a solitary individual who knew anything whatever about them  some of the party well read concerning most other lands had no other information about the azores than that they were a group of nine or ten small islands far out in the atlantic something more than halfway between new york and gibraltar  that was all  these considerations move me to put in a paragraph of dry facts just here  the community is eminently portuguesethat is to say it is slow poor shiftless sleepy and lazy  there is a civil governor appointed by the king of portugal and also a military governor who can assume supreme control and suspend the civil government at his pleasure  the islands contain a population of about 200000 almost entirely portuguese everything is staid and settled for the country was one hundred years old when columbus discovered america  the principal crop is corn and they raise it and grind it just as their greatgreatgreatgrandfathers did  they plow with a board slightly shod with iron their trifling little harrows are drawn by men and women small windmills grind the corn ten bushels a day and there is one assistant superintendent to feed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from going to sleep  when the wind changes they hitch on some donkeys and actually turn the whole upper half of the mill around until the sails are in proper position instead of fixing the concern so that the sails could be moved instead of the mill  oxen tread the wheat from the ear after the fashion prevalent in the time of methuselah  there is not a wheelbarrow in the landthey carry everything on their heads or on donkeys or in a wickerbodied cart whose wheels are solid blocks of wood and whose axles turn with the wheel  there is not a modern plow in the islands or a threshing machine  all attempts to introduce them have failed  the good catholic portuguese crossed himself and prayed god to shield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his father did before him  the climate is mild they never have snow or ice and i saw no chimneys in the town  the donkeys and the men women and children of a family all eat and sleep in the same room and are unclean are ravaged by vermin and are truly happy  the people lie and cheat the stranger and are desperately ignorant and have hardly any reverence for their dead  the latter trait shows how little better they are than the donkeys they eat and sleep with  the only welldressed portuguese in the camp are the half a dozen welltodo families the jesuit priests and the soldiers of the little garrison  the wages of a laborer are twenty to twentyfour cents a day and those of a good mechanic about twice as much  they count it in reis at a thousand to the dollar and this makes them rich and contented  fine grapes used to grow in the islands and an excellent wine was made and exported  but a disease killed all the vines fifteen years ago and since that time no wine has been made  the islands being wholly of volcanic origin the soil is necessarily very rich  nearly every foot of ground is under cultivation and two or three crops a year of each article are produced but nothing is exported save a few orangeschiefly to england  nobody comes here and nobody goes away  news is a thing unknown in fayal  a thirst for it is a passion equally unknown  a portuguese of average intelligence inquired if our civil war was over  because he said somebody had told him it wasor at least it ran in his mind that somebody had told him something like that  and when a passenger gave an officer of the garrison copies of the tribune the herald and times he was surprised to find later news in them from lisbon than he had just received by the little monthly steamer he was told that it came by cable  he said he knew they had tried to lay a cable ten years ago but it had been in his mind somehow that they hadnt succeeded  it is in communities like this that jesuit humbuggery flourishes  we visited a jesuit cathedral nearly two hundred years old and found in it a piece of the veritable cross upon which our saviour was crucified  it was polished and hard and in as excellent a state of preservation as if the dread tragedy on calvary had occurred yesterday instead of eighteen centuries ago  but these confiding people believe in that piece of wood unhesitatingly  in a chapel of the cathedral is an altar with facings of solid silverat least they call it so and i think myself it would go a couple of hundred to the ton to speak after the fashion of the silver minersand before it is kept forever burning a small lamp  a devout lady who died left money and contracted for unlimited masses for the repose of her soul and also stipulated that this lamp should be kept lighted always day and night  she did all this before she died you understand  it is a very small lamp and a very dim one and it could not work her much damage i think if it went out altogether  the great altar of the cathedral and also three or four minor ones are a perfect mass of gilt gimcracks and gingerbread  and they have a swarm of rusty dusty battered apostles standing around the filagree work some on one leg and some with one eye out but a gamey look in the other and some with two or three fingers gone and some with not enough nose left to blowall of them crippled and discouraged and fitter subjects for the hospital than the cathedral  the walls of the chancel are of porcelain all pictured over with figures of almost life size very elegantly wrought and dressed in the fanciful costumes of two centuries ago  the design was a history of something or somebody but none of us were learned enough to read the story  the old father reposing under a stone close by dated 1686 might have told us if he could have risen  but he didnt  as we came down through the town we encountered a squad of little donkeys ready saddled for use  the saddles were peculiar to say the least they consisted of a sort of sawbuck with a small mattress on it and this furniture covered about half the donkey  there were no stirrups but really such supports were not neededto use such a saddle was the next thing to riding a dinner tablethere was ample support clear out to ones knee joints  a pack of ragged portuguese muleteers crowded around us offering their beasts at half a dollar an hourmore rascality to the stranger for the market price is sixteen cents  half a dozen of us mounted the ungainly affairs and submitted to the indignity of making a ridiculous spectacle of ourselves through the principal streets of a town of 10000 inhabitants  we started  it was not a trot a gallop or a canter but a stampede and made up of all possible or conceivable gaits  no spurs were necessary  there was a muleteer to every donkey and a dozen volunteers beside and they banged the donkeys with their goad sticks and pricked them with their spikes and shouted something that sounded like sekkiyah and kept up a din and a racket that was worse than bedlam itself these rascals were all on foot but no matter they were always up to timethey can outrun and outlast a donkey  altogether ours was a lively and a picturesque procession and drew crowded audiences to the balconies wherever we went  blucher could do nothing at all with his donkey  the beast scampered zigzag across the road and the others ran into him he scraped blucher against carts and the corners of houses the road was fenced in with high stone walls and the donkey gave him a polishing first on one side and then on the other but never once took the middle he finally came to the house he was born in and darted into the parlor scraping blucher off at the doorway  after remounting blucher said to the muleteer now thats enough you know you go slow hereafter  but the fellow knew no english and did not understand so he simply said sekkiyah and the donkey was off again like a shot  he turned a corner suddenly and blucher went over his head  and to speak truly every mule stumbled over the two and the whole cavalcade was piled up in a heap  no harm done  a fall from one of those donkeys is of little more consequence than rolling off a sofa  the donkeys all stood still after the catastrophe and waited for their dismembered saddles to be patched up and put on by the noisy muleteers  blucher was pretty angry and wanted to swear but every time he opened his mouth his animal did so also and let off a series of brays that drowned all other sounds  it was fun scurrying around the breezy hills and through the beautiful canyons  there was that rare thing novelty about it it was a fresh new exhilarating sensation this donkey riding and worth a hundred worn and threadbare home pleasures  the roads were a wonder and well they might be  here was an island with only a handful of people in it25000and yet such fine roads do not exist in the united states outside of central park  everywhere you go in any direction you find either a hard smooth level thoroughfare just sprinkled with black lava sand and bordered with little gutters neatly paved with small smooth pebbles or compactly paved ones like broadway  they talk much of the russ pavement in new york and call it a new inventionyet here they have been using it in this remote little isle of the sea for two hundred years  every street in horta is handsomely paved with the heavy russ blocks and the surface is neat and true as a floornot marred by holes like broadway  and every road is fenced in by tall solid lava walls which will last a thousand years in this land where frost is unknown  they are very thick and are often plastered and whitewashed and capped with projecting slabs of cut stone trees from gardens above hang their swaying tendrils down and contrast their bright green with the whitewash or the black lava of the walls and make them beautiful  the trees and vines stretch across these narrow roadways sometimes and so shut out the sun that you seem to be riding through a tunnel  the pavements the roads and the bridges are all government work  the bridges are of a single spana single archof cut stone without a support and paved on top with flags of lava and ornamental pebblework everywhere are walls walls walls and all of them tasteful and handsomeand eternally substantial and everywhere are those marvelous pavements so neat so smooth and so indestructible  and if ever roads and streets and the outsides of houses were perfectly free from any sign or semblance of dirt or dust or mud or uncleanliness of any kind it is horta it is fayal  the lower classes of the people in their persons and their domiciles are not cleanbut there it stopsthe town and the island are miracles of cleanliness  we arrived home again finally after a tenmile excursion and the irrepressible muleteers scampered at our heels through the main street goading the donkeys shouting the everlasting sekkiyah and singing john browns body in ruinous english  when we were dismounted and it came to settling the shouting and jawing and swearing and quarreling among the muleteers and with us was nearly deafening  one fellow would demand a dollar an hour for the use of his donkey another claimed half a dollar for pricking him up another a quarter for helping in that service and about fourteen guides presented bills for showing us the way through the town and its environs and every vagrant of them was more vociferous and more vehement and more frantic in gesture than his neighbor  we paid one guide and paid for one muleteer to each donkey  the mountains on some of the islands are very high  we sailed along the shore of the island of pico under a stately green pyramid that rose up with one unbroken sweep from our very feet to an altitude of 7613 feet and thrust its summit above the white clouds like an island adrift in a fog  we got plenty of fresh oranges lemons figs apricots etc in these azores of course  but i will desist  i am not here to write patent office reports  we are on our way to gibraltar and shall reach there five or six days out from the azores     chapter vii  a week of buffeting a tempestuous and relentless sea a week of seasickness and deserted cabins of lonely quarterdecks drenched with sprayspray so ambitious that it even coated the smokestacks thick with a white crust of salt to their very tops a week of shivering in the shelter of the lifeboats and deckhouses by day and blowing suffocating clouds and boisterously performing at dominoes in the smoking room at night  and the last night of the seven was the stormiest of all  there was no thunder no noise but the pounding bows of the ship the keen whistling of the gale through the cordage and the rush of the seething waters but the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaventhen paused an instant that seemed a century and plunged headlong down again as from a precipice  the sheeted sprays drenched the decks like rain  the blackness of darkness was everywhere  at long intervals a flash of lightning clove it with a quivering line of fire that revealed a heaving world of water where was nothing before kindled the dusky cordage to glittering silver and lit up the faces of the men with a ghastly luster  fear drove many on deck that were used to avoiding the night winds and the spray  some thought the vessel could not live through the night and it seemed less dreadful to stand out in the midst of the wild tempest and see the peril that threatened than to be shut up in the sepulchral cabins under the dim lamps and imagine the horrors that were abroad on the ocean  and once outonce where they could see the ship struggling in the strong grasp of the stormonce where they could hear the shriek of the winds and face the driving spray and look out upon the majestic picture the lightnings disclosed they were prisoners to a fierce fascination they could not resist and so remained  it was a wild night and a very very long one  everybody was sent scampering to the deck at seven oclock this lovely morning of the thirtieth of june with the glad news that land was in sight  it was a rare thing and a joyful to see all the ships family abroad once more albeit the happiness that sat upon every countenance could only partly conceal the ravages which that long siege of storms had wrought there  but dull eyes soon sparkled with pleasure pallid cheeks flushed again and frames weakened by sickness gathered new life from the quickening influences of the bright fresh morning  yea and from a still more potent influence the worn castaways were to see the blessed land againand to see it was to bring back that motherland that was in all their thoughts  within the hour we were fairly within the straits of gibraltar the tall yellowsplotched hills of africa on our right with their bases veiled in a blue haze and their summits swathed in cloudsthe same being according to scripture which says that clouds and darkness are over the land the words were spoken of this particular portion of africa i believe on our left were the graniteribbed domes of old spain  the strait is only thirteen miles wide in its narrowest part  at short intervals along the spanish shore were quaintlooking old stone towersmoorish we thoughtbut learned better afterwards  in former times the morocco rascals used to coast along the spanish main in their boats till a safe opportunity seemed to present itself and then dart in and capture a spanish village and carry off all the pretty women they could find  it was a pleasant business and was very popular  the spaniards built these watchtowers on the hills to enable them to keep a sharper lookout on the moroccan speculators  the picture on the other hand was very beautiful to eyes weary of the changeless sea and by and by the ships company grew wonderfully cheerful  but while we stood admiring the cloudcapped peaks and the lowlands robed in misty gloom a finer picture burst upon us and chained every eye like a magneta stately ship with canvas piled on canvas till she was one towering mass of bellying sail  she came speeding over the sea like a great bird  africa and spain were forgotten  all homage was for the beautiful stranger  while everybody gazed she swept superbly by and flung the stars and stripes to the breeze  quicker than thought hats and handkerchiefs flashed in the air and a cheer went up  she was beautiful beforeshe was radiant now  many a one on our decks knew then for the first time how tame a sight his countrys flag is at home compared to what it is in a foreign land  to see it is to see a vision of home itself and all its idols and feel a thrill that would stir a very river of sluggish blood  we were approaching the famed pillars of hercules and already the african one apes hill a grand old mountain with summit streaked with granite ledges was in sight  the other the great rock of gibraltar was yet to come  the ancients considered the pillars of hercules the head of navigation and the end of the world  the information the ancients didnt have was very voluminous  even the prophets wrote book after book and epistle after epistle yet never once hinted at the existence of a great continent on our side of the water yet they must have known it was there i should think  in a few moments a lonely and enormous mass of rock standing seemingly in the center of the wide strait and apparently washed on all sides by the sea swung magnificently into view and we needed no tedious traveled parrot to tell us it was gibraltar  there could not be two rocks like that in one kingdom  the rock of gibraltar is about a mile and a half long i should say by 1400 to 1500 feet high and a quarter of a mile wide at its base  one side and one end of it come about as straight up out of the sea as the side of a house the other end is irregular and the other side is a steep slant which an army would find very difficult to climb  at the foot of this slant is the walled town of gibraltaror rather the town occupies part of the slant  everywhereon hillside in the precipice by the sea on the heightseverywhere you choose to look gibraltar is clad with masonry and bristling with guns  it makes a striking and lively picture from whatsoever point you contemplate it  it is pushed out into the sea on the end of a flat narrow strip of land and is suggestive of a gob of mud on the end of a shingle  a few hundred yards of this flat ground at its base belongs to the english and then extending across the strip from the atlantic to the mediterranean a distance of a quarter of a mile comes the neutral ground a space two or three hundred yards wide which is free to both parties  are you going through spain to paris  that question was bandied about the ship day and night from fayal to gibraltar and i thought i never could get so tired of hearing any one combination of words again or more tired of answering i dont know  at the last moment six or seven had sufficient decision of character to make up their minds to go and did go and i felt a sense of relief at onceit was forever too late now and i could make up my mind at my leisure not to go  i must have a prodigious quantity of mind it takes me as much as a week sometimes to make it up  but behold how annoyances repeat themselves  we had no sooner gotten rid of the spain distress than the gibraltar guides started anothera tiresome repetition of a legend that had nothing very astonishing about it even in the first place that high hill yonder is called the queens chair it is because one of the queens of spain placed her chair there when the french and spanish troops were besieging gibraltar and said she would never move from the spot till the english flag was lowered from the fortresses  if the english hadnt been gallant enough to lower the flag for a few hours one day shed have had to break her oath or die up there  we rode on asses and mules up the steep narrow streets and entered the subterranean galleries the english have blasted out in the rock  these galleries are like spacious railway tunnels and at short intervals in them great guns frown out upon sea and town through portholes five or six hundred feet above the ocean  there is a mile or so of this subterranean work and it must have cost a vast deal of money and labor  the gallery guns command the peninsula and the harbors of both oceans but they might as well not be there i should think for an army could hardly climb the perpendicular wall of the rock anyhow  those lofty portholes afford superb views of the sea though  at one place where a jutting crag was hollowed out into a great chamber whose furniture was huge cannon and whose windows were portholes a glimpse was caught of a hill not far away and a soldier said  that high hill yonder is called the queens chair it is because a queen of spain placed her chair there once when the french and spanish troops were besieging gibraltar and said she would never move from the spot till the english flag was lowered from the fortresses  if the english hadnt been gallant enough to lower the flag for a few hours one day shed have had to break her oath or die up there  on the topmost pinnacle of gibraltar we halted a good while and no doubt the mules were tired  they had a right to be  the military road was good but rather steep and there was a good deal of it  the view from the narrow ledge was magnificent from it vessels seeming like the tiniest little toy boats were turned into noble ships by the telescopes and other vessels that were fifty miles away and even sixty they said and invisible to the naked eye could be clearly distinguished through those same telescopes  below on one side we looked down upon an endless mass of batteries and on the other straight down to the sea  while i was resting ever so comfortably on a rampart and cooling my baking head in the delicious breeze an officious guide belonging to another party came up and said  senor that high hill yonder is called the queens chair  sir i am a helpless orphan in a foreign land  have pity on me  dont now dont inflict that most infernal old legend on me anymore today  therei had used strong language after promising i would never do so again but the provocation was more than human nature could bear  if you had been bored so when you had the noble panorama of spain and africa and the blue mediterranean spread abroad at your feet and wanted to gaze and enjoy and surfeit yourself in its beauty in silence you might have even burst into stronger language than i did  gibraltar has stood several protracted sieges one of them of nearly four years duration it failed and the english only captured it by stratagem  the wonder is that anybody should ever dream of trying so impossible a project as the taking it by assaultand yet it has been tried more than once  the moors held the place twelve hundred years ago and a staunch old castle of theirs of that date still frowns from the middle of the town with mossgrown battlements and sides well scarred by shots fired in battles and sieges that are forgotten now  a secret chamber in the rock behind it was discovered some time ago which contained a sword of exquisite workmanship and some quaint old armor of a fashion that antiquaries are not acquainted with though it is supposed to be roman roman armor and roman relics of various kinds have been found in a cave in the sea extremity of gibraltar history says rome held this part of the country about the christian era and these things seem to confirm the statement  in that cave also are found human bones crusted with a very thick stony coating and wise men have ventured to say that those men not only lived before the flood but as much as ten thousand years before it  it may be trueit looks reasonable enoughbut as long as those parties cant vote anymore the matter can be of no great public interest  in this cave likewise are found skeletons and fossils of animals that exist in every part of africa yet within memory and tradition have never existed in any portion of spain save this lone peak of gibraltar  so the theory is that the channel between gibraltar and africa was once dry land and that the low neutral neck between gibraltar and the spanish hills behind it was once ocean and of course that these african animals being over at gibraltar after rock perhapsthere is plenty there got closed out when the great change occurred  the hills in africa across the channel are full of apes and there are now and always have been apes on the rock of gibraltarbut not elsewhere in spain  the subject is an interesting one  there is an english garrison at gibraltar of 6000 or 7000 men and so uniforms of flaming red are plenty and red and blue and undress costumes of snowy white and also the queer uniform of the barekneed highlander and one sees softeyed spanish girls from san roque and veiled moorish beauties i suppose they are beauties from tarifa and turbaned sashed and trousered moorish merchants from fez and longrobed barelegged ragged muhammadan vagabonds from tetuan and tangier some brown some yellow and some as black as virgin inkand jews from all around in gabardine skullcap and slippers just as they are in pictures and theaters and just as they were three thousand years ago no doubt  you can easily understand that a tribe somehow our pilgrims suggest that expression because they march in a straggling procession through these foreign places with such an indianlike air of complacency and independence about them like ours made up from fifteen or sixteen states of the union found enough to stare at in this shifting panorama of fashion today  speaking of our pilgrims reminds me that we have one or two people among us who are sometimes an annoyance  however i do not count the oracle in that list  i will explain that the oracle is an innocent old ass who eats for four and looks wiser than the whole academy of france would have any right to look and never uses a onesyllable word when he can think of a longer one and never by any possible chance knows the meaning of any long word he uses or ever gets it in the right place yet he will serenely venture an opinion on the most abstruse subject and back it up complacently with quotations from authors who never existed and finally when cornered will slide to the other side of the question say he has been there all the time and come back at you with your own spoken arguments only with the big words all tangled and play them in your very teeth as original with himself  he reads a chapter in the guidebooks mixes the facts all up with his bad memory and then goes off to inflict the whole mess on somebody as wisdom which has been festering in his brain for years and which he gathered in college from erudite authors who are dead now and out of print  this morning at breakfast he pointed out of the window and said  do you see that there hill out there on that african coast  its one of them pillows of herkewls i should sayand theres the ultimate one alongside of it  the ultimate onethat is a good wordbut the pillars are not both on the same side of the strait  i saw he had been deceived by a carelessly written sentence in the guidebook  well it aint for you to say nor for me  some authors states it that way and some states it different  old gibbons dont say nothing about itjust shirks it completegibbons always done that when he got stuck but there is rolampton what does he say  why he says that they was both on the same side and trinculian and sobaster and syraccus and langomarganbl  oh that will dothats enough  if you have got your hand in for inventing authors and testimony i have nothing more to saylet them be on the same side  we dont mind the oracle  we rather like him  we can tolerate the oracle very easily but we have a poet and a goodnatured enterprising idiot on board and they do distress the company  the one gives copies of his verses to consuls commanders hotel keepers arabs dutchto anybody in fact who will submit to a grievous infliction most kindly meant  his poetry is all very well on shipboard notwithstanding when he wrote an ode to the ocean in a storm in one half hour and an apostrophe to the rooster in the waist of the ship in the next the transition was considered to be rather abrupt but when he sends an invoice of rhymes to the governor of fayal and another to the commander in chief and other dignitaries in gibraltar with the compliments of the laureate of the ship it is not popular with the passengers  the other personage i have mentioned is young and green and not bright not learned and not wise  he will be though someday if he recollects the answers to all his questions  he is known about the ship as the interrogation point and this by constant use has become shortened to interrogation  he has distinguished himself twice already  in fayal they pointed out a hill and told him it was 800 feet high and 1100 feet long  and they told him there was a tunnel 2000 feet long and 1000 feet high running through the hill from end to end  he believed it  he repeated it to everybody discussed it and read it from his notes finally he took a useful hint from this remark which a thoughtful old pilgrim made  well yes it is a little remarkablesingular tunnel altogetherstands up out of the top of the hill about two hundred feet and one end of it sticks out of the hill about nine hundred  here in gibraltar he corners these educated british officers and badgers them with braggadocio about america and the wonders she can perform  he told one of them a couple of our gunboats could come here and knock gibraltar into the mediterranean sea  at this present moment half a dozen of us are taking a private pleasure excursion of our own devising  we form rather more than half the list of white passengers on board a small steamer bound for the venerable moorish town of tangier africa  nothing could be more absolutely certain than that we are enjoying ourselves  one can not do otherwise who speeds over these sparkling waters and breathes the soft atmosphere of this sunny land  care cannot assail us here  we are out of its jurisdiction  we even steamed recklessly by the frowning fortress of malabat a stronghold of the emperor of morocco without a twinge of fear the whole garrison turned out under arms and assumed a threatening attitudeyet still we did not fear  the entire garrison marched and countermarched within the rampart in full viewyet notwithstanding even this we never flinched  i suppose we really do not know what fear is  i inquired the name of the garrison of the fortress of malabat and they said it was mehemet ali ben sancom  i said it would be a good idea to get some more garrisons to help him but they said no he had nothing to do but hold the place and he was competent to do that had done it two years already  that was evidence which one could not well refute  there is nothing like reputation  every now and then my glove purchase in gibraltar last night intrudes itself upon me  dan and the ships surgeon and i had been up to the great square listening to the music of the fine military bands and contemplating english and spanish female loveliness and fashion and at nine oclock were on our way to the theater when we met the general the judge the commodore the colonel and the commissioner of the united states of america to europe asia and africa who had been to the club house to register their several titles and impoverish the bill of fare and they told us to go over to the little variety store near the hall of justice and buy some kid gloves  they said they were elegant and very moderate in price  it seemed a stylish thing to go to the theater in kid gloves and we acted upon the hint  a very handsome young lady in the store offered me a pair of blue gloves  i did not want blue but she said they would look very pretty on a hand like mine  the remark touched me tenderly  i glanced furtively at my hand and somehow it did seem rather a comely member  i tried a glove on my left and blushed a little manifestly the size was too small for me  but i felt gratified when she said  oh it is just right  yet i knew it was no such thing  i tugged at it diligently but it was discouraging work  she said  ah  i see you are accustomed to wearing kid glovesbut some gentlemen are so awkward about putting them on  it was the last compliment i had expected  i only understand putting on the buckskin article perfectly  i made another effort and tore the glove from the base of the thumb into the palm of the handand tried to hide the rent  she kept up her compliments and i kept up my determination to deserve them or die  ah you have had experience  a rip down the back of the hand they are just right for youyour hand is very smallif they tear you need not pay for them  a rent across the middle  i can always tell when a gentleman understands putting on kid gloves  there is a grace about it that only comes with long practice  the whole afterguard of the glove fetched away as the sailors say the fabric parted across the knuckles and nothing was left but a melancholy ruin  i was too much flattered to make an exposure and throw the merchandise on the angels hands  i was hot vexed confused but still happy but i hated the other boys for taking such an absorbing interest in the proceedings  i wished they were in jericho  i felt exquisitely mean when i said cheerfully  this one does very well it fits elegantly  i like a glove that fits no never mind maam never mind ill put the other on in the street it is warm here  it was warm  it was the warmest place i ever was in  i paid the bill and as i passed out with a fascinating bow i thought i detected a light in the womans eye that was gently ironical and when i looked back from the street and she was laughing all to herself about something or other i said to myself with withering sarcasm oh certainly you know how to put on kid gloves dont you  a selfcomplacent ass ready to be flattered out of your senses by every petticoat that chooses to take the trouble to do it  the silence of the boys annoyed me  finally dan said musingly  some gentlemen dont know how to put on kid gloves at all but some do  and the doctor said to the moon i thought  but it is always easy to tell when a gentleman is used to putting on kid gloves  dan soliloquized after a pause  ah yes there is a grace about it that only comes with long very long practice  yes indeed ive noticed that when a man hauls on a kid glove like he was dragging a cat out of an ash hole by the tail he understands putting on kid gloves hes had ex  boys enough of a things enough  you think you are very smart i suppose but i dont  and if you go and tell any of those old gossips in the ship about this thing ill never forgive you for it thats all  they let me alone then for the time being  we always let each other alone in time to prevent ill feeling from spoiling a joke  but they had bought gloves too as i did  we threw all the purchases away together this morning  they were coarse unsubstantial freckled all over with broad yellow splotches and could neither stand wear nor public exhibition  we had entertained an angel unawares but we did not take her in  she did that for us  tangier  a tribe of stalwart moors are wading into the sea to carry us ashore on their backs from the small boats     chapter viii  this is royal  let those who went up through spain make the best of it these dominions of the emperor of morocco suit our little party well enough  we have had enough of spain at gibraltar for the present tangier is the spot we have been longing for all the time  elsewhere we have found foreignlooking things and foreignlooking people but always with things and people intermixed that we were familiar with before and so the novelty of the situation lost a deal of its force  we wanted something thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreignforeign from top to bottomforeign from center to circumferenceforeign inside and outside and all aroundnothing anywhere about it to dilute its foreignness nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun and lo  in tangier we have found it  here is not the slightest thing that ever we have seen save in picturesand we always mistrusted the pictures before  we cannot anymore  the pictures used to seem exaggerationsthey seemed too weird and fanciful for reality  but behold they were not wild enoughthey were not fanciful enoughthey have not told half the story  tangier is a foreign land if ever there was one and the true spirit of it can never be found in any book save the arabian nights  here are no white men visible yet swarms of humanity are all about us  here is a packed and jammed city enclosed in a massive stone wall which is more than a thousand years old  all the houses nearly are oneand twostory made of thick walls of stone plastered outside square as a drygoods box flat as a floor on top no cornices whitewashed all overa crowded city of snowy tombs  and the doors are arched with the peculiar arch we see in moorish pictures the floors are laid in varicolored diamond flags in tesselated manycolored porcelain squares wrought in the furnaces of fez in red tiles and broad bricks that time cannot wear there is no furniture in the rooms of jewish dwellings save divanswhat there is in moorish ones no man may know within their sacred walls no christian dog can enter  and the streets are orientalsome of them three feet wide some six but only two that are over a dozen a man can blockade the most of them by extending his body across them  isnt it an oriental picture  there are stalwart bedouins of the desert here and stately moors proud of a history that goes back to the night of time and jews whose fathers fled hither centuries upon centuries ago and swarthy riffians from the mountainsborn cutthroatsand original genuine negroes as black as moses and howling dervishes and a hundred breeds of arabsall sorts and descriptions of people that are foreign and curious to look upon  and their dresses are strange beyond all description  here is a bronzed moor in a prodigious white turban curiously embroidered jacket gold and crimson sash of many folds wrapped round and round his waist trousers that only come a little below his knee and yet have twenty yards of stuff in them ornamented scimitar bare shins stockingless feet yellow slippers and gun of preposterous lengtha mere soldieri thought he was the emperor at least  and here are aged moors with flowing white beards and long white robes with vast cowls and bedouins with long cowled striped cloaks and negroes and riffians with heads cleanshaven except a kinky scalp lock back of the ear or rather upon the after corner of the skull and all sorts of barbarians in all sorts of weird costumes and all more or less ragged  and here are moorish women who are enveloped from head to foot in coarse white robes and whose sex can only be determined by the fact that they only leave one eye visible and never look at men of their own race or are looked at by them in public here are five thousand jews in blue gabardines sashes about their waists slippers upon their feet little skullcaps upon the backs of their heads hair combed down on the forehead and cut straight across the middle of it from side to sidethe selfsame fashion their tangier ancestors have worn for i dont know how many bewildering centuries their feet and ankles are bare  their noses are all hooked and hooked alike  they all resemble each other so much that one could almost believe they were of one family  their women are plump and pretty and do smile upon a christian in a way which is in the last degree comforting  what a funny old town it is  it seems like profanation to laugh and jest and bandy the frivolous chat of our day amid its hoary relics  only the stately phraseology and the measured speech of the sons of the prophet are suited to a venerable antiquity like this  here is a crumbling wall that was old when columbus discovered america was old when peter the hermit roused the knightly men of the middle ages to arm for the first crusade was old when charlemagne and his paladins beleaguered enchanted castles and battled with giants and genii in the fabled days of the olden time was old when christ and his disciples walked the earth stood where it stands today when the lips of memnon were vocal and men bought and sold in the streets of ancient thebes  the phoenicians the carthagenians the english moors romans all have battled for tangierall have won it and lost it  here is a ragged orientallooking negro from some desert place in interior africa filling his goatskin with water from a stained and battered fountain built by the romans twelve hundred years ago  yonder is a ruined arch of a bridge built by julius caesar nineteen hundred years ago  men who had seen the infant saviour in the virgins arms have stood upon it maybe  near it are the ruins of a dockyard where caesar repaired his ships and loaded them with grain when he invaded britain fifty years before the christian era  here under the quiet stars these old streets seem thronged with the phantoms of forgotten ages  my eyes are resting upon a spot where stood a monument which was seen and described by roman historians less than two thousand years ago whereon was inscribed                 we are the canaanites  we are they that                have been driven out of the land of canaan                by the jewish robber joshua  joshua drove them out and they came here  not many leagues from here is a tribe of jews whose ancestors fled thither after an unsuccessful revolt against king david and these their descendants are still under a ban and keep to themselves  tangier has been mentioned in history for three thousand years  and it was a town though a queer one when hercules clad in his lion skin landed here four thousand years ago  in these streets he met anitus the king of the country and brained him with his club which was the fashion among gentlemen in those days  the people of tangier called tingis then lived in the rudest possible huts and dressed in skins and carried clubs and were as savage as the wild beasts they were constantly obliged to war with  but they were a gentlemanly race and did no work they lived on the natural products of the land  their kings country residence was at the famous garden of hesperides seventy miles down the coast from here  the garden with its golden apples oranges is gone nowno vestige of it remains  antiquarians concede that such a personage as hercules did exist in ancient times and agree that he was an enterprising and energetic man but decline to believe him a good bonafide god because that would be unconstitutional  down here at cape spartel is the celebrated cave of hercules where that hero took refuge when he was vanquished and driven out of the tangier country  it is full of inscriptions in the dead languages which fact makes me think hercules could not have traveled much else he would not have kept a journal  five days journey from heresay two hundred milesare the ruins of an ancient city of whose history there is neither record nor tradition and yet its arches its columns and its statues proclaim it to have been built by an enlightened race  the general size of a store in tangier is about that of an ordinary shower bath in a civilized land  the muhammadan merchant tinman shoemaker or vendor of trifles sits crosslegged on the floor and reaches after any article you may want to buy  you can rent a whole block of these pigeonholes for fifty dollars a month  the market people crowd the marketplace with their baskets of figs dates melons apricots etc and among them file trains of laden asses not much larger if any than a newfoundland dog  the scene is lively is picturesque and smells like a police court  the jewish moneychangers have their dens close at hand and all day long are counting bronze coins and transferring them from one bushel basket to another  they dont coin much money nowadays i think  i saw none but what was dated four or five hundred years back and was badly worn and battered  these coins are not very valuable  jack went out to get a napoleon changed so as to have money suited to the general cheapness of things and came back and said he had swamped the bank had bought eleven quarts of coin and the head of the firm had gone on the street to negotiate for the balance of the change  i bought nearly half a pint of their money for a shilling myself  i am not proud on account of having so much money though  i care nothing for wealth  the moors have some small silver coins and also some silver slugs worth a dollar each  the latter are exceedingly scarceso much so that when poor ragged arabs see one they beg to be allowed to kiss it  they have also a small gold coin worth two dollars  and that reminds me of something  when morocco is in a state of war arab couriers carry letters through the country and charge a liberal postage  every now and then they fall into the hands of marauding bands and get robbed therefore warned by experience as soon as they have collected two dollars worth of money they exchange it for one of those little gold pieces and when robbers come upon them swallow it  the stratagem was good while it was unsuspected but after that the marauders simply gave the sagacious united states mail an emetic and sat down to wait  the emperor of morocco is a soulless despot and the great officers under him are despots on a smaller scale  there is no regular system of taxation but when the emperor or the bashaw want money they levy on some rich man and he has to furnish the cash or go to prison therefore few men in morocco dare to be rich  it is too dangerous a luxury  vanity occasionally leads a man to display wealth but sooner or later the emperor trumps up a charge against himany sort of one will doand confiscates his property  of course there are many rich men in the empire but their money is buried and they dress in rags and counterfeit poverty  every now and then the emperor imprisons a man who is suspected of the crime of being rich and makes things so uncomfortable for him that he is forced to discover where he has hidden his money  moors and jews sometimes place themselves under the protection of the foreign consuls and then they can flout their riches in the emperors face with impunity     chapter ix  about the first adventure we had yesterday afternoon after landing here came near finishing that heedless blucher  we had just mounted some mules and asses and started out under the guardianship of the stately the princely the magnificent hadji muhammad lamarty may his tribe increase when we came upon a fine moorish mosque with tall tower rich with checkerwork of manycolored porcelain and every part and portion of the edifice adorned with the quaint architecture of the alhambra and blucher started to ride into the open doorway  a startling hihi from our camp followers and a loud halt from an english gentleman in the party checked the adventurer and then we were informed that so dire a profanation is it for a christian dog to set foot upon the sacred threshold of a moorish mosque that no amount of purification can ever make it fit for the faithful to pray in again  had blucher succeeded in entering the place he would no doubt have been chased through the town and stoned and the time has been and not many years ago either when a christian would have been most ruthlessly slaughtered if captured in a mosque  we caught a glimpse of the handsome tessellated pavements within and of the devotees performing their ablutions at the fountains but even that we took that glimpse was a thing not relished by the moorish bystanders  some years ago the clock in the tower of the mosque got out of order the moors of tangier have so degenerated that it has been long since there was an artificer among them capable of curing so delicate a patient as a debilitated clock  the great men of the city met in solemn conclave to consider how the difficulty was to be met  they discussed the matter thoroughly but arrived at no solution  finally a patriarch arose and said  oh children of the prophet it is known unto you that a portuguee dog of a christian clock mender pollutes the city of tangier with his presence  ye know also that when mosques are builded asses bear the stones and the cement and cross the sacred threshold  now therefore send the christian dog on all fours and barefoot into the holy place to mend the clock and let him go as an ass  and in that way it was done  therefore if blucher ever sees the inside of a mosque he will have to cast aside his humanity and go in his natural character  we visited the jail and found moorish prisoners making mats and baskets  this thing of utilizing crime savors of civilization  murder is punished with death  a short time ago three murderers were taken beyond the city walls and shot  moorish guns are not good and neither are moorish marksmen  in this instance they set up the poor criminals at long range like so many targets and practiced on themkept them hopping about and dodging bullets for half an hour before they managed to drive the center  when a man steals cattle they cut off his right hand and left leg and nail them up in the marketplace as a warning to everybody  their surgery is not artistic  they slice around the bone a little then break off the limb  sometimes the patient gets well but as a general thing he dont  however the moorish heart is stout  the moors were always brave  these criminals undergo the fearful operation without a wince without a tremor of any kind without a groan  no amount of suffering can bring down the pride of a moor or make him shame his dignity with a cry  here marriage is contracted by the parents of the parties to it  there are no valentines no stolen interviews no riding out no courting in dim parlors no lovers quarrels and reconciliationsno nothing that is proper to approaching matrimony  the young man takes the girl his father selects for him marries her and after that she is unveiled and he sees her for the first time  if after due acquaintance she suits him he retains her but if he suspects her purity he bundles her back to her father if he finds her diseased the same or if after just and reasonable time is allowed her she neglects to bear children back she goes to the home of her childhood  muhammadans here who can afford it keep a good many wives on hand  they are called wives though i believe the koran only allows four genuine wivesthe rest are concubines  the emperor of morocco dont know how many wives he has but thinks he has five hundred  however that is near enougha dozen or so one way or the other dont matter  even the jews in the interior have a plurality of wives  i have caught a glimpse of the faces of several moorish women for they are only human and will expose their faces for the admiration of a christian dog when no male moor is by and i am full of veneration for the wisdom that leads them to cover up such atrocious ugliness  they carry their children at their backs in a sack like other savages the world over  many of the negroes are held in slavery by the moors  but the moment a female slave becomes her masters concubine her bonds are broken and as soon as a male slave can read the first chapter of the koran which contains the creed he can no longer be held in bondage  they have three sundays a week in tangier  the muhammadans comes on friday the jews on saturday and that of the christian consuls on sunday  the jews are the most radical  the moor goes to his mosque about noon on his sabbath as on any other day removes his shoes at the door performs his ablutions makes his salaams pressing his forehead to the pavement time and again says his prayers and goes back to his work  but the jew shuts up shop will not touch copper or bronze money at all soils his fingers with nothing meaner than silver and gold attends the synagogue devoutly will not cook or have anything to do with fire and religiously refrains from embarking in any enterprise  the moor who has made a pilgrimage to mecca is entitled to high distinction  men call him hadji and he is thenceforward a great personage  hundreds of moors come to tangier every year and embark for mecca  they go part of the way in english steamers and the ten or twelve dollars they pay for passage is about all the trip costs  they take with them a quantity of food and when the commissary department fails they skirmish as jack terms it in his sinful slangy way  from the time they leave till they get home again they never wash either on land or sea  they are usually gone from five to seven months and as they do not change their clothes during all that time they are totally unfit for the drawing room when they get back  many of them have to rake and scrape a long time to gather together the ten dollars their steamer passage costs and when one of them gets back he is a bankrupt forever after  few moors can ever build up their fortunes again in one short lifetime after so reckless an outlay  in order to confine the dignity of hadji to gentlemen of patrician blood and possessions the emperor decreed that no man should make the pilgrimage save bloated aristocrats who were worth a hundred dollars in specie  but behold how iniquity can circumvent the law  for a consideration the jewish moneychanger lends the pilgrim one hundred dollars long enough for him to swear himself through and then receives it back before the ship sails out of the harbor  spain is the only nation the moors fear  the reason is that spain sends her heaviest ships of war and her loudest guns to astonish these muslims while america and other nations send only a little contemptible tub of a gunboat occasionally  the moors like other savages learn by what they see not what they hear or read  we have great fleets in the mediterranean but they seldom touch at african ports  the moors have a small opinion of england france and america and put their representatives to a deal of redtape circumlocution before they grant them their common rights let alone a favor  but the moment the spanish minister makes a demand it is acceded to at once whether it be just or not  spain chastised the moors five or six years ago about a disputed piece of property opposite gibraltar and captured the city of tetouan  she compromised on an augmentation of her territory twenty million dollars indemnity in money and peace  and then she gave up the city  but she never gave it up until the spanish soldiers had eaten up all the cats they would not compromise as long as the cats held out  spaniards are very fond of cats  on the contrary the moors reverence cats as something sacred  so the spaniards touched them on a tender point that time  their unfeline conduct in eating up all the tetouan cats aroused a hatred toward them in the breasts of the moors to which even the driving them out of spain was tame and passionless  moors and spaniards are foes forever now  france had a minister here once who embittered the nation against him in the most innocent way  he killed a couple of battalions of cats tangier is full of them and made a parlor carpet out of their hides  he made his carpet in circlesfirst a circle of old gray tomcats with their tails all pointing toward the center then a circle of yellow cats next a circle of black cats and a circle of white ones then a circle of all sorts of cats and finally a centerpiece of assorted kittens  it was very beautiful but the moors curse his memory to this day  when we went to call on our american consul general today i noticed that all possible games for parlor amusement seemed to be represented on his center tables  i thought that hinted at lonesomeness  the idea was correct  his is the only american family in tangier  there are many foreign consuls in this place but much visiting is not indulged in tangier is clear out of the world and what is the use of visiting when people have nothing on earth to talk about  there is none  so each consuls family stays at home chiefly and amuses itself as best it can tangier is full of interest for one day but after that it is a weary prison  the consul general has been here five years and has got enough of it to do him for a century and is going home shortly  his family seize upon their letters and papers when the mail arrives read them over and over again for two days or three talk them over and over again for two or three more till they wear them out and after that for days together they eat and drink and sleep and ride out over the same old road and see the same old tiresome things that even decades of centuries have scarcely changed and say never a single word  they have literally nothing whatever to talk about  the arrival of an american manofwar is a godsend to them  o solitude where are the charms which sages have seen in thy face  it is the completest exile that i can conceive of i would seriously recommend to the government of the united states that when a man commits a crime so heinous that the law provides no adequate punishment for it they make him consul general to tangier  i am glad to have seen tangierthe secondoldest town in the world  but i am ready to bid it goodbye i believe  we shall go hence to gibraltar this evening or in the morning and doubtless the quaker city will sail from that port within the next fortyeight hours     chapter x  we passed the fourth of july on board the quaker city in midocean  it was in all respects a characteristic mediterranean dayfaultlessly beautiful  a cloudless sky a refreshing summer wind a radiant sunshine that glinted cheerily from dancing wavelets instead of crested mountains of water a sea beneath us that was so wonderfully blue so richly brilliantly blue that it overcame the dullest sensibilities with the spell of its fascination  they even have fine sunsets on the mediterraneana thing that is certainly rare in most quarters of the globe  the evening we sailed away from gibraltar that hardfeatured rock was swimming in a creamy mist so rich so soft so enchantingly vague and dreamy that even the oracle that serene that inspired that overpowering humbug scorned the dinner gong and tarried to worship  he said well thats gorgis aint it  they dont have none of them things in our parts do they  i consider that them effects is on account of the superior refragability as you may say of the suns diramic combination with the lymphatic forces of the perihelion of jubiter  what should you think  oh go to bed dan said that and went away  oh yes its all very well to say go to bed when a man makes an argument which another man cant answer  dan dont never stand any chance in an argument with me  and he knows it too  what should you say jack  now doctor dont you come bothering around me with that dictionary bosh  i dont do you any harm do i  then you let me alone  hes gone too  well them fellows have all tackled the old oracle as they say but the old mans most too many for em  maybe the poet lariat aint satisfied with them deductions  the poet replied with a barbarous rhyme and went below  pears that he cant qualify neither  well i didnt expect nothing out of him  i never see one of them poets yet that knowed anything hell go down now and grind out about four reams of the awfullest slush about that old rock and give it to a consul or a pilot or a nigger or anybody he comes across first which he can impose on  pity but somebodyd take that poor old lunatic and dig all that poetry rubbage out of him  why cant a man put his intellect onto things thats some value gibbons and hippocratus and sarcophagus and all them old ancient philosophers was down on poets  doctor i said you are going to invent authorities now and ill leave you too  i always enjoy your conversation notwithstanding the luxuriance of your syllables when the philosophy you offer rests on your own responsibility but when you begin to soarwhen you begin to support it with the evidence of authorities who are the creations of your own fancyi lose confidence  that was the way to flatter the doctor  he considered it a sort of acknowledgment on my part of a fear to argue with him  he was always persecuting the passengers with abstruse propositions framed in language that no man could understand and they endured the exquisite torture a minute or two and then abandoned the field  a triumph like this over half a dozen antagonists was sufficient for one day from that time forward he would patrol the decks beaming blandly upon all comers and so tranquilly blissfully happy  but i digress  the thunder of our two brave cannon announced the fourth of july at daylight to all who were awake  but many of us got our information at a later hour from the almanac  all the flags were sent aloft except half a dozen that were needed to decorate portions of the ship below and in a short time the vessel assumed a holiday appearance during the morning meetings were held and all manner of committees set to work on the celebration ceremonies  in the afternoon the ships company assembled aft on deck under the awnings the flute the asthmatic melodeon and the consumptive clarinet crippled the starspangled banner the choir chased it to cover and george came in with a peculiarly lacerating screech on the final note and slaughtered it nobody mourned  we carried out the corpse on three cheers that joke was not intentional and i do not endorse it and then the president throned behind a cable locker with a national flag spread over it announced the reader who rose up and read that same old declaration of independence which we have all listened to so often without paying any attention to what it said and after that the president piped the orator of the day to quarters and he made that same old speech about our national greatness which we so religiously believe and so fervently applaud  now came the choir into court again with the complaining instruments and assaulted hail columbia and when victory hung wavering in the scale george returned with his dreadful wildgoose stop turned on and the choir won of course a minister pronounced the benediction and the patriotic little gathering disbanded  the fourth of july was safe as far as the mediterranean was concerned  at dinner in the evening a wellwritten original poem was recited with spirit by one of the ships captains and thirteen regular toasts were washed down with several baskets of champagne  the speeches were bad execrable almost without exception  in fact without any exception but one  captain duncan made a good speech he made the only good speech of the evening  he said  ladies and gentlemenmay we all live to a green old age and be prosperous and happy  steward bring up another basket of champagne  it was regarded as a very able effort  the festivities so to speak closed with another of those miraculous balls on the promenade deck  we were not used to dancing on an even keel though and it was only a questionable success  but take it all together it was a bright cheerful pleasant fourth  toward nightfall the next evening we steamed into the great artificial harbor of this noble city of marseilles and saw the dying sunlight gild its clustering spires and ramparts and flood its leagues of environing verdure with a mellow radiance that touched with an added charm the white villas that flecked the landscape far and near  copyright secured according to law  there were no stages out and we could not get on the pier from the ship it was annoying  we were full of enthusiasmwe wanted to see france just at nightfall our party of three contracted with a waterman for the privilege of using his boat as a bridgeits stern was at our companion ladder and its bow touched the pier  we got in and the fellow backed out into the harbor  i told him in french that all we wanted was to walk over his thwarts and step ashore and asked him what he went away out there for  he said he could not understand me  i repeated  still he could not understand  he appeared to be very ignorant of french  the doctor tried him but he could not understand the doctor  i asked this boatman to explain his conduct which he did and then i couldnt understand him  dan said  oh go to the pier you old foolthats where we want to go  we reasoned calmly with dan that it was useless to speak to this foreigner in englishthat he had better let us conduct this business in the french language and not let the stranger see how uncultivated he was  well go on go on he said dont mind me  i dont wish to interfere  only if you go on telling him in your kind of french he never will find out where we want to go to  that is what i think about it  we rebuked him severely for this remark and said we never knew an ignorant person yet but was prejudiced  the frenchman spoke again and the doctor said  there now dan he says he is going to allez to the douain  means he is going to the hotel  oh certainlywe dont know the french language  this was a crusher as jack would say  it silenced further criticism from the disaffected member  we coasted past the sharp bows of a navy of great steamships and stopped at last at a government building on a stone pier  it was easy to remember then that the douain was the customhouse and not the hotel  we did not mention it however  with winning french politeness the officers merely opened and closed our satchels declined to examine our passports and sent us on our way  we stopped at the first cafe we came to and entered  an old woman seated us at a table and waited for orders  the doctor said  avezvous du vin  the dame looked perplexed  the doctor said again with elaborate distinctness of articulation  avezvous duvin  the dame looked more perplexed than before  i said  doctor there is a flaw in your pronunciation somewhere  let me try her  madame avezvous du vinit isnt any use doctortake the witness  madame avezvous du vindu fromagepainpickled pigs feetbeurre des oeufsdu boeufhorseradish sauerkraut hog and hominyanything anything in the world that can stay a christian stomach  she said  bless you why didnt you speak english before  i dont know anything about your plagued french  the humiliating taunts of the disaffected member spoiled the supper and we dispatched it in angry silence and got away as soon as we could  here we were in beautiful francein a vast stone house of quaint architecturesurrounded by all manner of curiously worded french signs stared at by strangely habited bearded french peopleeverything gradually and surely forcing upon us the coveted consciousness that at last and beyond all question we were in beautiful france and absorbing its nature to the forgetfulness of everything else and coming to feel the happy romance of the thing in all its enchanting delightfulnessand to think of this skinny veteran intruding with her vile english at such a moment to blow the fair vision to the winds  it was exasperating  we set out to find the centre of the city inquiring the direction every now and then  we never did succeed in making anybody understand just exactly what we wanted and neither did we ever succeed in comprehending just exactly what they said in reply but then they always pointedthey always did thatand we bowed politely and said merci monsieur and so it was a blighting triumph over the disaffected member anyway  he was restive under these victories and often asked  what did that pirate say  why he told us which way to go to find the grand casino  yes but what did he say  oh it dont matter what he saidwe understood him  these are educated peoplenot like that absurd boatman  well i wish they were educated enough to tell a man a direction that goes some wherefor weve been going around in a circle for an hour ive passed this same old drugstore seven times  we said it was a low disreputable falsehood but we knew it was not it was plain that it would not do to pass that drugstore again though we might go on asking directions but we must cease from following fingerpointings if we hoped to check the suspicions of the disaffected member  a long walk through smooth asphaltumpaved streets bordered by blocks of vast new mercantile houses of creamcolored stone every house and every block precisely like all the other houses and all the other blocks for a mile and all brilliantly lightedbrought us at last to the principal thoroughfare  on every hand were bright colors flashing constellations of gas burners gaily dressed men and women thronging the sidewalks hurry life activity cheerfulness conversation and laughter everywhere  we found the grand hotel du louvre et de la paix and wrote down who we were where we were born what our occupations were the place we came from last whether we were married or single how we liked it how old we were where we were bound for and when we expected to get there and a great deal of information of similar importanceall for the benefit of the landlord and the secret police  we hired a guide and began the business of sightseeing immediately  that first night on french soil was a stirring one  i cannot think of half the places we went to or what we particularly saw we had no disposition to examine carefully into anything at allwe only wanted to glance and goto move keep moving  the spirit of the country was upon us  we sat down finally at a late hour in the great casino and called for unstinted champagne  it is so easy to be bloated aristocrats where it costs nothing of consequence  there were about five hundred people in that dazzling place i suppose though the walls being papered entirely with mirrors so to speak one could not really tell but that there were a hundred thousand  young daintily dressed exquisites and young stylishly dressed women and also old gentlemen and old ladies sat in couples and groups about innumerable marbletopped tables and ate fancy suppers drank wine and kept up a chattering din of conversation that was dazing to the senses  there was a stage at the far end and a large orchestra and every now and then actors and actresses in preposterous comic dresses came out and sang the most extravagantly funny songs to judge by their absurd actions but that audience merely suspended its chatter stared cynically and never once smiled never once applauded i had always thought that frenchmen were ready to laugh at any thing     chapter xi  we are getting foreignized rapidly and with facility  we are getting reconciled to halls and bedchambers with unhomelike stone floors and no carpetsfloors that ring to the tread of ones heels with a sharpness that is death to sentimental musing  we are getting used to tidy noiseless waiters who glide hither and thither and hover about your back and your elbows like butterflies quick to comprehend orders quick to fill them thankful for a gratuity without regard to the amount and always politenever otherwise than polite  that is the strangest curiosity yeta really polite hotel waiter who isnt an idiot  we are getting used to driving right into the central court of the hotel in the midst of a fragrant circle of vines and flowers and in the midst also of parties of gentlemen sitting quietly reading the paper and smoking  we are getting used to ice frozen by artificial process in ordinary bottles the only kind of ice they have here  we are getting used to all these things but we are not getting used to carrying our own soap  we are sufficiently civilized to carry our own combs and toothbrushes but this thing of having to ring for soap every time we wash is new to us and not pleasant at all  we think of it just after we get our heads and faces thoroughly wet or just when we think we have been in the bathtub long enough and then of course an annoying delay follows  these marseillaises make marseillaise hymns and marseilles vests and marseilles soap for all the world but they never sing their hymns or wear their vests or wash with their soap themselves  we have learned to go through the lingering routine of the table dhote with patience with serenity with satisfaction  we take soup then wait a few minutes for the fish a few minutes more and the plates are changed and the roast beef comes another change and we take peas change again and take lentils change and take snail patties i prefer grasshoppers change and take roast chicken and salad then strawberry pie and ice cream then green figs pears oranges green almonds etc finally coffee  wine with every course of course being in france with such a cargo on board digestion is a slow process and we must sit long in the cool chambers and smokeand read french newspapers which have a strange fashion of telling a perfectly straight story till you get to the nub of it and then a word drops in that no man can translate and that story is ruined  an embankment fell on some frenchmen yesterday and the papers are full of it todaybut whether those sufferers were killed or crippled or bruised or only scared is more than i can possibly make out and yet i would just give anything to know  we were troubled a little at dinner today by the conduct of an american who talked very loudly and coarsely and laughed boisterously where all others were so quiet and well behaved  he ordered wine with a royal flourish and said  i never dine without wine sir which was a pitiful falsehood and looked around upon the company to bask in the admiration he expected to find in their faces  all these airs in a land where they would as soon expect to leave the soup out of the bill of fare as the winein a land where wine is nearly as common among all ranks as water  this fellow said i am a freeborn sovereign sir an american sir and i want everybody to know it  he did not mention that he was a lineal descendant of balaams ass but everybody knew that without his telling it  we have driven in the pradothat superb avenue bordered with patrician mansions and noble shade treesand have visited the chateau boarely and its curious museum  they showed us a miniature cemetery therea copy of the first graveyard that was ever in marseilles no doubt  the delicate little skeletons were lying in broken vaults and had their household gods and kitchen utensils with them  the original of this cemetery was dug up in the principal street of the city a few years ago  it had remained there only twelve feet underground for a matter of twentyfive hundred years or thereabouts  romulus was here before he built rome and thought something of founding a city on this spot but gave up the idea  he may have been personally acquainted with some of these phoenicians whose skeletons we have been examining  in the great zoological gardens we found specimens of all the animals the world produces i think including a dromedary a monkey ornamented with tufts of brilliant blue and carmine haira very gorgeous monkey he was a hippopotamus from the nile and a sort of tall longlegged bird with a beak like a powder horn and closefitting wings like the tails of a dress coat  this fellow stood up with his eyes shut and his shoulders stooped forward a little and looked as if he had his hands under his coat tails such tranquil stupidity such supernatural gravity such selfrighteousness and such ineffable selfcomplacency as were in the countenance and attitude of that graybodied darkwinged baldheaded and preposterously uncomely bird  he was so ungainly so pimply about the head so scaly about the legs yet so serene so unspeakably satisfied  he was the most comicallooking creature that can be imagined  it was good to hear dan and the doctor laughsuch natural and such enjoyable laughter had not been heard among our excursionists since our ship sailed away from america  this bird was a godsend to us and i should be an ingrate if i forgot to make honorable mention of him in these pages  ours was a pleasure excursion therefore we stayed with that bird an hour and made the most of him  we stirred him up occasionally but he only unclosed an eye and slowly closed it again abating no jot of his stately piety of demeanor or his tremendous seriousness  he only seemed to say defile not heavens anointed with unsanctified hands  we did not know his name and so we called him the pilgrim  dan said  all he wants now is a plymouth collection  the boon companion of the colossal elephant was a common cat  this cat had a fashion of climbing up the elephants hind legs and roosting on his back  she would sit up there with her paws curved under her breast and sleep in the sun half the afternoon  it used to annoy the elephant at first and he would reach up and take her down but she would go aft and climb up again  she persisted until she finally conquered the elephants prejudices and now they are inseparable friends  the cat plays about her comrades forefeet or his trunk often until dogs approach and then she goes aloft out of danger  the elephant has annihilated several dogs lately that pressed his companion too closely  we hired a sailboat and a guide and made an excursion to one of the small islands in the harbor to visit the castle dif  this ancient fortress has a melancholy history  it has been used as a prison for political offenders for two or three hundred years and its dungeon walls are scarred with the rudely carved names of many and many a captive who fretted his life away here and left no record of himself but these sad epitaphs wrought with his own hands  how thick the names were  and their longdeparted owners seemed to throng the gloomy cells and corridors with their phantom shapes  we loitered through dungeon after dungeon away down into the living rock below the level of the sea it seemed  names everywheresome plebeian some noble some even princely  plebeian prince and noble had one solicitude in commonthey would not be forgotten  they could suffer solitude inactivity and the horrors of a silence that no sound ever disturbed but they could not bear the thought of being utterly forgotten by the world  hence the carved names  in one cell where a little light penetrated a man had lived twentyseven years without seeing the face of a human beinglived in filth and wretchedness with no companionship but his own thoughts and they were sorrowful enough and hopeless enough no doubt  whatever his jailers considered that he needed was conveyed to his cell by night through a wicket  this man carved the walls of his prison house from floor to roof with all manner of figures of men and animals grouped in intricate designs  he had toiled there year after year at his selfappointed task while infants grew to boyhoodto vigorous youthidled through school and collegeacquired a professionclaimed mans mature estatemarried and looked back to infancy as to a thing of some vague ancient time almost but who shall tell how many ages it seemed to this prisoner  with the one time flew sometimes with the other neverit crawled always  to the one nights spent in dancing had seemed made of minutes instead of hours to the other those selfsame nights had been like all other nights of dungeon life and seemed made of slow dragging weeks instead of hours and minutes  one prisoner of fifteen years had scratched verses upon his walls and brief prose sentencesbrief but full of pathos  these spoke not of himself and his hard estate but only of the shrine where his spirit fled the prison to worshipof home and the idols that were templed there he never lived to see them  the walls of these dungeons are as thick as some bedchambers at home are widefifteen feet  we saw the damp dismal cells in which two of dumas heroes passed their confinementheroes of monte cristo  it was here that the brave abbe wrote a book with his own blood with a pen made of a piece of iron hoop and by the light of a lamp made out of shreds of cloth soaked in grease obtained from his food and then dug through the thick wall with some trifling instrument which he wrought himself out of a stray piece of iron or table cutlery and freed dantes from his chains it was a pity that so many weeks of dreary labor should have come to naught at last  they showed us the noisome cell where the celebrated iron maskthat illstarred brother of a hardhearted king of francewas confined for a season before he was sent to hide the strange mystery of his life from the curious in the dungeons of ste marguerite  the place had a far greater interest for us than it could have had if we had known beyond all question who the iron mask was and what his history had been and why this most unusual punishment had been meted out to him  mystery  that was the charm  that speechless tongue those prisoned features that heart so freighted with unspoken troubles and that breast so oppressed with its piteous secret had been here  these dank walls had known the man whose dolorous story is a sealed book forever  there was fascination in the spot     chapter xii  we have come five hundred miles by rail through the heart of france what a bewitching land it is  what a garden  surely the leagues of bright green lawns are swept and brushed and watered every day and their grasses trimmed by the barber  surely the hedges are shaped and measured and their symmetry preserved by the most architectural of gardeners surely the long straight rows of stately poplars that divide the beautiful landscape like the squares of a checkerboard are set with line and plummet and their uniform height determined with a spirit level surely the straight smooth pure white turnpikes are jackplaned and sandpapered every day  how else are these marvels of symmetry cleanliness and order attained  it is wonderful  there are no unsightly stone walls and never a fence of any kind  there is no dirt no decay no rubbish anywherenothing that even hints at untidiness nothing that ever suggests neglect  all is orderly and beautifulevery thing is charming to the eye  we had such glimpses of the rhone gliding along between its grassy banks of cosy cottages buried in flowers and shrubbery of quaint old redtiled villages with mossy medieval cathedrals looming out of their midst of wooded hills with ivygrown towers and turrets of feudal castles projecting above the foliage such glimpses of paradise it seemed to us such visions of fabled fairyland  we knew then what the poet meant when he sang of  thy cornfields green and sunny vines  o pleasant land of france  and it is a pleasant land  no word describes it so felicitously as that one  they say there is no word for home in the french language  well considering that they have the article itself in such an attractive aspect they ought to manage to get along without the word  let us not waste too much pity on homeless france  i have observed that frenchmen abroad seldom wholly give up the idea of going back to france some time or other  i am not surprised at it now  we are not infatuated with these french railway cars though  we took firstclass passage not because we wished to attract attention by doing a thing which is uncommon in europe but because we could make our journey quicker by so doing  it is hard to make railroading pleasant in any country  it is too tedious  stagecoaching is infinitely more delightful  once i crossed the plains and deserts and mountains of the west in a stagecoach from the missouri line to california and since then all my pleasure trips must be measured to that rare holiday frolic two thousand miles of ceaseless rush and rattle and clatter by night and by day and never a weary moment never a lapse of interest  the first seven hundred miles a level continent its grassy carpet greener and softer and smoother than any sea and figured with designs fitted to its magnitudethe shadows of the clouds  here were no scenes but summer scenes and no disposition inspired by them but to lie at full length on the mail sacks in the grateful breeze and dreamily smoke the pipe of peacewhat other where all was repose and contentment  in cool mornings before the sun was fairly up it was worth a lifetime of city toiling and moiling to perch in the foretop with the driver and see the six mustangs scamper under the sharp snapping of the whip that never touched them to scan the blue distances of a world that knew no lords but us to cleave the wind with uncovered head and feel the sluggish pulses rousing to the spirit of a speed that pretended to the resistless rush of a typhoon  then thirteen hundred miles of desert solitudes of limitless panoramas of bewildering perspective of mimic cities of pinnacled cathedrals of massive fortresses counterfeited in the eternal rocks and splendid with the crimson and gold of the setting sun of dizzy altitudes among fogwreathed peaks and nevermelting snows where thunders and lightnings and tempests warred magnificently at our feet and the storm clouds above swung their shredded banners in our very faces but i forgot  i am in elegant france now and not scurrying through the great south pass and the wind river mountains among antelopes and buffaloes and painted indians on the warpath  it is not meet that i should make too disparaging comparisons between humdrum travel on a railway and that royal summer flight across a continent in a stagecoach i meant in the beginning to say that railway journeying is tedious and tiresome and so it isthough at the time i was thinking particularly of a dismal fiftyhour pilgrimage between new york and st louis  of course our trip through france was not really tedious because all its scenes and experiences were new and strange but as dan says it had its discrepancies  the cars are built in compartments that hold eight persons each  each compartment is partially subdivided and so there are two tolerably distinct parties of four in it  four face the other four  the seats and backs are thickly padded and cushioned and are very comfortable you can smoke if you wish there are no bothersome peddlers you are saved the infliction of a multitude of disagreeable fellow passengers  so far so well  but then the conductor locks you in when the train starts there is no water to drink in the car there is no heating apparatus for night travel if a drunken rowdy should get in you could not remove a matter of twenty seats from him or enter another car but above all if you are worn out and must sleep you must sit up and do it in naps with cramped legs and in a torturing misery that leaves you withered and lifeless the next dayfor behold they have not that culmination of all charity and human kindness a sleeping car in all france  i prefer the american system  it has not so many grievous discrepancies  in france all is clockwork all is order  they make no mistakes  every third man wears a uniform and whether he be a marshal of the empire or a brakeman he is ready and perfectly willing to answer all your questions with tireless politeness ready to tell you which car to take yea and ready to go and put you into it to make sure that you shall not go astray  you cannot pass into the waiting room of the depot till you have secured your ticket and you cannot pass from its only exit till the train is at its threshold to receive you  once on board the train will not start till your ticket has been examinedtill every passengers ticket has been inspected  this is chiefly for your own good  if by any possibility you have managed to take the wrong train you will be handed over to a polite official who will take you whither you belong and bestow you with many an affable bow  your ticket will be inspected every now and then along the route and when it is time to change cars you will know it  you are in the hands of officials who zealously study your welfare and your interest instead of turning their talents to the invention of new methods of discommoding and snubbing you as is very often the main employment of that exceedingly selfsatisfied monarch the railroad conductor of america  but the happiest regulation in french railway government isthirty minutes to dinner  no fiveminute boltings of flabby rolls muddy coffee questionable eggs guttapercha beef and pies whose conception and execution are a dark and bloody mystery to all save the cook that created them  no we sat calmly downit was in old dijon which is so easy to spell and so impossible to pronounce except when you civilize it and call it demijohnand poured out rich burgundian wines and munched calmly through a long table dhote bill of fare snail patties delicious fruits and all then paid the trifle it cost and stepped happily aboard the train again without once cursing the railroad company  a rare experience and one to be treasured forever  they say they do not have accidents on these french roads and i think it must be true  if i remember rightly we passed high above wagon roads or through tunnels under them but never crossed them on their own level about every quarter of a mile it seemed to me a man came out and held up a club till the train went by to signify that everything was safe ahead  switches were changed a mile in advance by pulling a wire rope that passed along the ground by the rail from station to station signals for the day and signals for the night gave constant and timely notice of the position of switches  no they have no railroad accidents to speak of in france  but why because when one occurs somebody has to hang for it  not hang maybe but be punished at least with such vigor of emphasis as to make negligence a thing to be shuddered at by railroad officials for many a day thereafter  no blame attached to the officersthat lying and disasterbreeding verdict so common to our softhearted juries is seldom rendered in france  if the trouble occurred in the conductors department that officer must suffer if his subordinate cannot be proven guilty if in the engineers department and the case be similar the engineer must answer  the old travelersthose delightful parrots who have been here before and know more about the country than louis napoleon knows now or ever will knowtell us these things and we believe them because they are pleasant things to believe and because they are plausible and savor of the rigid subjection to law and order which we behold about us everywhere  but we love the old travelers  we love to hear them prate and drivel and lie  we can tell them the moment we see them  they always throw out a few feelers they never cast themselves adrift till they have sounded every individual and know that he has not traveled  then they open their throttle valves and how they do brag and sneer and swell and soar and blaspheme the sacred name of truth  their central idea their grand aim is to subjugate you keep you down make you feel insignificant and humble in the blaze of their cosmopolitan glory  they will not let you know anything  they sneer at your most inoffensive suggestions they laugh unfeelingly at your treasured dreams of foreign lands they brand the statements of your traveled aunts and uncles as the stupidest absurdities they deride your most trusted authors and demolish the fair images they have set up for your willing worship with the pitiless ferocity of the fanatic iconoclast  but still i love the old travelers i love them for their witless platitudes for their supernatural ability to bore for their delightful asinine vanity for their luxuriant fertility of imagination for their startling their brilliant their overwhelming mendacity  by lyons and the saone where we saw the lady of lyons and thought little of her comeliness by villa franca tonnere venerable sens melun fontainebleau and scores of other beautiful cities we swept always noting the absence of hogwallows broken fences cow lots unpainted houses and mud and always noting as well the presence of cleanliness grace taste in adorning and beautifying even to the disposition of a tree or the turning of a hedge the marvel of roads in perfect repair void of ruts and guiltless of even an inequality of surfacewe bowled along hour after hour that brilliant summer day and as nightfall approached we entered a wilderness of odorous flowers and shrubbery sped through it and then excited delighted and half persuaded that we were only the sport of a beautiful dream lo we stood in magnificent paris  what excellent order they kept about that vast depot  there was no frantic crowding and jostling no shouting and swearing and no swaggering intrusion of services by rowdy hackmen  these latter gentry stood outsidestood quietly by their long line of vehicles and said never a word  a kind of hackman general seemed to have the whole matter of transportation in his hands  he politely received the passengers and ushered them to the kind of conveyance they wanted and told the driver where to deliver them  there was no talking back no dissatisfaction about overcharging no grumbling about anything  in a little while we were speeding through the streets of paris and delightfully recognizing certain names and places with which books had long ago made us familiar it was like meeting an old friend when we read rue de rivoli on the street corner we knew the genuine vast palace of the louvre as well as we knew its picture when we passed by the column of july we needed no one to tell us what it was or to remind us that on its site once stood the grim bastille that grave of human hopes and happiness that dismal prison house within whose dungeons so many young faces put on the wrinkles of age so many proud spirits grew humble so many brave hearts broke  we secured rooms at the hotel or rather we had three beds put into one room so that we might be together and then we went out to a restaurant just after lamplighting and ate a comfortable satisfactory lingering dinner  it was a pleasure to eat where everything was so tidy the food so well cooked the waiters so polite and the coming and departing company so moustached so frisky so affable so fearfully and wonderfully frenchy  all the surroundings were gay and enlivening  two hundred people sat at little tables on the sidewalk sipping wine and coffee the streets were thronged with light vehicles and with joyous pleasureseekers there was music in the air life and action all about us and a conflagration of gaslight everywhere  after dinner we felt like seeing such parisian specialties as we might see without distressing exertion and so we sauntered through the brilliant streets and looked at the dainty trifles in variety stores and jewelry shops  occasionally merely for the pleasure of being cruel we put unoffending frenchmen on the rack with questions framed in the incomprehensible jargon of their native language and while they writhed we impaled them we peppered them we scarified them with their own vile verbs and participles  we noticed that in the jewelry stores they had some of the articles marked gold and some labeled imitation  we wondered at this extravagance of honesty and inquired into the matter  we were informed that inasmuch as most people are not able to tell false gold from the genuine article the government compels jewelers to have their gold work assayed and stamped officially according to its fineness and their imitation work duly labeled with the sign of its falsity  they told us the jewelers would not dare to violate this law and that whatever a stranger bought in one of their stores might be depended upon as being strictly what it was represented to be  verily a wonderful land is france  then we hunted for a barbershop  from earliest infancy it had been a cherished ambition of mine to be shaved some day in a palatial barbershop in paris  i wished to recline at full length in a cushioned invalid chair with pictures about me and sumptuous furniture with frescoed walls and gilded arches above me and vistas of corinthian columns stretching far before me with perfumes of araby to intoxicate my senses and the slumbrous drone of distant noises to soothe me to sleep  at the end of an hour i would wake up regretfully and find my face as smooth and as soft as an infants  departing i would lift my hands above that barbers head and say heaven bless you my son  so we searched high and low for a matter of two hours but never a barbershop could we see  we saw only wigmaking establishments with shocks of dead and repulsive hair bound upon the heads of painted waxen brigands who stared out from glass boxes upon the passerby with their stony eyes and scared him with the ghostly white of their countenances we shunned these signs for a time but finally we concluded that the wigmakers must of necessity be the barbers as well since we could find no single legitimate representative of the fraternity  we entered and asked and found that it was even so  i said i wanted to be shaved  the barber inquired where my room was  i said never mind where my room was i wanted to be shavedthere on the spot  the doctor said he would be shaved also  then there was an excitement among those two barbers  there was a wild consultation and afterwards a hurrying to and fro and a feverish gathering up of razors from obscure places and a ransacking for soap  next they took us into a little mean shabby back room they got two ordinary sittingroom chairs and placed us in them with our coats on  my old old dream of bliss vanished into thin air  i sat bolt upright silent sad and solemn  one of the wigmaking villains lathered my face for ten terrible minutes and finished by plastering a mass of suds into my mouth  i expelled the nasty stuff with a strong english expletive and said foreigner beware  then this outlaw strapped his razor on his boot hovered over me ominously for six fearful seconds and then swooped down upon me like the genius of destruction  the first rake of his razor loosened the very hide from my face and lifted me out of the chair  i stormed and raved and the other boys enjoyed it  their beards are not strong and thick  let us draw the curtain over this harrowing scene  suffice it that i submitted and went through with the cruel infliction of a shave by a french barber tears of exquisite agony coursed down my cheeks now and then but i survived  then the incipient assassin held a basin of water under my chin and slopped its contents over my face and into my bosom and down the back of my neck with a mean pretense of washing away the soap and blood  he dried my features with a towel and was going to comb my hair but i asked to be excused  i said with withering irony that it was sufficient to be skinnedi declined to be scalped  i went away from there with my handkerchief about my face and never never never desired to dream of palatial parisian barbershops anymore the truth is as i believe i have since found out that they have no barber shops worthy of the name in parisand no barbers either for that matter  the impostor who does duty as a barber brings his pans and napkins and implements of torture to your residence and deliberately skins you in your private apartments  ah i have suffered suffered suffered here in paris but never mindthe time is coming when i shall have a dark and bloody revenge  someday a parisian barber will come to my room to skin me and from that day forth that barber will never be heard of more  at eleven oclock we alighted upon a sign which manifestly referred to billiards  joy  we had played billiards in the azores with balls that were not round and on an ancient table that was very little smoother than a brick pavementone of those wretched old things with dead cushions and with patches in the faded cloth and invisible obstructions that made the balls describe the most astonishing and unsuspected angles and perform feats in the way of unlookedfor and almost impossible scratches that were perfectly bewildering  we had played at gibraltar with balls the size of a walnut on a table like a public squareand in both instances we achieved far more aggravation than amusement  we expected to fare better here but we were mistaken  the cushions were a good deal higher than the balls and as the balls had a fashion of always stopping under the cushions we accomplished very little in the way of caroms  the cushions were hard and unelastic and the cues were so crooked that in making a shot you had to allow for the curve or you would infallibly put the english on the wrong side of the hall  dan was to mark while the doctor and i played  at the end of an hour neither of us had made a count and so dan was tired of keeping tally with nothing to tally and we were heated and angry and disgusted  we paid the heavy billabout six centsand said we would call around sometime when we had a week to spend and finish the game  we adjourned to one of those pretty cafes and took supper and tested the wines of the country as we had been instructed to do and found them harmless and unexciting  they might have been exciting however if we had chosen to drink a sufficiency of them  to close our first day in paris cheerfully and pleasantly we now sought our grand room in the grand hotel du louvre and climbed into our sumptuous bed to read and smokebut alas            it was pitiful           in a whole cityfull           gas we had none  no gas to read bynothing but dismal candles  it was a shame  we tried to map out excursions for the morrow we puzzled over french guides to paris we talked disjointedly in a vain endeavor to make head or tail of the wild chaos of the days sights and experiences we subsided to indolent smoking we gaped and yawned and stretchedthen feebly wondered if we were really and truly in renowned paris and drifted drowsily away into that vast mysterious void which men call sleep     chapter xiii  the next morning we were up and dressed at ten oclock  we went to the commissionaire of the hoteli dont know what a commissionaire is but that is the man we went toand told him we wanted a guide  he said the national exposition had drawn such multitudes of englishmen and americans to paris that it would be next to impossible to find a good guide unemployed  he said he usually kept a dozen or two on hand but he only had three now  he called them  one looked so like a very pirate that we let him go at once  the next one spoke with a simpering precision of pronunciation that was irritating and said  if ze zhentlemans will to me make ze grande honneur to me rattain in hees serveece i shall show to him every sing zat is magnifique to look upon in ze beautiful parree  i speaky ze angleesh pairfaitemaw  he would have done well to have stopped there because he had that much by heart and said it right off without making a mistake  but his selfcomplacency seduced him into attempting a flight into regions of unexplored english and the reckless experiment was his ruin  within ten seconds he was so tangled up in a maze of mutilated verbs and torn and bleeding forms of speech that no human ingenuity could ever have gotten him out of it with credit  it was plain enough that he could not speaky the english quite as pairfaitemaw as he had pretended he could  the third man captured us  he was plainly dressed but he had a noticeable air of neatness about him  he wore a high silk hat which was a little old but had been carefully brushed  he wore secondhand kid gloves in good repair and carried a small rattan cane with a curved handlea female legof ivory  he stepped as gently and as daintily as a cat crossing a muddy street and oh he was urbanity he was quiet unobtrusive selfpossession he was deference itself  he spoke softly and guardedly and when he was about to make a statement on his sole responsibility or offer a suggestion he weighed it by drachms and scruples first with the crook of his little stick placed meditatively to his teeth  his opening speech was perfect  it was perfect in construction in phraseology in grammar in emphasis in pronunciation everything  he spoke little and guardedly after that  we were charmed we were more than charmedwe were overjoyed  we hired him at once  we never even asked him his price  this manour lackey our servant our unquestioning slave though he waswas still a gentlemanwe could see thatwhile of the other two one was coarse and awkward and the other was a born pirate  we asked our man fridays name  he drew from his pocketbook a snowy little card and passed it to us with a profound bow                               a billfinger                     guide to paris france germany                             spain c c                        grande hotel du louvre  billfinger  oh carry me home to die  that was an aside from dan  the atrocious name grated harshly on my ear too  the most of us can learn to forgive and even to like a countenance that strikes us unpleasantly at first but few of us i fancy become reconciled to a jarring name so easily  i was almost sorry we had hired this man his name was so unbearable  however no matter we were impatient to start  billfinger stepped to the door to call a carriage and then the doctor said  well the guide goes with the barbershop with the billiardtable with the gasless room and may be with many another pretty romance of paris i expected to have a guide named henri de montmorency or armand de la chartreuse or something that would sound grand in letters to the villagers at home but to think of a frenchman by the name of billfinger oh  this is absurd you know  this will never do  we cant say billfinger it is nauseating  name him over again what had we better call him  alexis du caulaincourt  alphonse henri gustave de hauteville i suggested  call him ferguson said dan  that was practical unromantic good sense  without debate we expunged billfinger as billfinger and called him ferguson  the carriagean open barouchewas ready  ferguson mounted beside the driver and we whirled away to breakfast  as was proper mr ferguson stood by to transmit our orders and answer questions  by and by he mentioned casuallythe artful adventurerthat he would go and get his breakfast as soon as we had finished ours  he knew we could not get along without him and that we would not want to loiter about and wait for him  we asked him to sit down and eat with us  he begged with many a bow to be excused  it was not proper he said he would sit at another table  we ordered him peremptorily to sit down with us  here endeth the first lesson  it was a mistake  as long as we had that fellow after that he was always hungry he was always thirsty  he came early he stayed late he could not pass a restaurant he looked with a lecherous eye upon every wine shop suggestions to stop excuses to eat and to drink were forever on his lips  we tried all we could to fill him so full that he would have no room to spare for a fortnight but it was a failure  he did not hold enough to smother the cravings of his superhuman appetite  he had another discrepancy about him  he was always wanting us to buy things  on the shallowest pretenses he would inveigle us into shirt stores boot stores tailor shops glove shopsanywhere under the broad sweep of the heavens that there seemed a chance of our buying anything anyone could have guessed that the shopkeepers paid him a percentage on the sales but in our blessed innocence we didnt until this feature of his conduct grew unbearably prominent  one day dan happened to mention that he thought of buying three or four silk dress patterns for presents fergusons hungry eye was upon him in an instant  in the course of twenty minutes the carriage stopped  whats this  zis is ze finest silk magazin in parisze most celebrate  what did you come here for  we told you to take us to the palace of the louvre  i suppose ze gentleman say he wish to buy some silk  you are not required to suppose things for the party ferguson  we do not wish to tax your energies too much  we will bear some of the burden and heat of the day ourselves  we will endeavor to do such supposing as is really necessary to be done  drive on  so spake the doctor  within fifteen minutes the carriage halted again and before another silk store  the doctor said  ah the palace of the louvrebeautiful beautiful edifice  does the emperor napoleon live here now ferguson  ah doctor  you do jest zis is not ze palace we come there directly but since we pass right by zis store where is such beautiful silk  ah  i see i see  i meant to have told you that we did not wish to purchase any silks today but in my absentmindedness i forgot it  i also meant to tell you we wished to go directly to the louvre but i forgot that also  however we will go there now  pardon my seeming carelessness ferguson  drive on  within the half hour we stopped againin front of another silk store we were angry but the doctor was always serene always smoothvoiced he said  at last  how imposing the louvre is and yet how small  how exquisitely fashioned  how charmingly situatedvenerable venerable pile  pairdon doctor zis is not ze louvreit is  what is it  i have ze ideait come to me in a momentzat ze silk in zis magazin  ferguson how heedless i am  i fully intended to tell you that we did not wish to buy any silks today and i also intended to tell you that we yearned to go immediately to the palace of the louvre but enjoying the happiness of seeing you devour four breakfasts this morning has so filled me with pleasurable emotions that i neglect the commonest interests of the time  however we will proceed now to the louvre ferguson  but doctor excitedly it will take not a minutenot but one small minute  ze gentleman need not to buy if he not wish tobut only look at ze silklook at ze beautiful fabric  then pleadingly sairjust only one leetle moment  dan said confound the idiot  i dont want to see any silks today and i wont look at them  drive on  and the doctor we need no silks now ferguson  our hearts yearn for the louvre  let us journey onlet us journey on  but doctor  it is only one momentone leetle moment  and ze time will be saveentirely save  because zere is nothing to see nowit is too late  it want ten minute to four and ze louvre close at fouronly one leetle moment doctor  the treacherous miscreant  after four breakfasts and a gallon of champagne to serve us such a scurvy trick  we got no sight of the countless treasures of art in the louvre galleries that day and our only poor little satisfaction was in the reflection that ferguson sold not a solitary silk dress pattern  i am writing this chapter partly for the satisfaction of abusing that accomplished knave billfinger and partly to show whosoever shall read this how americans fare at the hands of the paris guides and what sort of people paris guides are  it need not be supposed that we were a stupider or an easier prey than our countrymen generally are for we were not the guides deceive and defraud every american who goes to paris for the first time and sees its sights alone or in company with others as little experienced as himself  i shall visit paris again someday and then let the guides beware  i shall go in my war painti shall carry my tomahawk along  i think we have lost but little time in paris  we have gone to bed every night tired out  of course we visited the renowned international exposition  all the world did that  we went there on our third day in parisand we stayed there nearly two hours  that was our first and last visit  to tell the truth we saw at a glance that one would have to spend weeksyea even monthsin that monstrous establishment to get an intelligible idea of it  it was a wonderful show but the moving masses of people of all nations we saw there were a still more wonderful show i discovered that if i were to stay there a month i should still find myself looking at the people instead of the inanimate objects on exhibition  i got a little interested in some curious old tapestries of the thirteenth century but a party of arabs came by and their dusky faces and quaint costumes called my attention away at once  i watched a silver swan which had a living grace about his movements and a living intelligence in his eyeswatched him swimming about as comfortably and as unconcernedly as if he had been born in a morass instead of a jewelers shopwatched him seize a silver fish from under the water and hold up his head and go through all the customary and elaborate motions of swallowing itbut the moment it disappeared down his throat some tattooed south sea islanders approached and i yielded to their attractions  presently i found a revolving pistol several hundred years old which looked strangely like a modern colt but just then i heard that the empress of the french was in another part of the building and hastened away to see what she might look like  we heard martial musicwe saw an unusual number of soldiers walking hurriedly aboutthere was a general movement among the people  we inquired what it was all about and learned that the emperor of the french and the sultan of turkey were about to review twentyfive thousand troops at the arc de letoile  we immediately departed  i had a greater anxiety to see these men than i could have had to see twenty expositions  we drove away and took up a position in an open space opposite the american ministers house  a speculator bridged a couple of barrels with a board and we hired standing places on it  presently there was a sound of distant music in another minute a pillar of dust came moving slowly toward us a moment more and then with colors flying and a grand crash of military music a gallant array of cavalrymen emerged from the dust and came down the street on a gentle trot  after them came a long line of artillery then more cavalry in splendid uniforms and then their imperial majesties napoleon iii and abdul aziz  the vast concourse of people swung their hats and shoutedthe windows and housetops in the wide vicinity burst into a snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs and the wavers of the same mingled their cheers with those of the masses below it was a stirring spectacle  but the two central figures claimed all my attention  was ever such a contrast set up before a multitude till then  napoleon in military uniforma longbodied shortlegged man fiercely moustached old wrinkled with eyes half closed and such a deep crafty scheming expression about themnapoleon bowing ever so gently to the loud plaudits and watching everything and everybody with his cat eyes from under his depressed hat brim as if to discover any sign that those cheers were not heartfelt and cordial  abdul aziz absolute lord of the ottoman empireclad in dark green european clothes almost without ornament or insignia of rank a red turkish fez on his head a short stout dark man blackbearded blackeyed stupid unprepossessinga man whose whole appearance somehow suggested that if he only had a cleaver in his hand and a white apron on one would not be at all surprised to hear him say a mutton roast today or will you have a nice porterhouse steak  napoleon iii the representative of the highest modern civilization progress and refinement abdulaziz the representative of a people by nature and training filthy brutish ignorant unprogressive superstitiousand a government whose three graces are tyranny rapacity blood  here in brilliant paris under this majestic arch of triumph the first century greets the nineteenth  napoleon iii emperor of france  surrounded by shouting thousands by military pomp by the splendors of his capital city and companioned by kings and princesthis is the man who was sneered at and reviled and called bastardyet who was dreaming of a crown and an empire all the while who was driven into exilebut carried his dreams with him who associated with the common herd in america and ran foot races for a wagerbut still sat upon a throne in fancy who braved every danger to go to his dying motherand grieved that she could not be spared to see him cast aside his plebeian vestments for the purple of royalty who kept his faithful watch and walked his weary beat a common policeman of londonbut dreamed the while of a coming night when he should tread the longdrawn corridors of the tuileries who made the miserable fiasco of strasbourg saw his poor shabby eagle forgetful of its lesson refuse to perch upon his shoulder delivered his carefully prepared sententious burst of eloquence upon unsympathetic ears found himself a prisoner the butt of small wits a mark for the pitiless ridicule of all the world yet went on dreaming of coronations and splendid pageants as before who lay a forgotten captive in the dungeons of hamand still schemed and planned and pondered over future glory and future power president of france at last a coup detat and surrounded by applauding armies welcomed by the thunders of cannon he mounts a throne and waves before an astounded world the sceptre of a mighty empire  who talks of the marvels of fiction  who speaks of the wonders of romance  who prates of the tame achievements of aladdin and the magii of arabia  abdulaziz sultan of turkey lord of the ottoman empire  born to a throne weak stupid ignorant almost as his meanest slave chief of a vast royalty yet the puppet of his premier and the obedient child of a tyrannical mother a man who sits upon a thronethe beck of whose finger moves navies and armieswho holds in his hands the power of life and death over millionsyet who sleeps sleeps eats eats idles with his eight hundred concubines and when he is surfeited with eating and sleeping and idling and would rouse up and take the reins of government and threaten to be a sultan is charmed from his purpose by wary fuad pacha with a pretty plan for a new palace or a new shipcharmed away with a new toy like any other restless child a man who sees his people robbed and oppressed by soulless taxgatherers but speaks no word to save them who believes in gnomes and genii and the wild fables of the arabian nights but has small regard for the mighty magicians of today and is nervous in the presence of their mysterious railroads and steamboats and telegraphs who would see undone in egypt all that great mehemet ali achieved and would prefer rather to forget than emulate him a man who found his great empire a blot upon the eartha degraded povertystricken miserable infamous agglomeration of ignorance crime and brutalityand will idle away the allotted days of his trivial life and then pass to the dust and the worms and leave it so  napoleon has augmented the commercial prosperity of france in ten years to such a degree that figures can hardly compute it  he has rebuilt paris and has partly rebuilt every city in the state  he condemns a whole street at a time assesses the damages pays them and rebuilds superbly  then speculators buy up the ground and sell but the original owner is given the first choice by the government at a stated price before the speculator is permitted to purchase  but above all things he has taken the sole control of the empire of france into his hands and made it a tolerably free landfor people who will not attempt to go too far in meddling with government affairs  no country offers greater security to life and property than france and one has all the freedom he wants but no licenseno license to interfere with anybody or make anyone uncomfortable  as for the sultan one could set a trap any where and catch a dozen abler men in a night  the bands struck up and the brilliant adventurer napoleon iii the genius of energy persistence enterprise and the feeble abdulaziz the genius of ignorance bigotry and indolence prepared for the forward march  we saw the splendid review we saw the whitemoustached old crimean soldier canrobert marshal of france we sawwell we saw every thing and then we went home satisfied     chapter xiv  we went to see the cathedral of notre dame  we had heard of it before it surprises me sometimes to think how much we do know and how intelligent we are  we recognized the brown old gothic pile in a moment it was like the pictures  we stood at a little distance and changed from one point of observation to another and gazed long at its lofty square towers and its rich front clustered thick with stony mutilated saints who had been looking calmly down from their perches for ages  the patriarch of jerusalem stood under them in the old days of chivalry and romance and preached the third crusade more than six hundred years ago and since that day they have stood there and looked quietly down upon the most thrilling scenes the grandest pageants the most extraordinary spectacles that have grieved or delighted paris  these battered and brokennosed old fellows saw many and many a cavalcade of mailclad knights come marching home from holy land they heard the bells above them toll the signal for the st bartholomews massacre and they saw the slaughter that followed later they saw the reign of terror the carnage of the revolution the overthrow of a king the coronation of two napoleons the christening of the young prince that lords it over a regiment of servants in the tuileries todayand they may possibly continue to stand there until they see the napoleon dynasty swept away and the banners of a great republic floating above its ruins  i wish these old parties could speak  they could tell a tale worth the listening to  they say that a pagan temple stood where notre dame now stands in the old roman days eighteen or twenty centuries agoremains of it are still preserved in paris and that a christian church took its place about ad 300 another took the place of that in ad 500 and that the foundations of the present cathedral were laid about ad 1100  the ground ought to be measurably sacred by this time one would think  one portion of this noble old edifice is suggestive of the quaint fashions of ancient times it was built by jean sanspeur duke of burgundy to set his conscience at resthe had assassinated the duke of orleans  alas  those good old times are gone when a murderer could wipe the stain from his name and soothe his troubles to sleep simply by getting out his bricks and mortar and building an addition to a church  the portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars they took the central one away in 1852 on the occasion of thanksgivings for the reinstitution of the presidential powerbut precious soon they had occasion to reconsider that motion and put it back again  and they did  we loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two staring up at the rich stainedglass windows embellished with blue and yellow and crimson saints and martyrs and trying to admire the numberless great pictures in the chapels and then we were admitted to the sacristy and shown the magnificent robes which the pope wore when he crowned napoleon i a wagonload of solid gold and silver utensils used in the great public processions and ceremonies of the church some nails of the true cross a fragment of the cross itself a part of the crown of thorns we had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a church in the azores but no nails  they showed us likewise the bloody robe which that archbishop of paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved the wrath of the insurgents of 1848 to mount the barricades and hold aloft the olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter  his noble effort cost him his life  he was shot dead  they showed us a cast of his face taken after death the bullet that killed him and the two vertebrae in which it lodged  these people have a somewhat singular taste in the matter of relics  ferguson told us that the silver cross which the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown into the seine where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years and then an angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it he did dive for it and got it and now it is there on exhibition at notre dame to be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in inanimate objects of miraculous intervention  next we went to visit the morgue that horrible receptacle for the dead who die mysteriously and leave the manner of their taking off a dismal secret  we stood before a grating and looked through into a room which was hung all about with the clothing of dead men coarse blouses watersoaked the delicate garments of women and children patrician vestments hacked and stabbed and stained with red a hat that was crushed and bloody  on a slanting stone lay a drowned man naked swollen purple clasping the fragment of a broken bush with a grip which death had so petrified that human strength could not unloose it mute witness of the last despairing effort to save the life that was doomed beyond all help a stream of water trickled ceaselessly over the hideous face  we knew that the body and the clothing were there for identification by friends but still we wondered if anybody could love that repulsive object or grieve for its loss  we grew meditative and wondered if some forty years ago when the mother of that ghastly thing was dandling it upon her knee and kissing it and petting it and displaying it with satisfied pride to the passersby a prophetic vision of this dread ending ever flitted through her brain  i half feared that the mother or the wife or a brother of the dead man might come while we stood there but nothing of the kind occurred  men and women came and some looked eagerly in and pressed their faces against the bars others glanced carelessly at the body and turned away with a disappointed look people i thought who live upon strong excitements and who attend the exhibitions of the morgue regularly just as other people go to see theatrical spectacles every night  when one of these looked in and passed on i could not help thinking  now this dont afford you any satisfactiona party with his head shot off is what you need  one night we went to the celebrated jardin mabille but only staid a little while  we wanted to see some of this kind of paris life however and therefore the next night we went to a similar place of entertainment in a great garden in the suburb of asnieres  we went to the railroad depot toward evening and ferguson got tickets for a secondclass carriage  such a perfect jam of people i have not often seenbut there was no noise no disorder no rowdyism  some of the women and young girls that entered the train we knew to be of the demimonde but others we were not at all sure about  the girls and women in our carriage behaved themselves modestly and becomingly all the way out except that they smoked  when we arrived at the garden in asnieres we paid a franc or two admission and entered a place which had flower beds in it and grass plots and long curving rows of ornamental shrubbery with here and there a secluded bower convenient for eating ice cream in  we moved along the sinuous gravel walks with the great concourse of girls and young men and suddenly a domed and filigreed white temple starred over and over and over again with brilliant gas jets burst upon us like a fallen sun  nearby was a large handsome house with its ample front illuminated in the same way and above its roof floated the starspangled banner of america  well i said  how is this  it nearly took my breath away  ferguson said an americana new yorkerkept the place and was carrying on quite a stirring opposition to the jardin mabille  crowds composed of both sexes and nearly all ages were frisking about the garden or sitting in the open air in front of the flagstaff and the temple drinking wine and coffee or smoking  the dancing had not begun yet  ferguson said there was to be an exhibition  the famous blondin was going to perform on a tightrope in another part of the garden  we went thither  here the light was dim and the masses of people were pretty closely packed together  and now i made a mistake which any donkey might make but a sensible man never  i committed an error which i find myself repeating every day of my life  standing right before a young lady i said  dan just look at this girl how beautiful she is  i thank you more for the evident sincerity of the compliment sir than for the extraordinary publicity you have given to it  this in good pure english  we took a walk but my spirits were very very sadly dampened  i did not feel right comfortable for some time afterward  why will people be so stupid as to suppose themselves the only foreigners among a crowd of ten thousand persons  but blondin came out shortly  he appeared on a stretched cable far away above the sea of tossing hats and handkerchiefs and in the glare of the hundreds of rockets that whizzed heavenward by him he looked like a wee insect  he balanced his pole and walked the length of his ropetwo or three hundred feet he came back and got a man and carried him across he returned to the center and danced a jig next he performed some gymnastic and balancing feats too perilous to afford a pleasant spectacle and he finished by fastening to his person a thousand roman candles catherine wheels serpents and rockets of all manner of brilliant colors setting them on fire all at once and walking and waltzing across his rope again in a blinding blaze of glory that lit up the garden and the peoples faces like a great conflagration at midnight  the dance had begun and we adjourned to the temple  within it was a drinking saloon and all around it was a broad circular platform for the dancers  i backed up against the wall of the temple and waited  twenty sets formed the music struck up and theni placed my hands before my face for very shame  but i looked through my fingers  they were dancing the renowned cancan  a handsome girl in the set before me tripped forward lightly to meet the opposite gentleman tripped back again grasped her dresses vigorously on both sides with her hands raised them pretty high danced an extraordinary jig that had more activity and exposure about it than any jig i ever saw before and then drawing her clothes still higher she advanced gaily to the center and launched a vicious kick full at her visavis that must infallibly have removed his nose if he had been seven feet high  it was a mercy he was only six  that is the cancan  the idea of it is to dance as wildly as noisily as furiously as you can expose yourself as much as possible if you are a woman and kick as high as you can no matter which sex you belong to there is no word of exaggeration in this  any of the staid respectable aged people who were there that night can testify to the truth of that statement  there were a good many such people present  i suppose french morality is not of that straightlaced description which is shocked at trifles  i moved aside and took a general view of the cancan  shouts laughter furious music a bewildering chaos of darting and intermingling forms stormy jerking and snatching of gay dresses bobbing beads flying arms lightning flashes of whitestockinged calves and dainty slippers in the air and then a grand final rush riot a terrific hubbub and a wild stampede  heavens  nothing like it has been seen on earth since trembling tam oshanter saw the devil and the witches at their orgies that stormy night in alloways auld haunted kirk  we visited the louvre at a time when we had no silk purchases in view and looked at its miles of paintings by the old masters  some of them were beautiful but at the same time they carried such evidences about them of the cringing spirit of those great men that we found small pleasure in examining them  their nauseous adulation of princely patrons was more prominent to me and chained my attention more surely than the charms of color and expression which are claimed to be in the pictures gratitude for kindnesses is well but it seems to me that some of those artists carried it so far that it ceased to be gratitude and became worship  if there is a plausible excuse for the worship of men then by all means let us forgive rubens and his brethren  but i will drop the subject lest i say something about the old masters that might as well be left unsaid  of course we drove in the bois de boulogne that limitless park with its forests its lakes its cascades and its broad avenues  there were thousands upon thousands of vehicles abroad and the scene was full of life and gaiety  there were very common hacks with father and mother and all the children in them conspicuous little open carriages with celebrated ladies of questionable reputation in them there were dukes and duchesses abroad with gorgeous footmen perched behind and equally gorgeous outriders perched on each of the six horses there were blue and silver and green and gold and pink and black and all sorts and descriptions of stunning and startling liveries out and i almost yearned to be a flunkey myself for the sake of the fine clothes  but presently the emperor came along and he outshone them all  he was preceded by a bodyguard of gentlemen on horseback in showy uniforms his carriagehorses there appeared to be somewhere in the remote neighborhood of a thousand of them were bestridden by gallantlooking fellows also in stylish uniforms and after the carriage followed another detachment of bodyguards  everybody got out of the way everybody bowed to the emperor and his friend the sultan and they went by on a swinging trot and disappeared  i will not describe the bois de boulogne  i can not do it  it is simply a beautiful cultivated endless wonderful wilderness  it is an enchanting place  it is in paris now one may say but a crumbling old cross in one portion of it reminds one that it was not always so  the cross marks the spot where a celebrated troubadour was waylaid and murdered in the fourteenth century  it was in this park that that fellow with an unpronounceable name made the attempt upon the russian czars life last spring with a pistol  the bullet struck a tree  ferguson showed us the place  now in america that interesting tree would be chopped down or forgotten within the next five years but it will be treasured here  the guides will point it out to visitors for the next eight hundred years and when it decays and falls down they will put up another there and go on with the same old story just the same     chapter xv  one of our pleasantest visits was to pere la chaise the national buryingground of france the honored restingplace of some of her greatest and best children the last home of scores of illustrious men and women who were born to no titles but achieved fame by their own energy and their own genius  it is a solemn city of winding streets and of miniature marble temples and mansions of the dead gleaming white from out a wilderness of foliage and fresh flowers  not every city is so well peopled as this or has so ample an area within its walls  few palaces exist in any city that are so exquisite in design so rich in art so costly in material so graceful so beautiful  we had stood in the ancient church of st denis where the marble effigies of thirty generations of kings and queens lay stretched at length upon the tombs and the sensations invoked were startling and novel the curious armor the obsolete costumes the placid faces the hands placed palm to palm in eloquent supplicationit was a vision of gray antiquity  it seemed curious enough to be standing face to face as it were with old dagobert i and clovis and charlemagne those vague colossal heroes those shadows those myths of a thousand years ago  i touched their dustcovered faces with my finger but dagobert was deader than the sixteen centuries that have passed over him clovis slept well after his labor for christ and old charlemagne went on dreaming of his paladins of bloody roncesvalles and gave no heed to me  the great names of pere la chaise impress one too but differently there the suggestion brought constantly to his mind is that this place is sacred to a nobler royaltythe royalty of heart and brain  every faculty of mind every noble trait of human nature every high occupation which men engage in seems represented by a famous name  the effect is a curious medley  davoust and massena who wrought in many a battle tragedy are here and so also is rachel of equal renown in mimic tragedy on the stage  the abbe sicard sleeps herethe first great teacher of the deaf and dumba man whose heart went out to every unfortunate and whose life was given to kindly offices in their service and not far off in repose and peace at last lies marshal ney whose stormy spirit knew no music like the bugle call to arms  the man who originated public gaslighting and that other benefactor who introduced the cultivation of the potato and thus blessed millions of his starving countrymen lie with the prince of masserano and with exiled queens and princes of further india  gaylussac the chemist laplace the astronomer larrey the surgeon de suze the advocate are here and with them are talma bellini rubini de balzac beaumarchais beranger moliere and lafontaine and scores of other men whose names and whose worthy labors are as familiar in the remote byplaces of civilization as are the historic deeds of the kings and princes that sleep in the marble vaults of st denis  but among the thousands and thousands of tombs in pere la chaise there is one that no man no woman no youth of either sex ever passes by without stopping to examine  every visitor has a sort of indistinct idea of the history of its dead and comprehends that homage is due there but not one in twenty thousand clearly remembers the story of that tomb and its romantic occupants  this is the grave of abelard and heloisea grave which has been more revered more widely known more written and sung about and wept over for seven hundred years than any other in christendom save only that of the saviour  all visitors linger pensively about it all young people capture and carry away keepsakes and mementoes of it all parisian youths and maidens who are disappointed in love come there to bail out when they are full of tears yea many stricken lovers make pilgrimages to this shrine from distant provinces to weep and wail and grit their teeth over their heavy sorrows and to purchase the sympathies of the chastened spirits of that tomb with offerings of immortelles and budding flowers  go when you will you find somebody snuffling over that tomb  go when you will you find it furnished with those bouquets and immortelles  go when you will you find a graveltrain from marseilles arriving to supply the deficiencies caused by mementocabbaging vandals whose affections have miscarried  yet who really knows the story of abelard and heloise  precious few people  the names are perfectly familiar to every body and that is about all  with infinite pains i have acquired a knowledge of that history and i propose to narrate it here partly for the honest information of the public and partly to show that public that they have been wasting a good deal of marketable sentiment very unnecessarily                          story of abelard and heloise  heloise was born seven hundred and sixtysix years ago  she may have had parents  there is no telling  she lived with her uncle fulbert a canon of the cathedral of paris  i do not know what a canon of a cathedral is but that is what he was  he was nothing more than a sort of a mountain howitzer likely because they had no heavy artillery in those days suffice it then that heloise lived with her uncle the howitzer and was happy  she spent the most of her childhood in the convent of argenteuil never heard of argenteuil before but suppose there was really such a place  she then returned to her uncle the old gun or son of a gun as the case may be and he taught her to write and speak latin which was the language of literature and polite society at that period  just at this time pierre abelard who had already made himself widely famous as a rhetorician came to found a school of rhetoric in paris the originality of his principles his eloquence and his great physical strength and beauty created a profound sensation  he saw heloise and was captivated by her blooming youth her beauty and her charming disposition  he wrote to her she answered  he wrote again she answered again  he was now in love  he longed to know herto speak to her face to face  his school was near fulberts house  he asked fulbert to allow him to call  the good old swivel saw here a rare opportunity his niece whom he so much loved would absorb knowledge from this man and it would not cost him a cent  such was fulbertpenurious  fulberts first name is not mentioned by any author which is unfortunate  however george w fulbert will answer for him as well as any other  we will let him go at that  he asked abelard to teach her  abelard was glad enough of the opportunity  he came often and staid long  a letter of his shows in its very first sentence that he came under that friendly roof like a coldhearted villain as he was with the deliberate intention of debauching a confiding innocent girl  this is the letter            i cannot cease to be astonished at the simplicity of fulbert           i was as much surprised as if he had placed a lamb in the power           of a hungry wolf  heloise and i under pretext of study gave           ourselves up wholly to love and the solitude that love seeks           our studies procured for us  books were open before us but we           spoke oftener of love than philosophy and kisses came more           readily from our lips than words  and so exulting over an honorable confidence which to his degraded instinct was a ludicrous simplicity this unmanly abelard seduced the niece of the man whose guest he was  paris found it out  fulbert was told of ittold oftenbut refused to believe it  he could not comprehend how a man could be so depraved as to use the sacred protection and security of hospitality as a means for the commission of such a crime as that  but when he heard the rowdies in the streets singing the lovesongs of abelard to heloise the case was too plainlovesongs come not properly within the teachings of rhetoric and philosophy  he drove abelard from his house  abelard returned secretly and carried heloise away to palais in brittany his native country  here shortly afterward she bore a son who from his rare beauty was surnamed astrolabewilliam g  the girls flight enraged fulbert and he longed for vengeance but feared to strike lest retaliation visit heloisefor he still loved her tenderly  at length abelard offered to marry heloise but on a shameful condition that the marriage should be kept secret from the world to the end that while her good name remained a wreck as before his priestly reputation might be kept untarnished  it was like that miscreant  fulbert saw his opportunity and consented  he would see the parties married and then violate the confidence of the man who had taught him that trick he would divulge the secret and so remove somewhat of the obloquy that attached to his nieces fame  but the niece suspected his scheme  she refused the marriage at first she said fulbert would betray the secret to save her and besides she did not wish to drag down a lover who was so gifted so honored by the world and who had such a splendid career before him  it was noble selfsacrificing love and characteristic of the puresouled heloise but it was not good sense  but she was overruled and the private marriage took place  now for fulbert  the heart so wounded should be healed at last the proud spirit so tortured should find rest again the humbled head should be lifted up once more  he proclaimed the marriage in the high places of the city and rejoiced that dishonor had departed from his house  but lo  abelard denied the marriage  heloise denied it  the people knowing the former circumstances might have believed fulbert had only abelard denied it but when the person chiefly interestedthe girl herselfdenied it they laughed despairing fulbert to scorn  the poor canon of the cathedral of paris was spiked again  the last hope of repairing the wrong that had been done his house was gone  what next human nature suggested revenge  he compassed it  the historian says            ruffians hired by fulbert fell upon abelard by night and           inflicted upon him a terrible and nameless mutilation  i am seeking the last resting place of those ruffians  when i find it i shall shed some tears on it and stack up some bouquets and immortelles and cart away from it some gravel whereby to remember that howsoever blotted by crime their lives may have been these ruffians did one just deed at any rate albeit it was not warranted by the strict letter of the law  heloise entered a convent and gave goodbye to the world and its pleasures for all time  for twelve years she never heard of abelard never even heard his name mentioned  she had become prioress of argenteuil and led a life of complete seclusion  she happened one day to see a letter written by him in which he narrated his own history  she cried over it and wrote him  he answered addressing her as his sister in christ  they continued to correspond she in the unweighed language of unwavering affection he in the chilly phraseology of the polished rhetorician  she poured out her heart in passionate disjointed sentences he replied with finished essays divided deliberately into heads and subheads premises and argument  she showered upon him the tenderest epithets that love could devise he addressed her from the north pole of his frozen heart as the spouse of christ  the abandoned villain  on account of her too easy government of her nuns some disreputable irregularities were discovered among them and the abbot of st denis broke up her establishment  abelard was the official head of the monastery of st gildas de ruys at that time and when he heard of her homeless condition a sentiment of pity was aroused in his breast it is a wonder the unfamiliar emotion did not blow his head off and he placed her and her troop in the little oratory of the paraclete a religious establishment which he had founded  she had many privations and sufferings to undergo at first but her worth and her gentle disposition won influential friends for her and she built up a wealthy and flourishing nunnery  she became a great favorite with the heads of the church and also the people though she seldom appeared in public  she rapidly advanced in esteem in good report and in usefulness and abelard as rapidly lost ground  the pope so honored her that he made her the head of her order  abelard a man of splendid talents and ranking as the first debater of his time became timid irresolute and distrustful of his powers  he only needed a great misfortune to topple him from the high position he held in the world of intellectual excellence and it came  urged by kings and princes to meet the subtle st bernard in debate and crush him he stood up in the presence of a royal and illustrious assemblage and when his antagonist had finished he looked about him and stammered a commencement but his courage failed him the cunning of his tongue was gone with his speech unspoken he trembled and sat down a disgraced and vanquished champion  he died a nobody and was buried at cluny ad 1144  they removed his body to the paraclete afterward and when heloise died twenty years later they buried her with him in accordance with her last wish  he died at the ripe age of 64 and she at 63  after the bodies had remained entombed three hundred years they were removed once more  they were removed again in 1800 and finally seventeen years afterward they were taken up and transferred to pere la chaise where they will remain in peace and quiet until it comes time for them to get up and move again  history is silent concerning the last acts of the mountain howitzer  let the world say what it will about him i at least shall always respect the memory and sorrow for the abused trust and the broken heart and the troubled spirit of the old smoothbore  rest and repose be his  such is the story of abelard and heloise  such is the history that lamartine has shed such cataracts of tears over  but that man never could come within the influence of a subject in the least pathetic without overflowing his banks  he ought to be dammedor leveed i should more properly say  such is the historynot as it is usually told but as it is when stripped of the nauseous sentimentality that would enshrine for our loving worship a dastardly seducer like pierre abelard  i have not a word to say against the misused faithful girl and would not withhold from her grave a single one of those simple tributes which blighted youths and maidens offer to her memory but i am sorry enough that i have not time and opportunity to write four or five volumes of my opinion of her friend the founder of the parachute or the paraclete or whatever it was  the tons of sentiment i have wasted on that unprincipled humbug in my ignorance  i shall throttle down my emotions hereafter about this sort of people until i have read them up and know whether they are entitled to any tearful attentions or not  i wish i had my immortelles back now and that bunch of radishes  in paris we often saw in shop windows the sign english spoken here just as one sees in the windows at home the sign ici on parle francaise  we always invaded these places at onceand invariably received the information framed in faultless french that the clerk who did the english for the establishment had just gone to dinner and would be back in an hourwould monsieur buy something  we wondered why those parties happened to take their dinners at such erratic and extraordinary hours for we never called at a time when an exemplary christian would be in the least likely to be abroad on such an errand  the truth was it was a base frauda snare to trap the unwarychaff to catch fledglings with  they had no englishmurdering clerk  they trusted to the sign to inveigle foreigners into their lairs and trusted to their own blandishments to keep them there till they bought something  we ferreted out another french impositiona frequent sign to this effect all manner of american drinks artistically prepared here  we procured the services of a gentleman experienced in the nomenclature of the american bar and moved upon the works of one of these impostors  a bowing aproned frenchman skipped forward and said  que voulez les messieurs  i do not know what que voulez les messieurs  means but such was his remark  our general said we will take a whiskey straight  a stare from the frenchman  well if you dont know what that is give us a champagne cocktail  a stare and a shrug  well then give us a sherry cobbler  the frenchman was checkmated  this was all greek to him  give us a brandy smash  the frenchman began to back away suspicious of the ominous vigor of the last orderbegan to back away shrugging his shoulders and spreading his hands apologetically  the general followed him up and gained a complete victory  the uneducated foreigner could not even furnish a santa cruz punch an eyeopener a stonefence or an earthquake  it was plain that he was a wicked impostor  an acquaintance of mine said the other day that he was doubtless the only american visitor to the exposition who had had the high honor of being escorted by the emperors bodyguard  i said with unobtrusive frankness that i was astonished that such a longlegged lanternjawed unprepossessinglooking specter as he should be singled out for a distinction like that and asked how it came about  he said he had attended a great military review in the champ de mars some time ago and while the multitude about him was growing thicker and thicker every moment he observed an open space inside the railing  he left his carriage and went into it  he was the only person there and so he had plenty of room and the situation being central he could see all the preparations going on about the field  by and by there was a sound of music and soon the emperor of the french and the emperor of austria escorted by the famous cent gardes entered the enclosure  they seemed not to observe him but directly in response to a sign from the commander of the guard a young lieutenant came toward him with a file of his men following halted raised his hand and gave the military salute and then said in a low voice that he was sorry to have to disturb a stranger and a gentleman but the place was sacred to royalty  then this new jersey phantom rose up and bowed and begged pardon then with the officer beside him the file of men marching behind him and with every mark of respect he was escorted to his carriage by the imperial cent gardes  the officer saluted again and fell back the new jersey sprite bowed in return and had presence of mind enough to pretend that he had simply called on a matter of private business with those emperors and so waved them an adieu and drove from the field  imagine a poor frenchman ignorantly intruding upon a public rostrum sacred to some sixpenny dignitary in america  the police would scare him to death first with a storm of their elegant blasphemy and then pull him to pieces getting him away from there  we are measurably superior to the french in some things but they are immeasurably our betters in others  enough of paris for the present  we have done our whole duty by it  we have seen the tuileries the napoleon column the madeleine that wonder of wonders the tomb of napoleon all the great churches and museums libraries imperial palaces and sculpture and picture galleries the pantheon jardin des plantes the opera the circus the legislative body the billiard rooms the barbers the grisettes  ah the grisettes  i had almost forgotten  they are another romantic fraud  they were if you let the books of travel tell it always so beautifulso neat and trim so gracefulso naive and trustingso gentle so winningso faithful to their shop duties so irresistible to buyers in their prattling importunityso devoted to their povertystricken students of the latin quarterso lighthearted and happy on their sunday picnics in the suburbsand oh so charmingly so delightfully immoral  stuff  for three or four days i was constantly saying  quick ferguson  is that a grisette  and he always said no  he comprehended at last that i wanted to see a grisette  then he showed me dozens of them  they were like nearly all the frenchwomen i ever saw homely  they had large hands large feet large mouths they had pug noses as a general thing and moustaches that not even good breeding could overlook they combed their hair straight back without parting they were illshaped they were not winning they were not graceful i knew by their looks that they ate garlic and onions and lastly and finally to my thinking it would be base flattery to call them immoral  aroint thee wench  i sorrow for the vagabond student of the latin quarter now even more than formerly i envied him  thus topples to earth another idol of my infancy  we have seen every thing and tomorrow we go to versailles  we shall see paris only for a little while as we come back to take up our line of march for the ship and so i may as well bid the beautiful city a regretful farewell  we shall travel many thousands of miles after we leave here and visit many great cities but we shall find none so enchanting as this  some of our party have gone to england intending to take a roundabout course and rejoin the vessel at leghorn or naples several weeks hence we came near going to geneva but have concluded to return to marseilles and go up through italy from genoa  i will conclude this chapter with a remark that i am sincerely proud to be able to makeand glad as well that my comrades cordially endorse it to wit by far the handsomest women we have seen in france were born and reared in america  i feel now like a man who has redeemed a failing reputation and shed luster upon a dimmed escutcheon by a single just deed done at the eleventh hour  let the curtain fall to slow music     chapter xvi  versailles  it is wonderfully beautiful  you gaze and stare and try to understand that it is real that it is on the earth that it is not the garden of edenbut your brain grows giddy stupefied by the world of beauty around you and you half believe you are the dupe of an exquisite dream  the scene thrills one like military music  a noble palace stretching its ornamented front block upon block away till it seemed that it would never end a grand promenade before it whereon the armies of an empire might parade all about it rainbows of flowers and colossal statues that were almost numberless and yet seemed only scattered over the ample space broad flights of stone steps leading down from the promenade to lower grounds of the parkstairways that whole regiments might stand to arms upon and have room to spare vast fountains whose great bronze effigies discharged rivers of sparkling water into the air and mingled a hundred curving jets together in forms of matchless beauty wide grasscarpeted avenues that branched hither and thither in every direction and wandered to seemingly interminable distances walled all the way on either side with compact ranks of leafy trees whose branches met above and formed arches as faultless and as symmetrical as ever were carved in stone and here and there were glimpses of sylvan lakes with miniature ships glassed in their surfaces  and every whereon the palace steps and the great promenade around the fountains among the trees and far under the arches of the endless avenueshundreds and hundreds of people in gay costumes walked or ran or danced and gave to the fairy picture the life and animation which was all of perfection it could have lacked  it was worth a pilgrimage to see  everything is on so gigantic a scale nothing is smallnothing is cheap  the statues are all large the palace is grand the park covers a fairsized county the avenues are interminable  all the distances and all the dimensions about versailles are vast  i used to think the pictures exaggerated these distances and these dimensions beyond all reason and that they made versailles more beautiful than it was possible for any place in the world to be  i know now that the pictures never came up to the subject in any respect and that no painter could represent versailles on canvas as beautiful as it is in reality  i used to abuse louis xiv for spending two hundred millions of dollars in creating this marvelous park when bread was so scarce with some of his subjects but i have forgiven him now  he took a tract of land sixty miles in circumference and set to work to make this park and build this palace and a road to it from paris  he kept 36000 men employed daily on it and the labor was so unhealthy that they used to die and be hauled off by cartloads every night  the wife of a nobleman of the time speaks of this as an inconvenience but naively remarks that it does not seem worthy of attention in the happy state of tranquillity we now enjoy  i always thought ill of people at home who trimmed their shrubbery into pyramids and squares and spires and all manner of unnatural shapes and when i saw the same thing being practiced in this great park i began to feel dissatisfied  but i soon saw the idea of the thing and the wisdom of it  they seek the general effect  we distort a dozen sickly trees into unaccustomed shapes in a little yard no bigger than a dining room and then surely they look absurd enough  but here they take two hundred thousand tall forest trees and set them in a double row allow no sign of leaf or branch to grow on the trunk lower down than six feet above the ground from that point the boughs begin to project and very gradually they extend outward further and further till they meet overhead and a faultless tunnel of foliage is formed  the arch is mathematically precise  the effect is then very fine  they make trees take fifty different shapes and so these quaint effects are infinitely varied and picturesque  the trees in no two avenues are shaped alike and consequently the eye is not fatigued with anything in the nature of monotonous uniformity  i will drop this subject now leaving it to others to determine how these people manage to make endless ranks of lofty forest trees grow to just a certain thickness of trunk say a foot and twothirds how they make them spring to precisely the same height for miles how they make them grow so close together how they compel one huge limb to spring from the same identical spot on each tree and form the main sweep of the arch and how all these things are kept exactly in the same condition and in the same exquisite shapeliness and symmetry month after month and year after yearfor i have tried to reason out the problem and have failed  we walked through the great hall of sculpture and the one hundred and fifty galleries of paintings in the palace of versailles and felt that to be in such a place was useless unless one had a whole year at his disposal  these pictures are all battle scenes and only one solitary little canvas among them all treats of anything but great french victories  we wandered also through the grand trianon and the petit trianon those monuments of royal prodigality and with histories so mournfulfilled as it is with souvenirs of napoleon the first and three dead kings and as many queens  in one sumptuous bed they had all slept in succession but no one occupies it now  in a large dining room stood the table at which louis xiv and his mistress madame maintenon and after them louis xv and pompadour had sat at their meals naked and unattendedfor the table stood upon a trapdoor which descended with it to regions below when it was necessary to replenish its dishes  in a room of the petit trianon stood the furniture just as poor marie antoinette left it when the mob came and dragged her and the king to paris never to return  near at hand in the stables were prodigious carriages that showed no color but goldcarriages used by former kings of france on state occasions and never used now save when a kingly head is to be crowned or an imperial infant christened  and with them were some curious sleighs whose bodies were shaped like lions swans tigers etcvehicles that had once been handsome with pictured designs and fine workmanship but were dusty and decaying now  they had their history  when louis xiv had finished the grand trianon he told maintenon he had created a paradise for her and asked if she could think of anything now to wish for  he said he wished the trianon to be perfectionnothing less  she said she could think of but one thingit was summer and it was balmy franceyet she would like well to sleigh ride in the leafy avenues of versailles  the next morning found miles and miles of grassy avenues spread thick with snowy salt and sugar and a procession of those quaint sleighs waiting to receive the chief concubine of the gaiest and most unprincipled court that france has ever seen  from sumptuous versailles with its palaces its statues its gardens and its fountains we journeyed back to paris and sought its antipodes the faubourg st antoine  little narrow streets dirty children blockading them greasy slovenly women capturing and spanking them filthy dens on first floors with rag stores in them the heaviest business in the faubourg is the chiffoniers other filthy dens where whole suits of second and thirdhand clothing are sold at prices that would ruin any proprietor who did not steal his stock still other filthy dens where they sold groceriessold them by the halfpennyworthfive dollars would buy the man out goodwill and all  up these little crooked streets they will murder a man for seven dollars and dump the body in the seine  and up some other of these streetsmost of them i should say live lorettes  all through this faubourg st antoine misery poverty vice and crime go hand in hand and the evidences of it stare one in the face from every side  here the people live who begin the revolutions  whenever there is anything of that kind to be done they are always ready  they take as much genuine pleasure in building a barricade as they do in cutting a throat or shoving a friend into the seine  it is these savagelooking ruffians who storm the splendid halls of the tuileries occasionally and swarm into versailles when a king is to be called to account  but they will build no more barricades they will break no more soldiers heads with pavingstones  louis napoleon has taken care of all that  he is annihilating the crooked streets and building in their stead noble boulevards as straight as an arrowavenues which a cannon ball could traverse from end to end without meeting an obstruction more irresistible than the flesh and bones of menboulevards whose stately edifices will never afford refuges and plotting places for starving discontented revolution breeders  five of these great thoroughfares radiate from one ample centrea centre which is exceedingly well adapted to the accommodation of heavy artillery  the mobs used to riot there but they must seek another rallyingplace in future  and this ingenious napoleon paves the streets of his great cities with a smooth compact composition of asphaltum and sand  no more barricades of flagstonesno more assaulting his majestys troops with cobbles  i cannot feel friendly toward my quondam fellowamerican napoleon iii especially at this timejuly 1867when in fancy i see his credulous victim maximilian lying stark and stiff in mexico and his maniac widow watching eagerly from her french asylum for the form that will never comebut i do admire his nerve his calm selfreliance his shrewd good sense     chapter xvii  we had a pleasant journey of it seaward again  we found that for the three past nights our ship had been in a state of war  the first night the sailors of a british ship being happy with grog came down on the pier and challenged our sailors to a free fight  they accepted with alacrity repaired to the pier and gainedtheir share of a drawn battle  several bruised and bloody members of both parties were carried off by the police and imprisoned until the following morning  the next night the british boys came again to renew the fight but our men had had strict orders to remain on board and out of sight  they did so and the besieging party grew noisy and more and more abusive as the fact became apparent to them that our men were afraid to come out  they went away finally with a closing burst of ridicule and offensive epithets  the third night they came again and were more obstreperous than ever  they swaggered up and down the almost deserted pier and hurled curses obscenity and stinging sarcasms at our crew  it was more than human nature could bear  the executive officer ordered our men ashorewith instructions not to fight  they charged the british and gained a brilliant victory  i probably would not have mentioned this war had it ended differently  but i travel to learn and i still remember that they picture no french defeats in the battlegalleries of versailles  it was like home to us to step on board the comfortable ship again and smoke and lounge about her breezy decks  and yet it was not altogether like home either because so many members of the family were away  we missed some pleasant faces which we would rather have found at dinner and at night there were gaps in the euchreparties which could not be satisfactorily filled  moult  was in england jack in switzerland charley in spain  blucher was gone none could tell where  but we were at sea again and we had the stars and the ocean to look at and plenty of room to meditate in  in due time the shores of italy were sighted and as we stood gazing from the decks early in the bright summer morning the stately city of genoa rose up out of the sea and flung back the sunlight from her hundred palaces  here we rest for the presentor rather here we have been trying to rest for some little time but we run about too much to accomplish a great deal in that line  i would like to remain here  i had rather not go any further  there may be prettier women in europe but i doubt it  the population of genoa is 120000 twothirds of these are women i think and at least twothirds of the women are beautiful  they are as dressy and as tasteful and as graceful as they could possibly be without being angels  however angels are not very dressy i believe  at least the angels in pictures are not they wear nothing but wings  but these genoese women do look so charming  most of the young demoiselles are robed in a cloud of white from head to foot though many trick themselves out more elaborately ninetenths of them wear nothing on their heads but a filmy sort of veil which falls down their backs like a white mist  they are very fair and many of them have blue eyes but black and dreamy dark brown ones are met with oftenest  the ladies and gentlemen of genoa have a pleasant fashion of promenading in a large park on the top of a hill in the center of the city from six till nine in the evening and then eating ices in a neighboring garden an hour or two longer  we went to the park on sunday evening  two thousand persons were present chiefly young ladies and gentlemen  the gentlemen were dressed in the very latest paris fashions and the robes of the ladies glinted among the trees like so many snowflakes  the multitude moved round and round the park in a great procession  the bands played and so did the fountains the moon and the gas lamps lit up the scene and altogether it was a brilliant and an animated picture  i scanned every female face that passed and it seemed to me that all were handsome  i never saw such a freshet of loveliness before  i did not see how a man of only ordinary decision of character could marry here because before he could get his mind made up he would fall in love with somebody else  never smoke any italian tobacco  never do it on any account  it makes me shudder to think what it must be made of  you cannot throw an old cigar stub down anywhere but some vagabond will pounce upon it on the instant  i like to smoke a good deal but it wounds my sensibilities to see one of these stubhunters watching me out of the corners of his hungry eyes and calculating how long my cigar will be likely to last it reminded me too painfully of that san francisco undertaker who used to go to sickbeds with his watch in his hand and time the corpse  one of these stubhunters followed us all over the park last night and we never had a smoke that was worth anything  we were always moved to appease him with the stub before the cigar was half gone because he looked so viciously anxious  he regarded us as his own legitimate prey by right of discovery i think because he drove off several other professionals who wanted to take stock in us  now they surely must chew up those old stubs and dry and sell them for smokingtobacco  therefore give your custom to other than italian brands of the article  the superb and the city of palaces are names which genoa has held for centuries  she is full of palaces certainly and the palaces are sumptuous inside but they are very rusty without and make no pretensions to architectural magnificence  genoa the superb would be a felicitous title if it referred to the women  we have visited several of the palacesimmense thickwalled piles with great stone staircases tesselated marble pavements on the floors sometimes they make a mosaic work of intricate designs wrought in pebbles or little fragments of marble laid in cement and grand salons hung with pictures by rubens guido titian paul veronese and so on and portraits of heads of the family in plumed helmets and gallant coats of mail and patrician ladies in stunning costumes of centuries ago but of course the folks were all out in the country for the summer and might not have known enough to ask us to dinner if they had been at home and so all the grand empty salons with their resounding pavements their grim pictures of dead ancestors and tattered banners with the dust of bygone centuries upon them seemed to brood solemnly of death and the grave and our spirits ebbed away and our cheerfulness passed from us we never went up to the eleventh story  we always began to suspect ghosts  there was always an undertakerlooking servant along too who handed us a program pointed to the picture that began the list of the salon he was in and then stood stiff and stark and unsmiling in his petrified livery till we were ready to move on to the next chamber whereupon he marched sadly ahead and took up another malignantly respectful position as before  i wasted so much time praying that the roof would fall in on these dispiriting flunkies that i had but little left to bestow upon palace and pictures  and besides as in paris we had a guide  perdition catch all the guides  this one said he was the most gifted linguist in genoa as far as english was concerned and that only two persons in the city beside himself could talk the language at all  he showed us the birthplace of christopher columbus and after we had reflected in silent awe before it for fifteen minutes he said it was not the birthplace of columbus but of columbus grandmother  when we demanded an explanation of his conduct he only shrugged his shoulders and answered in barbarous italian  i shall speak further of this guide in a future chapter  all the information we got out of him we shall be able to carry along with us i think  i have not been to church so often in a long time as i have in the last few weeks  the people in these old lands seem to make churches their specialty  especially does this seem to be the case with the citizens of genoa  i think there is a church every three or four hundred yards all over town  the streets are sprinkled from end to end with shovelhatted longrobed wellfed priests and the church bells by dozens are pealing all the day long nearly  every now and then one comes across a friar of orders gray with shaven head long coarse robe rope girdle and beads and with feet cased in sandals or entirely bare  these worthies suffer in the flesh and do penance all their lives i suppose but they look like consummate faminebreeders  they are all fat and serene  the old cathedral of san lorenzo is about as notable a building as we have found in genoa  it is vast and has colonnades of noble pillars and a great organ and the customary pomp of gilded moldings pictures frescoed ceilings and so forth  i cannot describe it of courseit would require a good many pages to do that  but it is a curious place they said that half of itfrom the front door halfway down to the altar was a jewish synagogue before the saviour was born and that no alteration had been made in it since that time  we doubted the statement but did it reluctantly  we would much rather have believed it  the place looked in too perfect repair to be so ancient  the main point of interest about the cathedral is the little chapel of st john the baptist  they only allow women to enter it on one day in the year on account of the animosity they still cherish against the sex because of the murder of the saint to gratify a caprice of herodias  in this chapel is a marble chest in which they told us were the ashes of st john and around it was wound a chain which they said had confined him when he was in prison  we did not desire to disbelieve these statements and yet we could not feel certain that they were correct partly because we could have broken that chain and so could st john and partly because we had seen st johns ashes before in another church  we could not bring ourselves to think st john had two sets of ashes  they also showed us a portrait of the madonna which was painted by st luke and it did not look half as old and smoky as some of the pictures by rubens  we could not help admiring the apostles modesty in never once mentioning in his writings that he could paint  but isnt this relic matter a little overdone  we find a piece of the true cross in every old church we go into and some of the nails that held it together  i would not like to be positive but i think we have seen as much as a keg of these nails  then there is the crown of thorns they have part of one in sainte chapelle in paris and part of one also in notre dame  and as for bones of st denis i feel certain we have seen enough of them to duplicate him if necessary  i only meant to write about the churches but i keep wandering from the subject  i could say that the church of the annunciation is a wilderness of beautiful columns of statues gilded moldings and pictures almost countless but that would give no one an entirely perfect idea of the thing and so where is the use  one family built the whole edifice and have got money left  there is where the mystery lies  we had an idea at first that only a mint could have survived the expense  these people here live in the heaviest highest broadest darkest solidest houses one can imagine  each one might laugh a siege to scorn  a hundred feet front and a hundred high is about the style and you go up three flights of stairs before you begin to come upon signs of occupancy  everything is stone and stone of the heaviestfloors stairways mantels bencheseverything  the walls are four to five feet thick  the streets generally are four or five to eight feet wide and as crooked as a corkscrew  you go along one of these gloomy cracks and look up and behold the sky like a mere ribbon of light far above your head where the tops of the tall houses on either side of the street bend almost together  you feel as if you were at the bottom of some tremendous abyss with all the world far above you  you wind in and out and here and there in the most mysterious way and have no more idea of the points of the compass than if you were a blind man  you can never persuade yourself that these are actually streets and the frowning dingy monstrous houses dwellings till you see one of these beautiful prettily dressed women emerge from themsee her emerge from a dark drearylooking den that looks dungeon all over from the ground away halfway up to heaven  and then you wonder that such a charming moth could come from such a forbidding shell as that  the streets are wisely made narrow and the houses heavy and thick and stony in order that the people may be cool in this roasting climate  and they are cool and stay so  and while i think of itthe men wear hats and have very dark complexions but the women wear no headgear but a flimsy veil like a gossamers web and yet are exceedingly fair as a general thing singular isnt it  the huge palaces of genoa are each supposed to be occupied by one family but they could accommodate a hundred i should think  they are relics of the grandeur of genoas palmy daysthe days when she was a great commercial and maritime power several centuries ago  these houses solid marble palaces though they be are in many cases of a dull pinkish color outside and from pavement to eaves are pictured with genoese battle scenes with monstrous jupiters and cupids and with familiar illustrations from grecian mythology  where the paint has yielded to age and exposure and is peeling off in flakes and patches the effect is not happy  a noseless cupid or a jupiter with an eye out or a venus with a flyblister on her breast are not attractive features in a picture some of these painted walls reminded me somewhat of the tall van plastered with fanciful bills and posters that follows the bandwagon of a circus about a country village  i have not read or heard that the outsides of the houses of any other european city are frescoed in this way  i can not conceive of such a thing as genoa in ruins  such massive arches such ponderous substructions as support these towering broadwinged edifices we have seldom seen before and surely the great blocks of stone of which these edifices are built can never decay walls that are as thick as an ordinary american doorway is high cannot crumble  the republics of genoa and pisa were very powerful in the middle ages their ships filled the mediterranean and they carried on an extensive commerce with constantinople and syria  their warehouses were the great distributing depots from whence the costly merchandise of the east was sent abroad over europe  they were warlike little nations and defied in those days governments that overshadow them now as mountains overshadow molehills  the saracens captured and pillaged genoa nine hundred years ago but during the following century genoa and pisa entered into an offensive and defensive alliance and besieged the saracen colonies in sardinia and the balearic isles with an obstinacy that maintained its pristine vigor and held to its purpose for forty long years  they were victorious at last and divided their conquests equably among their great patrician families  descendants of some of those proud families still inhabit the palaces of genoa and trace in their own features a resemblance to the grim knights whose portraits hang in their stately halls and to pictured beauties with pouting lips and merry eyes whose originals have been dust and ashes for many a dead and forgotten century  the hotel we live in belonged to one of those great orders of knights of the cross in the times of the crusades and its mailed sentinels once kept watch and ward in its massive turrets and woke the echoes of these halls and corridors with their iron heels  but genoas greatness has degenerated into an unostentatious commerce in velvets and silver filagreework  they say that each european town has its specialty  these filagree things are genoas specialty  her smiths take silver ingots and work them up into all manner of graceful and beautiful forms  they make bunches of flowers from flakes and wires of silver that counterfeit the delicate creations the frost weaves upon a windowpane and we were shown a miniature silver temple whose fluted columns whose corinthian capitals and rich entablatures whose spire statues bells and ornate lavishness of sculpture were wrought in polished silver and with such matchless art that every detail was a fascinating study and the finished edifice a wonder of beauty  we are ready to move again though we are not really tired yet of the narrow passages of this old marble cave  cave is a good wordwhen speaking of genoa under the stars  when we have been prowling at midnight through the gloomy crevices they call streets where no footfalls but ours were echoing where only ourselves were abroad and lights appeared only at long intervals and at a distance and mysteriously disappeared again and the houses at our elbows seemed to stretch upward farther than ever toward the heavens the memory of a cave i used to know at home was always in my mind with its lofty passages its silence and solitude its shrouding gloom its sepulchral echoes its flitting lights and more than all its sudden revelations of branching crevices and corridors where we least expected them  we are not tired of the endless processions of cheerful chattering gossipers that throng these courts and streets all day long either nor of the coarserobed monks nor of the asti wines which that old doctor whom we call the oracle with customary felicity in the matter of getting everything wrong misterms nasty  but we must go nevertheless  our last sight was the cemetery a burial place intended to accommodate 60000 bodies and we shall continue to remember it after we shall have forgotten the palaces  it is a vast marble collonaded corridor extending around a great unoccupied square of ground its broad floor is marble and on every slab is an inscriptionfor every slab covers a corpse  on either side as one walks down the middle of the passage are monuments tombs and sculptured figures that are exquisitely wrought and are full of grace and beauty  they are new and snowy every outline is perfect every feature guiltless of mutilation flaw or blemish and therefore to us these farreaching ranks of bewitching forms are a hundred fold more lovely than the damaged and dingy statuary they have saved from the wreck of ancient art and set up in the galleries of paris for the worship of the world  well provided with cigars and other necessaries of life we are now ready to take the cars for milan     chapter xviii  all day long we sped through a mountainous country whose peaks were bright with sunshine whose hillsides were dotted with pretty villas sitting in the midst of gardens and shrubbery and whose deep ravines were cool and shady and looked ever so inviting from where we and the birds were winging our flight through the sultry upper air  we had plenty of chilly tunnels wherein to check our perspiration though  we timed one of them  we were twenty minutes passing through it going at the rate of thirty to thirtyfive miles an hour  beyond alessandria we passed the battlefield of marengo  toward dusk we drew near milan and caught glimpses of the city and the blue mountain peaks beyond  but we were not caring for these things they did not interest us in the least  we were in a fever of impatience we were dying to see the renowned cathedral  we watchedin this direction and thatall aroundeverywhere  we needed no one to point it outwe did not wish any one to point it outwe would recognize it even in the desert of the great sahara  at last a forest of graceful needles shimmering in the amber sunlight rose slowly above the pygmy housetops as one sometimes sees in the far horizon a gilded and pinnacled mass of cloud lift itself above the waste of waves at seathe cathedral  we knew it in a moment  half of that night and all of the next day this architectural autocrat was our sole object of interest  what a wonder it is  so grand so solemn so vast  and yet so delicate so airy so graceful  a very world of solid weight and yet it seems in the soft moonlight only a fairy delusion of frostwork that might vanish with a breath  how sharply its pinnacled angles and its wilderness of spires were cut against the sky and how richly their shadows fell upon its snowy roof  it was a visiona miraclean anthem sung in stone a poem wrought in marble  howsoever you look at the great cathedral it is noble it is beautiful wherever you stand in milan or within seven miles of milan it is visible and when it is visible no other object can chain your whole attention leave your eyes unfettered by your will but a single instant and they will surely turn to seek it  it is the first thing you look for when you rise in the morning and the last your lingering gaze rests upon at night  surely it must be the princeliest creation that ever brain of man conceived  at nine oclock in the morning we went and stood before this marble colossus  the central one of its five great doors is bordered with a basrelief of birds and fruits and beasts and insects which have been so ingeniously carved out of the marble that they seem like living creaturesand the figures are so numerous and the design so complex that one might study it a week without exhausting its interest  on the great steeplesurmounting the myriad of spiresinside of the spiresover the doors the windowsin nooks and cornersevery where that a niche or a perch can be found about the enormous building from summit to base there is a marble statue and every statue is a study in itself raphael angelo canovagiants like these gave birth to the designs and their own pupils carved them  every face is eloquent with expression and every attitude is full of grace  away above on the lofty roof rank on rank of carved and fretted spires spring high in the air and through their rich tracery one sees the sky beyond  in their midst the central steeple towers proudly up like the mainmast of some great indiaman among a fleet of coasters  we wished to go aloft  the sacristan showed us a marble stairway of course it was marble and of the purest and whitestthere is no other stone no brick no wood among its building materials and told us to go up one hundred and eightytwo steps and stop till he came  it was not necessary to say stopwe should have done that any how  we were tired by the time we got there  this was the roof  here springing from its broad marble flagstones were the long files of spires looking very tall close at hand but diminishing in the distance like the pipes of an organ  we could see now that the statue on the top of each was the size of a large man though they all looked like dolls from the street  we could see also that from the inside of each and every one of these hollow spires from sixteen to thirtyone beautiful marble statues looked out upon the world below  from the eaves to the comb of the roof stretched in endless succession great curved marble beams like the foreandaft braces of a steamboat and along each beam from end to end stood up a row of richly carved flowers and fruitseach separate and distinct in kind and over 15000 species represented  at a little distance these rows seem to close together like the ties of a railroad track and then the mingling together of the buds and blossoms of this marble garden forms a picture that is very charming to the eye  we descended and entered  within the church long rows of fluted columns like huge monuments divided the building into broad aisles and on the figured pavement fell many a soft blush from the painted windows above  i knew the church was very large but i could not fully appreciate its great size until i noticed that the men standing far down by the altar looked like boys and seemed to glide rather than walk  we loitered about gazing aloft at the monster windows all aglow with brilliantly colored scenes in the lives of the saviour and his followers some of these pictures are mosaics and so artistically are their thousand particles of tinted glass or stone put together that the work has all the smoothness and finish of a painting  we counted sixty panes of glass in one window and each pane was adorned with one of these master achievements of genius and patience  the guide showed us a coffeecolored piece of sculpture which he said was considered to have come from the hand of phidias since it was not possible that any other artist of any epoch could have copied nature with such faultless accuracy  the figure was that of a man without a skin with every vein artery muscle every fiber and tendon and tissue of the human frame represented in minute detail  it looked natural because somehow it looked as if it were in pain  a skinned man would be likely to look that way unless his attention were occupied with some other matter  it was a hideous thing and yet there was a fascination about it some where  i am very sorry i saw it because i shall always see it now  i shall dream of it sometimes  i shall dream that it is resting its corded arms on the beds head and looking down on me with its dead eyes i shall dream that it is stretched between the sheets with me and touching me with its exposed muscles and its stringy cold legs  it is hard to forget repulsive things  i remember yet how i ran off from school once when i was a boy and then pretty late at night concluded to climb into the window of my fathers office and sleep on a lounge because i had a delicacy about going home and getting thrashed  as i lay on the lounge and my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness i fancied i could see a long dusky shapeless thing stretched upon the floor  a cold shiver went through me  i turned my face to the wall  that did not answer  i was afraid that that thing would creep over and seize me in the dark  i turned back and stared at it for minutes and minutesthey seemed hours  it appeared to me that the lagging moonlight never never would get to it  i turned to the wall and counted twenty to pass the feverish time away  i lookedthe pale square was nearer  i turned again and counted fiftyit was almost touching it  with desperate will i turned again and counted one hundred and faced about all in a tremble  a white human hand lay in the moonlight  such an awful sinking at the heartsuch a sudden gasp for breath  i felti cannot tell what i felt  when i recovered strength enough i faced the wall again  but no boy could have remained so with that mysterious hand behind him  i counted again and lookedthe most of a naked arm was exposed  i put my hands over my eyes and counted till i could stand it no longer and then the pallid face of a man was there with the corners of the mouth drawn down and the eyes fixed and glassy in death  i raised to a sitting posture and glowered on that corpse till the light crept down the bare breastline by lineinch by inchpast the nippleand then it disclosed a ghastly stab  i went away from there  i do not say that i went away in any sort of a hurry but i simply wentthat is sufficient  i went out at the window and i carried the sash along with me  i did not need the sash but it was handier to take it than it was to leave it and so i took iti was not scared but i was considerably agitated  when i reached home they whipped me but i enjoyed it  it seemed perfectly delightful  that man had been stabbed near the office that afternoon and they carried him in there to doctor him but he only lived an hour  i have slept in the same room with him often since thenin my dreams  now we will descend into the crypt under the grand altar of milan cathedral and receive an impressive sermon from lips that have been silent and hands that have been gestureless for three hundred years  the priest stopped in a small dungeon and held up his candle  this was the last restingplace of a good man a warmhearted unselfish man a man whose whole life was given to succoring the poor encouraging the fainthearted visiting the sick in relieving distress whenever and wherever he found it  his heart his hand and his purse were always open  with his story in ones mind he can almost see his benignant countenance moving calmly among the haggard faces of milan in the days when the plague swept the city brave where all others were cowards full of compassion where pity had been crushed out of all other breasts by the instinct of selfpreservation gone mad with terror cheering all praying with all helping all with hand and brain and purse at a time when parents forsook their children the friend deserted the friend and the brother turned away from the sister while her pleadings were still wailing in his ears  this was good st charles borromeo bishop of milan  the people idolized him princes lavished uncounted treasures upon him  we stood in his tomb  near by was the sarcophagus lighted by the dripping candles  the walls were faced with basreliefs representing scenes in his life done in massive silver  the priest put on a short white lace garment over his black robe crossed himself bowed reverently and began to turn a windlass slowly  the sarcophagus separated in two parts lengthwise and the lower part sank down and disclosed a coffin of rock crystal as clear as the atmosphere  within lay the body robed in costly habiliments covered with gold embroidery and starred with scintillating gems  the decaying head was black with age the dry skin was drawn tight to the bones the eyes were gone there was a hole in the temple and another in the cheek and the skinny lips were parted as in a ghastly smile  over this dreadful face its dust and decay and its mocking grin hung a crown sown thick with flashing brilliants and upon the breast lay crosses and croziers of solid gold that were splendid with emeralds and diamonds  how poor and cheap and trivial these gewgaws seemed in presence of the solemnity the grandeur the awful majesty of death  think of milton shakespeare washington standing before a reverent world tricked out in the glass beads the brass earrings and tin trumpery of the savages of the plains  dead bartolomeo preached his pregnant sermon and its burden was you that worship the vanities of earthyou that long for worldly honor worldly wealth worldly famebehold their worth  to us it seemed that so good a man so kind a heart so simple a nature deserved rest and peace in a grave sacred from the intrusion of prying eyes and believed that he himself would have preferred to have it so but peradventure our wisdom was at fault in this regard  as we came out upon the floor of the church again another priest volunteered to show us the treasures of the church  what more  the furniture of the narrow chamber of death we had just visited weighed six millions of francs in ounces and carats alone without a penny thrown into the account for the costly workmanship bestowed upon them  but we followed into a large room filled with tall wooden presses like wardrobes  he threw them open and behold the cargoes of crude bullion of the assay offices of nevada faded out of my memory  there were virgins and bishops there above their natural size made of solid silver each worth by weight from eight hundred thousand to two millions of francs and bearing gemmed books in their hands worth eighty thousand there were basreliefs that weighed six hundred pounds carved in solid silver croziers and crosses and candlesticks six and eight feet high all of virgin gold and brilliant with precious stones and beside these were all manner of cups and vases and such things rich in proportion  it was an aladdins palace  the treasures here by simple weight without counting workmanship were valued at fifty millions of francs  if i could get the custody of them for a while i fear me the market price of silver bishops would advance shortly on account of their exceeding scarcity in the cathedral of milan  the priests showed us two of st pauls fingers and one of st peters a bone of judas iscariot it was black and also bones of all the other disciples a handkerchief in which the saviour had left the impression of his face  among the most precious of the relics were a stone from the holy sepulchre part of the crown of thorns they have a whole one at notre dame a fragment of the purple robe worn by the saviour a nail from the cross and a picture of the virgin and child painted by the veritable hand of st luke  this is the second of st lukes virgins we have seen  once a year all these holy relics are carried in procession through the streets of milan  i like to revel in the dryest details of the great cathedral  the building is five hundred feet long by one hundred and eighty wide and the principal steeple is in the neighborhood of four hundred feet high it has 7148 marble statues and will have upwards of three thousand more when it is finished  in addition it has one thousand five hundred basreliefs  it has one hundred and thirtysix spirestwentyone more are to be added  each spire is surmounted by a statue six and a half feet high  every thing about the church is marble and all from the same quarry it was bequeathed to the archbishopric for this purpose centuries ago  so nothing but the mere workmanship costs still that is expensivethe bill foots up six hundred and eightyfour millions of francs thus far considerably over a hundred millions of dollars and it is estimated that it will take a hundred and twenty years yet to finish the cathedral  it looks complete but is far from being so  we saw a new statue put in its niche yesterday alongside of one which had been standing these four hundred years they said  there are four staircases leading up to the main steeple each of which cost a hundred thousand dollars with the four hundred and eight statues which adorn them  marco compioni was the architect who designed the wonderful structure more than five hundred years ago and it took him fortysix years to work out the plan and get it ready to hand over to the builders  he is dead now  the building was begun a little less than five hundred years ago and the third generation hence will not see it completed  the building looks best by moonlight because the older portions of it being stained with age contrast unpleasantly with the newer and whiter portions  it seems somewhat too broad for its height but may be familiarity with it might dissipate this impression  they say that the cathedral of milan is second only to st peters at rome  i cannot understand how it can be second to anything made by human hands  we bid it goodbye nowpossibly for all time  how surely in some future day when the memory of it shall have lost its vividness shall we half believe we have seen it in a wonderful dream but never with waking eyes     chapter xix  do you wis zo haut can be  that was what the guide asked when we were looking up at the bronze horses on the arch of peace  it meant do you wish to go up there i give it as a specimen of guideenglish  these are the people that make life a burthen to the tourist  their tongues are never still  they talk forever and forever and that is the kind of billingsgate they use inspiration itself could hardly comprehend them  if they would only show you a masterpiece of art or a venerable tomb or a prisonhouse or a battlefield hallowed by touching memories or historical reminiscences or grand traditions and then step aside and hold still for ten minutes and let you think it would not be so bad  but they interrupt every dream every pleasant train of thought with their tiresome cackling sometimes when i have been standing before some cherished old idol of mine that i remembered years and years ago in pictures in the geography at school i have thought i would give a whole world if the human parrot at my side would suddenly perish where he stood and leave me to gaze and ponder and worship  no we did not wis zo haut can be  we wished to go to la scala the largest theater in the world i think they call it  we did so  it was a large place  seven separate and distinct masses of humanitysix great circles and a monster parquette  we wished to go to the ambrosian library and we did that also  we saw a manuscript of virgil with annotations in the handwriting of petrarch the gentleman who loved another mans laura and lavished upon her all through life a love which was a clear waste of the raw material  it was sound sentiment but bad judgment  it brought both parties fame and created a fountain of commiseration for them in sentimental breasts that is running yet  but who says a word in behalf of poor mr laura  i do not know his other name  who glorifies him  who bedews him with tears who writes poetry about him  nobody  how do you suppose he liked the state of things that has given the world so much pleasure  how did he enjoy having another man following his wife every where and making her name a familiar word in every garlicexterminating mouth in italy with his sonnets to her preempted eyebrows  they got fame and sympathyhe got neither  this is a peculiarly felicitous instance of what is called poetical justice  it is all very fine but it does not chime with my notions of right  it is too onesidedtoo ungenerous  let the world go on fretting about laura and petrarch if it will but as for me my tears and my lamentations shall be lavished upon the unsung defendant  we saw also an autograph letter of lucrezia borgia a lady for whom i have always entertained the highest respect on account of her rare histrionic capabilities her opulence in solid gold goblets made of gilded wood her high distinction as an operatic screamer and the facility with which she could order a sextuple funeral and get the corpses ready for it  we saw one single coarse yellow hair from lucrezias head likewise  it awoke emotions but we still live  in this same library we saw some drawings by michael angelo these italians call him mickel angelo and leonardo da vinci  they spell it vinci and pronounce it vinchy foreigners always spell better than they pronounce we reserve our opinion of these sketches  in another building they showed us a fresco representing some lions and other beasts drawing chariots and they seemed to project so far from the wall that we took them to be sculptures  the artist had shrewdly heightened the delusion by painting dust on the creatures backs as if it had fallen there naturally and properly  smart fellowif it be smart to deceive strangers  elsewhere we saw a huge roman amphitheatre with its stone seats still in good preservation  modernized it is now the scene of more peaceful recreations than the exhibition of a party of wild beasts with christians for dinner  part of the time the milanese use it for a race track and at other seasons they flood it with water and have spirited yachting regattas there  the guide told us these things and he would hardly try so hazardous an experiment as the telling of a falsehood when it is all he can do to speak the truth in english without getting the lockjaw  in another place we were shown a sort of summer arbor with a fence before it  we said that was nothing  we looked again and saw through the arbor an endless stretch of garden and shrubbery and grassy lawn we were perfectly willing to go in there and rest but it could not be done  it was only another delusiona painting by some ingenious artist with little charity in his heart for tired folk  the deception was perfect  no one could have imagined the park was not real  we even thought we smelled the flowers at first  we got a carriage at twilight and drove in the shaded avenues with the other nobility and after dinner we took wine and ices in a fine garden with the great public  the music was excellent the flowers and shrubbery were pleasant to the eye the scene was vivacious everybody was genteel and wellbehaved and the ladies were slightly moustached and handsomely dressed but very homely  we adjourned to a cafe and played billiards an hour and i made six or seven points by the doctor pocketing his ball and he made as many by my pocketing my ball  we came near making a carom sometimes but not the one we were trying to make  the table was of the usual european style cushions dead and twice as high as the balls the cues in bad repair the natives play only a sort of pool on them  we have never seen any body playing the french threeball game yet and i doubt if there is any such game known in france or that there lives any man mad enough to try to play it on one of these european tables  we had to stop playing finally because dan got to sleeping fifteen minutes between the counts and paying no attention to his marking  afterward we walked up and down one of the most popular streets for some time enjoying other peoples comfort and wishing we could export some of it to our restless driving vitalityconsuming marts at home  just in this one matter lies the main charm of life in europecomfort  in america we hurrywhich is well but when the days work is done we go on thinking of losses and gains we plan for the morrow we even carry our business cares to bed with us and toss and worry over them when we ought to be restoring our racked bodies and brains with sleep  we burn up our energies with these excitements and either die early or drop into a lean and mean old age at a time of life which they call a mans prime in europe  when an acre of ground has produced long and well we let it lie fallow and rest for a season we take no man clear across the continent in the same coach he started inthe coach is stabled somewhere on the plains and its heated machinery allowed to cool for a few days when a razor has seen long service and refuses to hold an edge the barber lays it away for a few weeks and the edge comes back of its own accord  we bestow thoughtful care upon inanimate objects but none upon ourselves  what a robust people what a nation of thinkers we might be if we would only lay ourselves on the shelf occasionally and renew our edges  i do envy these europeans the comfort they take  when the work of the day is done they forget it  some of them go with wife and children to a beer hall and sit quietly and genteelly drinking a mug or two of ale and listening to music others walk the streets others drive in the avenues others assemble in the great ornamental squares in the early evening to enjoy the sight and the fragrance of flowers and to hear the military bands playno european city being without its fine military music at eventide and yet others of the populace sit in the open air in front of the refreshment houses and eat ices and drink mild beverages that could not harm a child  they go to bed moderately early and sleep well  they are always quiet always orderly always cheerful comfortable and appreciative of life and its manifold blessings  one never sees a drunken man among them  the change that has come over our little party is surprising  day by day we lose some of our restlessness and absorb some of the spirit of quietude and ease that is in the tranquil atmosphere about us and in the demeanor of the people  we grow wise apace  we begin to comprehend what life is for  we have had a bath in milan in a public bathhouse  they were going to put all three of us in one bathtub but we objected  each of us had an italian farm on his back  we could have felt affluent if we had been officially surveyed and fenced in  we chose to have three bathtubs and large onestubs suited to the dignity of aristocrats who had real estate and brought it with them  after we were stripped and had taken the first chilly dash we discovered that haunting atrocity that has embittered our lives in so many cities and villages of italy and france there was no soap  i called  a woman answered and i barely had time to throw myself against the doorshe would have been in in another second i said  beware woman  go away from herego away now or it will be the worse for you  i am an unprotected male but i will preserve my honor at the peril of my life  these words must have frightened her for she skurried away very fast  dans voice rose on the air  oh bring some soap why dont you  the reply was italian  dan resumed  soap you knowsoap  that is what i wantsoap  soap soap sope soap soup soap  hurry up  i dont know how you irish spell it but i want it  spell it to suit yourself but fetch it im freezing  i heard the doctor say impressively  dan how often have we told you that these foreigners cannot understand english  why will you not depend upon us  why will you not tell us what you want and let us ask for it in the language of the country  it would save us a great deal of the humiliation your reprehensible ignorance causes us  i will address this person in his mother tongue here cospetto corpo di bacco  sacramento  solferinosoap you son of a gun  dan if you would let us talk for you you would never expose your ignorant vulgarity  even this fluent discharge of italian did not bring the soap at once but there was a good reason for it  there was not such an article about the establishment  it is my belief that there never had been  they had to send far up town and to several different places before they finally got it so they said  we had to wait twenty or thirty minutes  the same thing had occurred the evening before at the hotel  i think i have divined the reason for this state of things at last  the english know how to travel comfortably and they carry soap with them other foreigners do not use the article  at every hotel we stop at we always have to send out for soap at the last moment when we are grooming ourselves for dinner and they put it in the bill along with the candles and other nonsense  in marseilles they make half the fancy toilet soap we consume in america but the marseillaise only have a vague theoretical idea of its use which they have obtained from books of travel just as they have acquired an uncertain notion of clean shirts and the peculiarities of the gorilla and other curious matters  this reminds me of poor bluchers note to the landlord in paris       paris le 7 juillet  monsieur le landlordsir pourquoi dont you      mettez some savon in your bedchambers  estce que vous pensez i      will steal it  la nuit passee you charged me pour deux chandelles      when i only had one hier vous avez charged me avec glace when i had      none at all tout les jours you are coming some fresh game or other      on me mais vous ne pouvez pas play this savon dodge on me twice      savon is a necessary de la vie to any body but a frenchman et je      laurai hors de cet hotel or make trouble  you hear me  allons      blucher  i remonstrated against the sending of this note because it was so mixed up that the landlord would never be able to make head or tail of it but blucher said he guessed the old man could read the french of it and average the rest  bluchers french is bad enough but it is not much worse than the english one finds in advertisements all over italy every day  for instance observe the printed card of the hotel we shall probably stop at on the shores of lake como       notish       this hotel which the best it is in italy and most superb is      handsome locate on the best situation of the lake with the most      splendid view near the villas melzy to the king of belgian and      serbelloni  this hotel have recently enlarge do offer all      commodities on moderate price at the strangers gentlemen who whish      spend the seasons on the lake come  how is that for a specimen  in the hotel is a handsome little chapel where an english clergyman is employed to preach to such of the guests of the house as hail from england and america and this fact is also set forth in barbarous english in the same advertisement  wouldnt you have supposed that the adventurous linguist who framed the card would have known enough to submit it to that clergyman before he sent it to the printer  here in milan in an ancient tumbledown ruin of a church is the mournful wreck of the most celebrated painting in the worldthe last supper by leonardo da vinci  we are not infallible judges of pictures but of course we went there to see this wonderful painting once so beautiful always so worshipped by masters in art and forever to be famous in song and story  and the first thing that occurred was the infliction on us of a placard fairly reeking with wretched english  take a morsel of it bartholomew that is the first figure on the left hand side at the spectator uncertain and doubtful about what he thinks to have heard and upon which he wants to be assured by himself at christ and by no others  good isnt it  and then peter is described as argumenting in a threatening and angrily condition at judas iscariot  this paragraph recalls the picture  the last supper is painted on the dilapidated wall of what was a little chapel attached to the main church in ancient times i suppose  it is battered and scarred in every direction and stained and discolored by time and napoleons horses kicked the legs off most the disciples when they the horses not the disciples were stabled there more than half a century ago  i recognized the old picture in a momentthe saviour with bowed head seated at the centre of a long rough table with scattering fruits and dishes upon it and six disciples on either side in their long robes talking to each otherthe picture from which all engravings and all copies have been made for three centuries  perhaps no living man has ever known an attempt to paint the lords supper differently  the world seems to have become settled in the belief long ago that it is not possible for human genius to outdo this creation of da vincis  i suppose painters will go on copying it as long as any of the original is left visible to the eye  there were a dozen easels in the room and as many artists transferring the great picture to their canvases  fifty proofs of steel engravings and lithographs were scattered around too and as usual i could not help noticing how superior the copies were to the original that is to my inexperienced eye  wherever you find a raphael a rubens a michelangelo a carracci or a da vinci and we see them every day you find artists copying them and the copies are always the handsomest  maybe the originals were handsome when they were new but they are not now  this picture is about thirty feet long and ten or twelve high i should think and the figures are at least life size  it is one of the largest paintings in europe  the colors are dimmed with age the countenances are scaled and marred and nearly all expression is gone from them the hair is a dead blur upon the wall and there is no life in the eyes  only the attitudes are certain  people come here from all parts of the world and glorify this masterpiece  they stand entranced before it with bated breath and parted lips and when they speak it is only in the catchy ejaculations of rapture  oh wonderful  such expression  such grace of attitude  such dignity  such faultless drawing  such matchless coloring  such feeling  what delicacy of touch  what sublimity of conception  a vision  a vision  i only envy these people i envy them their honest admiration if it be honesttheir delight if they feel delight  i harbor no animosity toward any of them  but at the same time the thought will intrude itself upon me how can they see what is not visible  what would you think of a man who looked at some decayed blind toothless pockmarked cleopatra and said what matchless beauty  what soul  what expression  what would you think of a man who gazed upon a dingy foggy sunset and said what sublimity  what feeling  what richness of coloring  what would you think of a man who stared in ecstasy upon a desert of stumps and said oh my soul my beating heart what a noble forest is here  you would think that those men had an astonishing talent for seeing things that had already passed away  it was what i thought when i stood before the last supper and heard men apostrophizing wonders and beauties and perfections which had faded out of the picture and gone a hundred years before they were born  we can imagine the beauty that was once in an aged face we can imagine the forest if we see the stumps but we can not absolutely see these things when they are not there  i am willing to believe that the eye of the practiced artist can rest upon the last supper and renew a lustre where only a hint of it is left supply a tint that has faded away restore an expression that is gone patch and color and add to the dull canvas until at last its figures shall stand before him aglow with the life the feeling the freshness yea with all the noble beauty that was theirs when first they came from the hand of the master  but i can not work this miracle  can those other uninspired visitors do it or do they only happily imagine they do  after reading so much about it i am satisfied that the last supper was a very miracle of art once  but it was three hundred years ago  it vexes me to hear people talk so glibly of feeling expression tone and those other easily acquired and inexpensive technicalities of art that make such a fine show in conversations concerning pictures there is not one man in seventyfive hundred that can tell what a pictured face is intended to express  there is not one man in five hundred that can go into a courtroom and be sure that he will not mistake some harmless innocent of a juryman for the blackhearted assassin on trial  yet such people talk of character and presume to interpret expression in pictures  there is an old story that matthews the actor was once lauding the ability of the human face to express the passions and emotions hidden in the breast  he said the countenance could disclose what was passing in the heart plainer than the tongue could  now he said observe my facewhat does it express  despair  bah it expresses peaceful resignation  what does this express  rage  stuff  it means terror  this  imbecility  fool  it is smothered ferocity  now this  joy  oh perdition  any ass can see it means insanity  expression  people coolly pretend to read it who would think themselves presumptuous if they pretended to interpret the hieroglyphics on the obelisks of luxoryet they are fully as competent to do the one thing as the other  i have heard two very intelligent critics speak of murillos immaculate conception now in the museum at seville within the past few days  one said  oh the virgins face is full of the ecstasy of a joy that is complete that leaves nothing more to be desired on earth  the other said  ah that wonderful face is so humble so pleadingit says as plainly as words could say it i fear i tremble i am unworthy  but thy will be done sustain thou thy servant  the reader can see the picture in any drawingroom it can be easily recognized the virgin the only young and really beautiful virgin that was ever painted by one of the old masters some of us think stands in the crescent of the new moon with a multitude of cherubs hovering about her and more coming her hands are crossed upon her breast and upon her uplifted countenance falls a glory out of the heavens  the reader may amuse himself if he chooses in trying to determine which of these gentlemen read the virgins expression aright or if either of them did it  any one who is acquainted with the old masters will comprehend how much the last supper is damaged when i say that the spectator can not really tell now whether the disciples are hebrews or italians  these ancient painters never succeeded in denationalizing themselves  the italian artists painted italian virgins the dutch painted dutch virgins the virgins of the french painters were frenchwomennone of them ever put into the face of the madonna that indescribable something which proclaims the jewess whether you find her in new york in constantinople in paris jerusalem or in the empire of morocco  i saw in the sandwich islands once a picture copied by a talented german artist from an engraving in one of the american illustrated papers  it was an allegory representing mr davis in the act of signing a secession act or some such document  over him hovered the ghost of washington in warning attitude and in the background a troop of shadowy soldiers in continental uniform were limping with shoeless bandaged feet through a driving snowstorm valley forge was suggested of course  the copy seemed accurate and yet there was a discrepancy somewhere  after a long examination i discovered what it wasthe shadowy soldiers were all germans  jeff davis was a german even the hovering ghost was a german ghost  the artist had unconsciously worked his nationality into the picture  to tell the truth i am getting a little perplexed about john the baptist and his portraits  in france i finally grew reconciled to him as a frenchman here he is unquestionably an italian  what next  can it be possible that the painters make john the baptist a spaniard in madrid and an irishman in dublin  we took an open barouche and drove two miles out of milan to see ze echo as the guide expressed it  the road was smooth it was bordered by trees fields and grassy meadows and the soft air was filled with the odor of flowers  troops of picturesque peasant girls coming from work hooted at us shouted at us made all manner of game of us and entirely delighted me  my longcherished judgment was confirmed  i always did think those frowsy romantic unwashed peasant girls i had read so much about in poetry were a glaring fraud  we enjoyed our jaunt  it was an exhilarating relief from tiresome sightseeing  we distressed ourselves very little about the astonishing echo the guide talked so much about  we were growing accustomed to encomiums on wonders that too often proved no wonders at all  and so we were most happily disappointed to find in the sequel that the guide had even failed to rise to the magnitude of his subject  we arrived at a tumbledown old rookery called the palazzo simonettia massive hewnstone affair occupied by a family of ragged italians a goodlooking young girl conducted us to a window on the second floor which looked out on a court walled on three sides by tall buildings  she put her head out at the window and shouted  the echo answered more times than we could count  she took a speaking trumpet and through it she shouted sharp and quick a single ha  the echo answered  hahahahahaha ha haaaaa and finally went off into a rollicking convulsion of the jolliest laughter that could be imagined  it was so joyfulso long continuedso perfectly cordial and hearty that every body was forced to join in  there was no resisting it  then the girl took a gun and fired it  we stood ready to count the astonishing clatter of reverberations  we could not say one two three fast enough but we could dot our notebooks with our pencil points almost rapidly enough to take down a sort of shorthand report of the result my page revealed the following account  i could not keep up but i did as well as i could  i set down fiftytwo distinct repetitions and then the echo got the advantage of me  the doctor set down sixtyfour and thenceforth the echo moved too fast for him also  after the separate concussions could no longer be noted the reverberations dwindled to a wild longsustained clatter of sounds such as a watchmans rattle produces  it is likely that this is the most remarkable echo in the world  the doctor in jest offered to kiss the young girl and was taken a little aback when she said he might for a franc  the commonest gallantry compelled him to stand by his offer and so he paid the franc and took the kiss  she was a philosopher  she said a franc was a good thing to have and she did not care any thing for one paltry kiss because she had a million left  then our comrade always a shrewd businessman offered to take the whole cargo at thirty days but that little financial scheme was a failure     chapter xx  we left milan by rail  the cathedral six or seven miles behind us vast dreamy bluish snowclad mountains twenty miles in front of usthese were the accented points in the scenery  the more immediate scenery consisted of fields and farmhouses outside the car and a monsterheaded dwarf and a moustached woman inside it  these latter were not showpeople  alas deformity and female beards are too common in italy to attract attention  we passed through a range of wild picturesque hills steep wooded coneshaped with rugged crags projecting here and there and with dwellings and ruinous castles perched away up toward the drifting clouds we lunched at the curious old town of como at the foot of the lake and then took the small steamer and had an afternoons pleasure excursion to this placebellaggio  when we walked ashore a party of policemen people whose cocked hats and showy uniforms would shame the finest uniform in the military service of the united states put us into a little stone cell and locked us in  we had the whole passenger list for company but their room would have been preferable for there was no light there were no windows no ventilation  it was close and hot  we were much crowded  it was the black hole of calcutta on a small scale  presently a smoke rose about our feeta smoke that smelled of all the dead things of earth of all the putrefaction and corruption imaginable  we were there five minutes and when we got out it was hard to tell which of us carried the vilest fragrance  these miserable outcasts called that fumigating us and the term was a tame one indeed  they fumigated us to guard themselves against the cholera though we hailed from no infected port  we had left the cholera far behind us all the time  however they must keep epidemics away somehow or other and fumigation is cheaper than soap  they must either wash themselves or fumigate other people  some of the lower classes had rather die than wash but the fumigation of strangers causes them no pangs  they need no fumigation themselves  their habits make it unnecessary  they carry their preventive with them they sweat and fumigate all the day long  i trust i am a humble and a consistent christian  i try to do what is right  i know it is my duty to pray for them that despitefully use me and therefore hard as it is i shall still try to pray for these fumigating maccaronistuffing organgrinders  our hotel sits at the waters edgeat least its front garden doesand we walk among the shrubbery and smoke at twilight we look afar off at switzerland and the alps and feel an indolent willingness to look no closer we go down the steps and swim in the lake we take a shapely little boat and sail abroad among the reflections of the stars lie on the thwarts and listen to the distant laughter the singing the soft melody of flutes and guitars that comes floating across the water from pleasuring gondolas we close the evening with exasperating billiards on one of those same old execrable tables  a midnight luncheon in our ample bedchamber a final smoke in its contracted veranda facing the water the gardens and the mountains a summing up of the days events  then to bed with drowsy brains harassed with a mad panorama that mixes up pictures of france of italy of the ship of the ocean of home in grotesque and bewildering disorder  then a melting away of familiar faces of cities and of tossing waves into a great calm of forgetfulness and peace  after which the nightmare  breakfast in the morning and then the lake  i did not like it yesterday  i thought lake tahoe was much finer i have to confess now however that my judgment erred somewhat though not extravagantly  i always had an idea that como was a vast basin of water like tahoe shut in by great mountains  well the border of huge mountains is here but the lake itself is not a basin  it is as crooked as any brook and only from onequarter to twothirds as wide as the mississippi  there is not a yard of low ground on either side of it nothing but endless chains of mountains that spring abruptly from the waters edge and tower to altitudes varying from a thousand to two thousand feet  their craggy sides are clothed with vegetation and white specks of houses peep out from the luxuriant foliage everywhere they are even perched upon jutting and picturesque pinnacles a thousand feet above your head  again for miles along the shores handsome country seats surrounded by gardens and groves sit fairly in the water sometimes in nooks carved by nature out of the vinehung precipices and with no ingress or egress save by boats  some have great broad stone staircases leading down to the water with heavy stone balustrades ornamented with statuary and fancifully adorned with creeping vines and brightcolored flowersfor all the world like a drop curtain in a theatre and lacking nothing but longwaisted highheeled women and plumed gallants in silken tights coming down to go serenading in the splendid gondola in waiting  a great feature of comos attractiveness is the multitude of pretty houses and gardens that cluster upon its shores and on its mountain sides  they look so snug and so homelike and at eventide when every thing seems to slumber and the music of the vesper bells comes stealing over the water one almost believes that nowhere else than on the lake of como can there be found such a paradise of tranquil repose  from my window here in bellaggio i have a view of the other side of the lake now which is as beautiful as a picture  a scarred and wrinkled precipice rises to a height of eighteen hundred feet on a tiny bench half way up its vast wall sits a little snowflake of a church no bigger than a martinbox apparently skirting the base of the cliff are a hundred orange groves and gardens flecked with glimpses of the white dwellings that are buried in them in front three or four gondolas lie idle upon the waterand in the burnished mirror of the lake mountain chapel houses groves and boats are counterfeited so brightly and so clearly that one scarce knows where the reality leaves off and the reflection begins  the surroundings of this picture are fine  a mile away a groveplumed promontory juts far into the lake and glasses its palace in the blue depths in midstream a boat is cutting the shining surface and leaving a long track behind like a ray of light the mountains beyond are veiled in a dreamy purple haze far in the opposite direction a tumbled mass of domes and verdant slopes and valleys bars the lake and here indeed does distance lend enchantment to the viewfor on this broad canvas sun and clouds and the richest of atmospheres have blended a thousand tints together and over its surface the filmy lights and shadows drift hour after hour and glorify it with a beauty that seems reflected out of heaven itself  beyond all question this is the most voluptuous scene we have yet looked upon  last night the scenery was striking and picturesque  on the other side crags and trees and snowy houses were reflected in the lake with a wonderful distinctness and streams of light from many a distant window shot far abroad over the still waters  on this side near at hand great mansions white with moonlight glared out from the midst of masses of foliage that lay black and shapeless in the shadows that fell from the cliff aboveand down in the margin of the lake every feature of the weird vision was faithfully repeated  today we have idled through a wonder of a garden attached to a ducal estatebut enough of description is enough i judge  i suspect that this was the same place the gardeners son deceived the lady of lyons with but i do not know  you may have heard of the passage somewhere            a deep vale           shut out by alpine hills from the rude world           near a clear lake margined by fruits of gold           and whispering myrtles           glassing softest skies cloudless           save with rare and roseate shadows           a palace lifting to eternal heaven its marbled walls           from out a glossy bower of coolest foliage musical with birds  that is all very well except the clear part of the lake  it certainly is clearer than a great many lakes but how dull its waters are compared with the wonderful transparence of lake tahoe  i speak of the north shore of tahoe where one can count the scales on a trout at a depth of a hundred and eighty feet  i have tried to get this statement off at par here but with no success so i have been obliged to negotiate it at fifty percent discount  at this rate i find some takers perhaps the reader will receive it on the same termsninety feet instead of one hundred and eighty  but let it be remembered that those are forced termssheriffs sale prices  as far as i am privately concerned i abate not a jot of the original assertion that in those strangely magnifying waters one may count the scales on a trout a trout of the large kind at a depth of a hundred and eighty feetmay see every pebble on the bottommight even count a paper of draypins  people talk of the transparent waters of the mexican bay of acapulco but in my own experience i know they cannot compare with those i am speaking of  i have fished for trout in tahoe and at a measured depth of eightyfour feet i have seen them put their noses to the bait and i could see their gills open and shut  i could hardly have seen the trout themselves at that distance in the open air  as i go back in spirit and recall that noble sea reposing among the snowpeaks six thousand feet above the ocean the conviction comes strong upon me again that como would only seem a bedizened little courtier in that august presence  sorrow and misfortune overtake the legislature that still from year to year permits tahoe to retain its unmusical cognomen  tahoe  it suggests no crystal waters no picturesque shores no sublimity  tahoe for a sea in the clouds a sea that has character and asserts it in solemn calms at times at times in savage storms a sea whose royal seclusion is guarded by a cordon of sentinel peaks that lift their frosty fronts nine thousand feet above the level world a sea whose every aspect is impressive whose belongings are all beautiful whose lonely majesty types the deity  tahoe means grasshoppers  it means grasshopper soup  it is indian and suggestive of indians  they say it is piutepossibly it is digger i am satisfied it was named by the diggersthose degraded savages who roast their dead relatives then mix the human grease and ashes of bones with tar and gaum it thick all over their heads and foreheads and ears and go caterwauling about the hills and call it mourning  these are the gentry that named the lake  people say that tahoe means silver lakelimpid waterfalling leaf  bosh  it means grasshopper soup the favorite dish of the digger tribeand of the piutes as well  it isnt worth while in these practical times for people to talk about indian poetrythere never was any in themexcept in the fenimore cooper indians  but they are an extinct tribe that never existed  i know the noble red man  i have camped with the indians i have been on the warpath with them taken part in the chase with themfor grasshoppers helped them steal cattle i have roamed with them scalped them had them for breakfast  i would gladly eat the whole race if i had a chance  but i am growing unreliable  i will return to my comparison of the lakes  como is a little deeper than tahoe if people here tell the truth  they say it is eighteen hundred feet deep at this point but it does not look a dead enough blue for that  tahoe is one thousand five hundred and twentyfive feet deep in the centre by the state geologists measurement  they say the great peak opposite this town is five thousand feet high but i feel sure that three thousand feet of that statement is a good honest lie  the lake is a mile wide here and maintains about that width from this point to its northern extremitywhich is distant sixteen miles from here to its southern extremitysay fifteen milesit is not over half a mile wide in any place i should think  its snowclad mountains one hears so much about are only seen occasionally and then in the distance the alps  tahoe is from ten to eighteen miles wide and its mountains shut it in like a wall  their summits are never free from snow the year round  one thing about it is very strange it never has even a skim of ice upon its surface although lakes in the same range of mountains lying in a lower and warmer temperature freeze over in winter  it is cheerful to meet a shipmate in these outoftheway places and compare notes with him  we have found one of ours herean old soldier of the war who is seeking bloodless adventures and rest from his campaigns in these sunny landscolonel j  heron foster editor of a pittsburgh journal and a most estimable gentleman  as these sheets are being prepared for the press i am pained to learn of his decease shortly after his return homemt    chapter xxi  we voyaged by steamer down the lago di lecco through wild mountain scenery and by hamlets and villas and disembarked at the town of lecco they said it was two hours by carriage to the ancient city of bergamo and that we would arrive there in good season for the railway train  we got an open barouche and a wild boisterous driver and set out  it was delightful  we had a fast team and a perfectly smooth road  there were towering cliffs on our left and the pretty lago di lecco on our right and every now and then it rained on us  just before starting the driver picked up in the street a stump of a cigar an inch long and put it in his mouth  when he had carried it thus about an hour i thought it would be only christian charity to give him a light  i handed him my cigar which i had just lit and he put it in his mouth and returned his stump to his pocket  i never saw a more sociable man  at least i never saw a man who was more sociable on a short acquaintance  we saw interior italy now  the houses were of solid stone and not often in good repair  the peasants and their children were idle as a general thing and the donkeys and chickens made themselves at home in drawingroom and bedchamber and were not molested  the drivers of each and every one of the slowmoving marketcarts we met were stretched in the sun upon their merchandise sound a sleep  every three or four hundred yards it seemed to me we came upon the shrine of some saint or othera rude picture of him built into a huge cross or a stone pillar by the roadsidesome of the pictures of the saviour were curiosities in their way  they represented him stretched upon the cross his countenance distorted with agony  from the wounds of the crown of thorns from the pierced side from the mutilated hands and feet from the scourged bodyfrom every handbreadth of his person streams of blood were flowing  such a gory ghastly spectacle would frighten the children out of their senses i should think  there were some unique auxiliaries to the painting which added to its spirited effect  these were genuine wooden and iron implements and were prominently disposed round about the figure a bundle of nails the hammer to drive them the sponge the reed that supported it the cup of vinegar the ladder for the ascent of the cross the spear that pierced the saviours side  the crown of thorns was made of real thorns and was nailed to the sacred head  in some italian churchpaintings even by the old masters the saviour and the virgin wear silver or gilded crowns that are fastened to the pictured head with nails  the effect is as grotesque as it is incongruous  here and there on the fronts of roadside inns we found huge coarse frescoes of suffering martyrs like those in the shrines  it could not have diminished their sufferings any to be so uncouthly represented we were in the heart and home of priest craftof a happy cheerful contented ignorance superstition degradation poverty indolence and everlasting unaspiring worthlessness  and we said fervently it suits these people precisely let them enjoy it along with the other animals and heaven forbid that they be molested  we feel no malice toward these fumigators  we passed through the strangest funniest undreamptof old towns wedded to the customs and steeped in the dreams of the elder ages and perfectly unaware that the world turns round  and perfectly indifferent too as to whether it turns around or stands still  they have nothing to do but eat and sleep and sleep and eat and toil a little when they can get a friend to stand by and keep them awake  they are not paid for thinking they are not paid to fret about the worlds concerns  they were not respectable peoplethey were not worthy peoplethey were not learned and wise and brilliant peoplebut in their breasts all their stupid lives long resteth a peace that passeth understanding  how can men calling themselves men consent to be so degraded and happy  we whisked by many a gray old medieval castle clad thick with ivy that swung its green banners down from towers and turrets where once some old crusaders flag had floated  the driver pointed to one of these ancient fortresses and said i translate  do you see that great iron hook that projects from the wall just under the highest window in the ruined tower  we said we could not see it at such a distance but had no doubt it was there  well he said there is a legend connected with that iron hook nearly seven hundred years ago that castle was the property of the noble count luigi gennaro guido alphonso di genova  what was his other name  said dan  he had no other name  the name i have spoken was all the name he had he was the son of  poor but honest parentsthat is all rightnever mind the particulars go on with the legend                                 the legend  well then all the world at that time was in a wild excitement about the holy sepulchre  all the great feudal lords in europe were pledging their lands and pawning their plate to fit out menatarms so that they might join the grand armies of christendom and win renown in the holy wars  the count luigi raised money like the rest and one mild september morning armed with battleax portcullis and thundering culverin he rode through the greaves and bucklers of his donjonkeep with as gallant a troop of christian bandits as ever stepped in italy he had his sword excalibur with him  his beautiful countess and her young daughter waved him a tearful adieu from the batteringrams and buttresses of the fortress and he galloped away with a happy heart  he made a raid on a neighboring baron and completed his outfit with the booty secured  he then razed the castle to the ground massacred the family and moved on  they were hardy fellows in the grand old days of chivalry  alas  those days will never come again  count luigi grew high in fame in holy land  he plunged into the carnage of a hundred battles but his good excalibur always brought him out alive albeit often sorely wounded  his face became browned by exposure to the syrian sun in long marches he suffered hunger and thirst he pined in prisons he languished in loathsome plaguehospitals  and many and many a time he thought of his loved ones at home and wondered if all was well with them  but his heart said peace is not thy brother watching over thy household                                        fortytwo years waxed and waned the good fight was won godfrey reigned in jerusalemthe christian hosts reared the banner of the cross above the holy sepulchre  twilight was approaching  fifty harlequins in flowing robes approached this castle wearily for they were on foot and the dust upon their garments betokened that they had traveled far  they overtook a peasant and asked him if it were likely they could get food and a hospitable bed there for love of christian charity and if perchance a moral parlor entertainment might meet with generous countenancefor said they this exhibition hath no feature that could offend the most fastidious taste  marry quoth the peasant an it please your worships ye had better journey many a good rood hence with your juggling circus than trust your bones in yonder castle  how now sirrah  exclaimed the chief monk explain thy ribald speech or byr lady it shall go hard with thee  peace good mountebank i did but utter the truth that was in my heart san paolo be my witness that did ye but find the stout count leonardo in his cups sheer from the castles topmost battlements would he hurl ye all  alackaday the good lord luigi reigns not here in these sad times  the good lord luigi  aye none other please your worship  in his day the poor rejoiced in plenty and the rich he did oppress taxes were not known the fathers of the church waxed fat upon his bounty travelers went and came with none to interfere and whosoever would might tarry in his halls in cordial welcome and eat his bread and drink his wine withal  but woe is me some two and forty years agone the good count rode hence to fight for holy cross and many a year hath flown since word or token have we had of him  men say his bones lie bleaching in the fields of palestine  and now  now  god a mercy the cruel leonardo lords it in the castle  he wrings taxes from the poor he robs all travelers that journey by his gates he spends his days in feuds and murders and his nights in revel and debauch he roasts the fathers of the church upon his kitchen spits and enjoyeth the same calling it pastime  these thirty years luigis countess hath not been seen by any in all this land and many whisper that she pines in the dungeons of the castle for that she will not wed with leonardo saying her dear lord still liveth and that she will die ere she prove false to him  they whisper likewise that her daughter is a prisoner as well  nay good jugglers seek ye refreshment other wheres  twere better that ye perished in a christian way than that ye plunged from off yon dizzy tower  give ye goodday  god keep ye gentle knavefarewell  but heedless of the peasants warning the players moved straightway toward the castle  word was brought to count leonardo that a company of mountebanks besought his hospitality  tis well  dispose of them in the customary

fortified city of bergamo the renowned in history some threequarters of an hour before the train was ready to start  the place has thirty or forty thousand inhabitants and is remarkable for being the birthplace of harlequin  when we discovered that that legend of our driver took to itself a new interest in our eyes  rested and refreshed we took the rail happy and contented  i shall not tarry to speak of the handsome lago di gardi its stately castle that holds in its stony bosom the secrets of an age so remote that even tradition goeth not back to it the imposing mountain scenery that ennobles the landscape thereabouts nor yet of ancient padua or haughty verona nor of their montagues and capulets their famous balconies and tombs of juliet and romeo et al but hurry straight to the ancient city of the sea the widowed bride of the adriatic  it was a long long ride but toward evening as we sat silent and hardly conscious of where we weresubdued into that meditative calm that comes so surely after a conversational stormsome one shouted venice  and sure enough afloat on the placid sea a league away lay a great city with its towers and domes and steeples drowsing in a golden mist of sunset     chapter xxii  this venice which was a haughty invincible magnificent republic for nearly fourteen hundred years whose armies compelled the worlds applause whenever and wherever they battled whose navies well nigh held dominion of the seas and whose merchant fleets whitened the remotest oceans with their sails and loaded these piers with the products of every clime is fallen a prey to poverty neglect and melancholy decay  six hundred years ago venice was the autocrat of commerce her mart was the great commercial centre the distributinghouse from whence the enormous trade of the orient was spread abroad over the western world  today her piers are deserted her warehouses are empty her merchant fleets are vanished her armies and her navies are but memories  her glory is departed and with her crumbling grandeur of wharves and palaces about her she sits among her stagnant lagoons forlorn and beggared forgotten of the world  she that in her palmy days commanded the commerce of a hemisphere and made the weal or woe of nations with a beck of her puissant finger is become the humblest among the peoples of the earth a peddler of glass beads for women and trifling toys and trinkets for schoolgirls and children  the venerable mother of the republics is scarce a fit subject for flippant speech or the idle gossipping of tourists  it seems a sort of sacrilege to disturb the glamour of old romance that pictures her to us softly from afar off as through a tinted mist and curtains her ruin and her desolation from our view  one ought indeed to turn away from her rags her poverty and her humiliation and think of her only as she was when she sunk the fleets of charlemagne when she humbled frederick barbarossa or waved her victorious banners above the battlements of constantinople  we reached venice at eight in the evening and entered a hearse belonging to the grand hotel deurope  at any rate it was more like a hearse than any thing else though to speak by the card it was a gondola  and this was the storied gondola of venicethe fairy boat in which the princely cavaliers of the olden time were wont to cleave the waters of the moonlit canals and look the eloquence of love into the soft eyes of patrician beauties while the gay gondolier in silken doublet touched his guitar and sang as only gondoliers can sing  this the famed gondola and this the gorgeous gondolierthe one an inky rusty old canoe with a sable hearsebody clapped on to the middle of it and the other a mangy barefooted guttersnipe with a portion of his raiment on exhibition which should have been sacred from public scrutiny  presently as he turned a corner and shot his hearse into a dismal ditch between two long rows of towering untenanted buildings the gay gondolier began to sing true to the traditions of his race  i stood it a little while  then i said  now here roderigo gonzales michael angelo im a pilgrim and im a stranger but i am not going to have my feelings lacerated by any such caterwauling as that  if that goes on one of us has got to take water it is enough that my cherished dreams of venice have been blighted forever as to the romantic gondola and the gorgeous gondolier this system of destruction shall go no farther i will accept the hearse under protest and you may fly your flag of truce in peace but here i register a dark and bloody oath that you shant sing  another yelp and overboard you go  i began to feel that the old venice of song and story had departed forever  but i was too hasty  in a few minutes we swept gracefully out into the grand canal and under the mellow moonlight the venice of poetry and romance stood revealed  right from the waters edge rose long lines of stately palaces of marble gondolas were gliding swiftly hither and thither and disappearing suddenly through unsuspected gates and alleys ponderous stone bridges threw their shadows athwart the glittering waves there was life and motion everywhere and yet everywhere there was a hush a stealthy sort of stillness that was suggestive of secret enterprises of bravoes and of lovers and clad half in moonbeams and half in mysterious shadows the grim old mansions of the republic seemed to have an expression about them of having an eye out for just such enterprises as these at that same moment  music came floating over the watersvenice was complete  it was a beautiful picturevery soft and dreamy and beautiful  but what was this venice to compare with the venice of midnight  nothing  there was a fetea grand fete in honor of some saint who had been instrumental in checking the cholera three hundred years ago and all venice was abroad on the water  it was no common affair for the venetians did not know how soon they might need the saints services again now that the cholera was spreading every where  so in one vast spacesay a third of a mile wide and two miles longwere collected two thousand gondolas and every one of them had from two to ten twenty and even thirty colored lanterns suspended about it and from four to a dozen occupants  just as far as the eye could reach these painted lights were massed together like a vast garden of manycolored flowers except that these blossoms were never still they were ceaselessly gliding in and out and mingling together and seducing you into bewildering attempts to follow their mazy evolutions  here and there a strong red green or blue glare from a rocket that was struggling to get away splendidly illuminated all the boats around it  every gondola that swam by us with its crescents and pyramids and circles of colored lamps hung aloft and lighting up the faces of the young and the sweetscented and lovely below was a picture and the reflections of those lights so long so slender so numberless so manycolored and so distorted and wrinkled by the waves was a picture likewise and one that was enchantingly beautiful  many and many a party of young ladies and gentlemen had their state gondolas handsomely decorated and ate supper on board bringing their swallowtailed whitecravatted varlets to wait upon them and having their tables tricked out as if for a bridal supper  they had brought along the costly globe lamps from their drawingrooms and the lace and silken curtains from the same places i suppose  and they had also brought pianos and guitars and they played and sang operas while the plebeian paperlanterned gondolas from the suburbs and the back alleys crowded around to stare and listen  there was music every wherechoruses string bands brass bands flutes every thing  i was so surrounded walled in with music magnificence and loveliness that i became inspired with the spirit of the scene and sang one tune myself  however when i observed that the other gondolas had sailed away and my gondolier was preparing to go overboard i stopped  the fete was magnificent  they kept it up the whole night long and i never enjoyed myself better than i did while it lasted  what a funny old city this queen of the adriatic is  narrow streets vast gloomy marble palaces black with the corroding damps of centuries and all partly submerged no dry land visible any where and no sidewalks worth mentioning if you want to go to church to the theatre or to the restaurant you must call a gondola  it must be a paradise for cripples for verily a man has no use for legs here  for a day or two the place looked so like an overflowed arkansas town because of its currentless waters laving the very doorsteps of all the houses and the cluster of boats made fast under the windows or skimming in and out of the alleys and byways that i could not get rid of the impression that there was nothing the matter here but a spring freshet and that the river would fall in a few weeks and leave a dirty highwater mark on the houses and the streets full of mud and rubbish  in the glare of day there is little poetry about venice but under the charitable moon her stained palaces are white again their battered sculptures are hidden in shadows and the old city seems crowned once more with the grandeur that was hers five hundred years ago  it is easy then in fancy to people these silent canals with plumed gallants and fair ladieswith shylocks in gaberdine and sandals venturing loans upon the rich argosies of venetian commercewith othellos and desdemonas with iagos and roderigoswith noble fleets and victorious legions returning from the wars  in the treacherous sunlight we see venice decayed forlorn povertystricken and commercelessforgotten and utterly insignificant  but in the moonlight her fourteen centuries of greatness fling their glories about her and once more is she the princeliest among the nations of the earth            there is a glorious city in the sea           the sea is in the broad the narrow streets           ebbing and flowing and the saltsea weed           clings to the marble of her palaces           no track of men no footsteps to and fro           lead to her gates  the path lies oer the sea           invisible and from the land we went           as to a floating citysteering in           and gliding up her streets as in a dream           so smoothly silentlyby many a dome           mosquelike and many a stately portico           the statues ranged along an azure sky           by many a pile in more than eastern pride           of old the residence of merchant kings           the fronts of some tho time had shatterd them           still glowing with the richest hues of art           as tho the wealth within them had run oer  what would one naturally wish to see first in venice  the bridge of sighs of courseand next the church and the great square of st mark the bronze horses and the famous lion of st mark  we intended to go to the bridge of sighs but happened into the ducal palace firsta building which necessarily figures largely in venetian poetry and tradition  in the senate chamber of the ancient republic we wearied our eyes with staring at acres of historical paintings by tintoretto and paul veronese but nothing struck us forcibly except the one thing that strikes all strangers forciblya black square in the midst of a gallery of portraits  in one long row around the great hall were painted the portraits of the doges of venice venerable fellows with flowing white beards for of the three hundred senators eligible to the office the oldest was usually chosen doge and each had its complimentary inscription attachedtill you came to the place that should have had marino falieros picture in it and that was blank and blackblank except that it bore a terse inscription saying that the conspirator had died for his crime  it seemed cruel to keep that pitiless inscription still staring from the walls after the unhappy wretch had been in his grave five hundred years  at the head of the giants staircase where marino faliero was beheaded and where the doges were crowned in ancient times two small slits in the stone wall were pointed outtwo harmless insignificant orifices that would never attract a strangers attentionyet these were the terrible lions mouths  the heads were gone knocked off by the french during their occupation of venice but these were the throats down which went the anonymous accusation thrust in secretly at dead of night by an enemy that doomed many an innocent man to walk the bridge of sighs and descend into the dungeon which none entered and hoped to see the sun again  this was in the old days when the patricians alone governed venicethe common herd had no vote and no voice  there were one thousand five hundred patricians from these three hundred senators were chosen from the senators a doge and a council of ten were selected and by secret ballot the ten chose from their own number a council of three all these were government spies then and every spy was under surveillance himselfmen spoke in whispers in venice and no man trusted his neighbornot always his own brother  no man knew who the council of three werenot even the senate not even the doge the members of that dread tribunal met at night in a chamber to themselves masked and robed from head to foot in scarlet cloaks and did not even know each other unless by voice  it was their duty to judge heinous political crimes and from their sentence there was no appeal  a nod to the executioner was sufficient  the doomed man was marched down a hall and out at a doorway into the covered bridge of sighs through it and into the dungeon and unto his death  at no time in his transit was he visible to any save his conductor  if a man had an enemy in those old days the cleverest thing he could do was to slip a note for the council of three into the lions mouth saying this man is plotting against the government  if the awful three found no proof ten to one they would drown him anyhow because he was a deep rascal since his plots were unsolvable  masked judges and masked executioners with unlimited power and no appeal from their judgements in that hard cruel age were not likely to be lenient with men they suspected yet could not convict  we walked through the hall of the council of ten and presently entered the infernal den of the council of three  the table around which they had sat was there still and likewise the stations where the masked inquisitors and executioners formerly stood frozen upright and silent till they received a bloody order and then without a word moved off like the inexorable machines they were to carry it out  the frescoes on the walls were startlingly suited to the place  in all the other saloons the halls the great state chambers of the palace the walls and ceilings were bright with gilding rich with elaborate carving and resplendent with gallant pictures of venetian victories in war and venetian display in foreign courts and hallowed with portraits of the virgin the saviour of men and the holy saints that preached the gospel of peace upon earthbut here in dismal contrast were none but pictures of death and dreadful sufferingnot a living figure but was writhing in torture not a dead one but was smeared with blood gashed with wounds and distorted with the agonies that had taken away its life  from the palace to the gloomy prison is but a stepone might almost jump across the narrow canal that intervenes  the ponderous stone bridge of sighs crosses it at the second storya bridge that is a covered tunnel you can not be seen when you walk in it  it is partitioned lengthwise and through one compartment walked such as bore light sentences in ancient times and through the other marched sadly the wretches whom the three had doomed to lingering misery and utter oblivion in the dungeons or to sudden and mysterious death  down below the level of the water by the light of smoking torches we were shown the damp thickwalled cells where many a proud patricians life was eaten away by the longdrawn miseries of solitary imprisonmentwithout light air books naked unshaven uncombed covered with vermin his useless tongue forgetting its office with none to speak to the days and nights of his life no longer marked but merged into one eternal eventless night far away from all cheerful sounds buried in the silence of a tomb forgotten by his helpless friends and his fate a dark mystery to them forever losing his own memory at last and knowing no more who he was or how he came there devouring the loaf of bread and drinking the water that were thrust into the cell by unseen hands and troubling his worn spirit no more with hopes and fears and doubts and longings to be free ceasing to scratch vain prayers and complainings on walls where none not even himself could see them and resigning himself to hopeless apathy driveling childishness lunacy  many and many a sorrowful story like this these stony walls could tell if they could but speak  in a little narrow corridor near by they showed us where many a prisoner after lying in the dungeons until he was forgotten by all save his persecutors was brought by masked executioners and garroted or sewed up in a sack passed through a little window to a boat at dead of night and taken to some remote spot and drowned  they used to show to visitors the implements of torture wherewith the three were wont to worm secrets out of the accusedvillainous machines for crushing thumbs the stocks where a prisoner sat immovable while water fell drop by drop upon his head till the torture was more than humanity could bear and a devilish contrivance of steel which inclosed a prisoners head like a shell and crushed it slowly by means of a screw  it bore the stains of blood that had trickled through its joints long ago and on one side it had a projection whereon the torturer rested his elbow comfortably and bent down his ear to catch the moanings of the sufferer perishing within  of course we went to see the venerable relic of the ancient glory of venice with its pavements worn and broken by the passing feet of a thousand years of plebeians and patriciansthe cathedral of st mark it is built entirely of precious marbles brought from the orient nothing in its composition is domestic  its hoary traditions make it an object of absorbing interest to even the most careless stranger and thus far it had interest for me but no further  i could not go into ecstasies over its coarse mosaics its unlovely byzantine architecture or its five hundred curious interior columns from as many distant quarries  every thing was worn outevery block of stone was smooth and almost shapeless with the polishing hands and shoulders of loungers who devoutly idled here in bygone centuries and have died and gone to the devno simply died i mean  under the altar repose the ashes of st markand matthew luke and john too for all i know  venice reveres those relics above all things earthly  for fourteen hundred years st mark has been her patron saint every thing about the city seems to be named after him or so named as to refer to him in some wayso named or some purchase rigged in some way to scrape a sort of hurrahing acquaintance with him  that seems to be the idea  to be on good terms with st mark seems to be the very summit of venetian ambition  they say st mark had a tame lion and used to travel with himand every where that st mark went the lion was sure to go  it was his protector his friend his librarian  and so the winged lion of st mark with the open bible under his paw is a favorite emblem in the grand old city  it casts its shadow from the most ancient pillar in venice in the grand square of st mark upon the throngs of free citizens below and has so done for many a long century  the winged lion is found every whereand doubtless here where the winged lion is no harm can come  st mark died at alexandria in egypt  he was martyred i think however that has nothing to do with my legend  about the founding of the city of venicesay four hundred and fifty years after christfor venice is much younger than any other italian city a priest dreamed that an angel told him that until the remains of st mark were brought to venice the city could never rise to high distinction among the nations that the body must be captured brought to the city and a magnificent church built over it and that if ever the venetians allowed the saint to be removed from his new restingplace in that day venice would perish from off the face of the earth  the priest proclaimed his dream and forthwith venice set about procuring the corpse of st mark  one expedition after another tried and failed but the project was never abandoned during four hundred years  at last it was secured by stratagem in the year eight hundred and something  the commander of a venetian expedition disguised himself stole the bones separated them and packed them in vessels filled with lard  the religion of mahomet causes its devotees to abhor anything that is in the nature of pork and so when the christian was stopped by the officers at the gates of the city they only glanced once into his precious baskets then turned up their noses at the unholy lard and let him go  the bones were buried in the vaults of the grand cathedral which had been waiting long years to receive them and thus the safety and the greatness of venice were secured  and to this day there be those in venice who believe that if those holy ashes were stolen away the ancient city would vanish like a dream and its foundations be buried forever in the unremembering sea     chapter xxiii  the venetian gondola is as free and graceful in its gliding movement as a serpent  it is twenty or thirty feet long and is narrow and deep like a canoe its sharp bow and stern sweep upward from the water like the horns of a crescent with the abruptness of the curve slightly modified  the bow is ornamented with a steel comb with a battleax attachment which threatens to cut passing boats in two occasionally but never does  the gondola is painted black because in the zenith of venetian magnificence the gondolas became too gorgeous altogether and the senate decreed that all such display must cease and a solemn unembellished black be substituted  if the truth were known it would doubtless appear that rich plebeians grew too prominent in their affectation of patrician show on the grand canal and required a wholesome snubbing  reverence for the hallowed past and its traditions keeps the dismal fashion in force now that the compulsion exists no longer  so let it remain  it is the color of mourning  venice mourns  the stern of the boat is decked over and the gondolier stands there  he uses a single oara long blade of course for he stands nearly erect  a wooden peg a foot and a half high with two slight crooks or curves in one side of it and one in the other projects above the starboard gunwale  against that peg the gondolier takes a purchase with his oar changing it at intervals to the other side of the peg or dropping it into another of the crooks as the steering of the craft may demandand how in the world he can back and fill shoot straight ahead or flirt suddenly around a corner and make the oar stay in those insignificant notches is a problem to me and a never diminishing matter of interest  i am afraid i study the gondoliers marvelous skill more than i do the sculptured palaces we glide among  he cuts a corner so closely now and then or misses another gondola by such an imperceptible hairbreadth that i feel myself scrooching as the children say just as one does when a buggy wheel grazes his elbow  but he makes all his calculations with the nicest precision and goes darting in and out among a broadway confusion of busy craft with the easy confidence of the educated hackman  he never makes a mistake  sometimes we go flying down the great canals at such a gait that we can get only the merest glimpses into front doors and again in obscure alleys in the suburbs we put on a solemnity suited to the silence the mildew the stagnant waters the clinging weeds the deserted houses and the general lifelessness of the place and move to the spirit of grave meditation  the gondolier is a picturesque rascal for all he wears no satin harness no plumed bonnet no silken tights  his attitude is stately he is lithe and supple all his movements are full of grace  when his long canoe and his fine figure towering from its high perch on the stern are cut against the evening sky they make a picture that is very novel and striking to a foreign eye  we sit in the cushioned carriagebody of a cabin with the curtains drawn and smoke or read or look out upon the passing boats the houses the bridges the people and enjoy ourselves much more than we could in a buggy jolting over our cobblestone pavements at home  this is the gentlest pleasantest locomotion we have ever known  but it seems queerever so queerto see a boat doing duty as a private carriage  we see business men come to the front door step into a gondola instead of a street car and go off down town to the countingroom  we see visiting young ladies stand on the stoop and laugh and kiss goodbye and flirt their fans and say come soonnow doyouve been just as mean as ever you can bemothers dying to see youand weve moved into the new house o such a love of a placeso convenient to the post office and the church and the young mens christian association and we do have such fishing and such carrying on and such swimmingmatches in the back yardoh you must comeno distance at all and if you go down through by st marks and the bridge of sighs and cut through the alley and come up by the church of santa maria dei frari and into the grand canal there isnt a bit of currentnow do come sally mariabybye and then the little humbug trips down the steps jumps into the gondola says under her breath disagreeable old thing i hope she wont goes skimming away round the corner and the other girl slams the street door and says well that inflictions over any way but i suppose ive got to go and see hertiresome stuckup thing human nature appears to be just the same all over the world  we see the diffident young man mild of moustache affluent of hair indigent of brain elegant of costume drive up to her fathers mansion tell his hackman to bail out and wait start fearfully up the steps and meet the old gentleman right on the thresholdhear him ask what street the new british bank is inas if that were what he came forand then bounce into his boat and skurry away with his coward heart in his bootssee him come sneaking around the corner again directly with a crack of the curtain open toward the old gentlemans disappearing gondola and out scampers his susan with a flock of little italian endearments fluttering from her lips and goes to drive with him in the watery avenues down toward the rialto  we see the ladies go out shopping in the most natural way and flit from street to street and from store to store just in the good old fashion except that they leave the gondola instead of a private carriage waiting at the curbstone a couple of hours for themwaiting while they make the nice young clerks pull down tons and tons of silks and velvets and moire antiques and those things and then they buy a paper of pins and go paddling away to confer the rest of their disastrous patronage on some other firm  and they always have their purchases sent home just in the good old way  human nature is very much the same all over the world and it is so like my dear native home to see a venetian lady go into a store and buy ten cents worth of blue ribbon and have it sent home in a scow  ah it is these little touches of nature that move one to tears in these faroff foreign lands  we see little girls and boys go out in gondolas with their nurses for an airing  we see staid families with prayerbook and beads enter the gondola dressed in their sunday best and float away to church  and at midnight we see the theatre break up and discharge its swarm of hilarious youth and beauty we hear the cries of the hackmangondoliers and behold the struggling crowd jump aboard and the black multitude of boats go skimming down the moonlit avenues we see them separate here and there and disappear up divergent streets we hear the faint sounds of laughter and of shouted farewells floating up out of the distance and then the strange pageant being gone we have lonely stretches of glittering water of stately buildingsof blotting shadowsof weird stone faces creeping into the moonlightof deserted bridgesof motionless boats at anchor  and over all broods that mysterious stillness that stealthy quiet that befits so well this old dreaming venice  we have been pretty much every where in our gondola  we have bought beads and photographs in the stores and wax matches in the great square of st mark  the last remark suggests a digression  every body goes to this vast square in the evening  the military bands play in the centre of it and countless couples of ladies and gentlemen promenade up and down on either side and platoons of them are constantly drifting away toward the old cathedral and by the venerable column with the winged lion of st mark on its top and out to where the boats lie moored and other platoons are as constantly arriving from the gondolas and joining the great throng  between the promenaders and the sidewalks are seated hundreds and hundreds of people at small tables smoking and taking granita a first cousin to icecream on the sidewalks are more employing themselves in the same way  the shops in the first floor of the tall rows of buildings that wall in three sides of the square are brilliantly lighted the air is filled with music and merry voices and altogether the scene is as bright and spirited and full of cheerfulness as any man could desire  we enjoy it thoroughly  very many of the young women are exceedingly pretty and dress with rare good taste  we are gradually and laboriously learning the illmanners of staring them unflinchingly in the facenot because such conduct is agreeable to us but because it is the custom of the country and they say the girls like it  we wish to learn all the curious outlandish ways of all the different countries so that we can show off and astonish people when we get home  we wish to excite the envy of our untraveled friends with our strange foreign fashions which we cant shake off  all our passengers are paying strict attention to this thing with the end in view which i have mentioned  the gentle reader will never never know what a consummate ass he can become until he goes abroad  i speak now of course in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been abroad and therefore is not already a consummate ass  if the case be otherwise i beg his pardon and extend to him the cordial hand of fellowship and call him brother  i shall always delight to meet an ass after my own heart when i shall have finished my travels  on this subject let me remark that there are americans abroad in italy who have actually forgotten their mother tongue in three monthsforgot it in france  they can not even write their address in english in a hotel register  i append these evidences which i copied verbatim from the register of a hotel in a certain italian city       john p whitcomb etats unis       wm l ainsworth travailleur he meant traveler i suppose       etats unis       george p morton et fils damerique       lloyd b  williams et trois amis ville de boston amerique       j ellsworth baker tout de suite de france place de      naissance amerique destination la grand bretagne  i love this sort of people  a lady passenger of ours tells of a fellowcitizen of hers who spent eight weeks in paris and then returned home and addressed his dearest old bosom friend herbert as mr erbare  he apologized though and said pon my soul it is aggravating but i cahnt help iti have got so used to speaking nothing but french my dear erbaredamme there it goes againgot so used to french pronunciation that i cahnt get rid of itit is positively annoying i assure you  this entertaining idiot whose name was gordon allowed himself to be hailed three times in the street before he paid any attention and then begged a thousand pardons and said he had grown so accustomed to hearing himself addressed as msieu gorrdong with a roll to the r that he had forgotten the legitimate sound of his name he wore a rose in his buttonhole he gave the french salutationtwo flips of the hand in front of the face he called paris pairree in ordinary english conversation he carried envelopes bearing foreign postmarks protruding from his breastpocket he cultivated a moustache and imperial and did what else he could to suggest to the beholder his pet fancy that he resembled louis napoleonand in a spirit of thankfulness which is entirely unaccountable considering the slim foundation there was for it he praised his maker that he was as he was and went on enjoying his little life just the same as if he really had been deliberately designed and erected by the great architect of the universe  think of our whitcombs and our ainsworths and our williamses writing themselves down in dilapidated french in foreign hotel registers  we laugh at englishmen when we are at home for sticking so sturdily to their national ways and customs but we look back upon it from abroad very forgivingly  it is not pleasant to see an american thrusting his nationality forward obtrusively in a foreign land but oh it is pitiable to see him making of himself a thing that is neither male nor female neither fish flesh nor fowla poor miserable hermaphrodite frenchman  among a long list of churches art galleries and such things visited by us in venice i shall mention only onethe church of santa maria dei frari  it is about five hundred years old i believe and stands on twelve hundred thousand piles  in it lie the body of canova and the heart of titian under magnificent monuments  titian died at the age of almost one hundred years  a plague which swept away fifty thousand lives was raging at the time and there is notable evidence of the reverence in which the great painter was held in the fact that to him alone the state permitted a public funeral in all that season of terror and death  in this church also is a monument to the doge foscari whose name a once resident of venice lord byron has made permanently famous  the monument to the doge giovanni pesaro in this church is a curiosity in the way of mortuary adornment  it is eighty feet high and is fronted like some fantastic pagan temple  against it stand four colossal nubians as black as night dressed in white marble garments  the black legs are bare and through rents in sleeves and breeches the skin of shiny black marble shows  the artist was as ingenious as his funeral designs were absurd  there are two bronze skeletons bearing scrolls and two great dragons uphold the sarcophagus  on high amid all this grotesqueness sits the departed doge  in the conventual buildings attached to this church are the state archives of venice  we did not see them but they are said to number millions of documents  they are the records of centuries of the most watchful observant and suspicious government that ever existedin which every thing was written down and nothing spoken out  they fill nearly three hundred rooms  among them are manuscripts from the archives of nearly two thousand families monasteries and convents  the secret history of venice for a thousand years is hereits plots its hidden trials its assassinations its commissions of hireling spies and masked bravoesfood ready to hand for a world of dark and mysterious romances  yes i think we have seen all of venice  we have seen in these old churches a profusion of costly and elaborate sepulchre ornamentation such as we never dreampt of before  we have stood in the dim religious light of these hoary sanctuaries in the midst of long ranks of dusty monuments and effigies of the great dead of venice until we seemed drifting back back back into the solemn past and looking upon the scenes and mingling with the peoples of a remote antiquity  we have been in a halfwaking sort of dream all the time  i do not know how else to describe the feeling  a part of our being has remained still in the nineteenth century while another part of it has seemed in some unaccountable way walking among the phantoms of the tenth  we have seen famous pictures until our eyes are weary with looking at them and refuse to find interest in them any longer  and what wonder when there are twelve hundred pictures by palma the younger in venice and fifteen hundred by tintoretto  and behold there are titians and the works of other artists in proportion  we have seen titians celebrated cain and abel his david and goliah his abrahams sacrifice  we have seen tintorettos monster picture which is seventyfour feet long and i do not know how many feet high and thought it a very commodious picture we have seen pictures of martyrs enough and saints enough to regenerate the world  i ought not to confess it but still since one has no opportunity in america to acquire a critical judgment in art and since i could not hope to become educated in it in europe in a few short weeks i may therefore as well acknowledge with such apologies as may be due that to me it seemed that when i had seen one of these martyrs i had seen them all  they all have a marked family resemblance to each other they dress alike in coarse monkish robes and sandals they are all bald headed they all stand in about the same attitude and without exception they are gazing heavenward with countenances which the ainsworths the mortons and the williamses et fils inform me are full of expression  to me there is nothing tangible about these imaginary portraits nothing that i can grasp and take a living interest in  if great titian had only been gifted with prophecy and had skipped a martyr and gone over to england and painted a portrait of shakspeare even as a youth which we could all have confidence in now the world down to the latest generations would have forgiven him the lost martyr in the rescued seer  i think posterity could have spared one more martyr for the sake of a great historical picture of titians time and painted by his brushsuch as columbus returning in chains from the discovery of a world for instance  the old masters did paint some venetian historical pictures and these we did not tire of looking at notwithstanding representations of the formal introduction of defunct doges to the virgin mary in regions beyond the clouds clashed rather harshly with the proprieties it seemed to us  but humble as we are and unpretending in the matter of art our researches among the painted monks and martyrs have not been wholly in vain  we have striven hard to learn  we have had some success  we have mastered some things possibly of trifling import in the eyes of the learned but to us they give pleasure and we take as much pride in our little acquirements as do others who have learned far more and we love to display them full as well  when we see a monk going about with a lion and looking tranquilly up to heaven we know that that is st mark  when we see a monk with a book and a pen looking tranquilly up to heaven trying to think of a word we know that that is st matthew  when we see a monk sitting on a rock looking tranquilly up to heaven with a human skull beside him and without other baggage we know that that is st jerome  because we know that he always went flying light in the matter of baggage  when we see a party looking tranquilly up to heaven unconscious that his body is shot through and through with arrows we know that that is st sebastian  when we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven but having no trademark we always ask who those parties are  we do this because we humbly wish to learn  we have seen thirteen thousand st jeromes and twentytwo thousand st marks and sixteen thousand st matthews and sixty thousand st sebastians and four millions of assorted monks undesignated and we feel encouraged to believe that when we have seen some more of these various pictures and had a larger experience we shall begin to take an absorbing interest in them like our cultivated countrymen from amerique  now it does give me real pain to speak in this almost unappreciative way of the old masters and their martyrs because good friends of mine in the shipfriends who do thoroughly and conscientiously appreciate them and are in every way competent to discriminate between good pictures and inferior oneshave urged me for my own sake not to make public the fact that i lack this appreciation and this critical discrimination myself  i believe that what i have written and may still write about pictures will give them pain and i am honestly sorry for it  i even promised that i would hide my uncouth sentiments in my own breast  but alas  i never could keep a promise  i do not blame myself for this weakness because the fault must lie in my physical organization  it is likely that such a very liberal amount of space was given to the organ which enables me to make promises that the organ which should enable me to keep them was crowded out  but i grieve not  i like no halfway things  i had rather have one faculty nobly developed than two faculties of mere ordinary capacity  i certainly meant to keep that promise but i find i can not do it  it is impossible to travel through italy without speaking of pictures and can i see them through others eyes  if i did not so delight in the grand pictures that are spread before me every day of my life by that monarch of all the old masters nature i should come to believe sometimes that i had in me no appreciation of the beautiful whatsoever  it seems to me that whenever i glory to think that for once i have discovered an ancient painting that is beautiful and worthy of all praise the pleasure it gives me is an infallible proof that it is not a beautiful picture and not in any wise worthy of commendation  this very thing has occurred more times than i can mention in venice  in every single instance the guide has crushed out my swelling enthusiasm with the remark  it is nothingit is of the renaissance  i did not know what in the mischief the renaissance was and so always i had to simply say  ah so it isi had not observed it before  i could not bear to be ignorant before a cultivated negro the offspring of a south carolina slave  but it occurred too often for even my selfcomplacency did that exasperating it is nothingit is of the renaissance  i said at last  who is this renaissance  where did he come from  who gave him permission to cram the republic with his execrable daubs  we learned then that renaissance was not a man that renaissance was a term used to signify what was at best but an imperfect rejuvenation of art  the guide said that after titians time and the time of the other great names we had grown so familiar with high art declined then it partially rose againan inferior sort of painters sprang up and these shabby pictures were the work of their hands  then i said in my heat that i wished to goodness high art had declined five hundred years sooner  the renaissance pictures suit me very well though sooth to say its school were too much given to painting real men and did not indulge enough in martyrs  the guide i have spoken of is the only one we have had yet who knew any thing  he was born in south carolina of slave parents  they came to venice while he was an infant  he has grown up here  he is well educated  he reads writes and speaks english italian spanish and french with perfect facility is a worshipper of art and thoroughly conversant with it knows the history of venice by heart and never tires of talking of her illustrious career  he dresses better than any of us i think and is daintily polite  negroes are deemed as good as white people in venice and so this man feels no desire to go back to his native land  his judgment is correct  i have had another shave  i was writing in our front room this afternoon and trying hard to keep my attention on my work and refrain from looking out upon the canal  i was resisting the soft influences of the climate as well as i could and endeavoring to overcome the desire to be indolent and happy  the boys sent for a barber  they asked me if i would be shaved  i reminded them of my tortures in genoa milan como of my declaration that i would suffer no more on italian soil  i said not any for me if you please  i wrote on  the barber began on the doctor  i heard him say  dan this is the easiest shave i have had since we left the ship  he said again presently  why dan a man could go to sleep with this man shaving him  dan took the chair  then he said  why this is titian  this is one of the old masters  i wrote on  directly dan said  doctor it is perfect luxury  the ships barber isnt any thing to him  my rough beard wee distressing me beyond measure  the barber was rolling up his apparatus  the temptation was too strong  i said  hold on please  shave me also  i sat down in the chair and closed my eyes  the barber soaped my face and then took his razor and gave me a rake that well nigh threw me into convulsions  i jumped out of the chair dan and the doctor were both wiping blood off their faces and laughing  i said it was a mean disgraceful fraud  they said that the misery of this shave had gone so far beyond any thing they had ever experienced before that they could not bear the idea of losing such a chance of hearing a cordial opinion from me on the subject  it was shameful  but there was no help for it  the skinning was begun and had to be finished  the tears flowed with every rake and so did the fervent execrations  the barber grew confused and brought blood every time  i think the boys enjoyed it better than any thing they have seen or heard since they left home  we have seen the campanile and byrons house and balbis the geographer and the palaces of all the ancient dukes and doges of venice and we have seen their effeminate descendants airing their nobility in fashionable french attire in the grand square of st mark and eating ices and drinking cheap wines instead of wearing gallant coats of mail and destroying fleets and armies as their great ancestors did in the days of venetian glory  we have seen no bravoes with poisoned stilettos no masks no wild carnival but we have seen the ancient pride of venice the grim bronze horses that figure in a thousand legends  venice may well cherish them for they are the only horses she ever had  it is said there are hundreds of people in this curious city who never have seen a living horse in their lives  it is entirely true no doubt  and so having satisfied ourselves we depart tomorrow and leave the venerable queen of the republics to summon her vanished ships and marshal her shadowy armies and know again in dreams the pride of her old renown     chapter xxiv  some of the quaker citys passengers had arrived in venice from switzerland and other lands before we left there and others were expected every day  we heard of no casualties among them and no sickness  we were a little fatigued with sight seeing and so we rattled through a good deal of country by rail without caring to stop  i took few notes i find no mention of bologna in my memorandum book except that we arrived there in good season but saw none of the sausages for which the place is so justly celebrated  pistoia awoke but a passing interest  florence pleased us for a while  i think we appreciated the great figure of david in the grand square and the sculptured group they call the rape of the sabines  we wandered through the endless collections of paintings and statues of the pitti and ufizzi galleries of course  i make that statement in selfdefense there let it stop  i could not rest under the imputation that i visited florence and did not traverse its weary miles of picture galleries  we tried indolently to recollect something about the guelphs and ghibelines and the other historical cutthroats whose quarrels and assassinations make up so large a share of florentine history but the subject was not attractive  we had been robbed of all the fine mountain scenery on our little journey by a system of railroading that had three miles of tunnel to a hundred yards of daylight and we were not inclined to be sociable with florence  we had seen the spot outside the city somewhere where these people had allowed the bones of galileo to rest in unconsecrated ground for an age because his great discovery that the world turned around was regarded as a damning heresy by the church and we know that long after the world had accepted his theory and raised his name high in the list of its great men they had still let him rot there  that we had lived to see his dust in honored sepulture in the church of santa croce we owed to a society of literati and not to florence or her rulers  we saw dantes tomb in that church also but we were glad to know that his body was not in it that the ungrateful city that had exiled him and persecuted him would give much to have it there but need not hope to ever secure that high honor to herself  medicis are good enough for florence  let her plant medicis and build grand monuments over them to testify how gratefully she was wont to lick the hand that scourged her  magnanimous florence  her jewelry marts are filled with artists in mosaic  florentine mosaics are the choicest in all the world  florence loves to have that said  florence is proud of it  florence would foster this specialty of hers  she is grateful to the artists that bring to her this high credit and fill her coffers with foreign money and so she encourages them with pensions  with pensions  think of the lavishness of it  she knows that people who piece together the beautiful trifles die early because the labor is so confining and so exhausting to hand and brain and so she has decreed that all these people who reach the age of sixty shall have a pension after that  i have not heard that any of them have called for their dividends yet  one man did fight along till he was sixty and started after his pension but it appeared that there had been a mistake of a year in his family record and so he gave it up and died  these artists will take particles of stone or glass no larger than a mustard seed and piece them together on a sleeve button or a shirt stud so smoothly and with such nice adjustment of the delicate shades of color the pieces bear as to form a pigmy rose with stem thorn leaves petals complete and all as softly and as truthfully tinted as though nature had builded it herself  they will counterfeit a fly or a hightoned bug or the ruined coliseum within the cramped circle of a breastpin and do it so deftly and so neatly that any man might think a master painted it  i saw a little table in the great mosaic school in florencea little trifle of a centre tablewhose top was made of some sort of precious polished stone and in the stone was inlaid the figure of a flute with bellmouth and a mazy complication of keys  no painting in the world could have been softer or richer no shading out of one tint into another could have been more perfect no work of art of any kind could have been more faultless than this flute and yet to count the multitude of little fragments of stone of which they swore it was formed would bankrupt any mans arithmetic  i do not think one could have seen where two particles joined each other with eyes of ordinary shrewdness  certainly we could detect no such blemish  this tabletop cost the labor of one man for ten long years so they said and it was for sale for thirtyfive thousand dollars  we went to the church of santa croce from time to time in florence to weep over the tombs of michael angelo raphael and machiavelli i suppose they are buried there but it may be that they reside elsewhere and rent their tombs to other partiessuch being the fashion in italy and between times we used to go and stand on the bridges and admire the arno  it is popular to admire the arno  it is a great historical creek with four feet in the channel and some scows floating around  it would be a very plausible river if they would pump some water into it  they all call it a river and they honestly think it is a river do these dark and bloody florentines  they even help out the delusion by building bridges over it  i do not see why they are too good to wade  how the fatigues and annoyances of travel fill one with bitter prejudices sometimes  i might enter florence under happier auspices a month hence and find it all beautiful all attractive  but i do not care to think of it now at all nor of its roomy shops filled to the ceiling with snowy marble and alabaster copies of all the celebrated sculptures in europe copies so enchanting to the eye that i wonder how they can really be shaped like the dingy petrified nightmares they are the portraits of  i got lost in florence at nine oclock one night and staid lost in that labyrinth of narrow streets and long rows of vast buildings that look all alike until toward three oclock in the morning  it was a pleasant night and at first there were a good many people abroad and there were cheerful lights about  later i grew accustomed to prowling about mysterious drifts and tunnels and astonishing and interesting myself with coming around corners expecting to find the hotel staring me in the face and not finding it doing any thing of the kind  later still i felt tired  i soon felt remarkably tired  but there was no one abroad now not even a policeman  i walked till i was out of all patience and very hot and thirsty  at last somewhere after one oclock i came unexpectedly to one of the city gates  i knew then that i was very far from the hotel  the soldiers thought i wanted to leave the city and they sprang up and barred the way with their muskets  i said  hotel deurope  it was all the italian i knew and i was not certain whether that was italian or french  the soldiers looked stupidly at each other and at me and shook their heads and took me into custody  i said i wanted to go home  they did not understand me  they took me into the guardhouse and searched me but they found no sedition on me  they found a small piece of soap we carry soap with us now and i made them a present of it seeing that they regarded it as a curiosity  i continued to say hotel deurope and they continued to shake their heads until at last a young soldier nodding in the corner roused up and said something  he said he knew where the hotel was i suppose for the officer of the guard sent him away with me  we walked a hundred or a hundred and fifty miles it appeared to me and then he got lost  he turned this way and that and finally gave it up and signified that he was going to spend the remainder of the morning trying to find the city gate again  at that moment it struck me that there was something familiar about the house over the way it was the hotel  it was a happy thing for me that there happened to be a soldier there that knew even as much as he did for they say that the policy of the government is to change the soldiery from one place to another constantly and from country to city so that they can not become acquainted with the people and grow lax in their duties and enter into plots and conspiracies with friends  my experiences of florence were chiefly unpleasant  i will change the subject  at pisa we climbed up to the top of the strangest structure the world has any knowledge ofthe leaning tower  as every one knows it is in the neighborhood of one hundred and eighty feet highand i beg to observe that one hundred and eighty feet reach to about the hight of four ordinary threestory buildings piled one on top of the other and is a very considerable altitude for a tower of uniform thickness to aspire to even when it stands uprightyet this one leans more than thirteen feet out of the perpendicular  it is seven hundred years old but neither history or tradition say whether it was built as it is purposely or whether one of its sides has settled  there is no record that it ever stood straight up  it is built of marble  it is an airy and a beautiful structure and each of its eight stories is encircled by fluted columns some of marble and some of granite with corinthian capitals that were handsome when they were new  it is a bell tower and in its top hangs a chime of ancient bells  the winding staircase within is dark but one always knows which side of the tower he is on because of his naturally gravitating from one side to the other of the staircase with the rise or dip of the tower  some of the stone steps are footworn only on one end others only on the other end others only in the middle  to look down into the tower from the top is like looking down into a tilted well  a rope that hangs from the centre of the top touches the wall before it reaches the bottom  standing on the summit one does not feel altogether comfortable when he looks down from the high side but to crawl on your breast to the verge on the lower side and try to stretch your neck out far enough to see the base of the tower makes your flesh creep and convinces you for a single moment in spite of all your philosophy that the building is falling  you handle yourself very carefully all the time under the silly impression that if it is not falling your trifling weight will start it unless you are particular not to bear down on it  the duomo close at hand is one of the finest cathedrals in europe  it is eight hundred years old  its grandeur has outlived the high commercial prosperity and the political importance that made it a necessity or rather a possibility  surrounded by poverty decay and ruin it conveys to us a more tangible impression of the former greatness of pisa than books could give us  the baptistery which is a few years older than the leaning tower is a stately rotunda of huge dimensions and was a costly structure  in it hangs the lamp whose measured swing suggested to galileo the pendulum it looked an insignificant thing to have conferred upon the world of science and mechanics such a mighty extension of their dominions as it has  pondering in its suggestive presence i seemed to see a crazy universe of swinging disks the toiling children of this sedate parent he appeared to have an intelligent expression about him of knowing that he was not a lamp at all that he was a pendulum a pendulum disguised for prodigious and inscrutable purposes of his own deep devising and not a common pendulum either but the old original patriarchal pendulumthe abraham pendulum of the world  this baptistery is endowed with the most pleasing echo of all the echoes we have read of  the guide sounded two sonorous notes about half an octave apart the echo answered with the most enchanting the most melodious the richest blending of sweet sounds that one can imagine  it was like a longdrawn chord of a church organ infinitely softened by distance  i may be extravagant in this matter but if this be the case my ear is to blamenot my pen  i am describing a memoryand one that will remain long with me  the peculiar devotional spirit of the olden time which placed a higher confidence in outward forms of worship than in the watchful guarding of the heart against sinful thoughts and the hands against sinful deeds and which believed in the protecting virtues of inanimate objects made holy by contact with holy things is illustrated in a striking manner in one of the cemeteries of pisa  the tombs are set in soil brought in ships from the holy land ages ago  to be buried in such ground was regarded by the ancient pisans as being more potent for salvation than many masses purchased of the church and the vowing of many candles to the virgin  pisa is believed to be about three thousand years old  it was one of the twelve great cities of ancient etruria that commonwealth which has left so many monuments in testimony of its extraordinary advancement and so little history of itself that is tangible and comprehensible  a pisan antiquarian gave me an ancient tearjug which he averred was full four thousand years old  it was found among the ruins of one of the oldest of the etruscan cities  he said it came from a tomb and was used by some bereaved family in that remote age when even the pyramids of egypt were young damascus a village abraham a prattling infant and ancient troy not yet dreampt of to receive the tears wept for some lost idol of a household  it spoke to us in a language of its own and with a pathos more tender than any words might bring its mute eloquence swept down the long roll of the centuries with its tale of a vacant chair a familiar footstep missed from the threshold a pleasant voice gone from the chorus a vanished forma tale which is always so new to us so startling so terrible so benumbing to the senses and behold how threadbare and old it is  no shrewdlyworded history could have brought the myths and shadows of that old dreamy age before us clothed with human flesh and warmed with human sympathies so vividly as did this poor little unsentient vessel of pottery  pisa was a republic in the middle ages with a government of her own armies and navies of her own and a great commerce  she was a warlike power and inscribed upon her banners many a brilliant fight with genoese and turks  it is said that the city once numbered a population of four hundred thousand but her sceptre has passed from her grasp now her ships and her armies are gone her commerce is dead  her battleflags bear the mold and the dust of centuries her marts are deserted she has shrunken far within her crumbling walls and her great population has diminished to twenty thousand souls  she has but one thing left to boast of and that is not much viz she is the second city of tuscany  we reached leghorn in time to see all we wished to see of it long before the city gates were closed for the evening and then came on board the ship  we felt as though we had been away from home an age  we never entirely appreciated before what a very pleasant den our stateroom is nor how jolly it is to sit at dinner in ones own seat in ones own cabin and hold familiar conversation with friends in ones own language  oh the rare happiness of comprehending every single word that is said and knowing that every word one says in return will be understood as well we would talk ourselves to death now only there are only about ten passengers out of the sixtyfive to talk to  the others are wandering we hardly know where  we shall not go ashore in leghorn  we are surfeited with italian cities for the present and much prefer to walk the familiar quarterdeck and view this one from a distance  the stupid magnates of this leghorn government can not understand that so large a steamer as ours could cross the broad atlantic with no other purpose than to indulge a party of ladies and gentlemen in a pleasure excursion  it looks too improbable  it is suspicious they think something more important must be hidden behind it all  they can not understand it and they scorn the evidence of the ships papers  they have decided at last that we are a battalion of incendiary bloodthirsty garibaldians in disguise  and in all seriousness they have set a gunboat to watch the vessel night and day with orders to close down on any revolutionary movement in a twinkling  police boats are on patrol duty about us all the time and it is as much as a sailors liberty is worth to show himself in a red shirt  these policemen follow the executive officers boat from shore to ship and from ship to shore and watch his dark maneuvres with a vigilant eye  they will arrest him yet unless he assumes an expression of countenance that shall have less of carnage insurrection and sedition in it  a visit paid in a friendly way to general garibaldi yesterday by cordial invitation by some of our passengers has gone far to confirm the dread suspicions the government harbors toward us  it is thought the friendly visit was only the cloak of a bloody conspiracy  these people draw near and watch us when we bathe in the sea from the ships side  do they think we are communing with a reserve force of rascals at the bottom  it is said that we shall probably be quarantined at naples  two or three of us prefer not to run this risk  therefore when we are rested we propose to go in a french steamer to civita and from thence to rome and by rail to naples  they do not quarantine the cars no matter where they got their passengers from     chapter xxv  there are a good many things about this italy which i do not understand and more especially i can not understand how a bankrupt government can have such palatial railroad depots and such marvels of turnpikes  why these latter are as hard as adamant as straight as a line as smooth as a floor and as white as snow  when it is too dark to see any other object one can still see the white turnpikes of france and italy and they are clean enough to eat from without a tablecloth  and yet no tolls are charged  as for the railwayswe have none like them  the cars slide as smoothly along as if they were on runners  the depots are vast palaces of cut marble with stately colonnades of the same royal stone traversing them from end to end and with ample walls and ceilings richly decorated with frescoes  the lofty gateways are graced with statues and the broad floors are all laid in polished flags of marble  these things win me more than italys hundred galleries of priceless art treasures because i can understand the one and am not competent to appreciate the other  in the turnpikes the railways the depots and the new boulevards of uniform houses in florence and other cities here i see the genius of louis napoleon or rather i see the works of that statesman imitated  but louis has taken care that in france there shall be a foundation for these improvementsmoney  he has always the wherewithal to back up his projects they strengthen france and never weaken her  her material prosperity is genuine  but here the case is different  this country is bankrupt  there is no real foundation for these great works  the prosperity they would seem to indicate is a pretence  there is no money in the treasury and so they enfeeble her instead of strengthening  italy has achieved the dearest wish of her heart and become an independent stateand in so doing she has drawn an elephant in the political lottery  she has nothing to feed it on inexperienced in government she plunged into all manner of useless expenditure and swamped her treasury almost in a day  she squandered millions of francs on a navy which she did not need and the first time she took her new toy into action she got it knocked higher than gilderoys kiteto use the language of the pilgrims  but it is an illwind that blows nobody good  a year ago when italy saw utter ruin staring her in the face and her greenbacks hardly worth the paper they were printed on her parliament ventured upon a coup de main that would have appalled the stoutest of her statesmen under less desperate circumstances  they in a manner confiscated the domains of the church  this in priestridden italy  this in a land which has groped in the midnight of priestly superstition for sixteen hundred years  it was a rare good fortune for italy the stress of weather that drove her to break from this prisonhouse  they do not call it confiscating the church property  that would sound too harshly yet  but it amounts to that  there are thousands of churches in italy each with untold millions of treasures stored away in its closets and each with its battalion of priests to be supported and then there are the estates of the churchleague on league of the richest lands and the noblest forests in all italyall yielding immense revenues to the church and none paying a cent in taxes to the state in some great districts the church owns all the propertylands watercourses woods mills and factories  they buy they sell they manufacture and since they pay no taxes who can hope to compete with them  well the government has seized all this in effect and will yet seize it in rigid and unpoetical reality no doubt  something must be done to feed a starving treasury and there is no other resource in all italy none but the riches of the church  so the government intends to take to itself a great portion of the revenues arising from priestly farms factories etc and also intends to take possession of the churches and carry them on after its own fashion and upon its own responsibility in a few instances it will leave the establishments of great pet churches undisturbed but in all others only a handful of priests will be retained to preach and pray a few will be pensioned and the balance turned adrift  pray glance at some of these churches and their embellishments and see whether the government is doing a righteous thing or not  in venice today a city of a hundred thousand inhabitants there are twelve hundred priests  heaven only knows how many there were before the parliament reduced their numbers  there was the great jesuit church  under the old regime it required sixty priests to engineer itthe government does it with five now and the others are discharged from service  all about that church wretchedness and poverty abound  at its door a dozen hats and bonnets were doffed to us as many heads were humbly bowed and as many hands extended appealing for penniesappealing with foreign words we could not understand but appealing mutely with sad eyes and sunken cheeks and ragged raiment that no words were needed to translate  then we passed within the great doors and it seemed that the riches of the world were before us  huge columns carved out of single masses of marble and inlaid from top to bottom with a hundred intricate figures wrought in costly verde antique pulpits of the same rich materials whose draperies hung down in many a pictured fold the stony fabric counterfeiting the delicate work of the loom the grand altar brilliant with polished facings and balustrades of oriental agate jasper verde antique and other precious stones whose names even we seldom hear and slabs of priceless lapis lazuli lavished every where as recklessly as if the church had owned a quarry of it  in the midst of all this magnificence the solid gold and silver furniture of the altar seemed cheap and trivial  even the floors and ceilings cost a princely fortune  now where is the use of allowing all those riches to lie idle while half of that community hardly know from day to day how they are going to keep body and soul together  and where is the wisdom in permitting hundreds upon hundreds of millions of francs to be locked up in the useless trumpery of churches all over italy and the people ground to death with taxation to uphold a perishing government  as far as i can see italy for fifteen hundred years has turned all her energies all her finances and all her industry to the building up of a vast array of wonderful church edifices and starving half her citizens to accomplish it  she is today one vast museum of magnificence and misery  all the churches in an ordinary american city put together could hardly buy the jeweled frippery in one of her hundred cathedrals  and for every beggar in america italy can show a hundredand rags and vermin to match  it is the wretchedest princeliest land on earth  look at the grand duomo of florencea vast pile that has been sapping the purses of her citizens for five hundred years and is not nearly finished yet  like all other men i fell down and worshipped it but when the filthy beggars swarmed around me the contrast was too striking too suggestive and i said o sons of classic italy is the spirit of enterprise of selfreliance of noble endeavor utterly dead within ye curse your indolent worthlessness why dont you rob your church  three hundred happy comfortable priests are employed in that cathedral  and now that my temper is up i may as well go on and abuse every body i can think of  they have a grand mausoleum in florence which they built to bury our lord and saviour and the medici family in  it sounds blasphemous but it is true and here they act blasphemy  the dead and damned medicis who cruelly tyrannized over florence and were her curse for over two hundred years are salted away in a circle of costly vaults and in their midst the holy sepulchre was to have been set up  the expedition sent to jerusalem to seize it got into trouble and could not accomplish the burglary and so the centre of the mausoleum is vacant now  they say the entire mausoleum was intended for the holy sepulchre and was only turned into a family burying place after the jerusalem expedition failedbut you will excuse me  some of those medicis would have smuggled themselves in surewhat they had not the effrontery to do was not worth doing  why they had their trivial forgotten exploits on land and sea pictured out in grand frescoes as did also the ancient doges of venice with the saviour and the virgin throwing bouquets to them out of the clouds and the deity himself applauding from his throne in heaven  and who painted these things  why titian tintoretto paul veronese raphaelnone other than the worlds idols the old masters  andrea del sarto glorified his princes in pictures that must save them for ever from the oblivion they merited and they let him starve  served him right  raphael pictured such infernal villains as catherine and marie de medicis seated in heaven and conversing familiarly with the virgin mary and the angels to say nothing of higher personages and yet my friends abuse me because i am a little prejudiced against the old mastersbecause i fail sometimes to see the beauty that is in their productions  i can not help but see it now and then but i keep on protesting against the groveling spirit that could persuade those masters to prostitute their noble talents to the adulation of such monsters as the french venetian and florentine princes of two and three hundred years ago all the same  i am told that the old masters had to do these shameful things for bread the princes and potentates being the only patrons of art  if a grandly gifted man may drag his pride and his manhood in the dirt for bread rather than starve with the nobility that is in him untainted the excuse is a valid one  it would excuse theft in washingtons and wellingtons and unchastity in women as well  but somehow i can not keep that medici mausoleum out of my memory  it is as large as a church its pavement is rich enough for the pavement of a kings palace its great dome is gorgeous with frescoes its walls are made ofwhat  marbleplasterwoodpaper  no  red porphyry verde antiquejasperoriental agatealabastermotherofpearl chalcedonyred corallapis lazuli  all the vast walls are made wholly of these precious stones worked in and in and in together in elaborate pattern s and figures and polished till they glow like great mirrors with the pictured splendors reflected from the dome overhead  and before a statue of one of those dead medicis reposes a crown that blazes with diamonds and emeralds enough to buy a shipoftheline almost  these are the things the government has its evil eye upon and a happy thing it will be for italy when they melt away in the public treasury  and now  however another beggar approaches  i will go out and destroy him and then come back and write another chapter of vituperation  having eaten the friendless orphanhaving driven away his comrades having grown calm and reflective at lengthi now feel in a kindlier mood  i feel that after talking so freely about the priests and the churches justice demands that if i know any thing good about either i ought to say it  i have heard of many things that redound to the credit of the priesthood but the most notable matter that occurs to me now is the devotion one of the mendicant orders showed during the prevalence of the cholera last year  i speak of the dominican friarsmen who wear a coarse heavy brown robe and a cowl in this hot climate and go barefoot  they live on alms altogether i believe  they must unquestionably love their religion to suffer so much for it  when the cholera was raging in naples when the people were dying by hundreds and hundreds every day when every concern for the public welfare was swallowed up in selfish private interest and every citizen made the taking care of himself his sole object these men banded themselves together and went about nursing the sick and burying the dead  their noble efforts cost many of them their lives  they laid them down cheerfully and well they might  creeds mathematically precise and hairsplitting niceties of doctrine are absolutely necessary for the salvation of some kinds of souls but surely the charity the purity the unselfishness that are in the hearts of men like these would save their souls though they were bankrupt in the true religionwhich is ours  one of these fat barefooted rascals came here to civita vecchia with us in the little french steamer  there were only half a dozen of us in the cabin  he belonged in the steerage  he was the life of the ship the bloodyminded son of the inquisition  he and the leader of the marine band of a french manofwar played on the piano and sang opera turn about they sang duets together they rigged impromptu theatrical costumes and gave us extravagant farces and pantomimes  we got along firstrate with the friar and were excessively conversational albeit he could not understand what we said and certainly he never uttered a word that we could guess the meaning of  this civita vecchia is the finest nest of dirt vermin and ignorance we have found yet except that african perdition they call tangier which is just like it  the people here live in alleys two yards wide which have a smell about them which is peculiar but not entertaining  it is well the alleys are not wider because they hold as much smell now as a person can stand and of course if they were wider they would hold more and then the people would die  these alleys are paved with stone and carpeted with deceased cats and decayed rags and decomposed vegetabletops and remnants of old boots all soaked with dishwater and the people sit around on stools and enjoy it  they are indolent as a general thing and yet have few pastimes  they work two or three hours at a time but not hard and then they knock off and catch flies this does not require any talent because they only have to grabif they do not get the one they are after they get another  it is all the same to them  they have no partialities  whichever one they get is the one they want  they have other kinds of insects but it does not make them arrogant they are very quiet unpretending people  they have more of these kind of things than other communities but they do not boast  they are very uncleanlythese peoplein face in person and dress when they see any body with a clean shirt on it arouses their scorn the women wash clothes half the day at the public tanks in the streets but they are probably somebody elses  or may be they keep one set to wear and another to wash because they never put on any that have ever been washed  when they get done washing they sit in the alleys and nurse their cubs  they nurse one ashcat at a time and the others scratch their backs against the doorpost and are happy  all this country belongs to the papal states  they do not appear to have any schools here and only one billiard table  their education is at a very low stage  one portion of the men go into the military another into the priesthood and the rest into the shoemaking business  they keep up the passport system here but so they do in turkey  this shows that the papal states are as far advanced as turkey  this fact will be alone sufficient to silence the tongues of malignant calumniators  i had to get my passport vised for rome in florence and then they would not let me come ashore here until a policeman had examined it on the wharf and sent me a permit  they did not even dare to let me take my passport in my hands for twelve hours i looked so formidable  they judged it best to let me cool down  they thought i wanted to take the town likely  little did they know me  i wouldnt have it  they examined my baggage at the depot  they took one of my ablest jokes and read it over carefully twice and then read it backwards but it was too deep for them  they passed it around and every body speculated on it awhile but it mastered them all  it was no common joke  at length a veteran officer spelled it over deliberately and shook his head three or four times and said that in his opinion it was seditious  that was the first time i felt alarmed  i immediately said i would explain the document and they crowded around and so i explained and explained and explained and they took notes of all i said but the more i explained the more they could not understand it and when they desisted at last i could not even understand it myself  they said they believed it was an incendiary document leveled at the government  i declared solemnly that it was not but they only shook their heads and would not be satisfied  then they consulted a good while and finally they confiscated it  i was very sorry for this because i had worked a long time on that joke and took a good deal of pride in it and now i suppose i shall never see it any more  i suppose it will be sent up and filed away among the criminal archives of rome and will always be regarded as a mysterious infernal machine which would have blown up like a mine and scattered the good pope all around but for a miraculous providential interference  and i suppose that all the time i am in rome the police will dog me about from place to place because they think i am a dangerous character  it is fearfully hot in civita vecchia  the streets are made very narrow and the houses built very solid and heavy and high as a protection against the heat  this is the first italian town i have seen which does not appear to have a patron saint  i suppose no saint but the one that went up in the chariot of fire could stand the climate  there is nothing here to see  they have not even a cathedral with eleven tons of solid silver archbishops in the back room and they do not show you any moldy buildings that are seven thousand years old nor any smokedried old firescreens which are chef doeuvres of reubens or simpson or titian or ferguson or any of those parties and they havent any bottled fragments of saints and not even a nail from the true cross we are going to rome  there is nothing to see here     chapter xxvi  what is it that confers the noblest delight  what is that which swells a mans breast with pride above that which any other experience can bring to him  discovery  to know that you are walking where none others have walked that you are beholding what human eye has not seen before that you are breathing a

longdrawn century of suspense when he placed his hand upon the throttlevalve and lo the steamboat moved jenner when his patient with the cows virus in his blood walked through the smallpox hospitals unscathed howe when the idea shot through his brain that for a hundred and twenty generations the eye had been bored through the wrong end of the needle the nameless lord of art who laid down his chisel in some old age that is forgotten now and gloated upon the finished laocoon daguerre when he commanded the sun riding in the zenith to print the landscape upon his insignificant silvered plate and he obeyed columbus in the pintas shrouds when he swung his hat above a fabled sea and gazed abroad upon an unknown world  these are the men who have really livedwho have actually comprehended what pleasure iswho have crowded long lifetimes of ecstasy into a single moment  what is there in rome for me to see that others have not seen before me what is there for me to touch that others have not touched  what is there for me to feel to learn to hear to know that shall thrill me before it pass to others  what can i discovernothing  nothing whatsoever  one charm of travel dies here  but if i were only a roman if added to my own i could be gifted with modern roman sloth modern roman superstition and modern roman boundlessness of ignorance what bewildering worlds of unsuspected wonders i would discover  ah if i were only a habitant of the campagna five and twenty miles from rome then i would travel  i would go to america and see and learn and return to the campagna and stand before my countrymen an illustrious discoverer  i would say  i saw there a country which has no overshadowing mother church and yet the people survive  i saw a government which never was protected by foreign soldiers at a cost greater than that required to carry on the government itself  i saw common men and common women who could read i even saw small children of common country people reading from books if i dared think you would believe it i would say they could write also  in the cities i saw people drinking a delicious beverage made of chalk and water but never once saw goats driven through their broadway or their pennsylvania avenue or their montgomery street and milked at the doors of the houses  i saw real glass windows in the houses of even the commonest people  some of the houses are not of stone nor yet of bricks i solemnly swear they are made of wood  houses there will take fire and burn sometimesactually burn entirely down and not leave a single vestige behind  i could state that for a truth upon my deathbed  and as a proof that the circumstance is not rare i aver that they have a thing which they call a fireengine which vomits forth great streams of water and is kept always in readiness by night and by day to rush to houses that are burning  you would think one engine would be sufficient but some great cities have a hundred they keep men hired and pay them by the month to do nothing but put out fires  for a certain sum of money other men will insure that your house shall not burn down and if it burns they will pay you for it  there are hundreds and thousands of schools and any body may go and learn to be wise like a priest  in that singular country if a rich man dies a sinner he is damned he can not buy salvation with money for masses  there is really not much use in being rich there  not much use as far as the other world is concerned but much very much use as concerns this because there if a man be rich he is very greatly honored and can become a legislator a governor a general a senator no matter how ignorant an ass he isjust as in our beloved italy the nobles hold all the great places even though sometimes they are born noble idiots  there if a man be rich they give him costly presents they ask him to feasts they invite him to drink complicated beverages but if he be poor and in debt they require him to do that which they term to settle  the women put on a different dress almost every day the dress is usually fine but absurd in shape the very shape and fashion of it changes twice in a hundred years and did i but covet to be called an extravagant falsifier i would say it changed even oftener  hair does not grow upon the american womens heads it is made for them by cunning workmen in the shops and is curled and frizzled into scandalous and ungodly forms some persons wear eyes of glass which they see through with facility perhaps else they would not use them and in the mouths of some are teeth made by the sacrilegious hand of man  the dress of the men is laughably grotesque  they carry no musket in ordinary life nor no longpointed pole they wear no wide greenlined cloak they wear no peaked black felt hat no leathern gaiters reaching to the knee no goatskin breeches with the hair side out no hobnailed shoes no prodigious spurs  they wear a conical hat termed a nailkeg a coat of saddest black a shirt which shows dirt so easily that it has to be changed every month and is very troublesome things called pantaloons which are held up by shoulder straps and on their feet they wear boots which are ridiculous in pattern and can stand no wear  yet dressed in this fantastic garb these people laughed at my costume  in that country books are so common that it is really no curiosity to see one newspapers also  they have a great machine which prints such things by thousands every hour  i saw common men theremen who were neither priests nor princeswho yet absolutely owned the land they tilled  it was not rented from the church nor from the nobles  i am ready to take my oath of this  in that country you might fall from a third story window three several times and not mash either a soldier or a priestthe scarcity of such people is astonishing  in the cities you will see a dozen civilians for every soldier and as many for every priest or preacher  jews there are treated just like human beings instead of dogs  they can work at any business they please they can sell brand new goods if they want to they can keep drugstores they can practice medicine among christians they can even shake hands with christians if they choose they can associate with them just the same as one human being does with another human being they dont have to stay shut up in one corner of the towns they can live in any part of a town they like best it is said they even have the privilege of buying land and houses and owning them themselves though i doubt that myself they never have had to run races naked through the public streets against jackasses to please the people in carnival time there they never have been driven by the soldiers into a church every sunday for hundreds of years to hear themselves and their religion especially and particularly cursed at this very day in that curious country a jew is allowed to vote hold office yea get up on a rostrum in the public street and express his opinion of the government if the government dont suit him  ah it is wonderful  the common people there know a great deal they even have the effrontery to complain if they are not properly governed and to take hold and help conduct the government themselves if they had laws like ours which give one dollar of every three a crop produces to the government for taxes they would have that law altered instead of paying thirtythree dollars in taxes out of every one hundred they receive they complain if they have to pay seven  they are curious people  they do not know when they are well off  mendicant priests do not prowl among them with baskets begging for the church and eating up their substance  one hardly ever sees a minister of the gospel going around there in his bare feet with a basket begging for subsistence  in that country the preachers are not like our mendicant orders of friarsthey have two or three suits of clothing and they wash sometimes  in that land are mountains far higher than the alban mountains the vast roman campagna a hundred miles long and full forty broad is really small compared to the united states of america the tiber that celebrated river of ours which stretches its mighty course almost two hundred miles and which a lad can scarcely throw a stone across at rome is not so long nor yet so wide as the american mississippinor yet the ohio nor even the hudson  in america the people are absolutely wiser and know much more than their grandfathers did  they do not plow with a sharpened stick nor yet with a threecornered block of wood that merely scratches the top of the ground  we do that because our fathers did three thousand years ago i suppose  but those people have no holy reverence for their ancestors they plow with a plow that is a sharp curved blade of iron and it cuts into the earth full five inches  and this is not all  they cut their grain with a horrid machine that mows down whole fields in a day  if i dared i would say that sometimes they use a blasphemous plow that works by fire and vapor and tears up an acre of ground in a single hourbut buti see by your looks that you do not believe the things i am telling you  alas my character is ruined and i am a branded speaker of untruths  of course we have been to the monster church of st peter frequently i knew its dimensions  i knew it was a prodigious structure  i knew it was just about the length of the capitol at washingtonsay seven hundred and thirty feet  i knew it was three hundred and sixtyfour feet wide and consequently wider than the capitol  i knew that the cross on the top of the dome of the church was four hundred and thirtyeight feet above the ground and therefore about a hundred or may be a hundred and twentyfive feet higher than the dome of the capitolthus i had one gauge  i wished to come as near forming a correct idea of how it was going to look as possible i had a curiosity to see how much i would err  i erred considerably  st peters did not look nearly so large as the capitol and certainly not a twentieth part as beautiful from the outside  when we reached the door and stood fairly within the church it was impossible to comprehend that it was a very large building  i had to cipher a comprehension of it  i had to ransack my memory for some more similes  st peters is bulky  its height and size would represent two of the washington capitol set one on top of the otherif the capitol were wider or two blocks or two blocks and a half of ordinary buildings set one on top of the other  st peters was that large but it could and would not look so  the trouble was that every thing in it and about it was on such a scale of uniform vastness that there were no contrasts to judge bynone but the people and i had not noticed them  they were insects  the statues of children holding vases of holy water were immense according to the tables of figures but so was every thing else around them  the mosaic pictures in the dome were huge and were made of thousands and thousands of cubes of glass as large as the end of my little finger but those pictures looked smooth and gaudy of color and in good proportion to the dome  evidently they would not answer to measure by  away down toward the far end of the church i thought it was really clear at the far end but discovered afterward that it was in the centre under the dome stood the thing they call the baldacchinoa great bronze pyramidal framework like that which upholds a mosquito bar it only looked like a considerably magnified bedsteadnothing more  yet i knew it was a good deal more than half as high as niagara falls  it was overshadowed by a dome so mighty that its own height was snubbed the four great square piers or pillars that stand equidistant from each other in the church and support the roof i could not work up to their real dimensions by any method of comparison  i knew that the faces of each were about the width of a very large dwellinghouse front fifty or sixty feet and that they were twice as high as an ordinary threestory dwelling but still they looked small  i tried all the different ways i could think of to compel myself to understand how large st peters was but with small success  the mosaic portrait of an apostle who was writing with a pen six feet long seemed only an ordinary apostle  but the people attracted my attention after a while  to stand in the door of st peters and look at men down toward its further extremity two blocks away has a diminishing effect on them surrounded by the prodigious pictures and statues and lost in the vast spaces they look very much smaller than they would if they stood two blocks away in the open air  i averaged a man as he passed me and watched him as he drifted far down by the baldacchino and beyondwatched him dwindle to an insignificant schoolboy and then in the midst of the silent throng of human pigmies gliding about him i lost him  the church had lately been decorated on the occasion of a great ceremony in honor of st peter and men were engaged now in removing the flowers and gilt paper from the walls and pillars  as no ladders could reach the great heights the men swung themselves down from balustrades and the capitals of pilasters by ropes to do this work  the upper gallery which encircles the inner sweep of the dome is two hundred and forty feet above the floor of the churchvery few steeples in america could reach up to it  visitors always go up there to look down into the church because one gets the best idea of some of the heights and distances from that point  while we stood on the floor one of the workmen swung loose from that gallery at the end of a long rope  i had not supposed before that a man could look so much like a spider  he was insignificant in size and his rope seemed only a thread  seeing that he took up so little space i could believe the story then that ten thousand troops went to st peters once to hear mass and their commanding officer came afterward and not finding them supposed they had not yet arrived  but they were in the church neverthelessthey were in one of the transepts  nearly fifty thousand persons assembled in st peters to hear the publishing of the dogma of the immaculate conception  it is estimated that the floor of the church affords standing room forfor a large number of people i have forgotten the exact figures  but it is no matterit is near enough  they have twelve small pillars in st peters which came from solomons temple  they have alsowhich was far more interesting to mea piece of the true cross and some nails and a part of the crown of thorns  of course we ascended to the summit of the dome and of course we also went up into the gilt copper ball which is above itthere was room there for a dozen persons with a little crowding and it was as close and hot as an oven  some of those people who are so fond of writing their names in prominent places had been there before usa million or two i should think  from the dome of st peters one can see every notable object in rome from the castle of st angelo to the coliseum he can discern the seven hills upon which rome is built  he can see the tiber and the locality of the bridge which horatius kept in the brave days of old when lars porsena attempted to cross it with his invading host  he can see the spot where the horatii and the curatii fought their famous battle  he can see the broad green campagna stretching away toward the mountains with its scattered arches and broken aqueducts of the olden time so picturesque in their gray ruin and so daintily festooned with vines  he can see the alban mountains the appenines the sabine hills and the blue mediterranean  he can see a panorama that is varied extensive beautiful to the eye and more illustrious in history than any other in europeabout his feet is spread the remnant of a city that once had a population of four million souls and among its massed edifices stand the ruins of temples columns and triumphal arches that knew the caesars and the noonday of roman splendor and close by them in unimpaired strength is a drain of arched and heavy masonry that belonged to that older city which stood here before romulus and remus were born or rome thought of  the appian way is here yet and looking much as it did perhaps when the triumphal processions of the emperors moved over it in other days bringing fettered princes from the confines of the earth  we can not see the long array of chariots and mailclad men laden with the spoils of conquest but we can imagine the pageant after a fashion  we look out upon many objects of interest from the dome of st peters and last of all almost at our feet our eyes rest upon the building which was once the inquisition  how times changed between the older ages and the new  some seventeen or eighteen centuries ago the ignorant men of rome were wont to put christians in the arena of the coliseum yonder and turn the wild beasts in upon them for a show  it was for a lesson as well  it was to teach the people to abhor and fear the new doctrine the followers of christ were teaching  the beasts tore the victims limb from limb and made poor mangled corpses of them in the twinkling of an eye  but when the christians came into power when the holy mother church became mistress of the barbarians she taught them the error of their ways by no such means  no she put them in this pleasant inquisition and pointed to the blessed redeemer who was so gentle and so merciful toward all men and they urged the barbarians to love him and they did all they could to persuade them to love and honor himfirst by twisting their thumbs out of joint with a screw then by nipping their flesh with pincersredhot ones because they are the most comfortable in cold weather then by skinning them alive a little and finally by roasting them in public  they always convinced those barbarians  the true religion properly administered as the good mother church used to administer it is very very soothing  it is wonderfully persuasive also  there is a great difference between feeding parties to wild beasts and stirring up their finer feelings in an inquisition  one is the system of degraded barbarians the other of enlightened civilized people  it is a great pity the playful inquisition is no more  i prefer not to describe st peters  it has been done before  the ashes of peter the disciple of the saviour repose in a crypt under the baldacchino  we stood reverently in that place so did we also in the mamertine prison where he was confined where he converted the soldiers and where tradition says he caused a spring of water to flow in order that he might baptize them  but when they showed us the print of peters face in the hard stone of the prison wall and said he made that by falling up against it we doubted  and when also the monk at the church of san sebastian showed us a pavingstone with two great footprints in it and said that peters feet made those we lacked confidence again  such things do not impress one  the monk said that angels came and liberated peter from prison by night and he started away from rome by the appian way  the saviour met him and told him to go back which he did  peter left those footprints in the stone upon which he stood at the time  it was not stated how it was ever discovered whose footprints they were seeing the interview occurred secretly and at night  the print of the face in the prison was that of a man of common size the footprints were those of a man ten or twelve feet high  the discrepancy confirmed our unbelief  we necessarily visited the forum where caesar was assassinated and also the tarpeian rock  we saw the dying gladiator at the capitol and i think that even we appreciated that wonder of art as much perhaps as we did that fearful story wrought in marble in the vaticanthe laocoon and then the coliseum  every body knows the picture of the coliseum every body recognizes at once that looped and windowed bandbox with a side bitten out  being rather isolated it shows to better advantage than any other of the monuments of ancient rome  even the beautiful pantheon whose pagan altars uphold the cross now and whose venus tricked out in consecrated gimcracks does reluctant duty as a virgin mary today is built about with shabby houses and its stateliness sadly marred  but the monarch of all european ruins the coliseum maintains that reserve and that royal seclusion which is proper to majesty  weeds and flowers spring from its massy arches and its circling seats and vines hang their fringes from its lofty walls  an impressive silence broods over the monstrous structure where such multitudes of men and women were wont to assemble in other days  the butterflies have taken the places of the queens of fashion and beauty of eighteen centuries ago and the lizards sun themselves in the sacred seat of the emperor  more vividly than all the written histories the coliseum tells the story of romes grandeur and romes decay  it is the worthiest type of both that exists  moving about the rome of today we might find it hard to believe in her old magnificence and her millions of population but with this stubborn evidence before us that she was obliged to have a theatre with sitting room for eighty thousand persons and standing room for twenty thousand more to accommodate such of her citizens as required amusement we find belief less difficult  the coliseum is over one thousand six hundred feet long seven hundred and fifty wide and one hundred and sixtyfive high  its shape is oval  in america we make convicts useful at the same time that we punish them for their crimes  we farm them out and compel them to earn money for the state by making barrels and building roads  thus we combine business with retribution and all things are lovely  but in ancient rome they combined religious duty with pleasure  since it was necessary that the new sect called christians should be exterminated the people judged it wise to make this work profitable to the state at the same time and entertaining to the public  in addition to the gladiatorial combats and other shows they sometimes threw members of the hated sect into the arena of the coliseum and turned wild beasts in upon them  it is estimated that seventy thousand christians suffered martyrdom in this place  this has made the coliseum holy ground in the eyes of the followers of the saviour  and well it might for if the chain that bound a saint and the footprints a saint has left upon a stone he chanced to stand upon be holy surely the spot where a man gave up his life for his faith is holy  seventeen or eighteen centuries ago this coliseum was the theatre of rome and rome was mistress of the world  splendid pageants were exhibited here in presence of the emperor the great ministers of state the nobles and vast audiences of citizens of smaller consequence gladiators fought with gladiators and at times with warrior prisoners from many a distant land  it was the theatre of romeof the worldand the man of fashion who could not let fall in a casual and unintentional manner something about my private box at the coliseum could not move in the first circles  when the clothingstore merchant wished to consume the corner grocery man with envy he bought secured seats in the front row and let the thing be known  when the irresistible dry goods clerk wished to blight and destroy according to his native instinct he got himself up regardless of expense and took some other fellows young lady to the coliseum and then accented the affront by cramming her with ice cream between the acts or by approaching the cage and stirring up the martyrs with his whalebone cane for her edification  the roman swell was in his true element only when he stood up against a pillar and fingered his moustache unconscious of the ladies when he viewed the bloody combats through an operaglass two inches long when he excited the envy of provincials by criticisms which showed that he had been to the coliseum many and many a time and was long ago over the novelty of it when he turned away with a yawn at last and said  he a star handles his sword like an apprentice brigand hell do for the country may be but he dont answer for the metropolis  glad was the contraband that had a seat in the pit at the saturday matinee and happy the roman streetboy who ate his peanuts and guyed the gladiators from the dizzy gallery  for me was reserved the high honor of discovering among the rubbish of the ruined coliseum the only playbill of that establishment now extant there was a suggestive smell of mintdrops about it still a corner of it had evidently been chewed and on the margin in choice latin these words were written in a delicate female hand       meet me on the tarpeian rock tomorrow evening dear at sharp      seven  mother will be absent on a visit to her friends in the

heretofore been attempted on any stage  no expense has been spared to make the opening season one which shall be worthy the generous patronage which the management feel sure will crown their efforts  the management beg leave to state that they have succeeded in securing the services of a                              galaxy of talent such as has not been beheld in rome before  the performance will commence this evening with a                           grand broadsword combat between two young and promising amateurs and a celebrated parthian gladiator who has just arrived a prisoner from the camp of verus  this will be followed by a grand moral                            battleax engagement between the renowned valerian with one hand tied behind him and two gigantic savages from britain  after which the renowned valerian if he survive will fight with the broadsword                                 left handed against six sophomores and a freshman from the gladiatorial college  a long series of brilliant engagements will follow in which the finest talent of the empire will take part  after which the celebrated infant prodigy known as                            the young achilles will engage four tiger whelps in combat armed with no other weapon than his little spear  the whole to conclude with a chaste and elegant                              general slaughter in which

mutilated copy of the roman daily battleax containing a critique upon this very performance  it comes to hand too late by many centuries to rank as news and therefore i translate and publish it simply to show how very little the general style and phraseology of dramatic criticism has altered in the ages that have dragged their slow length along since the carriers laid this one damp and fresh before their roman patrons       the opening seasoncoliseumnotwithstanding the inclemency of      the weather quite a respectable number of the rank and fashion of      the city assembled last night to witness the debut upon metropolitan      boards of the young tragedian who has of late been winning such      golden opinions in the amphitheatres of the provinces  some sixty      thousand persons were present and but for the fact that the streets      were almost impassable it is fair to presume that the house would      have been full  his august majesty the emperor aurelius occupied      the imperial box and was the cynosure of all eyes  many      illustrious nobles and generals of the empire graced the occasion      with their presence and not the least among them was the young      patrician lieutenant whose laurels won in the ranks of the      thundering legion are still so green upon his brow  the cheer      which greeted his entrance was heard beyond the tiber       the late repairs and decorations add both to the comeliness and the      comfort of the coliseum  the new cushions are a great improvement      upon the hard marble seats we have been so long accustomed to  the      present management deserve well of the public  they have restored      to the coliseum the gilding the rich upholstery and the uniform      magnificence which old coliseum frequenters tell us rome was so      proud of fifty years ago       the opening scene last nightthe broadsword combat between two      young amateurs and a famous parthian gladiator who was sent here a      prisonerwas very fine  the elder of the two young gentlemen      handled his weapon with a grace that marked the possession of      extraordinary talent  his feint of thrusting followed instantly by      a happily delivered blow which unhelmeted the parthian was received      with hearty applause  he was not thoroughly up in the backhanded      stroke but it was very gratifying to his numerous friends to know      that in time practice would have overcome this defect  however      he was killed  his sisters who were present expressed      considerable regret  his mother left the coliseum  the other youth      maintained the contest with such spirit as to call forth      enthusiastic bursts of applause  when at last he fell a corpse his      aged mother ran screaming with hair disheveled and tears streaming      from her eyes and swooned away just as her hands were clutching at      the railings of the arena  she was promptly removed by the police      under the circumstances the womans conduct was pardonable perhaps      but we suggest that such exhibitions interfere with the decorum      which should be preserved during the performances and are highly      improper in the presence of the emperor  the parthian prisoner      fought bravely and well and well he might for he was fighting for      both life and liberty  his wife and children were there to nerve      his arm with their love and to remind him of the old home he should      see again if he conquered  when his second assailant fell the      woman clasped her children to her breast and wept for joy  but it      was only a transient happiness  the captive staggered toward her      and she saw that the liberty he had earned was earned too late  he      was wounded unto death  thus the first act closed in a manner which      was entirely satisfactory  the manager was called before the      curtain and returned his thanks for the honor done him in a speech      which was replete with wit and humor and closed by hoping that his      humble efforts to afford cheerful and instructive entertainment      would continue to meet with the approbation of the roman public       the star now appeared and was received with vociferous applause      and the simultaneous waving of sixty thousand handkerchiefs  marcus      marcellus valerian stage namehis real name is smith is a      splendid specimen of physical development and an artist of rare      merit  his management of the battleax is wonderful  his gayety      and his playfulness are irresistible in his comic parts and yet      they are inferior to his sublime conceptions in the grave realm of      tragedy  when his ax was describing fiery circles about the heads      of the bewildered barbarians in exact time with his springing body      and his prancing legs the audience gave way to uncontrollable      bursts of laughter but when the back of his weapon broke the skull      of one and almost in the same instant its edge clove the others      body in twain the howl of enthusiastic applause that shook the      building was the acknowledgment of a critical assemblage that he      was a master of the noblest department of his profession  if he has      a fault and we are sorry to even intimate that he has it is that      of glancing at the audience in the midst of the most exciting      moments of the performance as if seeking admiration  the pausing      in a fight to bow when bouquets are thrown to him is also in bad      taste  in the great lefthanded combat he appeared to be looking at      the audience half the time instead of carving his adversaries and      when he had slain all the sophomores and was dallying with the      freshman he stooped and snatched a bouquet as it fell and offered      it to his adversary at a time when a blow was descending which      promised favorably to be his deathwarrant  such levity is proper      enough in the provinces we make no doubt but it ill suits the      dignity of the metropolis  we trust our young friend will take      these remarks in good part for we mean them solely for his benefit      all who know us are aware that although we are at times justly      severe upon tigers and martyrs we never intentionally offend      gladiators       the infant prodigy performed wonders  he overcame his four tiger      whelps with ease and with no other hurt than the loss of a portion      of his scalp  the general slaughter was rendered with a      faithfulness to details which reflects the highest credit upon the      late participants in it       upon the whole last nights performances shed honor not only upon      the management but upon the city that encourages and sustains such      wholesome and instructive entertainments  we would simply suggest      that the practice of vulgar young boys in the gallery of shying      peanuts and paper pellets at the tigers and saying hiyi and      manifesting approbation or dissatisfaction by such observations as      bully for the lion  go it gladdy  boots  speech  take      a walk round the block  and so on are extremely reprehensible      when the emperor is present and ought to be stopped by the police      several times last night when the supernumeraries entered the arena      to drag out the bodies the young ruffians in the gallery shouted      supe supe  and also oh what a coat  and why dont you pad      them shanks  and made use of various other remarks expressive of      derision  these things are very annoying to the audience       a matinee for the little folks is promised for this afternoon on      which occasion several martyrs will be eaten by the tigers  the      regular performance will continue every night till further notice      material change of programme every evening  benefit of valerian      tuesday 29th if he lives   i have been a dramatic critic myself in my time and i was often surprised to notice how much more i knew about hamlet than forrest did and it gratifies me to observe now how much better my brethren of ancient times knew how a broad sword battle ought to be fought than the gladiators     chapter xxvii  so far good  if any man has a right to feel proud of himself and satisfied surely it is i  for i have written about the coliseum and the gladiators the martyrs and the lions and yet have never once used the phrase butchered to make a roman holiday  i am the only free white man of mature age who has accomplished this since byron originated the expression  butchered to make a roman holiday sounds well for the first seventeen or eighteen hundred thousand times one sees it in print but after that it begins to grow tiresome  i find it in all the books concerning romeand here latterly it reminds me of judge oliver  oliver was a young lawyer fresh from the schools who had gone out to the deserts of nevada to begin life  he found that country and our ways of life there in those early days different from life in new england or paris  but he put on a woollen shirt and strapped a navy revolver to his person took to the bacon and beans of the country and determined to do in nevada as nevada did  oliver accepted the situation so completely that although he must have sorrowed over many of his trials he never complainedthat is he never complained but once  he two others and myself started to the new silver mines in the humboldt mountainshe to be probate judge of humboldt county and we to mine  the distance was two hundred miles  it was dead of winter  we bought a twohorse wagon and put eighteen hundred pounds of bacon flour beans blastingpowder picks and shovels in it we bought two sorrylooking mexican plugs with the hair turned the wrong way and more corners on their bodies than there are on the mosque of omar we hitched up and started  it was a dreadful trip  but oliver did not complain  the horses dragged the wagon two miles from town and then gave out  then we three pushed the wagon seven miles and oliver moved ahead and pulled the horses after him by the bits  we complained but oliver did not  the ground was frozen and it froze our backs while we slept the wind swept across our faces and froze our noses  oliver did not complain  five days of pushing the wagon by day and freezing by night brought us to the bad part of the journeythe forty mile desert or the great american desert if you please  still this mildestmannered man that ever was had not complained  we started across at eight in the morning pushing through sand that had no bottom toiling all day long by the wrecks of a thousand wagons the skeletons of ten thousand oxen by wagontires enough to hoop the washington monument to the top and oxchains enough to girdle long island by human graves with our throats parched always with thirst lips bleeding from the alkali dust hungry perspiring and very very wearyso weary that when we dropped in the sand every fifty yards to rest the horses we could hardly keep from going to sleepno complaints from oliver none the next morning at three oclock when we got across tired to death  awakened two or three nights afterward at midnight in a narrow canon by the snow falling on our faces and appalled at the imminent danger of being snowed in we harnessed up and pushed on till eight in the morning passed the divide and knew we were saved  no complaints fifteen days of hardship and fatigue brought us to the end of the two hundred miles and the judge had not complained  we wondered if any thing could exasperate him  we built a humboldt house  it is done in this way  you dig a square in the steep base of the mountain and set up two uprights and top them with two joists  then you stretch a great sheet of cotton domestic from the point where the joists join the hillside down over the joists to the ground this makes the roof and the front of the mansion the sides and back are the dirt walls your digging has left  a chimney is easily made by turning up one corner of the roof oliver was sitting alone in this dismal den one night by a sagebrush fire writing poetry he was very fond of digging poetry out of himself or blasting it out when it came hard  he heard an animals footsteps close to the roof a stone or two and some dirt came through and fell by him  he grew uneasy and said hiclear out from there cant you from time to time  but by and by he fell asleep where he sat and pretty soon a mule fell down the chimney  the fire flew in every direction and oliver went over backwards  about ten nights after that he recovered confidence enough to go to writing poetry again  again he dozed off to sleep and again a mule fell down the chimney  this time about half of that side of the house came in with the mule  struggling to get up the mule kicked the candle out and smashed most of the kitchen furniture and raised considerable dust  these violent awakenings must have been annoying to oliver but he never complained  he moved to a mansion on the opposite side of the canon because he had noticed the mules did not go there  one night about eight oclock he was endeavoring to finish his poem when a stone rolled inthen a hoof appeared below the canvasthen part of a cowthe after part  he leaned back in dread and shouted hooy hooy get out of this  and the cow struggled manfullylost ground steadilydirt and dust streamed down and before oliver could get well away the entire cow crashed through on to the table and made a shapeless wreck of every thing  then for the first time in his life i think oliver complained  he said  this thing is growing monotonous  then he resigned his judgeship and left humboldt county  butchered to make a roman holyday has grown monotonous to me  in this connection i wish to say one word about michael angelo buonarotti  i used to worship the mighty genius of michael angelothat man who was great in poetry painting sculpture architecturegreat in every thing he undertook  but i do not want michael angelo for breakfastfor luncheonfor dinnerfor teafor supperfor between meals  i like a change occasionally  in genoa he designed every thing in milan he or his pupils designed every thing he designed the lake of como in padua verona venice bologna who did we ever hear of from guides but michael angelo  in florence he painted every thing designed every thing nearly and what he did not design he used to sit on a favorite stone and look at and they showed us the stone  in pisa he designed every thing but the old shottower and they would have attributed that to him if it had not been so awfully out of the perpendicular  he designed the piers of leghorn and the custom house regulations of civita vecchia  but herehere it is frightful  he designed st peters he designed the pope he designed the pantheon the uniform of the popes soldiers the tiber the vatican the coliseum the capitol the tarpeian rock the barberini palace st john lateran the campagna the appian way the seven hills the baths of caracalla the claudian aqueduct the cloaca maximathe eternal bore designed the eternal city and unless all men and books do lie he painted every thing in it  dan said the other day to the guide enough enough enough say no more  lump the whole thing say that the creator made italy from designs by michael angelo  i never felt so fervently thankful so soothed so tranquil so filled with a blessed peace as i did yesterday when i learned that michael angelo was dead  but we have taken it out of this guide  he has marched us through miles of pictures and sculpture in the vast corridors of the vatican and through miles of pictures and sculpture in twenty other palaces he has shown us the great picture in the sistine chapel and frescoes enough to frescoe the heavenspretty much all done by michael angelo  so with him we have played that game which has vanquished so many guides for us imbecility and idiotic questions  these creatures never suspectthey have no idea of a sarcasm  he shows us a figure and says statoo brunzo  bronze statue  we look at it indifferently and the doctor asks by michael angelo  nonot know who  then he shows us the ancient roman forum  the doctor asks michael angelo  a stare from the guide  nothousan year before he is born  then an egyptian obelisk  again michael angelo  oh mon dieu genteelmen  zis is two thousan year before he is born  he grows so tired of that unceasing question sometimes that he dreads to show us any thing at all  the wretch has tried all the ways he can think of to make us comprehend that michael angelo is only responsible for the creation of a part of the world but somehow he has not succeeded yet relief for overtasked eyes and brain from study and sightseeing is necessary or we shall become idiotic sure enough  therefore this guide must continue to suffer  if he does not enjoy it so much the worse for him  we do  in this place i may as well jot down a chapter concerning those necessary nuisances european guides  many a man has wished in his heart he could do without his guide but knowing he could not has wished he could get some amusement out of him as a remuneration for the affliction of his society  we accomplished this latter matter and if our experience can be made useful to others they are welcome to it  guides know about enough english to tangle every thing up so that a man can make neither head or tail of it  they know their story by heartthe history of every statue painting cathedral or other wonder they show you  they know it and tell it as a parrot wouldand if you interrupt and throw them off the track they have to go back and begin over again all their lives long they are employed in showing strange things to foreigners and listening to their bursts of admiration  it is human nature to take delight in exciting admiration  it is what prompts children to say smart things and do absurd ones and in other ways show off when company is present  it is what makes gossips turn out in rain and storm to go and be the first to tell a startling bit of news think then what a passion it becomes with a guide whose privilege it is every day to show to strangers wonders that throw them into perfect ecstasies of admiration  he gets so that he could not by any possibility live in a soberer atmosphere  after we discovered this we never went into ecstasies any morewe never admired any thingwe never showed any but impassible faces and stupid indifference in the presence of the sublimest wonders a guide had to display  we had found their weak point we have made good use of it ever since  we have made some of those people savage at times but we have never lost our own serenity  the doctor asks the questions generally because he can keep his countenance and look more like an inspired idiot and throw more imbecility into the tone of his voice than any man that lives  it comes natural to him  the guides in genoa are delighted to secure an american party because americans so much wonder and deal so much in sentiment and emotion before any relic of columbus  our guide there fidgeted about as if he had swallowed a spring mattress  he was full of animationfull of impatience  he said  come wis me genteelmencome  i show you ze letter writing by christopher colombowrite it himselfwrite it wis his own hand come  he took us to the municipal palace  after much impressive fumbling of keys and opening of locks the stained and aged document was spread before us  the guides eyes sparkled  he danced about us and tapped the parchment with his finger  what i tell you genteelmen  is it not so  see handwriting christopher colombowrite it himself  we looked indifferentunconcerned  the doctor examined the document very deliberately during a painful pausethen he said without any show of interest  ahfergusonwhatwhat did you say was the name of the party who wrote this  christopher colombo ze great christopher colombo  another deliberate examination  ahdid he write it himself oror how  he write it himselfchristopher colombo  hes own handwriting write by himself  then the doctor laid the document down and said  why i have seen boys in america only fourteen years old that could write better than that  but zis is ze great christo  i dont care who it is  its the worst writing i ever saw  now you musnt think you can impose on us because we are strangers  we are not fools by a good deal  if you have got any specimens of penmanship of real merit trot them outand if you havent drive on  we drove on  the guide was considerably shaken up but he made one more venture  he had something which he thought would overcome us  he said  ah genteelmen you come wis me  i show you beautiful o magnificent bust christopher colombosplendid grand magnificent  he brought us before the beautiful bustfor it was beautifuland sprang back and struck an attitude  ah look genteelmenbeautiful grandbust christopher colombo beautiful bust beautiful pedestal  the doctor put up his eyeglassprocured for such occasions  ahwhat did you say this gentlemans name was  christopher colomboze great christopher colombo  christopher colombothe great christopher colombo  well what did he do  discover americadiscover america oh ze devil  discover america  nothat statement will hardly wash  we are just from america ourselves  we heard nothing about it  christopher colombo pleasant

happy combination indeed isis this the first time this gentleman was ever on a bust  that joke was lost on the foreignerguides can not master the subtleties of the american joke  we have made it interesting for this roman guide  yesterday we spent three or four hours in the vatican again that wonderful world of curiosities  we came very near expressing interest sometimeseven admirationit was very hard to keep from it  we succeeded though nobody else ever did in the vatican museums  the guide was bewildered nonplussed  he walked his legs off nearly hunting up extraordinary things and exhausted all his ingenuity on us but it was a failure we never showed any interest in any thing  he had reserved what he considered to be his greatest wonder till the lasta royal egyptian mummy the best preserved in the world perhaps  he took us there  he felt so sure this time that some of his old enthusiasm came back to him  see genteelmenmummy  mummy  the eyeglass came up as calmly as deliberately as ever  ahfergusonwhat did i understand you to say the gentlemans name was  namehe got no namemummygyptian mummy  yes yes  born here  no gyptian mummy  ah just so  frenchman i presume  nonot frenchman not romanborn in egypta  born in egypta  never heard of egypta before  foreign locality likely  mummymummy  how calm he ishow selfpossessed  is ahis he dead  oh sacre bleu been dead three thousan year  the doctor turned on him savagely  here now what do you mean by such conduct as this  playing us for chinamen because we are strangers and trying to learn  trying to impose your vile secondhand carcasses on usthunder and lightning ive a notion totoif youve got a nice fresh corpse fetch him outor by george well brain you  we make it exceedingly interesting for this frenchman  however he has paid us back partly without knowing it  he came to the hotel this morning to ask if we were up and he endeavored as well as he could to describe us so that the landlord would know which persons he meant  he finished with the casual remark that we were lunatics  the observation was so innocent and so honest that it amounted to a very good thing for a guide to say  there is one remark already mentioned which never yet has failed to disgust these guides  we use it always when we can think of nothing else to say  after they have exhausted their enthusiasm pointing out to us and praising the beauties of some ancient bronze image or brokenlegged statue we look at it stupidly and in silence for five ten fifteen minutesas long as we can hold out in factand then ask  isis he dead  that conquers the serenest of them  it is not what they are looking for especially a new guide  our roman ferguson is the most patient unsuspecting longsuffering subject we have had yet  we shall be sorry to part with him  we have enjoyed his society very much  we trust he has enjoyed ours but we are harassed with doubts  we have been in the catacombs  it was like going down into a very deep cellar only it was a cellar which had no end to it  the narrow passages are roughly hewn in the rock and on each hand as you pass along the hollowed shelves are carved out from three to fourteen deep each held a corpse once  there are names and christian symbols and prayers or sentences expressive of christian hopes carved upon nearly every sarcophagus  the dates belong away back in the dawn of the christian era of course  here in these holes in the ground the first christians sometimes burrowed to escape persecution  they crawled out at night to get food but remained under cover in the day time  the priest told us that st sebastian lived under ground for some time while he was being hunted he went out one day and the soldiery discovered and shot him to death with arrows  five or six of the early popesthose who reigned about sixteen hundred years agoheld their papal courts and advised with their clergy in the bowels of the earth  during seventeen yearsfrom ad 235 to ad 252the popes did not appear above ground  four were raised to the great office during that period  four years apiece or thereabouts  it is very suggestive of the unhealthiness of underground graveyards as places of residence  one pope afterward spent his entire pontificate in the catacombseight years  another was discovered in them and murdered in the episcopal chair  there was no satisfaction in being a pope in those days  there were too many annoyances  there are one hundred and sixty catacombs under rome each with its maze of narrow passages crossing and recrossing each other and each passage walled to the top with scooped graves its entire length  a careful estimate makes the length of the passages of all the catacombs combined foot up nine hundred miles and their graves number seven millions  we did not go through all the passages of all the catacombs  we were very anxious to do it and made the necessary arrangements but our too limited time obliged us to give up the idea  so we only groped through the dismal labyrinth of st callixtus under the church of st sebastian  in the various catacombs are small chapels rudely hewn in the stones and here the early christians often held their religious services by dim ghostly lights  think of mass and a sermon away down in those tangled caverns under ground  in the catacombs were buried st cecilia st agnes and several other of the most celebrated of the saints  in the catacomb of st callixtus st bridget used to remain long hours in holy contemplation and st charles borromeo was wont to spend whole nights in prayer there  it was also the scene of a very marvelous thing       here the heart of st philip neri was so inflamed with divine love      as to burst his ribs  i find that grave statement in a book published in new york in 1808 and written by rev william h neligan lld m a trinity college dublin member of the archaeological society of great britain therefore i believe it  otherwise i could not  under other circumstances i should have felt a curiosity to know what philip had for dinner  this author puts my credulity on its mettle every now and then  he tells of one st joseph calasanctius whose house in rome he visited he visited only the housethe priest has been dead two hundred years  he says the virgin mary appeared to this saint  then he continues       his tongue and his heart which were found after nearly a century      to be whole when the body was disinterred before his canonization      are still preserved in a glass case and after two centuries the      heart is still whole  when the french troops came to rome and when      pius vii was carried away prisoner blood dropped from it  to read that in a book written by a monk far back in the middle ages would surprise no one it would sound natural and proper but when it is seriously stated in the middle of the nineteenth century by a man of finished education an lld m a and an archaeological magnate it sounds strangely enough  still i would gladly change my unbelief for neligans faith and let him make the conditions as hard as he pleased  the old gentlemans undoubting unquestioning simplicity has a rare freshness about it in these matteroffact railroading and telegraphing days  hear him concerning the church of ara coeli       in the roof of the church directly above the high altar is      engraved regina coeli laetare alleluia  in the sixth century      rome was visited by a fearful pestilence  gregory the great urged      the people to do penance and a general procession was formed  it      was to proceed from ara coeli to st peters  as it passed before      the mole of adrian now the castle of st angelo the sound of      heavenly voices was heard singing it was easter morn regina      coeli laetare alleluia quia quem meruisti portare alleluia      resurrexit sicut dixit alleluia  the pontiff carrying in his      hands the portrait of the virgin which is over the high altar and      is said to have been painted by st luke answered with the      astonished people ora pro nobis deum alleluia  at the same time      an angel was seen to put up a sword in a scabbard and the      pestilence ceased on the same day  there are four circumstances      which confirmthe italics are minem tthis miracle the      annual procession which takes place in the western church on the      feast of st mark the statue of st michael placed on the mole of      adrian which has since that time been called the castle of st      angelo the antiphon regina coeli which the catholic church sings      during paschal time and the inscription in the church     chapter xxviii  from the sanguinary sports of the holy inquisition the slaughter of the coliseum and the dismal tombs of the catacombs i naturally pass to the picturesque horrors of the capuchin convent  we stopped a moment in a small chapel in the church to admire a picture of st michael vanquishing satana picture which is so beautiful that i can not but think it belongs to the reviled renaissance notwithstanding i believe they told us one of the ancient old masters painted itand then we descended into the vast vault underneath  here was a spectacle for sensitive nerves  evidently the old masters had been at work in this place  there were six divisions in the apartment and each division was ornamented with a style of decoration peculiar to itselfand these decorations were in every instance formed of human bones  there were shapely arches built wholly of thigh bones there were startling pyramids built wholly of grinning skulls there were quaint architectural structures of various kinds built of shin bones and the bones of the arm on the wall were elaborate frescoes whose curving vines were made of knotted human vertebrae whose delicate tendrils were made of sinews and tendons whose flowers were formed of kneecaps and toenails  every lasting portion of the human frame was represented in these intricate designs they were by michael angelo i think and there was a careful finish about the work and an attention to details that betrayed the artists love of his labors as well as his schooled ability i asked the goodnatured monk who accompanied us who did this  and he said we did itmeaning himself and his brethren up stairs  i could see that the old friar took a high pride in his curious show  we made him talkative by exhibiting an interest we never betrayed to guides  who were these people  weup stairsmonks of the capuchin ordermy brethren  how many departed monks were required to upholster these six parlors  these are the bones of four thousand  it took a long time to get enough  many many centuries  their different parts are well separatedskulls in one room legs in another ribs in anotherthere would be stirring times here for a while if the last trump should blow  some of the brethren might get hold of the wrong leg in the confusion and the wrong skull and find themselves limping and looking through eyes that were wider apart or closer together than they were used to  you can not tell any of these parties apart i suppose  oh yes i know many of them  he put his finger on a skull  this was brother anselmodead three hundred yearsa good man  he touched another  this was brother alexanderdead two hundred and eighty years  this was brother carlodead about as long  then he took a skull and held it in his hand and looked reflectively upon it after the manner of the gravedigger when he discourses of yorick  this he said was brother thomas  he was a young prince the scion of a proud house that traced its lineage back to the grand old days of rome well nigh two thousand years ago  he loved beneath his estate  his family persecuted him persecuted the girl as well  they drove her from rome he followed he sought her far and wide he found no trace of her he came back and offered his broken heart at our altar and his weary life to the service of god  but look you  shortly his father died and likewise his mother  the girl returned rejoicing  she sought every where for him whose eyes had used to look tenderly into hers out of this poor skull but she could not find him  at last in this coarse garb we wear she recognized him in the street  he knew her  it was too late he fell where he stood  they took him up and brought him here  he never spoke afterward  within the week he died  you can see the color of his hairfaded somewhatby this thin shred that clings still to the temple  this taking up a thigh bone was his  the veins of this leaf in the decorations over your head were his fingerjoints a hundred and fifty years ago  this businesslike way of illustrating a touching story of the heart by laying the several fragments of the lover before us and naming them was as grotesque a performance and as ghastly as any i ever witnessed  i hardly knew whether to smile or shudder  there are nerves and muscles in our frames whose functions and whose methods of working it seems a sort of sacrilege to describe by cold physiological names and surgical technicalities and the monks talk suggested to me something of this kind  fancy a surgeon with his nippers lifting tendons muscles and such things into view out of the complex machinery of a corpse and observing now this little nerve quiversthe vibration is imparted to this musclefrom here it is passed to this fibrous substance here its ingredients are separated by the chemical action of the bloodone part goes to the heart and thrills it with what is popularly termed emotion another part follows this nerve to the brain and communicates intelligence of a startling characterthe third part glides along this passage and touches the spring connected with the fluid receptacles that lie in the rear of the eye  thus by this simple and beautiful process the party is informed that his mother is dead and he weeps  horrible  i asked the monk if all the brethren up stairs expected to be put in this place when they died  he answered quietly  we must all lie here at last  see what one can accustom himself tothe reflection that he must some day be taken apart like an engine or a clock or like a house whose owner is gone and worked up into arches and pyramids and hideous frescoes did not distress this monk in the least  i thought he even looked as if he were thinking with complacent vanity that his own skull would look well on top of the heap and his own ribs add a charm to the frescoes which possibly they lacked at present  here and there in ornamental alcoves stretched upon beds of bones lay dead and driedup monks with lank frames dressed in the black robes one sees ordinarily upon priests  we examined one closely  the skinny hands were clasped upon the breast two lustreless tufts of hair stuck to the skull the skin was brown and sunken it stretched tightly over the cheek bones and made them stand out sharply the crisp dead eyes were deep in the sockets the nostrils were painfully prominent the end of the nose being gone the lips had shriveled away from the yellow teeth and brought down to us through the circling years and petrified there was a weird laugh a full century old  it was the jolliest laugh but yet the most dreadful that one can imagine  surely i thought it must have been a most extraordinary joke this veteran produced with his latest breath that he has not got done laughing at it yet  at this moment i saw that the old instinct was strong upon the boys and i said we had better hurry to st peters they were trying to keep from asking isis he dead  it makes me dizzy to think of the vaticanof its wilderness of statues paintings and curiosities of every description and every age  the old masters especially in sculpture fairly swarm there  i can not write about the vatican  i think i shall never remember any thing i saw there distinctly but the mummies and the transfiguration by raphael and some other things it is not necessary to mention now  i shall remember the transfiguration partly because it was placed in a room almost by itself partly because it is acknowledged by all to be the first oil painting in the world and partly because it was wonderfully beautiful  the colors are fresh and rich the expression i am told is fine the feeling is lively the tone is good the depth is profound and the width is about four and a half feet i should judge  it is a picture that really holds ones attention its beauty is fascinating  it is fine enough to be a renaissance  a remark i made a while ago suggests a thoughtand a hope  is it not possible that the reason i find such charms in this picture is because it is out of the crazy chaos of the galleries  if some of the others were set apart might not they be beautiful  if this were set in the midst of the tempest of pictures one finds in the vast galleries of the roman palaces would i think it so handsome  if up to this time i had seen only one old master in each palace instead of acres and acres of walls and ceilings fairly papered with them might i not have a more civilized opinion of the old masters than i have now  i think so  when i was a schoolboy and was to have a new knife i could not make up my mind as to which was the prettiest in the showcase and i did not think any of them were particularly pretty and so i chose with a heavy heart  but when i looked at my purchase at home where no glittering blades came into competition with it i was astonished to see how handsome it was  to this day my new hats look better out of the shop than they did in it with other new hats  it begins to dawn upon me now that possibly what i have been taking for uniform ugliness in the galleries may be uniform beauty after all  i honestly hope it is to others but certainly it is not to me  perhaps the reason i used to enjoy going to the academy of fine arts in new york was because there were but a few hundred paintings in it and it did not surfeit me to go through the list  i suppose the academy was bacon and beans in the fortymile desert and a european gallery is a state dinner of thirteen courses  one leaves no sign after him of the one dish but the thirteen frighten away his appetite and give him no satisfaction  there is one thing i am certain of though  with all the michael angelos the raphaels the guidos and the other old masters the sublime history of rome remains unpainted  they painted virgins enough and popes enough and saintly scarecrows enough to people paradise almost and these things are all they did paint  nero fiddling oer burning rome the assassination of caesar the stirring spectacle of a hundred thousand people bending forward with rapt interest in the coliseum to see two skillful gladiators hacking away each others lives a tiger springing upon a kneeling martyrthese and a thousand other matters which we read of with a living interest must be sought for only in booksnot among the rubbish left by the old masterswho are no more i have the satisfaction of informing the public  they did paint and they did carve in marble one historical scene and one only of any great historical consequence and what was it and why did they choose it particularly  it was the rape of the sabines and they chose it for the legs and busts  i like to look at statues however and i like to look at pictures also even of monks looking up in sacred ecstacy and monks looking down in meditation and monks skirmishing for something to eatand therefore i drop ill nature to thank the papal government for so jealously guarding and so industriously gathering up these things and for permitting me a stranger and not an entirely friendly one to roam at will and unmolested among them charging me nothing and only requiring that i shall behave myself simply as well as i ought to behave in any other mans house  i thank the holy father right heartily and i wish him long life and plenty of happiness  the popes have long been the patrons and preservers of art just as our new practical republic is the encourager and upholder of mechanics  in their vatican is stored up all that is curious and beautiful in art in our patent office is hoarded all that is curious or useful in mechanics when a man invents a new style of horsecollar or discovers a new and superior method of telegraphing our government issues a patent to him that is worth a fortune when a man digs up an ancient statue in the campagna the pope gives him a fortune in gold coin  we can make something of a guess at a mans character by the style of nose he carries on his face  the vatican and the patent office are governmental noses and they bear a deal of character about them  the guide showed us a colossal statue of jupiter in the vatican which he said looked so damaged and rustyso like the god of the vagabonds because it had but recently been dug up in the campagna  he asked how much we supposed this jupiter was worth  i replied with intelligent promptness that he was probably worth about four dollarsmay be four and a half  a hundred thousand dollars  ferguson said  ferguson said further that the pope permits no ancient work of this kind to leave his dominions  he appoints a commission to examine discoveries like this and report upon the value then the pope pays the discoverer onehalf of that assessed value and takes the statue  he said this jupiter was dug from a field which had just been bought for thirtysix thousand dollars so the first crop was a good one for the new farmer i do not know whether ferguson always tells the truth or not but i suppose he does  i know that an exorbitant export duty is exacted upon all pictures painted by the old masters in order to discourage the sale of those in the private collections  i am satisfied also that genuine old masters hardly exist at all in america because the cheapest and most insignificant of them are valued at the price of a fine farm  i proposed to buy a small trifle of a raphael myself but the price of it was eighty thousand dollars the export duty would have made it considerably over a hundred and so i studied on it awhile and concluded not to take it  i wish here to mention an inscription i have seen before i forget it  glory to god in the highest peace on earth to men of good will  it is not good scripture but it is sound catholic and human nature  this is in letters of gold around the apsis of a mosaic group at the side of the scala santa church of st john lateran the mother and mistress of all the catholic churches of the world  the group represents the saviour st peter pope leo st silvester constantine and charlemagne peter is giving the pallium to the pope and a standard to charlemagne the saviour is giving the keys to st silvester and a standard to constantine  no prayer is offered to the saviour who seems to be of little importance any where in rome but an inscription below says blessed peter give life to pope leo and victory to king charles  it does not say intercede for us through the saviour with the father for this boon but blessed peter give it us  in all seriousnesswithout meaning to be frivolouswithout meaning to be irreverent and more than all without meaning to be blasphemousi state as my simple deduction from the things i have seen and the things i have heard that the holy personages rank thus in rome  firstthe mother of godotherwise the virgin mary  secondthe deity  thirdpeter  fourthsome twelve or fifteen canonized popes and martyrs  fifthjesus christ the saviourbut always as an infant in arms  i may be wrong in thismy judgment errs often just as is the case with other mensbut it is my judgment be it good or bad  just here i will mention something that seems curious to me  there are no christs churches in rome and no churches of the holy ghost that i can discover  there are some four hundred churches but about a fourth of them seem to be named for the madonna and st peter  there are so many named for mary that they have to be distinguished by all sorts of affixes if i understand the matter rightly  then we have churches of st louis st augustine st agnes st calixtus st lorenzo in lucina st lorenzo in damaso st cecilia st athanasius st philip neri st catherine st dominico and a multitude of lesser saints whose names are not familiar in the worldand away down clear out of the list of the churches comes a couple of hospitals one of them is named for the saviour and the other for the holy ghost  day after day and night after night we have wandered among the crumbling wonders of rome day after day and night after night we have fed upon the dust and decay of fiveandtwenty centurieshave brooded over them by day and dreampt of them by night till sometimes we seemed moldering away ourselves and growing defaced and cornerless and liable at any moment to fall a prey to some antiquary and be patched in the legs and restored with an unseemly nose and labeled wrong and dated wrong and set up in the vatican for poets to drivel about and vandals to scribble their names on forever and forevermore  but the surest way to stop writing about rome is to stop  i wished to write a real guidebook chapter on this fascinating city but i could not do it because i have felt all the time like a boy in a candyshop there was every thing to choose from and yet no choice  i have drifted along hopelessly for a hundred pages of manuscript without knowing where to commence  i will not commence at all  our passports have been examined  we will go to naples     chapter xxix  the ship is lying here in the harbor of naplesquarantined  she has been here several days and will remain several more  we that came by rail from rome have escaped this misfortune  of course no one is allowed to go on board the ship or come ashore from her  she is a prison now the passengers probably spend the long blazing days looking out from under the awnings at vesuvius and the beautiful cityand in swearing think of ten days of this sort of pastimewe go out every day in a boat and request them to come ashore  it soothes them  we lie ten steps from the ship and tell them how splendid the city is and how much better the hotel fare is here than any where else in europe and how cool it is and what frozen continents of ice cream there are and what a time we are having cavorting about the country and sailing to the islands in the bay this tranquilizes them                             ascent of vesuvius  i shall remember our trip to vesuvius for many a daypartly because of its sightseeing experiences but chiefly on account of the fatigue of the journey  two or three of us had been resting ourselves among the tranquil and beautiful scenery of the island of ischia eighteen miles out in the harbor for two days we called it resting but i do not remember now what the resting consisted of for when we got back to naples we had not slept for fortyeight hours  we were just about to go to bed early in the evening and catch up on some of the sleep we had lost when we heard of this vesuvius expedition  there was to be eight of us in the party and we were to leave naples at midnight  we laid in some provisions for the trip engaged carriages to take us to annunciation and then moved about the city to keep awake till twelve we got away punctually and in the course of an hour and a half arrived at the town of annunciation  annunciation is the very last place under the sun  in other towns in italy the people lie around quietly and wait for you to ask them a question or do some overt act that can be charged forbut in annunciation they have lost even that fragment of delicacy they seize a ladys shawl from a chair and hand it to her and charge a penny they open a carriage door and charge for itshut it when you get out and charge for it they help you to take off a dustertwo cents brush your clothes and make them worse than they were beforetwo cents smile upon youtwo cents bow with a lickspittle smirk hat in hand two cents they volunteer all information such as that the mules will arrive presentlytwo centswarm day sirtwo centstake you four hours to make the ascenttwo cents  and so they go  they crowd you infest youswarm about you and sweat and smell offensively and look sneaking and mean and obsequious  there is no office too degrading for them to perform for money  i have had no opportunity to find out any thing about the upper classes by my own observation but from what i hear said about them i judge that what they lack in one or two of the bad traits the canaille have they make up in one or two others that are worse  how the people begmany of them very well dressed too  i said i knew nothing against the upper classes by personal observation i must recall it  i had forgotten  what i saw their bravest and their fairest do last night the lowest multitude that could be scraped up out of the purlieus of christendom would blush to do i think  they assembled by hundreds and even thousands in the great theatre of san carlo to dowhat  why simply to make fun of an old womanto deride to hiss to jeer at an actress they once worshipped but whose beauty is faded now and whose voice has lost its former richness  every body spoke of the rare sport there was to be  they said the theatre would be crammed because frezzolini was going to sing  it was said she could not sing well now but then the people liked to see her anyhow  and so we went  and every time the woman sang they hissed and laughedthe whole magnificent houseand as soon as she left the stage they called her on again with applause  once or twice she was encored five and six times in succession and received with hisses when she appeared and discharged with hisses and laughter when she had finishedthen instantly encored and insulted again  and how the highborn knaves enjoyed it whitekidded gentlemen and ladies laughed till the tears came and clapped their hands in very ecstacy when that unhappy old woman would come meekly out for the sixth time with uncomplaining patience to meet a storm of hisses  it was the cruelest exhibitionthe most wanton the most unfeeling  the singer would have conquered an audience of american rowdies by her brave unflinching tranquillity for she answered encore after encore and smiled and bowed pleasantly and sang the best she possibly could and went bowing off through all the jeers and hisses without ever losing countenance or temper and surely in any other land than italy her sex and her helplessness must have been an ample protection to hershe could have needed no other  think what a multitude of small souls were crowded into that theatre last night  if the manager could have filled his theatre with neapolitan souls alone without the bodies he could not have cleared less than ninety millions of dollars  what traits of character must a man have to enable him to help three thousand miscreants to hiss and jeer and laugh at one friendless old woman and shamefully humiliate her  he must have all the vile mean traits there are  my observation persuades me i do not like to venture beyond my own personal observation that the upper classes of naples possess those traits of character  otherwise they may be very good people i can not say                        ascent of vesuviuscontinued  in this city of naples they believe in and support one of the wretchedest of all the religious impostures one can find in italythe miraculous liquefaction of the blood of st januarius  twice a year the priests assemble all the people at the cathedral and get out this vial of clotted blood and let them see it slowly dissolve and become liquid and every day for eight days this dismal farce is repeated while the priests go among the crowd and collect money for the exhibition  the first day the blood liquefies in fortyseven minutesthe church is crammed then and time must be allowed the collectors to get around after that it liquefies a little quicker and a little quicker every day as the houses grow smaller till on the eighth day with only a few dozens present to see the miracle it liquefies in four minutes  and here also they used to have a grand procession of priests citizens soldiers sailors and the high dignitaries of the city government once a year to shave the head of a madeup madonnaa stuffed and painted image like a milliners dummywhose hair miraculously grew and restored itself every twelve months  they still kept up this shaving procession as late as four or five years ago  it was a source of great profit to the church that possessed the remarkable effigy and the ceremony of the public barbering of her was always carried out with the greatest possible eclat and displaythe more the better because the more excitement there was about it the larger the crowds it drew and the heavier the revenues it producedbut at last a day came when the pope and his servants were unpopular in naples and the city government stopped the madonnas annual show  there we have two specimens of these neapolitanstwo of the silliest possible frauds which half the population religiously and faithfully believed and the other half either believed also or else said nothing about and thus lent themselves to the support of the imposture  i am very well satisfied to think the whole population believed in those poor cheap miraclesa people who want two cents every time they bow to you and who abuse a woman are capable of it i think                        ascent of vesuviuscontinued  these neapolitans always ask four times as much money as they intend to take but if you give them what they first demand they feel ashamed of themselves for aiming so low and immediately ask more  when money is to be paid and received there is always some vehement jawing and gesticulating about it  one can not buy and pay for two cents worth of clams without trouble and a quarrel  one course in a twohorse carriage costs a francthat is lawbut the hackman always demands more on some pretence or other and if he gets it he makes a new demand it is said that a stranger took a onehorse carriage for a course tariff half a franc  he gave the man five francs by way of experiment he demanded more and received another franc  again he demanded more and got a francdemanded more and it was refused  he grew vehement was again refused and became noisy  the stranger said well give me the seven francs again and i will see what i can doand when he got them he handed the hackman half a franc and he immediately asked for two cents to buy a drink with  it may be thought that i am prejudiced  perhaps i am  i would be ashamed of myself if i were not                        ascent of vesuviuscontinued  well as i was saying we got our mules and horses after an hour and a half of bargaining with the population of annunciation and started sleepily up the mountain with a vagrant at each mules tail who pretended to be driving the brute along but was really holding on and getting himself dragged up instead  i made slow headway at first but i began to get dissatisfied at the idea of paying my minion five francs to hold my mule back by the tail and keep him from going up the hill and so i discharged him  i got along faster then  we had one magnificent picture of naples from a high point on the mountain side  we saw nothing but the gas lamps of coursetwothirds of a circle skirting the great baya necklace of diamonds glinting up through the darkness from the remote distanceless brilliant than the stars overhead but more softly richly beautifuland over all the great city the lights crossed and recrossed each other in many and many a sparkling line and curve  and back of the town far around and abroad over the miles of level campagna were scattered rows and circles and clusters of lights all glowing like so many gems and marking where a score of villages were sleeping  about this time the fellow who was hanging on to the tail of the horse in front of me and practicing all sorts of unnecessary cruelty upon the animal got kicked some fourteen rods and this incident together with the fairy spectacle of the lights far in the distance made me serenely happy and i was glad i started to vesuvius                     ascent of mount vesuviuscontinued  this subject will be excellent matter for a chapter and tomorrow or next day i will write it     chapter xxx                       ascent of vesuviuscontinued  see naples and die  well i do not know that one would necessarily die after merely seeing it but to attempt to live there might turn out a little differently  to see naples as we saw it in the early dawn from far up on the side of vesuvius is to see a picture of wonderful beauty at that distance its dingy buildings looked whiteand so rank on rank of balconies windows and roofs they piled themselves up from the blue ocean till the colossal castle of st elmo topped the grand white pyramid and gave the picture symmetry emphasis and completeness  and when its lilies turned to roseswhen it blushed under the suns first kissit was beautiful beyond all description  one might well say then see naples and die  the frame of the picture was charming itself  in front the smooth seaa vast mosaic of many colors the lofty islands swimming in a dreamy haze in the distance at our end of the city the stately double peak of vesuvius and its strong black ribs and seams of lava stretching down to the limitless level campagnaa green carpet that enchants the eye and leads it on and on past clusters of trees and isolated houses and snowy villages until it shreds out in a fringe of mist and general vagueness far away  it is from the hermitage there on the side of vesuvius that one should see naples and die  but do not go within the walls and look at it in detail  that takes away some of the romance of the thing  the people are filthy in their habits and this makes filthy streets and breeds disagreeable sights and smells there never was a community so prejudiced against the cholera as these neapolitans are  but they have good reason to be  the cholera generally vanquishes a neapolitan when it seizes him because you understand before the doctor can dig through the dirt and get at the disease the man dies  the upper classes take a seabath every day and are pretty decent  the streets are generally about wide enough for one wagon and how they do swarm with people  it is broadway repeated in every street in every court in every alley  such masses such throngs such multitudes of hurrying bustling struggling humanity  we never saw the like of it hardly even in new york i think  there are seldom any sidewalks and when there are they are not often wide enough to pass a man on without caroming on him  so everybody walks in the streetand where the street is wide enough carriages are forever dashing along  why a thousand people are not run over and crippled every day is a mystery that no man can solve  but if there is an eighth wonder in the world it must be the dwellinghouses of naples  i honestly believe a good majority of them are a hundred feet high  and the solid brick walls are seven feet through  you go up nine flights of stairs before you get to the first floor  no not nine but there or thereabouts  there is a little birdcage of an iron railing in front of every window clear away up up up among the eternal clouds where the roof is and there is always somebody looking out of every windowpeople of ordinary size looking out from the first floor people a shade smaller from the second people that look a little smaller yet from the thirdand from thence upward they grow smaller and smaller by a regularly graduated diminution till the folks in the topmost windows seem more like birds in an uncommonly tall martinbox than any thing else  the perspective of one of these narrow cracks of streets with its rows of tall houses stretching away till they come together in the distance like railway tracks its clotheslines crossing over at all altitudes and waving their bannered raggedness over the swarms of people below and the whitedressed women perched in balcony railings all the way from the pavement up to the heavensa perspective like that is really worth going into neapolitan details to see                        ascent of vesuviuscontinued  naples with its immediate suburbs contains six hundred and twentyfive thousand inhabitants but i am satisfied it covers no more ground than an american city of one hundred and fifty thousand  it reaches up into the air infinitely higher than three american cities though and there is where the secret of it lies  i will observe here in passing that the contrasts between opulence and poverty and magnificence and misery are more frequent and more striking in naples than in paris even  one must go to the bois de boulogne to see fashionable dressing splendid equipages and stunning liveries and to the faubourg st antoine to see vice misery hunger rags dirtbut in the thoroughfares of naples these things are all mixed together  naked boys of nine years and the fancydressed children of luxury shreds and tatters and brilliant uniforms jackasscarts and statecarriages beggars princes and bishops jostle each other in every street  at six oclock every evening all naples turns out to drive on the riviere di chiaja whatever that may mean and for two hours one may stand there and see the motliest and the worst mixed procession go by that ever eyes beheld princes there are more princes than policemen in naplesthe city is infested with themprinces who live up seven flights of stairs and dont own any principalities will keep a carriage and go hungry and clerks mechanics milliners and strumpets will go without their dinners and squander the money on a hackride in the chiaja the ragtag and rubbish of the city stack themselves up to the number of twenty or thirty on a rickety little gocart hauled by a donkey not much bigger than a cat and they drive in the chiaja dukes and bankers in sumptuous carriages and with gorgeous drivers and footmen turn out also and so the furious procession goes  for two hours rank and wealth and obscurity and poverty clatter along side by side in the wild procession and then go home serene happy covered with glory  i was looking at a magnificent marble staircase in the kings palace the other day which it was said cost five million francs and i suppose it did cost half a million may be  i felt as if it must be a fine thing to live in a country where there was such comfort and such luxury as this and then i stepped out musing and almost walked over a vagabond who was eating his dinner on the curbstonea piece of bread and a bunch of grapes  when i found that this mustang was clerking in a fruit establishment he had the establishment along with him in a basket at two cents a day and that he had no palace at home where he lived i lost some of my enthusiasm concerning the happiness of living in italy  this naturally suggests to me a thought about wages here  lieutenants in the army get about a dollar a day and common soldiers a couple of cents i only know one clerkhe gets four dollars a month  printers get six dollars and a half a month but i have heard of a foreman who gets thirteen  to be growing suddenly and violently rich as this man is naturally makes him a bloated aristocrat  the airs he puts on are insufferable  and speaking of wages reminds me of prices of merchandise  in paris you pay twelve dollars a dozen for jouvins best kid gloves gloves of about as good quality sell here at three or four dollars a dozen  you pay five and six dollars apiece for fine linen shirts in paris here and in leghorn you pay two and a half  in marseilles you pay forty dollars for a firstclass dress coat made by a good tailor but in leghorn you can get a full dress suit for the same money  here you get handsome business suits at from ten to twenty dollars and in leghorn you can get an overcoat for fifteen dollars that would cost you seventy in new york fine kid boots are worth eight dollars in marseilles and four dollars here  lyons velvets rank higher in america than those of genoa  yet the bulk of lyons velvets you buy in the states are made in genoa and imported into lyons where they receive the lyons stamp and are then exported to america  you can buy enough velvet in genoa for twentyfive dollars to make a five hundred dollar cloak in new yorkso the ladies tell me  of course these things bring me back by a natural and easy transition to the                       ascent of vesuviuscontinued  and thus the wonderful blue grotto is suggested to me  it is situated on the island of capri twentytwo miles from naples  we chartered a little steamer and went out there  of course the police boarded us and put us through a health examination and inquired into our politics before they would let us land  the airs these little insect governments put on are in the last degree ridiculous  they even put a policeman on board of our boat to keep an eye on us as long as we were in the capri dominions they thought we wanted to steal the grotto i suppose  it was worth stealing  the entrance to the cave is four feet high and four feet wide and is in the face of a lofty perpendicular cliffthe seawall  you enter in small boatsand a tight squeeze it is too  you can not go in at all when the tide is up  once within you find yourself in an arched cavern about one hundred and sixty feet long one hundred and twenty wide and about seventy high  how deep it is no man knows  it goes down to the bottom of the ocean  the waters of this placid subterranean lake are the brightest loveliest blue that can be imagined  they are as transparent as plate glass and their coloring would shame the richest sky that ever bent over italy  no tint could be more ravishing no lustre more superb  throw a stone into the water and the myriad of tiny bubbles that are created flash out a brilliant glare like blue theatrical fires  dip an oar and its blade turns to splendid frosted silver tinted with blue  let a man jump in and instantly he is cased in an armor more gorgeous than ever kingly crusader wore  then we went to ischia but i had already been to that island and tired myself to death resting a couple of days and studying human villainy with the landlord of the grande sentinelle for a model  so we went to procida and from thence to pozzuoli where st paul landed after he sailed from samos  i landed at precisely the same spot where st paul landed and so did dan and the others  it was a remarkable coincidence st paul preached to these people seven days before he started to rome  neros baths the ruins of baiae the temple of serapis cumae where the cumaen sybil interpreted the oracles the lake agnano with its ancient submerged city still visible far down in its depthsthese and a hundred other points of interest we examined with critical imbecility but the grotto of the dog claimed our chief attention because we had heard and read so much about it  every body has written about the grotto del cane and its poisonous vapors from pliny down to smith and every tourist has held a dog over its floor by the legs to test the capabilities of the place  the dog dies in a minute and a halfa chicken instantly  as a general thing strangers who crawl in there to sleep do not get up until they are called  and then they dont either  the stranger that ventures to sleep there takes a permanent contract  i longed to see this grotto i resolved to take a dog and hold him myself suffocate him a little and time him suffocate him some more and then finish him  we reached the grotto at about three in the afternoon and proceeded at once to make the experiments  but now an important difficulty presented itself  we had no dog                       ascent of vesuviuscontinued  at the hermitage we were about fifteen or eighteen hundred feet above the sea and thus far a portion of the ascent had been pretty abrupt  for the next two miles the road was a mixturesometimes the ascent was abrupt and sometimes it was not but one characteristic it possessed all the time without failurewithout modificationit was all uncompromisingly and unspeakably infamous  it was a rough narrow trail and led over an old lava flowa black ocean which was tumbled into a thousand fantastic shapesa wild chaos of ruin desolation and barrennessa wilderness of billowy upheavals of furious whirlpools of miniature mountains rent asunderof gnarled and knotted wrinkled and twisted masses of blackness that mimicked branching roots great vines trunks of trees all interlaced and mingled together and all these weird shapes all this turbulent panorama all this stormy farstretching waste of blackness with its thrilling suggestiveness of life of action of boiling surging furious motion was petrifiedall stricken dead and cold in the instant of its maddest riotingfettered paralyzed and left to glower at heaven in impotent rage for evermore  finally we stood in a level narrow valley a valley that had been created by the terrific march of some old time irruption and on either hand towered the two steep peaks of vesuvius  the one we had to climb the one that contains the active volcanoseemed about eight hundred or one thousand feet high and looked almost too straightupanddown for any man to climb and certainly no mule could climb it with a man on his back  four of these native pirates will carry you to the top in a sedan chair if you wish it but suppose they were to slip and let you fall is it likely that you would ever stop rolling  not this side of eternity perhaps  we left the mules sharpened our fingernails and began the ascent i have been writing about so long at twenty minutes to six in the morning  the path led straight up a rugged sweep of loose chunks of pumicestone and for about every two steps forward we took we slid back one  it was so excessively steep that we had to stop every fifty or sixty steps and rest a moment  to see our comrades we had to look very nearly straight up at those above us and very nearly straight down at those below  we stood on the summit at lastit had taken an hour and fifteen minutes to make the trip  what we saw there was simply a circular cratera circular ditch if you pleaseabout two hundred feet deep and four or five hundred feet wide whose inner wall was about half a mile in circumference  in the centre of the great circus ring thus formed was a torn and ragged upheaval a hundred feet high all snowed over with a sulphur crust of many and many a brilliant and beautiful color and the ditch inclosed this like the moat of a castle or surrounded it as a little river does a little island if the simile is better  the sulphur coating of that island was gaudy in the extremeall mingled together in the richest confusion were red blue brown black yellow whitei do not know that there was a color or shade of a color or combination of colors unrepresentedand when the sun burst through the morning mists and fired this tinted magnificence it topped imperial vesuvius like a jeweled crown  the crater itselfthe ditchwas not so variegated in coloring but yet in its softness richness and unpretentious elegance it was more charming more fascinating to the eye  there was nothing loud about its wellbred and wellcreased look  beautiful  one could stand and look down upon it for a week without getting tired of it  it had the semblance of a pleasant meadow whose slender grasses and whose velvety mosses were frosted with a shining dust and tinted with palest green that deepened gradually to the darkest hue of the orange leaf and deepened yet again into gravest brown then faded into orange then into brightest gold and culminated in the delicate pink of a newblown rose where portions of the meadow had sunk and where other portions had been broken up like an icefloe the cavernous openings of the one and the ragged upturned edges exposed by the other were hung with a lacework of softtinted crystals of sulphur that changed their deformities into quaint shapes and figures that were full of grace and beauty  the walls of the ditch were brilliant with yellow banks of sulphur and with lava and pumicestone of many colors  no fire was visible any where but gusts of sulphurous steam issued silently and invisibly from a thousand little cracks and fissures in the crater and were wafted to our noses with every breeze  but so long as we kept our nostrils buried in our handkerchiefs there was small danger of suffocation  some of the boys thrust long slips of paper down into holes and set them on fire and so achieved the glory of lighting their cigars by the flames of vesuvius and others cooked eggs over fissures in the rocks and were happy  the view from the summit would have been superb but for the fact that the sun could only pierce the mists at long intervals  thus the glimpses we had of the grand panorama below were only fitful and unsatisfactory                                 the descent  the descent of the mountain was a labor of only four minutes  instead of stalking down the rugged path we ascended we chose one which was bedded kneedeep in loose ashes and ploughed our way with prodigious strides that would almost have shamed the performance of him of the sevenleague boots  the vesuvius of today is a very poor affair compared to the mighty volcano of kilauea in the sandwich islands but i am glad i visited it it was well worth it  it is said that during one of the grand eruptions of vesuvius it discharged massy rocks weighing many tons a thousand feet into the air its vast jets of smoke and steam ascended thirty miles toward the firmament and clouds of its ashes were wafted abroad and fell upon the decks of ships seven hundred and fifty miles at sea  i will take the ashes at a moderate discount if any one will take the thirty miles of smoke but i do not feel able to take a commanding interest in the whole story by myself     chapter xxxi                          the buried city of pompeii  they pronounce it pompaye  i always had an idea that you went down into pompeii with torches by the way of damp dark stairways just as you do in silver mines and traversed gloomy tunnels with lava overhead and something on either hand like dilapidated prisons gouged out of the solid earth that faintly resembled houses  but you do nothing the kind fully onehalf of the buried city perhaps is completely exhumed and thrown open freely to the light of day and there stand the long rows of solidlybuilt brick houses roofless just as they stood eighteen hundred years ago hot with the flaming sun and there lie their floors cleanswept and not a bright fragment tarnished or waiting of the labored mosaics that pictured them with the beasts and birds and flowers which we copy in perishable carpets today and here are the venuses and bacchuses and adonises making love and getting drunk in manyhued frescoes on the walls of saloon and bedchamber and there are the narrow streets and narrower sidewalks paved with flags of good hard lava the one deeply rutted with the chariotwheels and the other with the passing feet of the pompeiians of bygone centuries and there are the bakeshops the temples the halls of justice the baths the theatresall cleanscraped and neat and suggesting nothing of the nature of a silver mine away down in the bowels of the earth  the broken pillars lying about the doorless doorways and the crumbled tops of the wilderness of walls were wonderfully suggestive of the burnt district in one of our cities and if there had been any charred timbers shattered windows heaps of debris and general blackness and smokiness about the place the resemblance would have been perfect  but nothe sun shines as brightly down on old pompeii today as it did when christ was born in bethlehem and its streets are cleaner a hundred times than ever pompeiian saw them in her prime  i know whereof i speakfor in the great chief thoroughfares merchant street and the street of fortune have i not seen with my own eyes how for two hundred years at least the pavements were not repairedhow ruts five and even ten inches deep were worn into the thick flagstones by the chariotwheels of generations of swindled taxpayers  and do i not know by these signs that street commissioners of pompeii never attended to their business and that if they never mended the pavements they never cleaned them  and besides is it not the inborn nature of street commissioners to avoid their duty whenever they get a chance  i wish i knew the name of the last one that held office in pompeii so that i could give him a blast  i speak with feeling on this subject because i caught my foot in one of those ruts and the sadness that came over me when i saw the first poor skeleton with ashes and lava sticking to it was tempered by the reflection that may be that party was the street commissioner  nopompeii is no longer a buried city  it is a city of hundreds and hundreds of roofless houses and a tangled maze of streets where one could easily get lost without a guide and have to sleep in some ghostly palace that had known no living tenant since that awful november night of eighteen centuries ago  we passed through the gate which faces the mediterranean called the marine gate and by the rusty broken image of minerva still keeping tireless watch and ward over the possessions it was powerless to save and went up a long street and stood in the broad court of the forum of justice  the floor was level and clean and up and down either side was a noble colonnade of broken pillars with their beautiful ionic and corinthian columns scattered about them  at the upper end were the vacant seats of the judges and behind them we descended into a dungeon where the ashes and cinders had found two prisoners chained on that memorable november night and tortured them to death  how they must have tugged at the pitiless fetters as the fierce fires surged around them  then we lounged through many and many a sumptuous private mansion which we could not have entered without a formal invitation in incomprehensible latin in the olden time when the owners lived thereand we probably wouldnt have got it  these people built their houses a good deal alike the floors were laid in fanciful figures wrought in mosaics of manycolored marbles  at the threshold your eyes fall upon a latin sentence of welcome sometimes or a picture of a dog with the legend beware of the dog and sometimes a picture of a bear or a faun with no inscription at all  then you enter a sort of vestibule where they used to keep the hatrack i suppose next a room with a large marble basin in the midst and the pipes of a fountain on either side are bedrooms beyond the fountain is a receptionroom then a little garden diningroom and so forth and so on  the floors were all mosaic the walls were stuccoed or frescoed or ornamented with basreliefs and here and there were statues large and small and little fishpools and cascades of sparkling water that sprang from secret places in the colonnade of handsome pillars that surrounded the court and kept the flowerbeds fresh and the air cool  those pompeiians were very luxurious in their tastes and habits  the most exquisite bronzes we have seen in europe came from the exhumed cities of herculaneum and pompeii and also the finest cameos and the most delicate engravings on precious stones their pictures eighteen or nineteen centuries old are often much more pleasing than the celebrated rubbish of the old masters of three centuries ago  they were well up in art  from the creation of these works of the first clear up to the eleventh century art seems hardly to have existed at allat least no remnants of it are leftand it was curious to see how far in some things at any rate these old time pagans excelled the remote generations of masters that came after them the pride of the world in sculptures seem to be the laocoon and the dying gladiator in rome  they are as old as pompeii were dug from the earth like pompeii but their exact age or who made them can only be conjectured  but worn and cracked without a history and with the blemishing stains of numberless centuries upon them they still mutely mock at all efforts to rival their perfections  it was a quaint and curious pastime wandering through this old silent city of the deadlounging through utterly deserted streets where thousands and thousands of human beings once bought and sold and walked and rode and made the place resound with the noise and confusion of traffic and pleasure  they were not lazy  they hurried in those days we had evidence of that  there was a temple on one corner and it was a shorter cut to go between the columns of that temple from one street to the other than to go aroundand behold that pathway had been worn deep into the heavy flagstone floor of the building by generations of timesaving feet  they would not go around when it was quicker to go through  we do that way in our cities  every where you see things that make you wonder how old these old houses were before the night of destruction camethings too which bring back those long dead inhabitants and place the living before your eyes  for instance the steps two feet thicklava blocks that lead up out of the school and the same kind of steps that lead up into the dress circle of the principal theatre are almost worn through  for ages the boys hurried out of that school and for ages their parents hurried into that theatre and the nervous feet that have been dust and ashes for eighteen centuries have left their record for us to read today  i imagined i could see crowds of gentlemen and ladies thronging into the theatre with tickets for secured seats in their hands and on the wall i read the imaginary placard in infamous grammar positively no free list except members of the press  hanging about the doorway i fancied were slouchy pompeiian streetboys uttering slang and profanity and keeping a wary eye out for checks  i entered the theatre and sat down in one of the long rows of stone benches in the dress circle and looked at the place for the orchestra and the ruined stage and around at the wide sweep of empty boxes and thought to myself this house wont pay  i tried to imagine the music in full blast the leader of the orchestra beating time and the versatile soandso who had just returned from a most successful tour in the provinces to play his last and farewell engagement of positively six nights only in pompeii previous to his departure for herculaneum charging around the stage and piling the agony mountains highbut i could not do it with such a house as that those empty benches tied my fancy down to dull reality  i said these people that ought to be here have been dead and still and moldering to dust for ages and ages and will never care for the trifles and follies of life any more for everowing to circumstances etc etc there will not be any performance tonight  close down the curtain  put out the lights  and so i turned away and went through shop after shop and store after store far down the long street of the merchants and called for the wares of rome and the east but the tradesmen were gone the marts were silent and nothing was left but the broken jars all set in cement of cinders and ashes the wine and the oil that once had filled them were gone with their owners  in a bakeshop was a mill for grinding the grain and the furnaces for baking the bread and they say that here in the same furnaces the exhumers of pompeii found nice well baked loaves which the baker had not found time to remove from the ovens the last time he left his shop because circumstances compelled him to leave in such a hurry  in one house the only building in pompeii which no woman is now allowed to enter were the small rooms and short beds of solid masonry just as they were in the old times and on the walls were pictures which looked almost as fresh as if they were painted yesterday but which no pen could have the hardihood to describe and here and there were latin inscriptionsobscene scintillations of wit scratched by hands that possibly were uplifted to heaven for succor in the midst of a driving storm of fire before the night was done  in one of the principal streets was a ponderous stone tank and a waterspout that supplied it and where the tired heated toilers from the campagna used to rest their right hands when they bent over to put their lips to the spout the thick stone was worn down to a broad groove an inch or two deep  think of the countless thousands of hands that had pressed that spot in the ages that are gone to so reduce a stone that is as hard as iron  they had a great public bulletin board in pompeiia place where announcements for gladiatorial combats elections and such things were postednot on perishable paper but carved in enduring stone  one lady who i take it was rich and well brought up advertised a dwelling or so to rent with baths and all the modern improvements and several hundred shops stipulating that the dwellings should not be put to immoral purposes  you can find out who lived in many a house in pompeii by the carved stone doorplates affixed to them and in the same way you can tell who they were that occupy the tombs  every where around are things that reveal to you something of the customs and history of this forgotten people  but what would a volcano leave of an american city if it once rained its cinders on it  hardly a sign or a symbol to tell its story  in one of these long pompeiian halls the skeleton of a man was found with ten pieces of gold in one hand and a large key in the other  he had seized his money and started toward the door but the fiery tempest caught him at the very threshold and he sank down and died  one more minute of precious time would have saved him  i saw the skeletons of a man a woman and two young girls  the woman had her hands spread wide apart as if in mortal terror and i imagined i could still trace upon her shapeless face something of the expression of wild despair that distorted it when the heavens rained fire in these streets so many ages ago  the girls and the man lay with their faces upon their arms as if they had tried to shield them from the enveloping cinders  in one apartment eighteen skeletons were found all in sitting postures and blackened places on the walls still mark their shapes and show their attitudes like shadows  one of them a woman still wore upon her skeleton throat a necklace with her name engraved upon itjulie di diomede  but perhaps the most poetical thing pompeii has yielded to modern research was that grand figure of a roman soldier clad in complete armor who true to his duty true to his proud name of a soldier of rome and full of the stern courage which had given to that name its glory stood to his post by the city gate erect and unflinching till the hell that raged around him burned out the dauntless spirit it could not conquer  we never read of pompeii but we think of that soldier we can not write of pompeii without the natural impulse to grant to him the mention he so well deserves  let us remember that he was a soldiernot a policeman and so praise him  being a soldier he staidbecause the warrior instinct forbade him to fly  had he been a policeman he would have staid alsobecause he would have been asleep  there are not half a dozen flights of stairs in pompeii and no other evidences that the houses were more than one story high  the people did not live in the clouds as do the venetians the genoese and neapolitans of today  we came out from under the solemn mysteries of this city of the venerable pastthis city which perished with all its old ways and its quaint old fashions about it remote centuries ago when the disciples were preaching the new religion which is as old as the hills to us nowand went dreaming among the trees that grow over acres and acres of its still buried streets and squares till a shrill whistle and the cry of all aboardlast train for naples  woke me up and reminded me that i belonged in the nineteenth century and was not a dusty mummy caked with ashes and cinders eighteen hundred years old  the transition was startling  the idea of a railroad train actually running to old dead pompeii and whistling irreverently and calling for passengers in the most bustling and businesslike way was as strange a thing as one could imagine and as unpoetical and disagreeable as it was strange  compare the cheerful life and the sunshine of this day with the horrors the younger pliny saw here the 9th of november ad 79 when he was so bravely striving to remove his mother out of reach of harm while she begged him with all a mothers unselfishness to leave her to perish and save himself       by this time the murky darkness had so increased that one might      have believed himself abroad in a black and moonless night or in a      chamber where all the lights had been extinguished  on every hand      was heard the complaints of women the wailing of children and the      cries of men  one called his father another his son and another      his wife and only by their voices could they know each other  many      in their despair begged that death would come and end their      distress       some implored the gods to succor them and some believed that this      night was the last the eternal night which should engulf the      universe       even so it seemed to meand i consoled myself for the coming death      with the reflection behold the world is passing away                                         after browsing among the stately ruins of rome of baiae of pompeii and after glancing down the long marble ranks of battered and nameless imperial heads that stretch down the corridors of the vatican one thing strikes me with a force it never had before the unsubstantial unlasting character of fame  men lived long lives in the olden time and struggled feverishly through them toiling like slaves in oratory in generalship or in literature and then laid them down and died happy in the possession of an enduring history and a deathless name  well twenty little centuries flutter away and what is left of these things  a crazy inscription on a block of stone which snuffy antiquaries bother over and tangle up and make nothing out of but a bare name which they spell wrongno history no tradition no poetrynothing that can give it even a passing interest  what may be left of general grants great name forty centuries hence  thisin the encyclopedia for a d 5868 possibly       uriah s or z grauntpopular poet of ancient times in the aztec      provinces of the united states of british america  some authors say      flourished about a d 742 but the learned ahah foofoo states      that he was a cotemporary of scharkspyre the english poet and      flourished about a d 1328 some three centuries after the trojan      war instead of before it  he wrote rock me to sleep mother  these thoughts sadden me  i will to bed     chapter xxxii  home again  for the first time in many weeks the ships entire family met and shook hands on the quarterdeck  they had gathered from many points of the compass and from many lands but not one was missing there was no tale of sickness or death among the flock to dampen the pleasure of the reunion  once more there was a full audience on deck to listen to the sailors chorus as they got the anchor up and to wave an adieu to the land as we sped away from naples  the seats were full at dinner again the domino parties were complete and the life and bustle on the upper deck in the fine moonlight at night was like old timesold times that had been gone weeks only but yet they were weeks so crowded with incident adventure and excitement that they seemed almost like years there was no lack of cheerfulness on board the quaker city  for once her title was a misnomer  at seven in the evening with the western horizon all golden from the sunken sun and specked with distant ships the full moon sailing high over head the dark blue of the sea under foot and a strange sort of twilight affected by all these different lights and colors around us and about us we sighted superb stromboli  with what majesty the monarch held his lonely state above the level sea  distance clothed him in a purple gloom and added a veil of shimmering mist that so softened his rugged features that we seemed to see him through a web of silver gauze his torch was out his fires were smoldering a tall column of smoke that rose up and lost itself in the growing moonlight was all the sign he gave that he was a living autocrat of the sea and not the spectre of a dead one  at two in the morning we swept through the straits of messina and so bright was the moonlight that italy on the one hand and sicily on the other seemed almost as distinctly visible as though we looked at them from the middle of a street we were traversing  the city of messina milkwhite and starred and spangled all over with gaslights was a fairy spectacle  a great party of us were on deck smoking and making a noise and waiting to see famous scylla and charybdis  and presently the oracle stepped out with his eternal spyglass and squared himself on the deck like another colossus of rhodes  it was a surprise to see him abroad at such an hour  nobody supposed he cared anything about an old fable like that of scylla and charybdis  one of the boys said  hello doctor what are you doing up here at this time of nightwhat do you want to see this place for  what do i want to see this place for  young man little do you know me or you wouldnt ask such a question  i wish to see all the places thats mentioned in the bible  stuffthis place isnt mentioned in the bible  it aint mentioned in the biblethis place aintwell now what place is this since you know so much about it  why its scylla and charybdis  scylla and chaconfound it i thought it was sodom and gomorrah  and he closed up his glass and went below  the above is the ship story its plausibility is marred a little by the fact that the oracle was not a biblical student and did not spend much of his time instructing himself about scriptural localitiesthey say the oracle complains in this hot weather lately that the only beverage in the ship that is passable is the butter  he did not mean butter of course but inasmuch as that article remains in a melted state now since we are out of ice it is fair to give him the credit of getting one long word in the right place anyhow for once in his life  he said in rome that the pope was a noblelooking old man but he never did think much of his iliad  we spent one pleasant day skirting along the isles of greece  they are very mountainous  their prevailing tints are gray and brown approaching to red  little white villages surrounded by trees nestle in the valleys or roost upon the lofty perpendicular seawalls  we had one fine sunseta rich carmine flush that suffused the western sky and cast a ruddy glow far over the seafine sunsets seem to be rare in this part of the worldor at least striking ones  they are soft sensuous lovelythey are exquisite refined effeminate but we have seen no sunsets here yet like the gorgeous conflagrations that flame in the track of the sinking sun in our high northern latitudes  but what were sunsets to us with the wild excitement upon us of approaching the most renowned of cities  what cared we for outward visions when agamemnon achilles and a thousand other heroes of the great past were marching in ghostly procession through our fancies  what were sunsets to us who were about to live and breathe and walk in actual athens yea and go far down into the dead centuries and bid in person for the slaves diogenes and plato in the public marketplace or gossip with the neighbors about the siege of troy or the splendid deeds of marathon  we scorned to consider sunsets  we arrived and entered the ancient harbor of the piraeus at last  we dropped anchor within half a mile of the village  away off across the undulating plain of attica could be seen a little squaretopped hill with a something on it which our glasses soon discovered to be the ruined edifices of the citadel of the athenians and most prominent among them loomed the venerable parthenon  so exquisitely clear and pure is this wonderful atmosphere that every column of the noble structure was discernible through the telescope and even the smaller ruins about it assumed some semblance of shape  this at a distance of five or six miles  in the valley near the acropolis the squaretopped hill before spoken of athens itself could be vaguely made out with an ordinary lorgnette  every body was anxious to get ashore and visit these classic localities as quickly as possible  no land we had yet seen had aroused such universal interest among the passengers  but bad news came  the commandant of the piraeus came in his boat and said we must either depart or else get outside the harbor and remain imprisoned in our ship under rigid quarantine for eleven days  so we took up the anchor and moved outside to lie a dozen hours or so taking in supplies and then sail for constantinople  it was the bitterest disappointment we had yet experienced  to lie a whole day in sight of the acropolis and yet be obliged to go away without visiting athens disappointment was hardly a strong enough word to describe the circumstances  all hands were on deck all the afternoon with books and maps and glasses trying to determine which narrow rocky ridge was the areopagus which sloping hill the pnyx which elevation the museum hill and so on  and we got things confused  discussion became heated and party spirit ran high  church members were gazing with emotion upon a hill which they said was the one st paul preached from and another faction claimed that that hill was hymettus and another that it was pentelicon  after all the trouble we could be certain of only one thingthe squaretopped hill was the acropolis and the grand ruin that crowned it was the parthenon whose picture we knew in infancy in the school books  we inquired of every body who came near the ship whether there were guards in the piraeus whether they were strict what the chances were of capture should any of us slip ashore and in case any of us made the venture and were caught what would be probably done to us  the answers were discouraging there was a strong guard or police force the piraeus was a small town and any stranger seen in it would surely attract attentioncapture would be certain  the commandant said the punishment would be heavy when asked how heavy he said it would be very severethat was all we could get out of him  at eleven oclock at night when most of the ships company were abed four of us stole softly ashore in a small boat a clouded moon favoring the enterprise and started two and two and far apart over a low hill intending to go clear around the piraeus out of the range of its police picking our way so stealthily over that rocky nettlegrown eminence made me feel a good deal as if i were on my way somewhere to steal something  my immediate comrade and i talked in an undertone about quarantine laws and their penalties but we found nothing cheering in the subject  i was posted  only a few days before i was talking with our captain and he mentioned the case of a man who swam ashore from a quarantined ship somewhere and got imprisoned six months for it and when he was in genoa a few years ago a captain of a quarantined ship went in his boat to a departing ship which was already outside of the harbor and put a letter on board to be taken to his family and the authorities imprisoned him three months for it and then conducted him and his ship fairly to sea and warned him never to show himself in that port again while he lived  this kind of conversation did no good further than to give a sort of dismal interest to our quarantinebreaking expedition and so we dropped it  we made the entire circuit of the town without seeing any body but one man who stared at us curiously but said nothing and a dozen persons asleep on the ground before their doors whom we walked among and never wokebut we woke up dogs enough in all consciencewe always had one or two barking at our heels and several times we had as many as ten and twelve at once  they made such a preposterous din that persons aboard our ship said they could tell how we were progressing for a long time and where we were by the barking of the dogs  the clouded moon still favored us  when we had made the whole circuit and were passing among the houses on the further side of the town the moon came out splendidly but we no longer feared the light as we approached a well near a house to get a drink the owner merely glanced at us and went within  he left the quiet slumbering town at our mercy  i record it here proudly that we didnt do any thing to it  seeing no road we took a tall hill to the left of the distant acropolis for a mark and steered straight for it over all obstructions and over a little rougher piece of country than exists any where else outside of the state of nevada perhaps  part of the way it was covered with small loose stoneswe trod on six at a time and they all rolled  another part of it was dry loose newlyploughed ground  still another part of it was a long stretch of low grapevines which were tanglesome and troublesome and which we took to be brambles  the attic plain barring the grapevines was a barren desolate unpoetical wastei wonder what it was in greeces age of glory five hundred years before christ  in the neighborhood of one oclock in the morning when we were heated with fast walking and parched with thirst denny exclaimed why these weeds are grapevines  and in five minutes we had a score of bunches of large white delicious grapes and were reaching down for more when a dark shape rose mysteriously up out of the shadows beside us and said ho  and so we left  in ten minutes more we struck into a beautiful road and unlike some others we had stumbled upon at intervals it led in the right direction we followed it  it was broad and smooth and whitehandsome and in perfect repair and shaded on both sides for a mile or so with single ranks of trees and also with luxuriant vineyards  twice we entered and stole grapes and the second time somebody shouted at us from some invisible place  whereupon we left again  we speculated in grapes no more on that side of athens  shortly we came upon an ancient stone aqueduct built upon arches and from that time forth we had ruins all about uswe were approaching our journeys end  we could not see the acropolis now or the high hill either and i wanted to follow the road till we were abreast of them but the others overruled me and we toiled laboriously up the stony hill immediately in our frontand from its summit saw anotherclimbed it and saw another  it was an hour of exhausting work  soon we came upon a row of open graves cut in the solid rockfor a while one of them served socrates for a prisonwe passed around the shoulder of the hill and the citadel in all its ruined magnificence burst upon us  we hurried across the ravine and up a winding road and stood on the old acropolis with the prodigious walls of the citadel towering above our heads  we did not stop to inspect their massive blocks of marble or measure their height or guess at their extraordinary thickness but passed at once through a great arched passage like a railway tunnel and went straight to the gate that leads to the ancient temples  it was locked  so after all it seemed that we were not to see the great parthenon face to face we sat down and held a council of war  result the gate was only a flimsy structure of woodwe would break it down  it seemed like desecration but then we had traveled far and our necessities were urgent  we could not hunt up guides and keeperswe must be on the ship before daylight  so we argued  this was all very fine but when we came to break the gate we could not do it  we moved around an angle of the wall and found a low bastioneight feet high withoutten or twelve within  denny prepared to scale it and we got ready to follow  by dint of hard scrambling he finally straddled the top but some loose stones crumbled away and fell with a crash into the court within  there was instantly a banging of doors and a shout  denny dropped from the wall in a twinkling and we retreated in disorder to the gate  xerxes took that mighty citadel four hundred and eighty years before christ when his five millions of soldiers and campfollowers followed him to greece and if we four americans could have remained unmolested five minutes longer we would have taken it too  the garrison had turned outfour greeks  we clamored at the gate and they admitted us  bribery and corruption  we crossed a large court entered a great door and stood upon a pavement of purest white marble deeply worn by footprints  before us in the flooding moonlight rose the noblest ruins we had ever looked uponthe propylae a small temple of minerva the temple of hercules and the grand parthenon  we got these names from the greek guide who didnt seem to know more than seven men ought to know these edifices were all built of the whitest pentelic marble but have a pinkish stain upon them now  where any part is broken however the fracture looks like fine loaf sugar  six caryatides or marble women clad in flowing robes support the portico of the temple of hercules but the porticos and colonnades of the other structures are formed of massive doric and ionic pillars whose flutings and capitals are still measurably perfect notwithstanding the centuries that have gone over them and the sieges they have suffered  the parthenon originally was two hundred and twentysix feet long one hundred wide and seventy high and had two rows of great columns eight in each at either end and single rows of seventeen each down the sides and was one of the most graceful and beautiful edifices ever erected  most of the parthenons imposing columns are still standing but the roof is gone  it was a perfect building two hundred and fifty years ago when a shell dropped into the venetian magazine stored here and the explosion which followed wrecked and unroofed it  i remember but little about the parthenon and i have put in one or two facts and figures for the use of other people with short memories  got them from the guidebook  as we wandered thoughtfully down the marblepaved length of this stately temple the scene about us was strangely impressive  here and there in lavish profusion were gleaming white statues of men and women propped against blocks of marble some of them armless some without legs others headlessbut all looking mournful in the moonlight and startlingly human  they rose up and confronted the midnight intruder on every side they stared at him with stony eyes from unlookedfor nooks and recesses they peered at him over fragmentary heaps far down the desolate corridors they barred his way in the midst of the broad forum and solemnly pointed with handless arms the way from the sacred fane and through the roofless temple the moon looked down and banded the floor and darkened the scattered fragments and broken statues with the slanting shadows of the columns  what a world of ruined sculpture was about us  set up in rowsstacked up in pilesscattered broadcast over the wide area of the acropolis were hundreds of crippled statues of all sizes and of the most exquisite workmanship and vast fragments of marble that once belonged to the entablatures covered with basreliefs representing battles and sieges ships of war with three and four tiers of oars pageants and processions every thing one could think of  history says that the temples of the acropolis were filled with the noblest works of praxiteles and phidias and of many a great master in sculpture besidesand surely these elegant fragments attest it  we walked out into the grassgrown fragmentstrewn court beyond the parthenon  it startled us every now and then to see a stony white face stare suddenly up at us out of the grass with its dead eyes  the place seemed alive with ghosts  i half expected to see the athenian heroes of twenty centuries ago glide out of the shadows and steal into the old temple they knew so well and regarded with such boundless pride  the full moon was riding high in the cloudless heavens now  we sauntered carelessly and unthinkingly to the edge of the lofty battlements of the citadel and looked downa vision  and such a vision  athens by moonlight  the prophet that thought the splendors of the new jerusalem were revealed to him surely saw this instead  it lay in the level plain right under our feetall spread abroad like a pictureand we looked down upon it as we might have looked from a balloon  we saw no semblance of a street but every house every window every clinging vine every projection was as distinct and sharply marked as if the time were noonday and yet there was no glare no glitter nothing harsh or repulsivethe noiseless city was flooded with the mellowest light that ever streamed from the moon and seemed like some living creature wrapped in peaceful slumber  on its further side was a little temple whose delicate pillars and ornate front glowed with a rich lustre that chained the eye like a spell and nearer by the palace of the king reared its creamy walls out of the midst of a great garden of shrubbery that was flecked all over with a random shower of amber lights a spray of golden sparks that lost their brightness in the glory of the moon and glinted softly upon the sea of dark foliage like the pallid stars of the milkyway  overhead the stately columns majestic still in their ruinunder foot the dreaming cityin the distance the silver sea not on the broad earth is there an other picture half so beautiful  as we turned and moved again through the temple i wished that the illustrious men who had sat in it in the remote ages could visit it again and reveal themselves to our curious eyesplato aristotle demosthenes socrates phocion pythagoras euclid pindar xenophon herodotus praxiteles and phidias zeuxis the painter  what a constellation of celebrated names  but more than all i wished that old diogenes groping so patiently with his lantern searching so zealously for one solitary honest man in all the world might meander along and stumble on our party  i ought not to say it may be but still i suppose he would have put out his light  we left the parthenon to keep its watch over old athens as it had kept it for twentythree hundred years and went and stood outside the walls of the citadel  in the distance was the ancient but still almost perfect temple of theseus and close by looking to the west was the bema from whence demosthenes thundered his philippics and fired the wavering patriotism of his countrymen  to the right was mars hill where the areopagus sat in ancient times and where st paul defined his position and below was the marketplace where he disputed daily with the gossiploving athenians  we climbed the stone steps st paul ascended and stood in the squarecut place he stood in and tried to recollect the bible account of the matterbut for certain reasons i could not recall the words  i have found them since       now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred in      him when he saw the city wholly given up to idolatry  therefore      disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout      persons and in the market daily with them that met with him                                        and they took him and brought him unto areopagus saying may we      know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is                                        then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said ye men of      athens i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious for      as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this      inscription to the unknown god  whom therefore ye ignorantly      worship him declare i unto youacts ch xvii  it occurred to us after a while that if we wanted to get home before daylight betrayed us we had better be moving  so we hurried away  when far on our road we had a parting view of the parthenon with the moonlight streaming through its open colonnades and touching its capitals with silver  as it looked then solemn grand and beautiful it will always remain in our memories  as we marched along we began to get over our fears and ceased to care much about quarantine scouts or any body else  we grew bold and reckless and once in a sudden burst of courage i even threw a stone at a dog  it was a pleasant reflection though that i did not hit him because his master might just possibly have been a policeman  inspired by this happy failure my valor became utterly uncontrollable and at intervals i absolutely whistled though on a moderate key  but boldness breeds boldness and shortly i plunged into a vineyard in the full light of the moon and captured a gallon of superb grapes not even minding the presence of a peasant who rode by on a mule  denny and birch followed my example  now i had grapes enough for a dozen but then jackson was all swollen up with courage too and he was obliged to enter a vineyard presently  the first bunch he seized brought trouble  a frowsy bearded brigand sprang into the road with a shout and flourished a musket in the light of the moon  we sidled toward the piraeusnot running you understand but only advancing with celerity  the brigand shouted again but still we advanced  it was getting late and we had no time to fool away on every ass that wanted to drivel greek platitudes to us  we would just as soon have talked with him as not if we had not been in a hurry  presently denny said those fellows are following us  we turned and sure enough there they werethree fantastic pirates armed with guns  we slackened our pace to let them come up and in the meantime i got out my cargo of grapes and dropped them firmly but reluctantly into the shadows by the wayside  but i was not afraid  i only felt that it was not right to steal grapes  and all the more so when the owner was aroundand not only around but with his friends around also  the villains came up and searched a bundle dr birch had in his hand and scowled upon him when they found it had nothing in it but some holy rocks from mars hill and these were not contraband  they evidently suspected him of playing some wretched fraud upon them and seemed half inclined to scalp the party  but finally they dismissed us with a warning couched in excellent greek i suppose and dropped tranquilly in our wake  when they had gone three hundred yards they stopped and we went on rejoiced  but behold another armed rascal came out of the shadows and took their place and followed us two hundred yards  then he delivered us over to another miscreant who emerged from some mysterious place and he in turn to another  for a mile and a half our rear was guarded all the while by armed men  i never traveled in so much state before in all my life  it was a good while after that before we ventured to steal any more grapes and when we did we stirred up another troublesome brigand and then we ceased all further speculation in that line  i suppose that fellow that rode by on the mule posted all the sentinels from athens to the piraeus about us  every field on that long route was watched by an armed sentinel some of whom had fallen asleep no doubt but were on hand nevertheless  this shows what sort of a country modern attica isa community of questionable characters  these men were not there to guard their possessions against strangers but against each other for strangers seldom visit athens and the piraeus and when they do they go in daylight and can buy all the grapes they want for a trifle  the modern inhabitants are confiscators and falsifiers of high repute if gossip speaks truly concerning them and i freely believe it does  just as the earliest tinges of the dawn flushed the eastern sky and turned the pillared parthenon to a broken harp hung in the pearly horizon we closed our thirteenth mile of weary roundabout marching and emerged upon the seashore abreast the ships with our usual escort of fifteen hundred piraean dogs howling at our heels  we hailed a boat that was two or three hundred yards from shore and discovered in a moment that it was a policeboat on the lookout for any quarantinebreakers that might chance to be abroad  so we dodgedwe were used to that by this timeand when the scouts reached the spot we had so lately occupied we were absent  they cruised along the shore but in the wrong direction and shortly our own boat issued from the gloom and took us aboard  they had heard our signal on the ship  we rowed noiselessly away and before the policeboat came in sight again we were safe at home once more  four more of our passengers were anxious to visit athens and started half an hour after we returned but they had not been ashore five minutes till the police discovered and chased them so hotly that they barely escaped to their boat again and that was all  they pursued the enterprise no further  we set sail for constantinople today but some of us little care for that  we have seen all there was to see in the old city that had its birth sixteen hundred years before christ was born and was an old town before the foundations of troy were laidand saw it in its most attractive aspect  wherefore why should we worry  two other passengers ran the blockade successfully last night  so we learned this morning  they slipped away so quietly that they were not missed from the ship for several hours  they had the hardihood to march into the piraeus in the early dusk and hire a carriage  they ran some danger of adding two or three months imprisonment to the other novelties of their holy land pleasure excursion  i admire cheekquotation from the pilgrimsbut they went and came safely and never walked a step     chapter xxxiii  from athens all through the islands of the grecian archipelago we saw little but forbidding seawalls and barren hills sometimes surmounted by three or four graceful columns of some ancient temple lonely and deserteda fitting symbol of the desolation that has come upon all greece in these latter ages  we saw no ploughed fields very few villages no trees or grass or vegetation of any kind scarcely and hardly ever an isolated house  greece is a bleak unsmiling desert without agriculture manufactures or commerce apparently  what supports its povertystricken people or its government is a mystery  i suppose that ancient greece and modern greece compared furnish the most extravagant contrast to be found in history  george i an infant of eighteen and a scraggy nest of foreign office holders sit in the places of themistocles pericles and the illustrious scholars and generals of the golden age of greece  the fleets that were the wonder of the world when the parthenon was new are a beggarly handful of fishingsmacks now and the manly people that performed such miracles of valor at marathon are only a tribe of unconsidered slaves today  the classic illyssus has gone dry and so have all the sources of grecian wealth and greatness  the nation numbers only eight hundred thousand souls and there is poverty and misery and mendacity enough among them to furnish forty millions and be liberal about it  under king otho the revenues of the state were five millions of dollarsraised from a tax of onetenth of all the agricultural products of the land which tenth the farmer had to bring to the royal granaries on packmules any distance not exceeding six leagues and from extravagant taxes on trade and commerce  out of that five millions the small tyrant tried to keep an army of ten thousand men pay all the hundreds of useless grand equerries in waiting first grooms of the bedchamber lord high chancellors of the exploded exchequer and all the other absurdities which these puppykingdoms indulge in in imitation of the great monarchies and in addition he set about building a white marble palace to cost about five millions itself the result was simply ten into five goes no times and none over  all these things could not be done with five millions and otho fell into trouble  the greek throne with its unpromising adjuncts of a ragged population of ingenious rascals who were out of employment eight months in the year because there was little for them to borrow and less to confiscate and a waste of barren hills and weedgrown deserts went begging for a good while  it was offered to one of victorias sons and afterwards to various other younger sons of royalty who had no thrones and were out of business but they all had the charity to decline the dreary honor and veneration enough for greeces ancient greatness to refuse to mock her sorrowful rags and dirt with a tinsel throne in this day of her humiliationtill they came to this young danish george and he took it he has finished the splendid palace i saw in the radiant moonlight the other night and is doing many other things for the salvation of greece they say  we sailed through the barren archipelago and into the narrow channel they sometimes call the dardanelles and sometimes the hellespont  this part of the country is rich in historic reminiscences and poor as sahara in every thing else  for instance as we approached the dardanelles we coasted along the plains of troy and past the mouth of the scamander we saw where troy had stood in the distance and where it does not stand nowa city that perished when the world was young  the poor trojans are all dead now  they were born too late to see noahs ark and died too soon to see our menagerie  we saw where agamemnons fleets rendezvoused and away inland a mountain which the map said was mount ida  within the hellespont we saw where the original first shoddy contract mentioned in history was carried out and the parties of the second part gently rebuked by xerxes  i speak of the famous bridge of boats which xerxes ordered to be built over the narrowest part of the hellespont where it is only two or three miles wide a moderate gale destroyed the flimsy structure and the king thinking that to publicly rebuke the contractors might have a good effect on the next set called them out before the army and had them beheaded  in the next ten minutes he let a new contract for the bridge  it has been observed by ancient writers that the second bridge was a very good bridge  xerxes crossed his host of five millions of men on it and if it had not been purposely destroyed it would probably have been there yet  if our government would rebuke some of our shoddy contractors occasionally it might work much good  in the hellespont we saw where leander and lord byron swam across the one to see her upon whom his souls affections were fixed with a devotion that only death could impair and the other merely for a flyer as jack says we had two noted tombs near us too  on one shore slept ajax and on the other hecuba  we had water batteries and forts on both sides of the hellespont flying the crimson flag of turkey with its white crescent and occasionally a village and sometimes a train of camels we had all these to look at till we entered the broad sea of marmora and then the land soon fading from view we resumed euchre and whist once more  we dropped anchor in the mouth of the golden horn at daylight in the morning  only three or four of us were up to see the great ottoman capital  the passengers do not turn out at unseasonable hours as they used to to get the earliest possible glimpse of strange foreign cities they are well over that  if we were lying in sight of the pyramids of egypt they would not come on deck until after breakfast nowadays  the golden horn is a narrow arm of the sea which branches from the bosporus a sort of broad river which connects the marmora and black seas and curving around divides the city in the middle  galata and pera are on one side of the bosporus and the golden horn stamboul ancient byzantium is upon the other  on the other bank of the bosporus is scutari and other suburbs of constantinople  this great city contains a million inhabitants but so narrow are its streets and so crowded together are its houses that it does not cover much more than half as much ground as new york city  seen from the anchorage or from a mile or so up the bosporus it is by far the handsomest city we have seen  its dense array of houses swells upward from the waters edge and spreads over the domes of many hills and the gardens that peep out here and there the great globes of the mosques and the countless minarets that meet the eye every where invest the metropolis with the quaint oriental aspect one dreams of when he reads books of eastern travel constantinople makes a noble picture  but its attractiveness begins and ends with its picturesqueness  from the time one starts ashore till he gets back again he execrates it  the boat he goes in is admirably miscalculated for the service it is built for  it is handsomely and neatly fitted up but no man could handle it well in the turbulent currents that sweep down the bosporus from the black sea and few men could row it satisfactorily even in still water it is a long light canoe caique large at one end and tapering to a knife blade at the other  they make that long sharp end the bow and you can imagine how these boiling currents spin it about  it has two oars and sometimes four and no rudder  you start to go to a given point and you run in fifty different directions before you get there  first one oar is backing water and then the other it is seldom that both are going ahead at once  this kind of boating is calculated to drive an impatient man mad in a week  the boatmen are the awkwardest the stupidest and the most unscientific on earth without question  ashore it waswell it was an eternal circus  people were thicker than bees in those narrow streets and the men were dressed in all the outrageous outlandish idolatrous extravagant thunderandlightning costumes that ever a tailor with the delirium tremens and seven devils could conceive of  there was no freak in dress too crazy to be indulged in no absurdity too absurd to be tolerated no frenzy in ragged diabolism too fantastic to be attempted  no two men were dressed alike it was a wild masquerade of all imaginable costumesevery struggling throng in every street was a dissolving view of stunning contrasts  some patriarchs wore awful turbans but the grand mass of the infidel horde wore the fiery red skullcap they call a fez  all the remainder of the raiment they indulged in was utterly indescribable  the shops here are mere coops mere boxes bathrooms closetsany thing you please to call themon the first floor  the turks sit crosslegged in them and work and trade and smoke long pipes and smell likelike turks  that covers the ground  crowding the narrow streets in front of them are beggars who beg forever yet never collect any thing and wonderful cripples distorted out of all semblance of humanity almost vagabonds driving laden asses porters carrying drygoods boxes as large as cottages on their backs peddlers of grapes hot corn pumpkin seeds and a hundred other things yelling like fiends and sleeping happily comfortably serenely among the hurrying feet are the famed dogs of constantinople drifting noiselessly about are squads of turkish women draped from chin to feet in flowing robes and with snowy veils bound about their heads that disclose only the eyes and a vague shadowy notion of their features  seen moving about far away in the dim arched aisles of the great bazaar they look as the shrouded dead must have looked when they walked forth from their graves amid the storms and thunders and earthquakes that burst upon calvary that awful night of the crucifixion  a street in constantinople is a picture which one ought to see oncenot oftener  and then there was the gooseranchera fellow who drove a hundred geese before him about the city and tried to sell them  he had a pole ten feet long with a crook in the end of it and occasionally a goose would branch out from the flock and make a lively break around the corner with wings half lifted and neck stretched to its utmost  did the goosemerchant get excited  no  he took his pole and reached after that goose with unspeakable sang froidtook a hitch round his neck and yanked him back to his place in the flock without an effort  he steered his geese with that stick as easily as another man would steer a yawl  a few hours afterward we saw him sitting on a stone at a corner in the midst of the turmoil sound asleep in the sun with his geese squatting around him or dodging out of the way of asses and men  we came by again within the hour and he was taking account of stock to see whether any of his flock had strayed or been stolen  the way he did it was unique he put the end of his stick within six or eight inches of a stone wall and made the geese march in single file between it and the wall  he counted them as they went by  there was no dodging that arrangement  if you want dwarfsi mean just a few dwarfs for a curiositygo to genoa  if you wish to buy them by the gross for retail go to milan there are plenty of dwarfs all over italy but it did seem to me that in milan the crop was luxuriant  if you would see a fair average style of assorted cripples go to naples or travel through the roman states but if you would see the very heart and home of cripples and human monsters both go straight to constantinople  a beggar in naples who can show a foot which has all run into one horrible toe with one shapeless nail on it has a fortunebut such an exhibition as that would not provoke any notice in constantinople  the man would starve  who would pay any attention to attractions like his among the rare monsters that throng the bridges of the golden horn and display their deformities in the gutters of stamboul  o wretched impostor  how could he stand against the threelegged woman and the man with his eye in his cheek how would he blush in presence of the man with fingers on his elbow where would he hide himself when the dwarf with seven fingers on each hand no upper lip and his underjaw gone came down in his majesty bismillah  the cripples of europe are a delusion and a fraud  the truly gifted flourish only in the byways of pera and stamboul  that threelegged woman lay on the bridge with her stock in trade so disposed as to command the most striking effectone natural leg and two long slender twisted ones with feet on them like somebody elses forearm  then there was a man further along who had no eyes and whose face was the color of a flyblown beefsteak and wrinkled and twisted like a lavaflowand verily so tumbled and distorted were his features that no man could tell the wart that served him for a nose from his cheekbones in stamboul was a man with a prodigious head an uncommonly long body legs eight inches long and feet like snowshoes  he traveled on those feet and his hands and was as swaybacked as if the colossus of rhodes had been riding him  ah a beggar has to have exceedingly good points to make a living in constantinople  a bluefaced man who had nothing to offer except that he had been blown up in a mine would be regarded as a rank impostor and a mere damaged soldier on crutches would never make a cent  it would pay him to get apiece of his head taken off and cultivate a wen like a carpet sack  the mosque of st sophia is the chief lion of constantinople  you must get a firman and hurry there the first thing  we did that  we did not get a firman but we took along four or five francs apiece which is much the same thing  i do not think much of the mosque of st sophia  i suppose i lack appreciation  we will let it go at that  it is the rustiest old barn in heathendom  i believe all the interest that attaches to it comes from the fact that it was built for a christian church and then turned into a mosque without much alteration by the mohammedan conquerors of the land  they made me take off my boots and walk into the place in my stockingfeet  i caught cold and got myself so stuck up with a complication of gums slime and general corruption that i wore out more than two thousand pair of bootjacks getting my boots off that night and even then some christian hide peeled off with them  i abate not a single bootjack  st sophia is a colossal church thirteen or fourteen hundred years old and unsightly enough to be very very much older  its immense dome is said to be more wonderful than st peters but its dirt is much more wonderful than its dome though they never mention it  the church has a hundred and seventy pillars in it each a single piece and all of costly marbles of various kinds but they came from ancient temples at baalbec heliopolis athens and ephesus and are battered ugly and repulsive they were a thousand years old when this church was new and then the contrast must have been ghastlyif justinians architects did not trim them any  the inside of the dome is figured all over with a monstrous inscription in turkish characters wrought in gold mosaic that looks as glaring as a circus bill the pavements and the marble balustrades are all battered and dirty the perspective is marred every where by a web of ropes that depend from the dizzy height of the dome and suspend countless dingy coarse oil lamps and ostricheggs six or seven feet above the floor  squatting and sitting in groups here and there and far and near were ragged turks reading books hearing sermons or receiving lessons like children  and in fifty places were more of the same sort bowing and straightening up bowing again and getting down to kiss the earth muttering prayers the while and keeping up their gymnastics till they ought to have been tired if they were not  every where was dirt and dust and dinginess and gloom every where were signs of a hoary antiquity but with nothing touching or beautiful about it every where were those groups of fantastic pagans overhead the gaudy mosaics and the web of lampropesnowhere was there any thing to win ones love or challenge his admiration  the people who go into ecstasies over st sophia must surely get them out of the guidebook where every church is spoken of as being considered by good judges to be the most marvelous structure in many respects that the world has ever seen  or else they are those old connoisseurs from the wilds of new jersey who laboriously learn the difference between a fresco and a fireplug and from that day forward feel privileged to void their critical bathos on painting sculpture and architecture forever more  we visited the dancing dervishes  there were twentyone of them  they wore a long lightcolored loose robe that hung to their heels  each in his turn went up to the priest they were all within a large circular railing and bowed profoundly and then went spinning away deliriously and took his appointed place in the circle and continued to spin  when all had spun themselves to their places they were about five or six feet apartand so situated the entire circle of spinning pagans spun itself three separate times around the room  it took twentyfive minutes to do it  they spun on the left foot and kept themselves going by passing the right rapidly before it and digging it against the waxed floor  some of them made incredible time  most of them spun around forty times in a minute and one artist averaged about sixtyone times a minute and kept it up during the whole twentyfive  his robe filled with air and stood out all around him like a balloon  they made no noise of any kind and most of them tilted their heads back and closed their eyes entranced with a sort of devotional ecstacy there was a rude kind of music part of the time but the musicians were not visible  none but spinners were allowed within the circle  a man had to either spin or stay outside  it was about as barbarous an exhibition as we have witnessed yet  then sick persons came and lay down and beside them women laid their sick children one a babe at the breast and the patriarch of the dervishes walked upon their bodies  he was supposed to cure their diseases by trampling upon their breasts or backs or standing on the back of their necks  this is well enough for a people who think all their affairs are made or marred by viewless spirits of the airby giants gnomes and geniiand who still believe to this day all the wild tales in the arabian nights  even so an intelligent missionary tells me  we visited the thousand and one columns  i do not know what it was originally intended for but they said it was built for a reservoir  it is situated in the centre of constantinople  you go down a flight of stone steps in the middle of a barren place and there you are  you are forty feet under ground and in the midst of a perfect wilderness of tall slender granite columns of byzantine architecture  stand where you would or change your position as often as you pleased you were always a centre from which radiated a dozen long archways and colonnades that lost themselves in distance and the sombre twilight of the place this old driedup reservoir is occupied by a few ghostly silkspinners now and one of them showed me a cross cut high up in one of the pillars i suppose he meant me to understand that the institution was there before the turkish occupation and i thought he made a remark to that effect but he must have had an impediment in his speech for i did not understand him  we took off our shoes and went into the marble mausoleum of the sultan mahmoud the neatest piece of architecture inside that i have seen lately  mahmouds tomb was covered with a black velvet pall which was elaborately embroidered with silver it stood within a fancy silver railing at the sides and corners were silver candlesticks that would weigh more than a hundred pounds and they supported candles as large as a mans leg on the top of the sarcophagus was a fez with a handsome diamond ornament upon it which an attendant said cost a hundred thousand pounds and lied like a turk when he said it  mahmouds whole family were comfortably planted around him  we went to the great bazaar in stamboul of course and i shall not describe it further than to say it is a monstrous hive of little shops thousands i should sayall under one roof and cut up into innumerable little blocks by narrow streets which are arched overhead  one street is devoted to a particular kind of merchandise another to another and so on  when you wish to buy a pair of shoes you have the swing of the whole streetyou do not have to walk yourself down hunting stores in different localities  it is the same with silks antiquities shawls etc  the place is crowded with people all the time and as the gaycolored eastern fabrics are lavishly displayed before every shop the great bazaar of stamboul is one of the sights that are worth seeing  it is full of life and stir and business dirt beggars asses yelling peddlers porters dervishes highborn turkish female shoppers greeks and weirdlooking and weirdly dressed mohammedans from the mountains and the far provinces and the only solitary thing one does not smell when he is in the great bazaar is something which smells good     chapter xxxiv  mosques are plenty churches are plenty graveyards are plenty but morals and whiskey are scarce  the koran does not permit mohammedans to drink  their natural instincts do not permit them to be moral  they say the sultan has eight hundred wives  this almost amounts to bigamy  it makes our cheeks burn with shame to see such a thing permitted here in turkey  we do not mind it so much in salt lake however  circassian and georgian girls are still sold in constantinople by their parents but not publicly  the great slave marts we have all read so much aboutwhere tender young girls were stripped for inspection and criticised and discussed just as if they were horses at an agricultural fairno longer exist  the exhibition and the sales are private now stocks are up just at present partly because of a brisk demand created by the recent return of the sultans suite from the courts of europe partly on account of an unusual abundance of breadstuffs which leaves holders untortured by hunger and enables them to hold back for high prices and partly because buyers are too weak to bear the market while sellers are amply prepared to bull it  under these circumstances if the american metropolitan newspapers were published here in constantinople their next commercial report would read about as follows i suppose                          slave girl market report       best brands circassians crop of 1850 l200 1852 l250 1854      l300  best brands georgian none in market second quality 1851      l180  nineteen fair to middling wallachian girls offered at l130       150 but no takers sixteen prime a 1 sold in small lots to close      outterms private       sales of one lot circassians prime to good 1852 to 1854 at l240       242 buyer 30 one fortyninerdamagedat l23 seller ten no      deposit  several georgians fancy brands 1852 changed hands to      fill orders  the georgians now on hand are mostly last years crop      which was unusually poor  the new crop is a little backward but      will be coming in shortly  as regards its quantity and quality the      accounts are most encouraging  in this connection we can safely      say also that the new crop of circassians is looking extremely      well  his majesty the sultan has already sent in large orders for      his new harem which will be finished within a fortnight and this      has naturally strengthened the market and given circassian stock a      strong upward tendency  taking advantage of the inflated market      many of our shrewdest operators are selling short  there are hints      of a corner on wallachians       there is nothing new in nubians  slow sale       eunuchsnone offering however large cargoes are expected from      egypt today   i think the above would be about the style of the commercial report prices are pretty high now and holders firm but two or three years ago parents in a starving condition brought their young daughters down here and sold them for even twenty and thirty dollars when they could do no better simply to save themselves and the girls from dying of want it is sad to think of so distressing a thing as this and i for one am sincerely glad the prices are up again  commercial morals especially are bad  there is no gainsaying that greek turkish and armenian morals consist only in attending church regularly on the appointed sabbaths and in breaking the ten commandments all the balance of the week  it comes natural to them to lie and cheat in the first place and then they go on and improve on nature until they arrive at perfection  in recommending his son to a merchant as a valuable salesman a father does not say he is a nice moral upright boy and goes to sunday school and is honest but he says this boy is worth his weight in broad pieces of a hundredfor behold he will cheat whomsoever hath dealings with him and from the euxine to the waters of marmora there abideth not so gifted a liar  how is that for a recommendation  the missionaries tell me that they hear encomiums like that passed upon people every day  they say of a person they admire ah he is a charming swindler and a most exquisite liar  every body lies and cheatsevery body who is in business at any rate even foreigners soon have to come down to the custom of the country and they do not buy and sell long in constantinople till they lie and cheat like a greek  i say like a greek because the greeks are called the worst transgressors in this line  several americans long resident in constantinople contend that most turks are pretty trustworthy but few claim that the greeks have any virtues that a man can discoverat least without a fire assay  i am half willing to believe that the celebrated dogs of constantinople have been misrepresentedslandered  i have always been led to suppose that they were so thick in the streets that they blocked the way that they moved about in organized companies platoons and regiments and took what they wanted by determined and ferocious assault and that at night they drowned all other sounds with their terrible howlings  the dogs i see here can not be those i have read of  i find them every where but not in strong force  the most i have found together has been about ten or twenty  and night or day a fair proportion of them were sound asleep  those that were not asleep always looked as if they wanted to be  i never saw such utterly wretched starving sadvisaged brokenhearted looking curs in my life  it seemed a grim satire to accuse such brutes as these of taking things by force of arms  they hardly seemed to have strength enough or ambition enough to walk across the streeti do not know that i have seen one walk that far yet  they are mangy and bruised and mutilated and often you see one with the hair singed off him in such wide and well defined tracts that he looks like a map of the new territories  they are the sorriest beasts that breathethe most abjectthe most pitiful  in their faces is a settled expression of melancholy an air of hopeless despondency  the hairless patches on a scalded dog are preferred by the fleas of constantinople to a wider range on a healthier dog and the exposed places suit the fleas exactly  i saw a dog of this kind start to nibble at a fleaa fly attracted his attention and he made a snatch at him the flea called for him once more and that forever unsettled him he looked sadly at his fleapasture then sadly looked at his bald spot then he heaved a sigh and dropped his head resignedly upon his paws  he was not equal to the situation  the dogs sleep in the streets all over the city  from one end of the street to the other i suppose they will average about eight or ten to a block  sometimes of course there are fifteen or twenty to a block they do not belong to any body and they seem to have no close personal friendships among each other  but they district the city themselves and the dogs of each district whether it be half a block in extent or ten blocks have to remain within its bounds  woe to a dog if he crosses the line  his neighbors would snatch the balance of his hair off in a second  so it is said  but they dont look it  they sleep in the streets these days  they are my compassmy guide when i see the dogs sleep placidly on while men sheep geese and all moving things turn out and go around them i know i am not in the great street where the hotel is and must go further  in the grand rue the dogs have a sort of air of being on the lookoutan air born of being obliged to get out of the way of many carriages every dayand that expression one recognizes in a moment  it does not exist upon the face of any dog without the confines of that street  all others sleep placidly and keep no watch  they would not move though the sultan himself passed by  in one narrow street but none of them are wide i saw three dogs lying coiled up about a foot or two apart  end to end they lay and so they just bridged the street neatly from gutter to gutter  a drove of a hundred sheep came along  they stepped right over the dogs the rear crowding the front impatient to get on  the dogs looked lazily up flinched a little when the impatient feet of the sheep touched their raw backssighed and lay peacefully down again  no talk could be plainer than that  so some of the sheep jumped over them and others scrambled between occasionally chipping a leg with their sharp hoofs and when the whole flock had made the trip the dogs sneezed a little in the cloud of dust but never budged their bodies an inch  i thought i was lazy but i am a steamengine compared to a constantinople dog  but was not that a singular scene for a city of a million inhabitants  these dogs are the scavengers of the city  that is their official position and a hard one it is  however it is their protection  but for their usefulness in partially cleansing these terrible streets they would not be tolerated long  they eat any thing and every thing that comes in their way from melon rinds and spoiled grapes up through all the grades and species of dirt and refuse to their own dead friends and relativesand yet they are always lean always hungry always despondent  the people are loath to kill themdo not kill them in fact  the turks have an innate antipathy to taking the life of any dumb animal it is said  but they do worse  they hang and kick and stone and scald these wretched creatures to the very verge of death and then leave them to live and suffer  once a sultan proposed to kill off all the dogs here and did begin the workbut the populace raised such a howl of horror about it that the massacre was stayed  after a while he proposed to remove them all to an island in the sea of marmora  no objection was offered and a shipload or so was taken away  but when it came to be known that somehow or other the dogs never got to the island but always fell overboard in the night and perished another howl was raised and the transportation scheme was dropped  so the dogs remain in peaceable possession of the streets  i do not say that they do not howl at night nor that they do not attack people who have not a red fez on their heads  i only say that it would be mean for me to accuse them of these unseemly things who have not seen them do them with my own eyes or heard them with my own ears  i was a little surprised to see turks and greeks playing newsboy right here in the mysterious land where the giants and genii of the arabian nights once dweltwhere winged horses and hydraheaded dragons guarded enchanted castleswhere princes and princesses flew through the air on carpets that obeyed a mystic talismanwhere cities whose houses were made of precious stones sprang up in a night under the hand of the magician and where busy marts were suddenly stricken with a spell and each citizen lay or sat or stood with weapon raised or foot advanced just as he was speechless and motionless till time had told a hundred years  it was curious to see newsboys selling papers in so dreamy a land as that  and to say truly it is comparatively a new thing here  the selling of newspapers had its birth in constantinople about a year ago and was a child of the prussian and austrian war  there is one paper published here in the english languagethe levant heraldand there are generally a number of greek and a few french papers rising and falling struggling up and falling again  newspapers are not popular with the sultans government  they do not understand journalism the proverb says the unknown is always great  to the court the newspaper is a mysterious and rascally institution  they know what a pestilence is because they have one occasionally that thins the people out at the rate of two thousand a day and they regard a newspaper as a mild form of pestilence  when it goes astray they suppress itpounce upon it without warning and throttle it  when it dont go astray for a long time they get suspicious and throttle it anyhow because they think it is hatching deviltry  imagine the grand vizier in solemn council with the magnates of the realm spelling his way through the hated newspaper and finally delivering his profound decision this thing means mischief it is too darkly too suspiciously inoffensivesuppress it  warn the publisher that we can not have this sort of thing put the editor in prison  the newspaper business has its inconveniences in constantinople  two greek papers and one french one were suppressed here within a few days of each other  no victories of the cretans are allowed to be printed  from time to time the grand vizier sends a notice to the various editors that the cretan insurrection is entirely suppressed and although that editor knows better he still has to print the notice  the levant herald is too fond of speaking praisefully of americans to be popular with the sultan who does not relish our sympathy with the cretans and therefore that paper has to be particularly circumspect in order to keep out of trouble once the editor forgetting the official notice in his paper that the cretans were crushed out printed a letter of a very different tenor from the american consul in crete and was fined two hundred and fifty dollars for it  shortly he printed another from the same source and was imprisoned three months for his pains  i think i could get the assistant editorship of the levant herald but i am going to try to worry along without it  to suppress a paper here involves the ruin of the publisher almost  but in naples i think they speculate on misfortunes of that kind  papers are suppressed there every day and spring up the next day under a new name during the ten days or a fortnight we staid there one paper was murdered and resurrected twice  the newsboys are smart there just as they are elsewhere  they take advantage of popular weaknesses  when they find they are not likely to sell out they approach a citizen mysteriously and say in a low voicelast copy sir double price paper just been suppressed  the man buys it of course and finds nothing in it  they do sayi do not vouch for itbut they do say that men sometimes print a vast edition of a paper with a ferociously seditious article in it distribute it quickly among the newsboys and clear out till the governments indignation cools  it pays well  confiscation dont amount to any thing  the type and presses are not worth taking care of  there is only one english newspaper in naples  it has seventy subscribers  the publisher is getting rich very deliberatelyvery deliberately indeed  i never shall want another turkish lunch  the cooking apparatus was in the little lunch room near the bazaar and it was all open to the street  the cook was slovenly and so was the table and it had no cloth on it  the fellow took a mass of sausage meat and coated it round a wire and laid it on a charcoal fire to cook  when it was done he laid it aside and a dog walked sadly in and nipped it  he smelt it first and probably recognized the remains of a friend  the cook took it away from him and laid it before us  jack said i passhe plays euchre sometimesand we all passed in turn  then the cook baked a broad flat wheaten cake greased it well with the sausage and started towards us with it  it dropped in the dirt and he picked it up and polished it on his breeches and laid it before us  jack said i pass  we all passed  he put some eggs in a frying pan and stood pensively prying slabs of meat from between his teeth with a fork  then he used the fork to turn the eggs withand brought them along  jack said pass again all followed suit  we did not know what to do and so we ordered a new ration of sausage  the cook got out his wire apportioned a proper amount of sausagemeat spat it on his hands and fell to work  this time with one accord we all passed out  we paid and left  that is all i learned about turkish lunches  a turkish lunch is good no doubt but it has its little drawbacks  when i think how i have been swindled by books of oriental travel i want a tourist for breakfast  for years and years i have dreamed of the wonders of the turkish bath for years and years i have promised myself that i would yet enjoy one  many and many a time in fancy i have lain in the marble bath and breathed the slumbrous fragrance of eastern spices that filled the air then passed through a weird and complicated system of pulling and hauling and drenching and scrubbing by a gang of naked savages who loomed vast and vaguely through the steaming mists like demons then rested for a while on a divan fit for a king then passed through another complex ordeal and one more fearful than the first and finally swathed in soft fabrics been conveyed to a princely saloon and laid on a bed of eider down where eunuchs gorgeous of costume fanned me while i drowsed and dreamed or contentedly gazed at the rich hangings of the apartment the soft carpets the sumptuous furniture the pictures and drank delicious coffee smoked the soothing narghili and dropped at the last into tranquil repose lulled by sensuous odors from unseen censers by the gentle influence of the narghilis persian tobacco and by the music of fountains that counterfeited the pattering of summer rain  that was the picture just as i got it from incendiary books of travel it was a poor miserable imposture  the reality is no more like it than the five points are like the garden of eden  they received me in a great court paved with marble slabs around it were broad galleries one above another carpeted with seedy matting railed with unpainted balustrades and furnished with huge rickety chairs cushioned with rusty old mattresses indented with impressions left by the forms of nine successive generations of men who had reposed upon them  the place was vast naked dreary its court a barn its galleries stalls for human horses  the cadaverous half nude varlets that served in the establishment had nothing of poetry in their appearance nothing of romance nothing of oriental splendor  they shed no entrancing odors just the contrary  their hungry eyes and their lank forms continually suggested one glaring unsentimental factthey wanted what they term in california a square meal  i went into one of the racks and undressed  an unclean starveling wrapped a gaudy tablecloth about his loins and hung a white rag over my shoulders  if i had had a tub then it would have come natural to me to take in washing  i was then conducted down stairs into the wet slippery court and the first things that attracted my attention were my heels my fall excited no comment  they expected it no doubt  it belonged in the list of softening sensuous influences peculiar to this home of eastern luxury  it was softening enough certainly but its application was not happy  they now gave me a pair of wooden clogsbenches in miniature with leather straps over them to confine my feet which they would have done only i do not wear no 13s these things dangled uncomfortably by the straps when i lifted up my feet and came down in awkward and unexpected places when i put them on the floor again and sometimes turned sideways and wrenched my ankles out of joint  however it was all oriental luxury and i did what i could to enjoy it  they put me in another part of the barn and laid me on a stuffy sort of pallet which was not made of cloth of gold or persian shawls but was merely the unpretending sort of thing i have seen in the negro quarters of arkansas  there was nothing whatever in this dim marble prison but five more of these biers  it was a very solemn place  i expected that the spiced odors of araby were going to steal over my senses now but they did not  a coppercolored skeleton with a rag around him brought me a glass decanter of water with a lighted tobacco pipe in the top of it and a pliant stem a yard long with a brass mouthpiece to it  it was the famous narghili of the eastthe thing the grand turk smokes in the pictures  this began to look like luxury  i took one blast at it and it was sufficient the smoke went in a great volume down into my stomach my lungs even into the uttermost parts of my frame  i exploded one mighty cough and it was as if vesuvius had let go  for the next five minutes i smoked at every pore like a frame house that is on fire on the inside  not any more narghili for me  the smoke had a vile taste and the taste of a thousand infidel tongues that remained on that brass mouthpiece was viler still  i was getting discouraged  whenever hereafter i see the crosslegged grand turk smoking his narghili in pretended bliss on the outside of a paper of connecticut tobacco i shall know him for the shameless humbug he is  this prison was filled with hot air  when i had got warmed up sufficiently to prepare me for a still warmer temperature they took me where it wasinto a marble room wet slippery and steamy and laid me out on a raised platform in the centre  it was very warm  presently my man sat me down by a tank of hot water drenched me well gloved his hand with a coarse mitten and began to polish me all over with it  i began to smell disagreeably  the more he polished the worse i smelt  it was alarming  i said to him  i perceive that i am pretty far gone  it is plain that i ought to be buried without any unnecessary delay  perhaps you had better go after my friends at once because the weather is warm and i can not keep long  he went on scrubbing and paid no attention  i soon saw that he was reducing my size  he bore hard on his mitten and from under it rolled little cylinders like maccaroni  it could not be dirt for it was too white  he pared me down in this way for a long time  finally i said  it is a tedious process  it will take hours to trim me to the size you want me i will wait go and borrow a jackplane  he paid no attention at all  after a while he brought a basin some soap and something that seemed to be the tail of a horse  he made up a prodigious quantity of soapsuds deluged me with them from head to foot without warning me to shut my eyes and then swabbed me viciously with the horsetail  then he left me there a snowy statue of lather and went away  when i got tired of waiting i went and hunted him up  he was propped against the wall in another room asleep  i woke him  he was not disconcerted  he took me back and flooded me with hot water then turbaned my head swathed me with dry tablecloths and conducted me to a latticed chickencoop in one of the galleries and pointed to one of those arkansas beds  i mounted it and vaguely expected the odors of araby a gain  they did not come  the blank unornamented coop had nothing about it of that oriental voluptuousness one reads of so much  it was more suggestive of the county hospital than any thing else  the skinny servitor brought a narghili and i got him to take it out again without wasting any time about it  then he brought the worldrenowned turkish coffee that poets have sung so rapturously for many generations and i seized upon it as the last hope that was left of my old dreams of eastern luxury  it was another fraud  of all the unchristian beverages that ever passed my lips turkish coffee is the worst  the cup is small it is smeared with grounds the coffee is black thick unsavory of smell and execrable in taste  the bottom of the cup has a muddy sediment in it half an inch deep  this goes down your throat and portions of it lodge by the way and produce a tickling aggravation that keeps you barking and coughing for an hour  here endeth my experience of the celebrated turkish bath and here also endeth my dream of the bliss the mortal revels in who passes through it it is a malignant swindle  the man who enjoys it is qualified to enjoy any thing that is repulsive to sight or sense and he that can invest it with a charm of poetry is able to do the same with any thing else in the world that is tedious and wretched and dismal and nasty     chapter xxxv  we left a dozen passengers in constantinople and sailed through the beautiful bosporus and far up into the black sea  we left them in the clutches of the celebrated turkish guide faraway moses who will seduce them into buying a shipload of ottar of roses splendid turkish vestments and all manner of curious things they can never have any use for  murrays invaluable guidebooks have mentioned faraway moses name and he is a made man  he rejoices daily in the fact that he is a recognized celebrity  however we can not alter our established customs to please the whims of guides we can not show partialities this late in the day  therefore ignoring this fellows brilliant fame and ignoring the fanciful name he takes such pride in we called him ferguson just as we had done with all other guides  it has kept him in a state of smothered exasperation all the time  yet we meant him no harm  after he has gotten himself up regardless of expense in showy baggy trowsers yellow pointed slippers fiery fez silken jacket of blue voluminous waistsash of fancy persian stuff filled with a battery of silvermounted horsepistols and has strapped on his terrible scimitar he considers it an unspeakable humiliation to be called ferguson  it can not be helped all guides are fergusons to us  we can not master their dreadful foreign names  sebastopol is probably the worst battered town in russia or any where else  but we ought to be pleased with it nevertheless for we have been in no country yet where we have been so kindly received and where we felt that to be americans was a sufficient visa for our passports  the moment the anchor was down the governor of the town immediately dispatched an officer on board to inquire if he could be of any assistance to us and to invite us to make ourselves at home in sebastopol  if you know russia you know that this was a wild stretch of hospitality  they are usually so suspicious of strangers that they worry them excessively with the delays and aggravations incident to a complicated passport system  had we come from any other country we could not have had permission to enter sebastopol and leave again under three daysbut as it was we were at liberty to go and come when and where we pleased  every body in constantinople warned us to be very careful about our passports see that they were strictly en regle and never to mislay them for a moment and they told us of numerous instances of englishmen and others who were delayed days weeks and even months in sebastopol on account of trifling informalities in their passports and for which they were not to blame  i had lost my passport and was traveling under my roommates who stayed behind in constantinople to await our return  to read the description of him in that passport and then look at me any man could see that i was no more like him than i am like hercules  so i went into the harbor of sebastopol with fear and tremblingfull of a vague horrible apprehension that i was going to be found out and hanged  but all that time my true passport had been floating gallantly overheadand behold it was only our flag  they never asked us for any other  we have had a great many russian and english gentlemen and ladies on board today and the time has passed cheerfully away  they were all happyspirited people and i never heard our mother tongue sound so pleasantly as it did when it fell from those english lips in this faroff land  i talked to the russians a good deal just to be friendly and they talked to me from the same motive i am sure that both enjoyed the conversation but never a word of it either of us understood  i did most of my talking to those english people though and i am sorry we can not carry some of them along with us  we have gone whithersoever we chose today and have met with nothing but the kindest attentions  nobody inquired whether we had any passports or not  several of the officers of the government have suggested that we take the ship to a little wateringplace thirty miles from here and pay the emperor of russia a visit  he is rusticating there  these officers said they would take it upon themselves to insure us a cordial reception they said if we would go they would not only telegraph the emperor but send a special courier overland to announce our coming  our time is so short though and more especially our coal is so nearly out that we judged it best to forego the rare pleasure of holding social intercourse with an emperor  ruined pompeii is in good condition compared to sebastopol  here you may look in whatsoever direction you please and your eye encounters scarcely any thing but ruin ruin ruinfragments of houses crumbled walls torn and ragged hills devastation every where  it is as if a mighty earthquake had spent all its terrible forces upon this one little spot  for eighteen long months the storms of war beat upon the helpless town and left it at last the saddest wreck that ever the sun has looked upon  not one solitary house escaped unscathednot one remained habitable even  such utter and complete ruin one could hardly conceive of  the houses had all been solid dressed stone structures most of them were ploughed through and through by cannon ballsunroofed and sliced down from eaves to foundationand now a row of them half a mile long looks merely like an endless procession of battered chimneys  no semblance of a house remains in such as these  some of the larger buildings had corners knocked off pillars cut in two cornices smashed holes driven straight through the walls  many of these holes are as round and as cleanly cut as if they had been made with an auger  others are half pierced through and the clean impression is there in the rock as smooth and as shapely as if it were done in putty  here and there a ball still sticks in a wall and from it iron tears trickle down and discolor the stone  the battlefields were pretty close together  the malakoff tower is on a hill which is right in the edge of the town  the redan was within rifleshot of the malakoff inkerman was a mile away and balaklava removed but an hours ride  the french trenches by which they approached and invested the malakoff were carried so close under its sloping sides that one might have stood by the russian guns and tossed a stone into them repeatedly during three terrible days they swarmed up the little malakoff hill and were beaten back with terrible slaughter finally they captured the place and drove the russians out who then tried to retreat into the town but the english had taken the redan and shut them off with a wall of flame there was nothing for them to do but go back and retake the malakoff or die under its guns  they did go back they took the malakoff and retook it two or three times but their desperate valor could not avail and they had to give up at last  these fearful fields where such tempests of death used to rage are peaceful enough now no sound is heard hardly a living thing moves about them they are lonely and silenttheir desolation is complete  there was nothing else to do and so every body went to hunting relics they have stocked the ship with them  they brought them from the malakoff from the redan inkerman balaklavaevery where  they have brought cannon balls broken ramrods fragments of shelliron enough to freight a sloop  some have even brought bonesbrought them laboriously from great distances and were grieved to hear the surgeon pronounce them only bones of mules and oxen  i knew blucher would not lose an opportunity like this  he brought a sack full on board and was going for another  i prevailed upon him not to go  he has already turned his stateroom into a museum of worthless trumpery which he has gathered up in his travels  he is labeling his trophies now  i picked up one a while ago and found it marked fragment of a russian general  i carried it out to get a better light upon itit was nothing but a couple of teeth and part of the jawbone of a horse  i said with some asperity  fragment of a russian general  this is absurd  are you never going to learn any sense  he only said go slowthe old woman wont know any different  his aunt  this person gathers mementoes with a perfect recklessness nowadays mixes them all up together and then serenely labels them without any regard to truth propriety or even plausibility  i have found him breaking a stone in two and labeling half of it chunk busted from the pulpit of demosthenes and the other half darnick from the tomb of abelard and heloise  i have known him to gather up a handful of pebbles by the roadside and bring them on board ship and label them as coming from twenty celebrated localities five hundred miles apart  i remonstrate against these outrages upon reason and truth of course but it does no good  i get the same tranquil unanswerable reply every time  it dont signifythe old woman wont know any different  ever since we three or four fortunate ones made the midnight trip to athens it has afforded him genuine satisfaction to give every body in the ship a pebble from the marshill where st paul preached  he got all those pebbles on the sea shore abreast the ship but professes to have gathered them from one of our party  however it is not of any use for me to expose the deceptionit affords him pleasure and does no harm to any body  he says he never expects to run out of mementoes of st paul as long as he is in reach of a sandbank  well he is no worse than others  i notice that all travelers supply deficiencies in their collections in the same way  i shall never have any confidence in such things again while i live     chapter xxxvi  we have got so far east nowa hundred and fiftyfive degrees of longitude from san franciscothat my watch can not keep the hang of the time any more  it has grown discouraged and stopped  i think it did a wise thing  the difference in time between sebastopol and the pacific coast is enormous  when it is six oclock in the morning here it is somewhere about week before last in california  we are excusable for getting a little tangled as to time  these distractions and distresses about the time have worried me so much that i was afraid my mind was so much affected that i never would have any appreciation of time again but when i noticed how handy i was yet about comprehending when it was dinnertime a blessed tranquillity settled down upon me and i am tortured with doubts and fears no more  odessa is about twenty hours run from sebastopol and is the most northerly port in the black sea  we came here to get coal principally the city has a population of one hundred and thirtythree thousand and is growing faster than any other small city out of america  it is a free port and is the great grain mart of this particular part of the world its roadstead is full of ships  engineers are at work now turning the open roadstead into a spacious artificial harbor  it is to be almost inclosed by massive stone piers one of which will extend into the sea over three thousand feet in a straight line  i have not felt so much at home for a long time as i did when i raised the hill and stood in odessa for the first time  it looked just like an american city fine broad streets and straight as well low houses two or three stories wide neat and free from any quaintness of architectural ornamentation locust trees bordering the sidewalks they call them acacias a stirring businesslook about the streets and the stores fast walkers a familiar new look about the houses and every thing yea and a driving and smothering cloud of dust that was so like a message from our own dear native land that we could hardly refrain from shedding a few grateful tears and execrations in the old timehonored american way  look up the street or down the street this way or that way we saw only america  there was not one thing to remind us that we were in russia  we walked for some little distance reveling in this home vision and then we came upon a church and a hackdriver and presto the illusion vanished  the church had a slenderspired dome that rounded inward at its base and looked like a turnip turned upside down and the hackman seemed to be dressed in a long petticoat with out any hoops  these things were essentially foreign and so were the carriages but every body knows about these things and there is no occasion for my describing them  we were only to stay here a day and a night and take in coal we consulted the guidebooks and were rejoiced to know that there were no sights in odessa to see and so we had one good untrammeled holyday on our hands with nothing to do but idle about the city and enjoy ourselves  we sauntered through the markets and criticised the fearful and wonderful costumes from the back country examined the populace as far as eyes could do it and closed the entertainment with an icecream debauch  we do not get icecream every where and so when we do we are apt to dissipate to excess  we never cared any thing about icecream at home but we look upon it with a sort of idolatry now that it is so scarce in these redhot climates of the east  we only found two pieces of statuary and this was another blessing  one was a bronze image of the duc de richelieu grandnephew of the splendid cardinal  it stood in a spacious handsome promenade overlooking the sea and from its base a vast flight of stone steps led down to the harbortwo hundred of them fifty feet long and a wide landing at the bottom of every twenty  it is a noble staircase and from a distance the people toiling up it looked like insects  i mention this statue and this stairway because they have their story  richelieu founded odessa watched over it with paternal carelabored with a fertile brain and a wise understanding for its best interestsspent his fortune freely to the same endendowed it with a sound prosperity and one which will yet make it one of the great cities of the old worldbuilt this noble stairway with money from his own private purseand  well the people for whom he had done so much let him walk down these same steps one day unattended old poor without a second coat to his back and when years afterwards he died in sebastopol in poverty and neglect they called a meeting subscribed liberally and immediately erected this tasteful monument to his memory and named a great street after him it reminds me of what robert burns mother said when they erected a stately monument to his memory ah robbie ye asked them for bread and they hae gien ye a stane  the people of odessa have warmly recommended us to go and call on the emperor as did the sebastopolians  they have telegraphed his majesty and he has signified his willingness to grant us an audience  so we are getting up the anchors and preparing to sail to his wateringplace  what a scratching around there will be now what a holding of important meetings and appointing of solemn committeesand what a furbishing up of clawhammer coats and white silk neckties  as this fearful ordeal we are about to pass through pictures itself to my fancy in all its dread sublimity i begin to feel my fierce desire to converse with a genuine emperor cooling down and passing away  what am i to do with my hands what am i to do with my feet  what in the world am i to do with myself     chapter xxxvii  we anchored here at yalta russia two or three days ago  to me the place was a vision of the sierras  the tall gray mountains that back it their sides bristling with pinescloven with ravineshere and there a hoary rock towering into viewlong straight streaks sweeping down from the summit to the sea marking the passage of some avalanche of former timesall these were as like what one sees in the sierras as if the one were a portrait of the other  the little village of yalta nestles at the foot of an amphitheatre which slopes backward and upward to the wall of hills and looks as if it might have sunk quietly down to its present position from a higher elevation  this depression is covered with the great parks and gardens of noblemen and through the mass of green foliage the bright colors of their palaces bud out here and there like flowers  it is a beautiful spot  we had the united states consul on boardthe odessa consul  we assembled in the cabin and commanded him to tell us what we must do to be saved and tell us quickly  he made a speech  the first thing he said fell like a blight on every hopeful spirit he had never seen a court reception  three groans for the consul  but he said he had seen receptions at the governor generals in odessa and had often listened to peoples experiences of receptions at the russian and other courts and believed he knew very well what sort of ordeal we were about to essay hope budded again  he said we were many the summer palace was small a mere mansion doubtless we should be received in summer fashionin the garden we would stand in a row all the gentlemen in swallowtail coats white kids and white neckties and the ladies in lightcolored silks or something of that kind at the proper moment12 meridianthe emperor attended by his suite arrayed in splendid uniforms would appear and walk slowly along the line bowing to some and saying two or three words to others  at the moment his majesty appeared a universal delighted enthusiastic smile ought to break out like a rash among the passengersa smile of love of gratification of admirationand with one accord the party must begin to bownot obsequiously but respectfully and with dignity at the end of fifteen minutes the emperor would go in the house and we could run along home again  we felt immensely relieved  it seemed in a manner easy  there was not a man in the party but believed that with a little practice he could stand in a row especially if there were others along there was not a man but believed he could bow without tripping on his coat tail and breaking his neck in a word we came to believe we were equal to any item in the performance except that complicated smile  the consul also said we ought to draft a little address to the emperor and present it to one of his aidesdecamp who would forward it to him at the proper time therefore five gentlemen were appointed to prepare the document and the fifty others went sadly smiling about the shippracticing  during the next twelve hours we had the general appearance somehow of being at a funeral where every body was sorry the death had occurred but glad it was overwhere every body was smiling and yet brokenhearted  a committee went ashore to wait on his excellency the governorgeneral and learn our fate  at the end of three hours of boding suspense they came back and said the emperor would receive us at noon the next day would send carriages for uswould hear the address in person  the grand duke michael had sent to invite us to his palace also  any man could see that there was an intention here to show that russias friendship for america was so genuine as to render even her private citizens objects worthy of kindly attentions  at the appointed hour we drove out three miles and assembled in the handsome garden in front of the emperors palace  we formed a circle under the trees before the door for there was no one room in the house able to accommodate our threescore persons comfortably and in a few minutes the imperial family came out bowing and smiling and stood in our midst  a number of great dignitaries of the empire in undress unit forms came with them  with every bow his majesty said a word of welcome  i copy these speeches  there is character in themrussian characterwhich is politeness itself and the genuine article  the french are polite but it is often mere ceremonious politeness  a russian imbues his polite things with a heartiness both of phrase and expression that compels belief in their sincerity  as i was saying the czar punctuated his speeches with bows  good morningi am glad to see youi am gratifiedi am delightedi am happy to receive you  all took off their hats and the consul inflicted the address on him  he bore it with unflinching fortitude then took the rustylooking document and handed it to some great officer or other to be filed away among the archives of russiain the stove  he thanked us for the address and said he was very much pleased to see us especially as such friendly relations existed between russia and the united states  the empress said the americans were favorites in russia and she hoped the russians were similarly regarded in america  these were all the speeches that were made and i recommend them to parties who present policemen with gold watches as models of brevity and point  after this the empress went and talked sociably for an empress with various ladies around the circle several gentlemen entered into a disjointed general conversation with the emperor the dukes and princes admirals and maids of honor dropped into freeandeasy chat with first one and then another of our party and whoever chose stepped forward and spoke with the modest little grand duchess marie the czars daughter  she is fourteen years old lighthaired blueeyed unassuming and pretty  every body talks english  the emperor wore a cap frock coat and pantaloons all of some kind of plain white drillingcotton or linen and sported no jewelry or any insignia whatever of rank  no costume could be less ostentatious  he is very tall and spare and a determinedlooking man though a very pleasantlooking one nevertheless  it is easy to see that he is kind and affectionate there is something very noble in his expression when his cap is off  there is none of that cunning in his eye that all of us noticed in louis napoleons  the empress and the little grand duchess wore simple suits of foulard or foulard silk i dont know which is proper with a small blue spot in it the dresses were trimmed with blue both ladies wore broad blue sashes about their waists linen collars and clerical ties of muslin lowcrowned strawhats trimmed with blue velvet parasols and fleshcolored gloves  the grand duchess had no heels on her shoes  i do not know this of my own knowledge but one of our ladies told me so i was not looking at her shoes  i was glad to observe that she wore her own hair plaited in thick braids against the back of her head instead of the uncomely thing they call a waterfall which is about as much like a waterfall as a canvascovered ham is like a cataract  taking the kind expression that is in the emperors face and the gentleness that is in his young daughters into consideration i wondered if it would not tax the czars firmness to the utmost to condemn a supplicating wretch to misery in the wastes of siberia if she pleaded for him  every time their eyes met i saw more and more what a tremendous power that weak diffident schoolgirl could wield if she chose to do it  many and many a time she might rule the autocrat of russia whose lightest word is law to seventy millions of human beings  she was only a girl and she looked like a thousand others i have seen but never a girl provoked such a novel and peculiar interest in me before  a strange new sensation is a rare thing in this humdrum life and i had it here there was nothing stale or worn out about the thoughts and feelings the situation and the circumstances created  it seemed strangestranger than i can tellto think that the central figure in the cluster of men and women chatting here under the trees like the most ordinary individual in the land was a man who could open his lips and ships would fly through the waves locomotives would speed over the plains couriers would hurry from village to village a hundred telegraphs would flash the word to the four corners of an empire that stretches its vast proportions over a seventh part of the habitable globe and a countless multitude of men would spring to do his bidding  i had a sort of vague desire to examine his hands and see if they were of flesh and blood like other mens  here was a man who could do this wonderful thing and yet if i chose i could knock him down  the case was plain but it seemed preposterous neverthelessas preposterous as trying to knock down a mountain or wipe out a continent  if this man sprained his ankle a million miles of telegraph would carry the news over mountains valleysuninhabited desertsunder the trackless seaand ten thousand newspapers would prate of it if he were grievously ill all the nations would know it before the sun rose again if he dropped lifeless where he stood his fall might shake the thrones of half a world  if i could have stolen his coat i would have done it  when i meet a man like that i want something to remember him by  as a general thing we have been shown through palaces by some plushlegged filagreed flunkey or other who charged a franc for it but after talking with the company half an hour the emperor of russia and his family conducted us all through their mansion themselves  they made no charge  they seemed to take a real pleasure in it  we spent half an hour idling through the palace admiring the cosy apartments and the rich but eminently homelike appointments of the place and then the imperial family bade our party a kind goodbye and proceeded to count the spoons  an invitation was extended to us to visit the palace of the eldest son the crown prince of russia which was near at hand  the young man was absent but the dukes and countesses and princes went over the premises with us as leisurely as was the case at the emperors and conversation continued as lively as ever  it was a little after one oclock now  we drove to the grand duke michaels a mile away in response to his invitation previously given  we arrived in twenty minutes from the emperors  it is a lovely place the beautiful palace nestles among the grand old groves of the park the park sits in the lap of the picturesque crags and hills and both look out upon the breezy ocean  in the park are rustic seats here and there in secluded nooks that are dark with shade there are rivulets of crystal water there are lakelets with inviting grassy banks there are glimpses of sparkling cascades through openings in the wilderness of foliage there are streams of clear water gushing from mimic knots on the trunks of forest trees there are miniature marble temples perched upon gray old crags there are airy lookouts whence one may gaze upon a broad expanse of landscape and ocean  the palace is modeled after the choicest forms of grecian architecture and its wide colonnades surround a central court that is banked with rare flowers that fill the place with their fragrance and in their midst springs a fountain that cools the summer air and may possibly breed mosquitoes but i do not think it does  the grand duke and his duchess came out and the presentation ceremonies were as simple as they had been at the emperors  in a few minutes conversation was under way as before  the empress appeared in the verandah and the little grand duchess came out into the crowd  they had beaten us there  in a few minutes the emperor came himself on horseback  it was very pleasant  you can appreciate it if you have ever visited royalty and felt occasionally that possibly you might be wearing out your welcomethough as a general thing i believe royalty is not scrupulous about discharging you when it is done with you  the grand duke is the third brother of the emperor is about thirtyseven years old perhaps and is the princeliest figure in russia  he is even taller than the czar as straight as an indian and bears himself like one of those gorgeous knights we read about in romances of the crusades he looks like a greathearted fellow who would pitch an enemy into the river in a moment and then jump in and risk his life fishing him out again  the stories they tell of him show him to be of a brave and generous nature  he must have been desirous of proving that americans were welcome guests in the imperial palaces of russia because he rode all the way to yalta and escorted our procession to the emperors himself and kept his aids scurrying about clearing the road and offering assistance wherever it could be needed  we were rather familiar with him then because we did not know who he was  we recognized him now and appreciated the friendly spirit that prompted him to do us a favor that any other grand duke in the world would have doubtless declined to do  he had plenty of servitors whom he could have sent but he chose to attend to the matter himself  the grand duke was dressed in the handsome and showy uniform of a cossack officer  the grand duchess had on a white alpaca robe with the seams and gores trimmed with black barb lace and a little gray hat with a feather of the same color  she is young rather pretty modest and unpretending and full of winning politeness  our party walked all through the house and then the nobility escorted them all over the grounds and finally brought them back to the palace about halfpast two oclock to breakfast  they called it breakfast but we would have called it luncheon  it consisted of two kinds of wine tea bread cheese and cold meats and was served on the centretables in the reception room and the verandahsanywhere that was convenient there was no ceremony  it was a sort of picnic  i had heard before that we were to breakfast there but blucher said he believed bakers boy had suggested it to his imperial highness  i think notthough it would be like him  bakers boy is the faminebreeder of the ship  he is always hungry  they say he goes about the staterooms when the passengers are out and eats up all the soap  and they say he eats oakum  they say he will eat any thing he can get between meals but he prefers oakum  he does not like oakum for dinner but he likes it for a lunch at odd hours or any thing that way  it makes him very disagreeable because it makes his breath bad and keeps his teeth all stuck up with tar  bakers boy may have suggested the breakfast but i hope he did not  it went off well anyhow  the illustrious host moved about from place to place and helped to destroy the provisions and keep the conversation lively and the grand duchess talked with the verandah parties and such as had satisfied their appetites and straggled out from the reception room  the grand dukes tea was delicious  they give one a lemon to squeeze into it or iced milk if he prefers it  the former is best  this tea is brought overland from china  it injures the article to transport it by sea  when it was time to go we bade our distinguished hosts goodbye and they retired happy and contented to their apartments to count their spoons  we had spent the best part of half a day in the home of royalty and had been as cheerful and comfortable all the time as we could have been in the ship  i would as soon have thought of being cheerful in abrahams bosom as in the palace of an emperor  i supposed that emperors were terrible people  i thought they never did any thing but wear magnificent crowns and red velvet dressinggowns with dabs of wool sewed on them in spots and sit on thrones and scowl at the flunkies and the people in the parquette and order dukes and duchesses off to execution  i find however that when one is so fortunate as to get behind the scenes and see them at home and in the privacy of their firesides they are strangely like common mortals  they are pleasanter to look upon then than they are in their theatrical aspect  it seems to come as natural to them to dress and act like other people as it is to put a friends cedar pencil in your pocket when you are done using it  but i can never have any confidence in the tinsel kings of the theatre after this  it will be a great loss  i used to take such a thrilling pleasure in them  but hereafter i will turn me sadly away and say  this does not answerthis isnt the style of king that i am acquainted with  when they swagger around the stage in jeweled crowns and splendid robes i shall feel bound to observe that all the emperors that ever i was personally acquainted with wore the commonest sort of clothes and did not swagger  and when they come on the stage attended by a vast bodyguard of supes in helmets and tin breastplates it will be my duty as well as my pleasure to inform the ignorant that no crowned head of my acquaintance has a soldier any where about his house or his person  possibly it may be thought that our party tarried too long or did other improper things but such was not the case  the company felt that they were occupying an unusually responsible positionthey were representing the people of america not the governmentand therefore they were careful to do their best to perform their high mission with credit  on the other hand the imperial families no doubt considered that in entertaining us they were more especially entertaining the people of america than they could by showering attentions on a whole platoon of ministers plenipotentiary and therefore they gave to the event its fullest significance as an expression of good will and friendly feeling toward the entire country  we took the kindnesses we received as attentions thus directed of course and not to ourselves as a party that we felt a personal pride in being received as the representatives of a nation we do not deny that we felt a national pride in the warm cordiality of that reception can not be doubted  our poet has been rigidly suppressed from the time we let go the anchor when it was announced that we were going to visit the emperor of russia the fountains of his great deep were broken up and he rained ineffable bosh for fourandtwenty hours  our original anxiety as to what we were going to do with ourselves was suddenly transformed into anxiety about what we were going to do with our poet  the problem was solved at last two alternatives were offered himhe must either swear a dreadful oath that he would not issue a line of his poetry while he was in the czars dominions or else remain under guard on board the ship until we were safe at constantinople again  he fought the dilemma long but yielded at last  it was a great deliverance  perhaps the savage reader would like a specimen of his style  i do not mean this term to be offensive  i only use it because the gentle reader has been used so often that any change from it can not but be refreshing            save us and sanctify us and finally then           see good provisions we enjoy while we journey to jerusalem           for so man proposes which it is most true           and time will wait for none nor for us too  the sea has been unusually rough all day  however we have had a lively time of it anyhow  we have had quite a run of visitors  the governorgeneral came and we received him with a salute of nine guns he brought his family with him  i observed that carpets were spread from the pierhead to his carriage for him to walk on though i have seen him walk there without any carpet when he was not on business  i thought may be he had what the accidental insurance people might call an extrahazardous polish policy joke but not above mediocrity on his boots and wished to protect them but i examined and could not see that they were blacked any better than usual  it may have been that he had forgotten his carpet before but he did not have it with him anyhow he was an exceedingly pleasant old gentleman we all liked him especially blucher when he went away blucher invited him to come again and fetch his carpet along  prince dolgorouki and a grand admiral or two whom we had seen yesterday at the reception came on board also  i was a little distant with these parties at first because when i have been visiting emperors i do not like to be too familiar with people i only know by reputation and whose moral characters and standing in society i can not be thoroughly acquainted with  i judged it best to be a little offish at first  i said to myself princes and counts and grand admirals are very well but they are not emperors and one can not be too particular about who he associates with  baron wrangel came also  he used to be russian ambassador at washington  i told him i had an uncle who fell down a shaft and broke himself in two as much as a year before that  that was a falsehood but then i was not going to let any man eclipse me on surprising adventures merely for the want of a little invention  the baron is a fine man and is said to stand high in the emperors confidence and esteem  baron ungernsternberg a boisterous wholesouled old nobleman came with the rest  he is a man of progress and enterprisea representative man of the age  he is the chief director of the railway system of russiaa sort of railroad king  in his line he is making things move along in this country he has traveled extensively in america  he says he has tried convict labor on his railroads and with perfect success  he says the convicts work well and are quiet and peaceable  he observed that he employs nearly ten thousand of them now  this appeared to be another call on my resources  i was equal to the emergency  i said we had eighty thousand convicts employed on the railways in americaall of them under sentence of death for murder in the first degree  that closed him out  we had general todtleben the famous defender of sebastopol during the siege and many inferior army and also navy officers and a number of unofficial russian ladies and gentlemen  naturally a champagne luncheon was in order and was accomplished without loss of life  toasts and jokes were discharged freely but no speeches were made save one thanking the emperor and the grand duke through the governorgeneral for our hospitable reception and one by the governorgeneral in reply in which he returned the emperors thanks for the speech etc etc     chapter xxxviii  we returned to constantinople and after a day or two spent in exhausting marches about the city and voyages up the golden horn in caiques we steamed away again  we passed through the sea of marmora and the dardanelles and steered for a new landa new one to us at leastasia we had as yet only acquired a bowing acquaintance with it through pleasure excursions to scutari and the regions round about  we passed between lemnos and mytilene and saw them as we had seen elba and the balearic islesmere bulky shapes with the softening mists of distance upon themwhales in a fog as it were  then we held our course southward and began to read up celebrated smyrna  at all hours of the day and night the sailors in the forecastle amused themselves and aggravated us by burlesquing our visit to royalty  the opening paragraph of our address to the emperor was framed as follows       we are a handful of private citizens of america traveling simply      for recreationand unostentatiously as becomes our unofficial      stateand therefore we have no excuse to tender for presenting      ourselves before your majesty save the desire of offering our      grateful acknowledgments to the lord of a realm which through good      and through evil report has been the steadfast friend of the land      we love so well  the third cook crowned with a resplendent tin basin and wrapped royally in a tablecloth mottled with greasespots and coffee stains and bearing a sceptre that looked strangely like a belayingpin walked upon a dilapidated carpet and perched himself on the capstan careless of the flying spray his tarred and weatherbeaten chamberlains dukes and lord high admirals surrounded him arrayed in all the pomp that spare tarpaulins and remnants of old sails could furnish  then the visiting watch below transformed into graceless ladies and uncouth pilgrims by rude travesties upon waterfalls hoopskirts white kid gloves and swallowtail coats moved solemnly up the companion way and bowing low began a system of complicated and extraordinary smiling which few monarchs could look upon and live  then the mock consul a slushplastered decksweep drew out a soiled fragment of paper and proceeded to read laboriously  to his imperial majesty alexander ii emperor of russia  we are a handful of private citizens of america traveling simply for recreationand unostentatiously as becomes our unofficial stateand therefore we have no excuse to tender for presenting ourselves before your majesty  the emperorthen what the devil did you come for  save the desire of offering our grateful acknowledgments to the lord of a realm which  the emperoroh dn the addressread

first groom of the palace will proceed to count the portable articles of value belonging to the premises  the farce then closed to be repeated again with every change of the watches and embellished with new and still more extravagant inventions of pomp and conversation  at all times of the day and night the phraseology of that tiresome address fell upon our ears  grimy sailors came down out of the foretop placidly announcing themselves as a handful of private citizens of america traveling simply for recreation and unostentatiously etc the coal passers moved to their duties in the profound depths of the ship explaining the blackness of their faces and their uncouthness of dress with the reminder that they were a handful of private citizens traveling simply for recreation etc and when the cry rang through the vessel at midnight eight bellslarboard watch turn out  the larboard watch came gaping and stretching out of their den with the everlasting formula ayeaye sir  we are a handful of private citizens of america traveling simply for recreation and unostentatiously as becomes our unofficial state  as i was a member of the committee and helped to frame the address these sarcasms came home to me  i never heard a sailor proclaiming himself as a handful of american citizens traveling for recreation but i wished he might trip and fall overboard and so reduce his handful by one individual at least  i never was so tired of any one phrase as the sailors made me of the opening sentence of the address to the emperor of russia  this seaport of smyrna our first notable acquaintance in asia is a closely packed city of one hundred and thirty thousand inhabitants and like constantinople it has no outskirts  it is as closely packed at its outer edges as it is in the centre and then the habitations leave suddenly off and the plain beyond seems houseless  it is just like any other oriental city  that is to say its moslem houses are heavy and dark and as comfortless as so many tombs its streets are crooked rudely and roughly paved and as narrow as an ordinary staircase the streets uniformly carry a man to any other place than the one he wants to go to and surprise him by landing him in the most unexpected localities business is chiefly carried on in great covered bazaars celled like a honeycomb with innumerable shops no larger than a common closet and the whole hive cut up into a maze of alleys about wide enough to accommodate a laden camel and well calculated to confuse a stranger and eventually lose him every where there is dirt every where there are fleas every where there are lean brokenhearted dogs every alley is thronged with people wherever you look your eye rests upon a wild masquerade of extravagant costumes the workshops are all open to the streets and the workmen visible all manner of sounds assail the ear and over them all rings out the muezzins cry from some tall minaret calling the faithful vagabonds to prayer and superior to the call to prayer the noises in the streets the interest of the costumessuperior to every thing and claiming the bulk of attention first last and all the timeis a combination of mohammedan stenches to which the smell of even a chinese quarter would be as pleasant as the roasting odors of the fatted calf to the nostrils of the returning prodigal  such is oriental luxurysuch is oriental splendor  we read about it all our days but we comprehend it not until we see it  smyrna is a very old city  its name occurs several times in the bible one or two of the disciples of christ visited it and here was located one of the original seven apocalyptic churches spoken of in revelations  these churches were symbolized in the scriptures as candlesticks and on certain conditions there was a sort of implied promise that smyrna should be endowed with a crown of life  she was to be faithful unto deaththose were the terms  she has not kept up her faith straight along but the pilgrims that wander hither consider that she has come near enough to it to save her and so they point to the fact that smyrna today wears her crown of life and is a great city with a great commerce and full of energy while the cities wherein were located the other six churches and to which no crown of life was promised have vanished from the earth  so smyrna really still possesses her crown of life in a business point of view  her career for eighteen centuries has been a chequered one and she has been under the rule of princes of many creeds yet there has been no season during all that time as far as we know and during such seasons as she was inhabited at all that she has been without her little community of christians faithful unto death  hers was the only church against which no threats were implied in the revelations and the only one which survived  with ephesus forty miles from here where was located another of the seven churches the case was different  the candlestick has been removed from ephesus  her light has been put out  pilgrims always prone to find prophecies in the bible and often where none exist speak cheerfully and complacently of poor ruined ephesus as the victim of prophecy  and yet there is no sentence that promises without due qualification the destruction of the city  the words are       remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and      do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will      remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent  that is all the other verses are singularly complimentary to ephesus the threat is qualified  there is no history to show that she did not repent  but the cruelest habit the modern prophecysavans have is that one of coolly and arbitrarily fitting the prophetic shirt on to the wrong man  they do it without regard to rhyme or reason  both the cases i have just mentioned are instances in point  those prophecies are distinctly leveled at the churches of ephesus smyrna etc and yet the pilgrims invariably make them refer to the cities instead  no crown of life is promised to the town of smyrna and its commerce but to the handful of christians who formed its church  if they were faithful unto death they have their crown nowbut no amount of faithfulness and legal shrewdness combined could legitimately drag the city into a participation in the promises of the prophecy  the stately language of the bible refers to a crown of life whose lustre will reflect the daybeams of the endless ages of eternity not the butterfly existence of a city built by mens hands which must pass to dust with the builders and be forgotten even in the mere handful of centuries vouchsafed to the solid world itself between its cradle and its grave  the fashion of delving out fulfillments of prophecy where that prophecy consists of mere ifs trenches upon the absurd  suppose a thousand years from now a malarious swamp builds itself up in the shallow harbor of smyrna or something else kills the town and suppose also that within that time the swamp that has filled the renowned harbor of ephesus and rendered her ancient site deadly and uninhabitable today becomes hard and healthy ground suppose the natural consequence ensues to wit that smyrna becomes a melancholy ruin and ephesus is rebuilt  what would the prophecysavans say  they would coolly skip over our age of the world and say smyrna was not faithful unto death and so her crown of life was denied her ephesus repented and lo her candlestick was not removed  behold these evidences  how wonderful is prophecy  smyrna has been utterly destroyed six times  if her crown of life had been an insurance policy she would have had an opportunity to collect on it the first time she fell  but she holds it on sufferance and by a complimentary construction of language which does not refer to her  six different times however i suppose some infatuated prophecyenthusiast blundered along and said to the infinite disgust of smyrna and the smyrniotes in sooth here is astounding fulfillment of prophecy  smyrna hath not been faithful unto death and behold her crown of life is vanished from her head  verily these things be astonishing  such things have a bad influence  they provoke worldly men into using light conversation concerning sacred subjects  thickheaded commentators upon the bible and stupid preachers and teachers work more damage to religion than sensible coolbrained clergymen can fight away again toil as they may  it is not good judgment to fit a crown of life upon a city which has been destroyed six times  that other class of wiseacres who twist prophecy in such a manner as to make it promise the destruction and desolation of the same city use judgment just as bad since the city is in a very flourishing condition now unhappily for them  these things put arguments into the mouth of infidelity  a portion of the city is pretty exclusively turkish the jews have a quarter to themselves the franks another quarter so also with the armenians  the armenians of course are christians  their houses are large clean airy handsomely paved with black and white squares of marble and in the centre of many of them is a square court which has in it a luxuriant flowergarden and a sparkling fountain the doors of all the rooms open on this  a very wide hall leads to the street door and in this the women sit the most of the day  in the cool of the evening they dress up in their best raiment and show themselves at the door they are all comely of countenance and exceedingly neat and cleanly they look as if they were just out of a bandbox  some of the young ladiesmany of them i may sayare even very beautiful they average a shade better than american girlswhich treasonable words i pray may be forgiven me  they are very sociable and will smile back when a stranger smiles at them bow back when he bows and talk back if he speaks to them  no introduction is required  an hours chat at the door with a pretty girl one never saw before is easily obtained and is very pleasant  i have tried it  i could not talk anything but english and the girl knew nothing but greek or armenian or some such barbarous tongue but we got along very well  i find that in cases like these the fact that you can not comprehend each other isnt much of a drawback in that russia n town of yalta i danced an astonishing sort of dance an hour long and one i had not heard of before with a very pretty girl and we talked incessantly and laughed exhaustingly and neither one ever knew what the other was driving at  but it was splendid  there were twenty people in the set and the dance was very lively and complicated it was complicated enough without mewith me it was more so  i threw in a figure now and then that surprised those russians  but i have never ceased to think of that girl  i have written to her but i can not direct the epistle because her name is one of those ninejointed russian affairs and there are not letters enough in our alphabet to hold out i am not reckless enough to try to pronounce it when i am awake but i make a stagger at it in my dreams and get up with the lockjaw in the morning  i am fading  i do not take my meals now with any sort of regularity  her dear name haunts me still in my dreams  it is awful on teeth  it never comes out of my mouth but it fetches an old snag along with it  and then the lockjaw closes down and nips off a couple of the last syllablesbut they taste good  coming through the dardanelles we saw camel trains on shore with the glasses but we were never close to one till we got to smyrna  these camels are very much larger than the scrawny specimens one sees in the menagerie  they stride along these streets in single file a dozen in a train with heavy loads on their backs and a fancylooking negro in turkish costume or an arab preceding them on a little donkey and completely overshadowed and rendered insignificant by the huge beasts to see a camel train laden with the spices of arabia and the rare fabrics of persia come marching through the narrow alleys of the bazaar among porters with their burdens moneychangers lampmerchants alnaschars in the glassware business portly crosslegged turks smoking the famous narghili and the crowds drifting to and fro in the fanciful costumes of the east is a genuine revelation of the orient  the picture lacks nothing  it casts you back at once into your forgotten boyhood and again you dream over the wonders of the arabian nights again your companions are princes your lord is the caliph haroun al raschid and your servants are terrific giants and genii that come with smoke and lightning and thunder and go as a storm goes when they depart     chapter xxxix  we inquired and learned that the lions of smyrna consisted of the ruins of the ancient citadel whose broken and prodigious battlements frown upon the city from a lofty hill just in the edge of the townthe mount pagus of scripture they call it the site of that one of the seven apocalyptic churches of asia which was located here in the first century of the christian era and the grave and the place of martyrdom of the venerable polycarp who suffered in smyrna for his religion some eighteen hundred years ago  we took little donkeys and started  we saw polycarps tomb and then hurried on  the seven churchesthus they abbreviate itcame next on the list  we rode thereabout a mile and a half in the sweltering sunand visited a little greek church which they said was built upon the ancient site and we paid a small fee and the holy attendant gave each of us a little wax candle as a remembrancer of the place and i put mine in my hat and the sun melted it and the grease all ran down the back of my neck and so now i have not any thing left but the wick and it is a sorry and a wiltedlooking wick at that  several of us argued as well as we could that the church mentioned in the bible meant a party of christians and not a building that the bible spoke of them as being very poorso poor i thought and so subject to persecution as per polycarps martyrdom that in the first place they probably could not have afforded a church edifice and in the second would not have dared to build it in the open light of day if they could and finally that if they had had the privilege of building it common judgment would have suggested that they build it somewhere near the town but the elders of the ships family ruled us down and scouted our evidences  however retribution came to them afterward  they found that they had been led astray and had gone to the wrong place they discovered that the accepted site is in the city  riding through the town we could see marks of the six smyrnas that have existed here and been burned up by fire or knocked down by earthquakes the hills and the rocks are rent asunder in places excavations expose great blocks of buildingstone that have lain buried for ages and all the mean houses and walls of modern smyrna along the way are spotted white with broken pillars capitals and fragments of sculptured marble that once adorned the lordly palaces that were the glory of the city in the olden time  the ascent of the hill of the citadel is very steep and we proceeded rather slowly  but there were matters of interest about us  in one place five hundred feet above the sea the perpendicular bank on the upper side of the road was ten or fifteen feet high and the cut exposed three veins of oyster shells just as we have seen quartz veins exposed in the cutting of a road in nevada or montana  the veins were about eighteen inches thick and two or three feet apart and they slanted along downward for a distance of thirty feet or more and then disappeared where the cut joined the road  heaven only knows how far a man might trace them by stripping  they were clean nice oyster shells large and just like any other oyster shells  they were thickly massed together and none were scattered above or below the veins  each one was a welldefined lead by itself and without a spur  my first instinct was to set up the usual                                  notice       we the undersigned claim five claims of two hundred feet each      and one for discovery on this ledge or lode of oystershells      with all its dips spurs angles variations and sinuosities and      fifty feet on each side of the same to work it etc etc      according to the mining laws of smyrna  they were such perfectly naturallooking leads that i could hardly keep from taking them up  among the oystershells were mixed many fragments of ancient broken crockery ware  now how did those masses of oystershells get there  i can not determine  broken crockery and oystershells are suggestive of restaurantsbut then they could have had no such places away up there on that mountain side in our time because nobody has lived up there  a restaurant would not pay in such a stony forbidding desolate place  and besides there were no champagne corks among the shells  if there ever was a restaurant there it must have been in smyrnas palmy days when the hills were covered with palaces i could believe in one restaurant on those terms but then how about the three  did they have restaurants there at three different periods of the worldbecause there are two or three feet of solid earth between the oyster leads  evidently the restaurant solution will not answer  the hill might have been the bottom of the sea once and been lifted up with its oysterbeds by an earthquakebut then how about the crockery  and moreover how about three oyster beds one above another and thick strata of good honest earth between  that theory will not do  it is just possible that this hill is mount ararat and that noahs ark rested here and he ate oysters and threw the shells overboard  but that will not do either  there are the three layers again and the solid earth betweenand besides there were only eight in noahs family and they could not have eaten all these oysters in the two or three months they staid on top of that mountain  the beastshowever it is simply absurd to suppose he did not know any more than to feed the beasts on oyster suppers  it is painfulit is even humiliatingbut i am reduced at last to one slender theory that the oysters climbed up there of their own accord but what object could they have had in viewwhat did they want up there  what could any oyster want to climb a hill for  to climb a hill must necessarily be fatiguing and annoying exercise for an oyster  the most natural conclusion would be that the oysters climbed up there to look at the scenery  yet when one comes to reflect upon the nature of an oyster it seems plain that he does not care for scenery  an oyster has no taste for such things he cares nothing for the beautiful  an oyster is of a retiring disposition and not livelynot even cheerful above the average and never enterprising  but above all an oyster does not take any interest in sceneryhe scorns it  what have i arrived at now simply at the point i started from namely those oyster shells are there in regular layers five hundred feet above the sea and no man knows how they got there  i have hunted up the guidebooks and the gist of what they say is this they are there but how they got there is a mystery  twentyfive years ago a multitude of people in america put on their ascension robes took a tearful leave of their friends and made ready to fly up into heaven at the first blast of the trumpet  but the angel did not blow it  millers resurrection day was a failure  the millerites were disgusted  i did not suspect that there were millers in asia minor but a gentleman tells me that they had it all set for the world to come to an end in smyrna one day about three years ago  there was much buzzing and preparation for a long time previously and it culminated in a wild excitement at the appointed time  a vast number of the populace ascended the citadel hill early in the morning to get out of the way of the general destruction and many of the infatuated closed up their shops and retired from all earthly business  but the strange part of it was that about three in the afternoon while this gentleman and his friends were at dinner in the hotel a terrific storm of rain accompanied by thunder and lightning broke forth and continued with dire fury for two or three hours  it was a thing unprecedented in smyrna at that time of the year and scared some of the most skeptical  the streets ran rivers and the hotel floor was flooded with water  the dinner had to be suspended  when the storm finished and left every body drenched through and through and melancholy and halfdrowned the ascensionists came down from the mountain as dry as so many charitysermons  they had been looking down upon the fearful storm going on below and really believed that their proposed destruction of the world was proving a grand success  a railway here in asiain the dreamy realm of the orientin the fabled land of the arabian nightsis a strange thing to think of  and yet they have one already and are building another  the present one is well built and well conducted by an english company but is not doing an immense amount of business  the first year it carried a good many passengers but its freight list only comprised eight hundred pounds of figs  it runs almost to the very gates of ephesusa town great in all ages of the worlda city familiar to readers of the bible and one which was as old as the very hills when the disciples of christ preached in its streets  it dates back to the shadowy ages of tradition and was the birthplace of gods renowned in grecian mythology  the idea of a locomotive tearing through such a place as this and waking the phantoms of its old days of romance out of their dreams of dead and gone centuries is curious enough  we journey thither tomorrow to see the celebrated ruins     chapter xl  this has been a stirring day  the superintendent of the railway put a train at our disposal and did us the further kindness of accompanying us to ephesus and giving to us his watchful care  we brought sixty scarcely perceptible donkeys in the freight cars for we had much ground to go over  we have seen some of the most grotesque costumes along the line of the railroad that can be imagined  i am glad that no possible combination of words could describe them for i might then be foolish enough to attempt it  at ancient ayassalook in the midst of a forbidding desert we came upon long lines of ruined aqueducts and other remnants of architectural grandeur that told us plainly enough we were nearing what had been a metropolis once  we left the train and mounted the donkeys along with our invited guestspleasant young gentlemen from the officers list of an american manofwar  the little donkeys had saddles upon them which were made very high in order that the riders feet might not drag the ground  the preventative did not work well in the cases of our tallest pilgrims however  there were no bridlesnothing but a single rope tied to the bit  it was purely ornamental for the donkey cared nothing for it  if he were drifting to starboard you might put your helm down hard the other way if it were any satisfaction to you to do it but he would continue to drift to starboard all the same  there was only one process which could be depended on and it was to get down and lift his rear around until his head pointed in the right direction or take him under your arm and carry him to a part of the road which he could not get out of without climbing the sun flamed down as hot as a furnace and neckscarfs veils and umbrellas seemed hardly any protection they served only to make the long procession look more than ever fantasticfor be it known the ladies were all riding astride because they could not stay on the shapeless saddles sidewise the men were perspiring and out of temper their feet were banging against the rocks the donkeys were capering in every direction but the right one and being belabored with clubs for it and every now and then a broad umbrella would suddenly go down out of the cavalcade announcing to all that one more pilgrim had bitten the dust  it was a wilder picture than those solitudes had seen for many a day  no donkeys ever existed that were as hard to navigate as these i think or that had so many vile exasperating instincts  occasionally we grew so tired and breathless with fighting them that we had to desistand immediately the donkey would come down to a deliberate walk  this with the fatigue and the sun would put a man asleep and soon as the man was asleep the donkey would lie down  my donkey shall never see his boyhoods home again  he has lain down once too often he must die  we all stood in the vast theatre of ancient ephesusthe stonebenched amphitheatre i meanand had our picture taken  we looked as proper there as we would look any where i suppose  we do not embellish the general desolation of a desert much  we add what dignity we can to a stately ruin with our green umbrellas and jackasses but it is little however we mean well  i wish to say a brief word of the aspect of ephesus  on a high steep hill toward the sea is a gray ruin of ponderous blocks of marble wherein tradition says st paul was imprisoned eighteen centuries ago  from these old walls you have the finest view of the desolate scene where once stood ephesus the proudest city of ancient times and whose temple of diana was so noble in design and so exquisite of workmanship that it ranked high in the list of the seven wonders of the world  behind you is the sea in front is a level green valley a marsh in fact extending far away among the mountains to the right of the front view is the old citadel of ayassalook on a high hill the ruined mosque of the sultan selim stands near it in the plain this is built over the grave of st john and was formerly christian church further toward you is the hill of pion around whose front is clustered all that remains of the ruins of ephesus that still stand divided from it by a narrow valley is the long rocky rugged mountain of coressus  the scene is a pretty one and yet desolatefor in that wide plain no man can live and in it is no human habitation  but for the crumbling arches and monstrous piers and broken walls that rise from the foot of the hill of pion one could not believe that in this place once stood a city whose renown is older than tradition itself  it is incredible to reflect that things as familiar all over the world today as household words belong in the history and in the shadowy legends of this silent mournful solitude we speak of apollo and of dianathey were born here of the metamorphosis of syrinx into a reedit was done here of the great god panhe dwelt in the caves of this hill of coressus of the amazonsthis was their best prized home of bacchus and hercules both fought the warlike women here of the cyclopsthey laid the ponderous marble blocks of some of the ruins yonder of homerthis was one of his many birthplaces of cirmon of athens of alcibiades lysander agesilaus they visited here so did alexander the great so did hannibal and antiochus scipio lucullus and sylla brutus cassius pompey cicero and augustus antony was a judge in this place and left his seat in the open court while the advocates were speaking to run after cleopatra who passed the door from this city these two sailed on pleasure excursions in galleys with silver oars and perfumed sails and with companies of beautiful girls to serve them and actors and musicians to amuse them in days that seem almost modern so remote are they from the early history of this city paul the apostle preached the new religion here and so did john and here it is supposed the former was pitted against wild beasts for in 1 corinthians xv 32 he says       if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus      c  when many men still lived who had seen the christ here mary magdalen died and here the virgin mary ended her days with john albeit rome has since judged it best to locate her grave elsewhere six or seven hundred years agoalmost yesterday as it weretroops of mailclad crusaders thronged the streets and to come down to trifles we speak of meandering streams and find a new interest in a common word when we discover that the crooked river meander in yonder valley gave it to our dictionary it makes me feel as old as these dreary hills to look down upon these mosshung ruins this historic desolation  one may read the scriptures and believe but he can not go and stand yonder in the ruined theatre and in imagination people it again with the vanished multitudes who mobbed pauls comrades there and shouted with one voice great is diana of the ephesians  the idea of a shout in such a solitude as this almost makes one shudder  it was a wonderful city this ephesus  go where you will about these broad plains you find the most exquisitely sculptured marble fragments scattered thick among the dust and weeds and protruding from the ground or lying prone upon it are beautiful fluted columns of porphyry and all precious marbles and at every step you find elegantly carved capitals and massive bases and polished tablets engraved with greek inscriptions it is a world of precious relics a wilderness of marred and mutilated gems  and yet what are these things to the wonders that lie buried here under the ground  at constantinople at pisa in the cities of spain are great mosques and cathedrals whose grandest columns came from the temples and palaces of ephesus and yet one has only to scratch the ground here to match them  we shall never know what magnificence is until this imperial city is laid bare to the sun  the finest piece of sculpture we have yet seen and the one that impressed us most for we do not know much about art and can not easily work up ourselves into ecstasies over it is one that lies in this old theatre of ephesus which st pauls riot has made so celebrated  it is only the headless body of a man clad in a coat of mail with a medusa head upon the breastplate but we feel persuaded that such dignity and such majesty were never thrown into a form of stone before  what builders they were these men of antiquity  the massive arches of some of these ruins rest upon piers that are fifteen feet square and built entirely of solid blocks of marble some of which are as large as a saratoga trunk and some the size of a boardinghouse sofa  they are not shells or shafts of stone filled inside with rubbish but the whole pier is a mass of solid masonry  vast arches that may have been the gates of the city are built in the same way  they have braved the storms and sieges of three thousand years and have been shaken by many an earthquake but still they stand  when they dig alongside of them they find ranges of ponderous masonry that are as perfect in every detail as they were the day those old cyclopian giants finished them  an english company is going to excavate ephesusand then  and now am i reminded of                      the legend of the seven sleepers  in the mount of pion yonder is the cave of the seven sleepers  once upon a time about fifteen hundred years ago seven young men lived near each other in ephesus who belonged to the despised sect of the christians  it came to pass that the good king maximilianus i am telling this story for nice little boys and girls it came to pass i say that the good king maximilianus fell to persecuting the christians and as time rolled on he made it very warm for them  so the seven young men said one to the other let us get up and travel  and they got up and traveled  they tarried not to bid their fathers and mothers goodbye or any friend they knew  they only took certain moneys which their parents had and garments that belonged unto their friends whereby they might remember them when far away and they took also the dog ketmehr which was the property of their neighbor malchus because the beast did run his head into a noose which one of the young men was carrying carelessly and they had not time to release him and they took also certain chickens that seemed lonely in the neighboring coops and likewise some bottles of curious liquors that stood near the grocers window and then they departed from the city  byandby they came to a marvelous cave in the hill of pion and entered into it and feasted and presently they hurried on again  but they forgot the bottles of curious liquors and left them behind  they traveled in many lands and had many strange adventures they were virtuous young men and lost no opportunity that fell in their way to make their livelihood  their motto was in these words namely procrastination is the thief of time  and so whenever they did come upon a man who was alone they said behold this person hath the wherewithallet us go through him  and they went through him  at the end of five years they had waxed tired of travel and adventure and longed to revisit their old home again and hear the voices and see the faces that were dear unto their youth  therefore they went through such parties as fell in their way where they sojourned at that time and journeyed back toward ephesus again  for the good king maximilianus was become converted unto the new faith and the christians rejoiced because they were no longer persecuted  one day as the sun went down they came to the cave in the mount of pion and they said each to his fellow let us sleep here and go and feast and make merry with our friends when the morning cometh  and each of the seven lifted up his voice and said it is a whiz  so they went in and lo where they had put them there lay the bottles of strange liquors and they judged that age had not impaired their excellence  wherein the wanderers were right and the heads of the same were level  so each of the young men drank six bottles and behold they felt very tired then and lay down and slept soundly  when they awoke one of them johannessurnamed smithianussaid we are naked  and it was so  their raiment was all gone and the money which they had gotten from a stranger whom they had proceeded through as they approached the city was lying upon the ground corroded and rusted and defaced  likewise the dog ketmehr was gone and nothing save the brass that was upon his collar remained  they wondered much at these things but they took the money and they wrapped about their bodies some leaves and came up to the top of the hill  then were they perplexed  the wonderful temple of diana was gone many grand edifices they had never seen before stood in the city men in strange garbs moved about the streets and every thing was changed  johannes said it hardly seems like ephesus  yet here is the great gymnasium here is the mighty theatre wherein i have seen seventy thousand men assembled here is the agora there is the font where the sainted john the baptist immersed the converts yonder is the prison of the good st paul where we all did use to go to touch the ancient chains that bound him and be cured of our distempers i see the tomb of the disciple luke and afar off is the church wherein repose the ashes of the holy john where the christians of ephesus go twice a year to gather the dust from the tomb which is able to make bodies whole again that are corrupted by disease and cleanse the soul from sin but see how the wharves encroach upon the sea and what multitudes of ships are anchored in the bay see also how the city hath stretched abroad far over the valley behind pion and even unto the walls of ayassalook and lo all the hills are white with palaces and ribbed with colonnades of marble how mighty is ephesus become  and wondering at what their eyes had seen they went down into the city and purchased garments and clothed themselves  and when they would have passed on the merchant bit the coins which they had given him with his teeth and turned them about and looked curiously upon them and cast them upon his counter and listened if they rang and then he said these be bogus  and they said depart thou to hades and went their way  when they were come to their houses they recognized them albeit they seemed old and mean and they rejoiced and were glad  they ran to the doors and knocked and strangers opened and looked inquiringly upon them  and they said with great excitement while their hearts beat high and the color in their faces came and went where is my father  where is my mother  where are dionysius and serapion and pericles and decius  and the strangers that opened said we know not these  the seven said how you know them not  how long have ye dwelt here and whither are they gone that dwelt here before ye  and the strangers said ye play upon us with a jest young men we and our fathers have sojourned under these roofs these six generations the names ye utter rot upon the tombs and they that bore them have run their brief race have laughed and sung have borne the sorrows and the weariness that were allotted them and are at rest for ninescore years the summers have come and gone and the autumn leaves have fallen since the roses faded out of their cheeks and they laid them to sleep with the dead  then the seven young men turned them away from their homes and the strangers shut the doors upon them  the wanderers marveled greatly and looked into the faces of all they met as hoping to find one that they knew but all were strange and passed them by and spake no friendly word  they were sore distressed and sad  presently they spake unto a citizen and said who is king in ephesus  and the citizen answered and said whence come ye that ye know not that great laertius reigns in ephesus  they looked one at the other greatly perplexed and presently asked again where then is the good king maximilianus  the citizen moved him apart as one who is afraid and said verily these men be mad and dream dreams else would they know that the king whereof they speak is dead above two hundred years agone  then the scales fell from the eyes of the seven and one said alas that we drank of the curious liquors  they have made us weary and in dreamless sleep these two long centuries have we lain  our homes are desolate our friends are dead  behold the jig is uplet us die  and that same day went they forth and laid them down and died  and in that selfsame day likewise the sevenup did cease in ephesus for that the seven that were up were down again and departed and dead withal  and the names that be upon their tombs even unto this time are johannes smithianus trumps gift high and low jack and the game  and with the sleepers lie also the bottles wherein were once the curious liquors and upon them is writ in ancient letters such words as thesedames of heathen gods of olden time perchance rumpunch jinsling egnog  such is the story of the seven sleepers with slight variations and i know it is true because i have seen the cave myself  really so firm a faith had the ancients this legend that as late as eight or nine hundred years ago learned travelers held it in superstitious fear  two of them record that they ventured into it but ran quickly out again not daring to tarry lest they should fall asleep and outlive their great grandchildren a century or so  even at this day the ignorant denizens of the neighboring country prefer not to sleep in it     chapter xli  when i last made a memorandum we were at ephesus  we are in syria now encamped in the mountains of lebanon  the interregnum has been long both as to time and distance  we brought not a relic from ephesus after gathering up fragments of sculptured marbles and breaking ornaments from the interior work of the mosques and after bringing them at a cost of infinite trouble and fatigue five miles on muleback to the railway depot a government officer compelled all who had such things to disgorge  he had an order from constantinople to look out for our party and see that we carried nothing off  it was a wise a just and a welldeserved rebuke but it created a sensation  i never resist a temptation to plunder a strangers premises without feeling insufferably vain about it  this time i felt proud beyond expression  i was serene in the midst of the scoldings that were heaped upon the ottoman government for its affront offered to a pleasuring party of entirely respectable gentlemen and ladies i said we that have free souls it touches us not  the shoe not only pinched our party but it pinched hard a principal sufferer discovered that the imperial order was inclosed in an envelop bearing the seal of the british embassy at constantinople and therefore must have been inspired by the representative of the queen  this was badvery bad  coming solely from the ottomans it might have signified only ottoman hatred of christians and a vulgar ignorance as to genteel methods of expressing it but coming from the christianized educated politic british legation it simply intimated that we were a sort of gentlemen and ladies who would bear watching  so the party regarded it and were incensed accordingly  the truth doubtless was that the same precautions would have been taken against any travelers because the english company who have acquired the right to excavate ephesus and have paid a great sum for that right need to be protected and deserve to be they can not afford to run the risk of having their hospitality abused by travelers especially since travelers are such notorious scorners of honest behavior  we sailed from smyrna in the wildest spirit of expectancy for the chief feature the grand goal of the expedition was near at handwe were approaching the holy land  such a burrowing into the hold for trunks that had lain buried for weeks yes for months such a hurrying to and fro above decks and below such a riotous system of packing and unpacking such a littering up of the cabins with shirts and skirts and indescribable and unclassable odds and ends such a making up of bundles and setting apart of umbrellas green spectacles and thick veils such a critical inspection of saddles and bridles that had never yet touched horses such a cleaning and loading of revolvers and examining of bowieknives such a halfsoling of the seats of pantaloons with serviceable buckskin then such a poring over ancient maps such a reading up of bibles and palestine travels such a marking out of routes such exasperating efforts to divide up the company into little bands of congenial spirits who might make the long and arduous journey without quarreling and morning noon and night such massmeetings in the cabins such speechmaking such sage suggesting such worrying and quarreling and such a general raising of the very mischief was never seen in the ship before  but it is all over now  we are cut up into parties of six or eight and by this time are scattered far and wide  ours is the only one however that is venturing on what is called the long tripthat is out into syria by baalbec to damascus and thence down through the full length of palestine  it would be a tedious and also a too risky journey at this hot season of the year for any but strong healthy men accustomed somewhat to fatigue and rough life in the open air  the other parties will take shorter journeys  for the last two months we have been in a worry about one portion of this holy land pilgrimage  i refer to transportation service  we knew very well that palestine was a country which did not do a large passenger business and every man we came across who knew any thing about it gave us to understand that not half of our party would be able to get dragomen and animals  at constantinople every body fell to telegraphing the american consuls at alexandria and beirout to give notice that we wanted dragomen and transportation  we were desperatewould take horses jackasses cameleopards kangaroosany thing  at smyrna more telegraphing was done to the same end  also fearing for the worst we telegraphed for a large number of seats in the diligence for damascus and horses for the ruins of baalbec  as might have been expected a notion got abroad in syria and egypt that the whole population of the province of america the turks consider us a trifling little province in some unvisited corner of the world were coming to the holy landand so when we got to beirout yesterday we found the place full of dragomen and their outfits  we had all intended to go by diligence to damascus and switch off to baalbec as we went alongbecause we expected to rejoin the ship go to mount carmel and take to the woods from there  however when our own private party of eight found that it was possible and proper enough to make the long trip we adopted that programme  we have never been much trouble to a consul before but we have been a fearful nuisance to our consul at beirout  i mention this because i can not help admiring his patience his industry and his accommodating spirit  i mention it also because i think some of our ships company did not give him as full credit for his excellent services as he deserved  well out of our eight three were selected to attend to all business connected with the expedition  the rest of us had nothing to do but look at the beautiful city of beirout with its bright new houses nestled among a wilderness of green shrubbery spread abroad over an upland that sloped gently down to the sea and also at the mountains of lebanon that environ it and likewise to bathe in the transparent blue water that rolled its billows about the ship we did not know there were sharks there we had also to range up and down through the town and look at the costumes  these are picturesque and fanciful but not so varied as at constantinople and smyrna the women of beirout add an agonyin the two former cities the sex wear a thin veil which one can see through and they often expose their ancles but at beirout they cover their entire faces with darkcolored or black veils so that they look like mummies and then expose their breasts to the public  a young gentleman i believe he was a greek volunteered to show us around the city and said it would afford him great pleasure because he was studying english and wanted practice in that language  when we had finished the rounds however he called for remunerationsaid he hoped the gentlemen would give him a trifle in the way of a few piastres equivalent to a few five cent pieces  we did so  the consul was surprised when he heard it and said he knew the young fellows family very well and that they were an old and highly respectable family and worth a hundred and fifty thousand dollars  some people so situated would have been ashamed of the berth he had with us and his manner of crawling into it  at the appointed time our business committee reported and said all things were in readdressthat we were to start today with horses pack animals and tents and go to baalbec damascus the sea of tiberias and thence southward by the way of the scene of jacobs dream and other notable bible localities to jerusalemfrom thence probably to the dead sea but possibly notand then strike for the ocean and rejoin the ship three or four weeks hence at joppa terms five dollars a day apiece in gold and every thing to be furnished by the dragoman  they said we would lie as well as at a hotel  i had read something like that before and did not shame my judgment by believing a word of it  i said nothing however but packed up a blanket and a shawl to sleep in pipes and tobacco two or three woollen shirts a portfolio a guidebook and a bible  i also took along a towel and a cake of soap to inspire respect in the arabs who would take me for a king in disguise  we were to select our horses at 3 pm  at that hour abraham the dragoman marshaled them before us  with all solemnity i set it down here that those horses were the hardest lot i ever did come across and their accoutrements were in exquisite keeping with their style  one brute had an eye out another had his tail sawed off close like a rabbit and was proud of it another had a bony ridge running from his neck to his tail like one of those ruined aqueducts one sees about rome and had a neck on him like a bowsprit they all limped and had sore backs and likewise raw places and old scales scattered about their persons like brass nails in a hair trunk their gaits were marvelous to contemplate and replete with variety under way the procession looked like a fleet in a storm  it was fearful  blucher shook his head and said  that dragon is going to get himself into trouble fetching these old crates out of the hospital the way they are unless he has got a permit  i said nothing  the display was exactly according to the guidebook and were we not traveling by the guidebook  i selected a certain horse because i thought i saw him shy and i thought that a horse that had spirit enough to shy was not to be despised  at 6 oclock pm we came to a halt here on the breezy summit of a shapely mountain overlooking the sea and the handsome valley where dwelt some of those enterprising phoenicians of ancient times we read so much about all around us are what were once the dominions of hiram king of tyre who furnished timber from the cedars of these lebanon hills to build portions of king solomons temple with  shortly after six our pack train arrived  i had not seen it before and a good right i had to be astonished  we had nineteen serving men and twentysix pack mules  it was a perfect caravan  it looked like one too as it wound among the rocks  i wondered what in the very mischief we wanted with such a vast turnout as that for eight men  i wondered awhile but soon i began to long for a tin plate and some bacon and beans  i had camped out many and many a time before and knew just what was coming  i went off without waiting for serving men and unsaddled my horse and washed such portions of his ribs and his spine as projected through his hide and when i came back behold five stately circus tents were uptents that were brilliant within with blue and gold and crimson and all manner of splendid adornment  i was speechless  then they brought eight little iron bedsteads and set them up in the tents they put a soft mattress and pillows and good blankets and two snowwhite sheets on each bed  next they rigged a table about the centrepole and on it placed pewter pitchers basins soap and the whitest of towels one set for each man they pointed to pockets in the tent and said we could put our small trifles in them for convenience and if we needed pins or such things they were sticking every where  then came the finishing touchthey spread carpets on the floor  i simply said if you call this camping out all rightbut it isnt the style i am used to my little baggage that i brought along is at a discount  it grew dark and they put candles on the tablescandles set in bright new brazen candlesticks  and soon the bella genuine simonpure bell rang and we were invited to the saloon  i had thought before that we had a tent or so too many but now here was one at least provided for it was to be used for nothing but an eatingsaloon  like the others it was high enough for a family of giraffes to live in and was very handsome and clean and brightcolored within  it was a gem of a place  a table for eight and eight canvas chairs a tablecloth and napkins whose whiteness and whose fineness laughed to scorn the things we were used to in the great excursion steamer knives and forks soupplates dinnerplatesevery thing in the handsomest kind of style  it was wonderful  and they call this camping out  those stately fellows in baggy trowsers and turbaned fezzes brought in a dinner which consisted of roast mutton roast chicken roast goose potatoes bread tea pudding apples and delicious grapes the viands were better cooked than any we had eaten for weeks and the table made a finer appearance with its large german silver candlesticks and other finery than any table we had sat down to for a good while and yet that polite dragoman abraham came bowing in and apologizing for the whole affair on account of the unavoidable confusion of getting under way for a very long trip and promising to do a great deal better in future  it is midnight now and we break camp at six in the morning  they call this camping out  at this rate it is a glorious privilege to be a pilgrim to the holy land     chapter xlii  we are camped near temninelfokaa name which the boys have simplified a good deal for the sake of convenience in spelling  they call it jacksonville  it sounds a little strangely here in the valley of lebanon but it has the merit of being easier to remember than the arabic name                       come like spirits so depart                   the night shall be filled with music                    and the cares that infest the day                  shall fold their tents like the arabs                       and as silently steal away  i slept very soundly last night yet when the dragomans bell rang at halfpast five this morning and the cry went abroad of ten minutes to dress for breakfast  i heard both  it surprised me because i have not heard the breakfast gong in the ship for a month and whenever we have had occasion to fire a salute at daylight i have only found it out in the course of conversation afterward  however camping out even though it be in a gorgeous tent makes one fresh and lively in the morning especially if the air you are breathing is the cool fresh air of the mountains  i was dressed within the ten minutes and came out  the saloon tent had been stripped of its sides and had nothing left but its roof so when we sat down to table we could look out over a noble panorama of mountain sea and hazy valley  and sitting thus the sun rose slowly up and suffused the picture with a world of rich coloring  hot mutton chops fried chicken omelettes fried potatoes and coffee all excellent  this was the bill of fare  it was sauced with a savage appetite purchased by hard riding the day before and refreshing sleep in a pure atmosphere  as i called for a second cup of coffee i glanced over my shoulder and behold our white village was gonethe splendid tents had vanished like magic  it was wonderful how quickly those arabs had folded their tents and it was wonderful also how quickly they had gathered the thousand odds and ends of the camp together and disappeared with them  by halfpast six we were under way and all the syrian world seemed to be under way also  the road was filled with mule trains and long processions of camels  this reminds me that we have been trying for some time to think what a camel looks like and now we have made it out  when he is down on all his knees flat on his breast to receive his load he looks something like a goose swimming and when he is upright he looks like an ostrich with an extra set of legs  camels are not beautiful and their long under lip gives them an exceedingly gallusexcuse the slang no other word will describe itexpression  they have immense flat forked cushions of feet that make a track in the dust like a pie with a slice cut out of it  they are not particular about their diet they would eat a tombstone if they could bite it  a thistle grows about here which has needles on it that would pierce through leather i think if one touches you you can find relief in nothing but profanity  the camels eat these  they show by their actions that they enjoy them  i suppose it would be a real treat to a camel to have a keg of nails for supper  while i am speaking of animals i will mention that i have a horse now by the name of jericho  he is a mare  i have seen remarkable horses before but none so remarkable as this  i wanted a horse that could shy and this one fills the bill  i had an idea that shying indicated spirit if i was correct i have got the most spirited horse on earth  he shies at every thing he comes across with the utmost impartiality  he appears to have a mortal dread of telegraph poles especially and it is fortunate that these are on both sides of the road because as it is now i never fall off twice in succession on the same side  if i fell on the same side always it would get to be monotonous after a while  this creature has scared at every thing he has seen today except a haystack he walked up to that with an intrepidity and a recklessness that were astonishing  and it would fill any one with admiration to see how he preserves his selfpossession in the presence of a barley sack  this daredevil bravery will be the death of this horse some day  he is not particularly fast but i think he will get me through the holy land  he has only one fault  his tail has been chopped off or else he has sat down on it too hard some time or other and he has to fight the flies with his heels  this is all very well but when he tries to kick a fly off the top of his head with his hind foot it is too much variety he is going to get himself into trouble that way some day  he reaches around and bites my legs too  i do not care particularly about that only i do not like to see a horse too sociable  i think the owner of this prize had a wrong opinion about him  he had an idea that he was one of those fiery untamed steeds but he is not of that character  i know the arab had this idea because when he brought the horse out for inspection in beirout he kept jerking at the bridle and shouting in arabic ho will you  do you want to run away you ferocious beast and break your neck when all the time the horse was not doing anything in the world and only looked like he wanted to lean up against something and think  whenever he is not shying at things or reaching after a fly he wants to do that yet  how it would surprise his owner to know this  we have been in a historical section of country all day  at noon we camped three hours and took luncheon at mekseh near the junction of the lebanon mountains and the jebel el kuneiyiseh and looked down into the immense level gardenlike valley of lebanon  tonight we are camping near the same valley and have a very wide sweep of it in view  we can see the long whalebacked ridge of mount hermon projecting above the eastern hills  the dews of hermon are falling upon us now and the tents are almost soaked with them  over the way from us and higher up the valley we can discern through the glasses the faint outlines of the wonderful ruins of baalbec the supposed baalgad of scripture  joshua and another person were the two spies who were sent into this land of canaan by the children of israel to report upon its characteri mean they were the spies who reported favorably  they took back with them some specimens of the grapes of this country and in the childrens picturebooks they are always represented as bearing one monstrous bunch swung to a pole between them a respectable load for a packtrain  the sundayschool books exaggerated it a little  the grapes are most excellent to this day but the bunches are not as large as those in the pictures  i was surprised and hurt when i saw them because those colossal bunches of grapes were one of my most cherished juvenile traditions  joshua reported favorably and the children of israel journeyed on with moses at the head of the general government and joshua in command of the army of six hundred thousand fighting men  of women and children and civilians there was a countless swarm  of all that mighty host none but the two faithful spies ever lived to set their feet in the promised land they and their descendants wandered forty years in the desert and then moses the gifted warrior poet statesman and philosopher went up into pisgah and met his mysterious fate  where he was buried no man knows for               no man dug that sepulchre           and no man saw it eer           for the sons of god upturned the sod           and laid the dead man there  then joshua began his terrible raid and from jericho clear to this baalgad he swept the land like the genius of destruction  he slaughtered the people laid waste their soil and razed their cities to the ground he wasted thirtyone kings also  one may call it that though really it can hardly be called wasting them because there were always plenty of kings in those days and to spare  at any rate he destroyed thirtyone kings and divided up their realms among his israelites  he divided up this valley stretched out here before us and so it was once jewish territory  the jews have long since disappeared from it however  back yonder an hours journey from here we passed through an arab village of stone drygoods boxes they look like that where noahs tomb lies under lock and key  noah built the ark  over these old hills and valleys the ark that contained all that was left of a vanished world once floated  i make no apology for detailing the above information  it will be news to some of my readers at any rate  noahs tomb is built of stone and is covered with a long stone building bucksheesh let us in  the building had to be long because the grave of the honored old navigator is two hundred and ten feet long itself  it is only about four feet high though  he must have cast a shadow like a lightningrod  the proof that this is the genuine spot where noah was buried can only be doubted by uncommonly incredulous people  the evidence is pretty straight  shem the son of noah was present at the burial and showed the place to his descendants who transmitted the knowledge to their descendants and the lineal descendants of these introduced themselves to us today  it was pleasant to make the acquaintance of members of so respectable a family  it was a thing to be proud of  it was the next thing to being acquainted with noah himself  noahs memorable voyage will always possess a living interest for me henceforward  if ever an oppressed race existed it is this one we see fettered around us under the inhuman tyranny of the ottoman empire  i wish europe would let russia annihilate turkey a littlenot much but enough to make it difficult to find the place again without a diviningrod or a divingbell  the syrians are very poor and yet they are ground down by a system of taxation that would drive any other nation frantic  last year their taxes were heavy enough in all consciencebut this year they have been increased by the addition of taxes that were forgiven them in times of famine in former years  on top of this the government has levied a tax of onetenth of the whole proceeds of the land  this is only half the story  the pacha of a pachalic does not trouble himself with appointing taxcollectors  he figures up what all these taxes ought to amount to in a certain district  then he farms the collection out  he calls the rich men together the highest bidder gets the speculation pays the pacha on the spot and then sells out to smaller fry who sell in turn to a piratical horde of still smaller fry these latter compel the peasant to bring his little trifle of grain to the village at his own cost  it must be weighed the various taxes set apart and the remainder returned to the producer  but the collector delays this duty day after day while the producers family are perishing for bread at last the poor wretch who can not but understand the game says take a quartertake halftake twothirds if you will and let me go  it is a most outrageous state of things  these people are naturally goodhearted and intelligent and with education and liberty would be a happy and contented race  they often appeal to the stranger to know if the great world will not some day come to their relief and save them  the sultan has been lavishing money like water in england and paris but his subjects are suffering for it now  this fashion of camping out bewilders me  we have bootjacks and a bathtub now and yet all the mysteries the packmules carry are not revealed  what next     chapter xliii  we had a tedious ride of about five hours in the sun across the valley of lebanon  it proved to be not quite so much of a garden as it had seemed from the hillsides  it was a desert weedgrown waste littered thickly with stones the size of a mans fist  here and there the natives had scratched the ground and reared a sickly crop of grain but for the most part the valley was given up to a handful of shepherds whose flocks were doing what they honestly could to get a living but the chances were against them  we saw rude piles of stones standing near the roadside at intervals and recognized the custom of marking boundaries which obtained in jacobs time  there were no walls no fences no hedgesnothing to secure a mans possessions but these random heaps of stones  the israelites held them sacred in the old patriarchal times and these other arabs their lineal descendants do so likewise  an american of ordinary intelligence would soon widely extend his property at an outlay of mere manual labor performed at night under so loose a system of fencing as this  the plows these people use are simply a sharpened stick such as abraham plowed with and they still winnow their wheat as he didthey pile it on the housetop and then toss it by shovelfulls into the air until the wind has blown all the chaff away  they never invent any thing never learn any thing  we had a fine race of a mile with an arab perched on a camel  some of the horses were fast and made very good time but the camel scampered by them without any very great effort  the yelling and shouting and whipping and galloping of all parties interested made it an exhilarating exciting and particularly boisterous race  at eleven oclock our eyes fell upon the walls and columns of baalbec a noble ruin whose history is a sealed book  it has stood there for thousands of years the wonder and admiration of travelers but who built it or when it was built are questions that may never be answered  one thing is very sure though  such grandeur of design and such grace of execution as one sees in the temples of baalbec have not been equaled or even approached in any work of mens hands that has been built within twenty centuries past  the great temple of the sun the temple of jupiter and several smaller temples are clustered together in the midst of one of these miserable syrian villages and look strangely enough in such plebeian company these temples are built upon massive substructions that might support a world almost the materials used are blocks of stone as large as an omnibusvery few if any of them are smaller than a carpenters tool chestand these substructions are traversed by tunnels of masonry through which a train of cars might pass  with such foundations as these it is little wonder that baalbec has lasted so long  the temple of the sun is nearly three hundred feet long and one hundred and sixty feet wide  it had fiftyfour columns around it but only six are standing nowthe others lie broken at its base a confused and picturesque heap  the six columns are their bases corinthian capitals and entablatureand six more shapely columns do not exist  the columns and the entablature together are ninety feet higha prodigious altitude for shafts of stone to reach trulyand yet one only thinks of their beauty and symmetry when looking at them the pillars look slender and delicate the entablature with its elaborate sculpture looks like rich stuccowork  but when you have gazed aloft till your eyes are weary you glance at the great fragments of pillars among which you are standing and find that they are eight feet through and with them lie beautiful capitals apparently as large as a small cottage and also single slabs of stone superbly sculptured that are four or five feet thick and would completely cover the floor of any ordinary parlor  you wonder where these monstrous things came from and it takes some little time to satisfy yourself that the airy and graceful fabric that towers above your head is made up of their mates  it seems too preposterous  the temple of jupiter is a smaller ruin than the one i have been speaking of and yet is immense  it is in a tolerable state of preservation  one row of nine columns stands almost uninjured  they are sixtyfive feet high and support a sort of porch or roof which connects them with the roof of the building  this porchroof is composed of tremendous slabs of stone which are so finely sculptured on the under side that the work looks like a fresco from below  one or two of these slabs had fallen and again i wondered if the gigantic masses of carved stone that lay about me were no larger than those above my head  within the temple the ornamentation was elaborate and colossal  what a wonder of architectural beauty and grandeur this edifice must have been when it was new  and what a noble picture it and its statelier companion with the chaos of mighty fragments scattered about them yet makes in the moonlight  i can not conceive how those immense blocks of stone were ever hauled from the quarries or how they were ever raised to the dizzy heights they occupy in the temples  and yet these sculptured blocks are trifles in size compared with the roughhewn blocks that form the wide verandah or platform which surrounds the great temple  one stretch of that platform two hundred feet long is composed of blocks of stone as large and some of them larger than a streetcar  they surmount a wall about ten or twelve feet high  i thought those were large rocks but they sank into insignificance compared with those which formed another section of the platform  these were three in number and i thought that each of them was about as long as three street cars placed end to end though of course they are a third wider and a third higher than a street car perhaps two railway freight cars of the largest pattern placed end to end might better represent their size  in combined length these three stones stretch nearly two hundred feet they are thirteen feet square two of them are sixtyfour feet long each and the third is sixtynine they are built into the massive wall some twenty feet above the ground they are there but how they got there is the question  i have seen the hull of a steamboat that was smaller than one of those stones  all these great walls are as exact and shapely as the flimsy things we build of bricks in these days  a race of gods or of giants must have inhabited baalbec many a century ago  men like the men of our day could hardly rear such temples as these  we went to the quarry from whence the stones of baalbec were taken  it was about a quarter of a mile off and down hill  in a great pit lay the mate of the largest stone in the ruins  it lay there just as the giants of that old forgotten time had left it when they were called hencejust as they had left it to remain for thousands of years an eloquent rebuke unto such as are prone to think slightingly of the men who lived before them  this enormous block lies there squared and ready for the builders handsa solid mass fourteen feet by seventeen and but a few inches less than seventy feet long  two buggies could be driven abreast of each other on its surface from one end of it to the other and leave room enough for a man or two to walk on either side  one might swear that all the john smiths and george wilkinsons and all the other pitiful nobodies between kingdom come and baalbec would inscribe their poor little names upon the walls of baalbecs magnificent ruins and would add the town the county and the state they came from and swearing thus be infallibly correct  it is a pity some great ruin does not fall in and flatten out some of these reptiles and scare their kind out of ever giving their names to fame upon any walls or monuments again forever  properly with the sorry relics we bestrode it was a three days journey to damascus  it was necessary that we should do it in less than two it was necessary because our three pilgrims would not travel on the sabbath day  we were all perfectly willing to keep the sabbath day but there are times when to keep the letter of a sacred law whose spirit is righteous becomes a sin and this was a case in point  we pleaded for the tired illtreated horses and tried to show that their faithful service deserved kindness in return and their hard lot compassion  but when did ever selfrighteousness know the sentiment of pity  what were a few long hours added to the hardships of some overtaxed brutes when weighed against the peril of those human souls  it was not the most promising party to travel with and hope to gain a higher veneration for religion through the example of its devotees  we said the saviour who pitied dumb beasts and taught that the ox must be rescued from the mire even on the sabbath day would not have counseled a forced march like this  we said the long trip was exhausting and therefore dangerous in the blistering heats of summer even when the ordinary days stages were traversed and if we persisted in this hard march some of us might be stricken down with the fevers of the country in consequence of it nothing could move the pilgrims  they must press on  men might die horses might die but they must enter upon holy soil next week with no sabbathbreaking stain upon them  thus they were willing to commit a sin against the spirit of religious law in order that they might preserve the letter of it  it was not worth while to tell them the letter kills  i am talking now about personal friends men whom i like men who are good citizens who are honorable upright conscientious but whose idea of the saviours religion seems to me distorted  they lecture our shortcomings unsparingly and every night they call us together and read to us chapters from the testament that are full of gentleness of charity and of tender mercy and then all the next day they stick to their saddles clear up to the summits of these rugged mountains and clear down again  apply the testaments gentleness and charity and tender mercy to a toiling worn and weary horsenonsensethese are for gods human creatures not his dumb ones  what the pilgrims choose to do respect for their almost sacred character demands that i should allow to passbut i would so like to catch any other member of the party riding his horse up one of these exhausting hills once  we have given the pilgrims a good many examples that might benefit them but it is virtue thrown away  they have never heard a cross word out of our lips toward each otherbut they have quarreled once or twice  we love to hear them at it after they have been lecturing us  the very first thing they did coming ashore at beirout was to quarrel in the boat  i have said i like them and i do like thembut every time they read me a scorcher of a lecture i mean to talk back in print  not content with doubling the legitimate stages they switched off the main road and went away out of the way to visit an absurd fountain called figia because baalams ass had drank there once  so we journeyed on through the terrible hills and deserts and the roasting sun and then far into the night seeking the honored pool of baalams ass the patron saint of all pilgrims like us  i find no entry but this in my notebook       rode today altogether thirteen hours through deserts partly      and partly over barren unsightly hills and latterly through wild      rocky scenery and camped at about eleven oclock at night on the      banks of a limpid stream near a syrian village  do not know its      namedo not wish to know itwant to go to bed  two horses lame      mine and jacks and the others worn out  jack and i walked three      or four miles over the hills and led the horses  funbut of a      mild type  twelve or thirteen hours in the saddle even in a christian land and a christian climate and on a good horse is a tiresome journey but in an oven like syria in a ragged spoon of a saddle that slips foreandaft and thortships and every way and on a horse that is tired and lame and yet must be whipped and spurred with hardly a moments cessation all day long till the blood comes from his side and your conscience hurts you every time you strike if you are half a manit is a journey to be remembered in bitterness of spirit and execrated with emphasis for a liberal division of a mans lifetime     chapter xliv  the next day was an outrage upon men and horses both  it was another thirteenhour stretch including an hours nooning it was over the barrenest chalkhills and through the baldest canons that even syria can show  the heat quivered in the air every where  in the canons we almost smothered in the baking atmosphere  on high ground the reflection from the chalkhills was blinding  it was cruel to urge the crippled horses but it had to be done in order to make damascus saturday night  we saw ancient tombs and temples of fanciful architecture carved out of the solid rock high up in the face of precipices above our heads but we had neither time nor strength to climb up there and examine them  the terse language of my notebook will answer for the rest of this days experiences       broke camp at 7 am and made a ghastly trip through the zeb dana      valley and the rough mountainshorses limping and that arab      screechowl that does most of the singing and carries the      waterskins always a thousand miles ahead of course and no water      to drinkwill he never die  beautiful stream in a chasm lined      thick with pomegranate fig olive and quince orchards and nooned      an hour at the celebrated baalams ass fountain of figia second in      size in syria and the coldest water out of siberiaguidebooks do      not say baalams ass ever drank theresomebody been imposing on      the pilgrims may be  bathed in itjack and i  only a      secondicewater  it is the principal source of the abana river      only onehalf mile down to where it joins  beautiful      placegiant trees all aroundso shady and cool if one could keep      awakevast stream gushes straight out from under the mountain in a      torrent  over it is a very ancient ruin with no known history      supposed to have been for the worship of the deity of the fountain      or baalams ass or somebody  wretched nest of human vermin about      the fountainrags dirt sunken cheeks pallor of sickness sores      projecting bones dull aching misery in their eyes and ravenous      hunger speaking from every eloquent fibre and muscle from head to      foot how they sprang upon a bone how they crunched the bread we      gave them  such as these to swarm about one and watch every bite      he takes with greedy looks and swallow unconsciously every time      he swallows as if they half fancied the precious morsel went down      their own throatshurry up the caravani never shall enjoy a      meal in this distressful country  to think of eating three times      every day under such circumstances for three weeks yetit is worse      punishment than riding all day in the sun  there are sixteen      starving babies from one to six years old in the party and their      legs are no larger than broom handles  left the fountain at 1 pm      the fountain took us at least two hours out of our way and      reached mahomets lookout perch over damascus in time to get a      good long look before it was necessary to move on  tired  ask of      the winds that far away with fragments strewed the sea  as the glare of day mellowed into twilight we looked down upon a picture which is celebrated all over the world  i think i have read about four hundred times that when mahomet was a simple cameldriver he reached this point and looked down upon damascus for the first time and then made a certain renowned remark  he said man could enter only one paradise he preferred to go to the one above  so he sat down there and feasted his eyes upon the earthly paradise of damascus and then went away without entering its gates  they have erected a tower on the hill to mark the spot where he stood  damascus is beautiful from the mountain  it is beautiful even to foreigners accustomed to luxuriant vegetation and i can easily understand how unspeakably beautiful it must be to eyes that are only used to the godforsaken barrenness and desolation of syria  i should think a syrian would go wild with ecstacy when such a picture bursts upon him for the first time  from his high perch one sees before him and below him a wall of dreary mountains shorn of vegetation glaring fiercely in the sun it fences in a level desert of yellow sand smooth as velvet and threaded far away with fine lines that stand for roads and dotted with creeping mites we know are cameltrains and journeying men right in the midst of the desert is spread a billowy expanse of green foliage and nestling in its heart sits the great white city like an island of pearls and opals gleaming out of a sea of emeralds  this is the picture you see spread far below you with distance to soften it the sun to glorify it strong contrasts to heighten the effects and over it and about it a drowsing air of repose to spiritualize it and make it seem rather a beautiful estray from the mysterious worlds we visit in dreams than a substantial tenant of our coarse dull globe  and when you think of the leagues of blighted blasted sandy rocky sunburnt ugly dreary infamous country you have ridden over to get here you think it is the most beautiful beautiful picture that ever human eyes rested upon in all the broad universe  if i were to go to damascus again i would camp on mahomets hill about a week and then go away  there is no need to go inside the walls  the prophet was wise without knowing it when he decided not to go down into the paradise of damascus  there is an honored old tradition that the immense garden which damascus stands in was the garden of eden and modern writers have gathered up many chapters of evidence tending to show that it really was the garden of eden and that the rivers pharpar and abana are the two rivers that watered adams paradise  it may be so but it is not paradise now and one would be as happy outside of it as he would be likely to be within it is so crooked and cramped and dirty that one can not realize that he is in the splendid city he saw from the hilltop  the gardens are hidden by high mudwalls and the paradise is become a very sink of pollution and uncomeliness  damascus has plenty of clear pure water in it though and this is enough of itself to make an arab think it beautiful and blessed  water is scarce in blistered syria  we run railways by our large cities in america in syria they curve the roads so as to make them run by the meagre little puddles they call fountains and which are not found oftener on a journey than every four hours  but the rivers of pharpar and abana of scripture mere creeks run through damascus and so every house and every garden have their sparkling fountains and rivulets of water  with her forest of foliage and her abundance of water damascus must be a wonder of wonders to the bedouin from the deserts  damascus is simply an oasisthat is what it is  for four thousand years its waters have not gone dry or its fertility failed now we can understand why the city has existed so long  it could not die  so long as its waters remain to it away out there in the midst of that howling desert so long will damascus live to bless the sight of the tired and thirsty wayfarer       though old as history itself thou art fresh as the breath of      spring blooming as thine own rosebud and fragrant as thine own      orange flower o damascus pearl of the east  damascus dates back anterior to the days of abraham and is the oldest city in the world  it was founded by uz the grandson of noah  the early history of damascus is shrouded in the mists of a hoary antiquity leave the matters written of in the first eleven chapters of the old testament out and no recorded event has occurred in the world but damascus was in existence to receive the news of it  go back as far as you will into the vague past there was always a damascus  in the writings of every century for more than four thousand years its name has been mentioned and its praises sung  to damascus years are only moments decades are only flitting trifles of time  she measures time not by days and months and years but by the empires she has seen rise and prosper and crumble to ruin  she is a type of immortality  she saw the foundations of baalbec and thebes and ephesus laid she saw these villages grow into mighty cities and amaze the world with their grandeurand she has lived to see them desolate deserted and given over to the owls and the bats  she saw the israelitish empire exalted and she saw it annihilated  she saw greece rise and flourish two thousand years and die  in her old age she saw rome built she saw it overshadow the world with its power she saw it perish  the few hundreds of years of genoese and venetian might and splendor were to grave old damascus only a trifling scintillation hardly worth remembering damascus has seen all that has ever occurred on earth and still she lives  she has looked upon the dry bones of a thousand empires and will see the tombs of a thousand more before she dies  though another claims the name old damascus is by right the eternal city  we reached the city gates just at sundown  they do say that one can get into any walled city of syria after night for bucksheesh except damascus  but damascus with its four thousand years of respectability in the world has many old fogy notions  there are no street lamps there and the law compels all who go abroad at night to carry lanterns just as was the case in old days when heroes and heroines of the arabian nights walked the streets of damascus or flew away toward bagdad on enchanted carpets  it was fairly dark a few minutes after we got within the wall and we rode long distances through wonderfully crooked streets eight to ten feet wide and shut in on either side by the high mudwalls of the gardens  at last we got to where lanterns could be seen flitting about here and there and knew we were in the midst of the curious old city in a little narrow street crowded with our packmules and with a swarm of uncouth arabs we alighted and through a kind of a hole in the wall entered the hotel  we stood in a great flagged court with flowers and citron trees about us and a huge tank in the centre that was receiving the waters of many pipes  we crossed the court and entered the rooms prepared to receive four of us  in a large marblepaved recess between the two rooms was a tank of clear cool water which was kept running over all the time by the streams that were pouring into it from half a dozen pipes  nothing in this scorching desolate land could look so refreshing as this pure water flashing in the lamplight nothing could look so beautiful nothing could sound so delicious as this mimic rain to ears long unaccustomed to sounds of such a nature  our rooms were large comfortably furnished and even had their floors clothed with soft cheerfultinted carpets  it was a pleasant thing to see a carpet again for if there is any thing drearier than the tomblike stonepaved parlors and bedrooms of europe and asia i do not know what it is they make one think of the grave all the time  a very broad gaily caparisoned divan some twelve or fourteen feet long extended across one side of each room and opposite were single beds with spring mattresses there were great lookingglasses and marbletop tables  all this luxury was as grateful to systems and senses worn out with an exhausting days travel as it was unexpectedfor one can not tell what to expect in a turkish city of even a quarter of a million inhabitants  i do not know but i think they used that tank between the rooms to draw drinking water from that did not occur to me however until i had dipped my baking head far down into its cool depths  i thought of it then and superb as the bath was i was sorry i had taken it and was about to go and explain to the landlord  but a finely curled and scented poodle dog frisked up and nipped the calf of my leg just then and before i had time to think i had soused him to the bottom of the tank and when i saw a servant coming with a pitcher i went off and left the pup trying to climb out and not succeeding very well  satisfied revenge was all i needed to make me perfectly happy and when i walked in to supper that first night in damascus i was in that condition  we lay on those divans a long time after supper smoking narghilies and longstemmed chibouks and talking about the dreadful ride of the day and i knew then what i had sometimes known beforethat it is worth while to get tired out because one so enjoys resting afterward  in the morning we sent for donkeys  it is worthy of note that we had to send for these things  i said damascus was an old fossil and she is any where else we would have been assailed by a clamorous army of donkeydrivers guides peddlers and beggarsbut in damascus they so hate the very sight of a foreign christian that they want no intercourse whatever with him only a year or two ago his person was not always safe in damascus streets  it is the most fanatical mohammedan purgatory out of arabia  where you see one green turban of a hadji elsewhere the honored sign that my lord has made the pilgrimage to mecca i think you will see a dozen in damascus  the damascenes are the ugliest wickedest looking villains we have seen  all the veiled women we had seen yet nearly left their eyes exposed but numbers of these in damascus completely hid the face under a closedrawn black veil that made the woman look like a mummy  if ever we caught an eye exposed it was quickly hidden from our contaminating christian vision the beggars actually passed us by without demanding bucksheesh the merchants in the bazaars did not hold up their goods and cry out eagerly hey john or look this howajji  on the contrary they only scowled at us and said never a word  the narrow streets swarmed like a hive with men and women in strange oriental costumes and our small donkeys knocked them right and left as we plowed through them urged on by the merciless donkeyboys  these persecutors run after the animals shouting and goading them for hours together they keep the donkey in a gallop always yet never get tired themselves or fall behind  the donkeys fell down and spilt us over their heads occasionally but there was nothing for it but to mount and hurry on again  we were banged against sharp corners loaded porters camels and citizens generally and we were so taken up with looking out for collisions and casualties that we had no chance to look about us at all we rode half through the city and through the famous street which is called straight without seeing any thing hardly  our bones were nearly knocked out of joint we were wild with excitement and our sides ached with the jolting we had suffered  i do not like riding in the damascus streetcars  we were on our way to the reputed houses of judas and ananias  about eighteen or nineteen hundred years ago saul a native of tarsus was particularly bitter against the new sect called christians and he left jerusalem and started across the country on a furious crusade against them  he went forth breathing threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord       and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there      shined round about him a light from heaven       and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul      saul why persecutest thou me       and when he knew that it was jesus that spoke to him he trembled      and was astonished and said lord what wilt thou have me to do  he was told to arise and go into the ancient city and one would tell him what to do  in the meantime his soldiers stood speechless and awestricken for they heard the mysterious voice but saw no man  saul rose up and found that that fierce supernatural light had destroyed his sight and he was blind so they led him by the hand and brought him to damascus  he was converted  paul lay three days blind in the house of judas and during that time he neither ate nor drank  there came a voice to a citizen of damascus named ananias saying arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquire at the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth  ananias did not wish to go at first for he had heard of saul before and he had his doubts about that style of a chosen vessel to preach the gospel of peace  however in obedience to orders he went into the street called straight how he found his way into it and after he did how he ever found his way out of it again are mysteries only to be accounted for by the fact that he was acting under divine inspiration he found paul and restored him and ordained him a preacher and from this old house we had hunted up in the street which is miscalled straight he had started out on that bold missionary career which he prosecuted till his death  it was not the house of the disciple who sold the master for thirty pieces of silver  i make this explanation in justice to judas who was a far different sort of man from the person just referred to  a very different style of man and lived in a very good house  it is a pity we do not know more about him  i have given in the above paragraphs some more information for people who will not read bible history until they are defrauded into it by some such method as this  i hope that no friend of progress and education will obstruct or interfere with my peculiar mission  the street called straight is straighter than a corkscrew but not as straight as a rainbow  st luke is careful not to commit himself he does not say it is the street which is straight but the street which is called straight  it is a fine piece of irony it is the only facetious remark in the bible i believe  we traversed the street called straight a good way and then turned off and called at the reputed house of ananias  there is small question that a part of the original house is there still it is an old room twelve or fifteen feet under ground and its masonry is evidently ancient  if ananias did not live there in st pauls time somebody else did which is just as well  i took a drink out of ananias well and singularly enough the water was just as fresh as if the well had been dug yesterday  we went out toward the north end of the city to see the place where the disciples let paul down over the damascus wall at dead of nightfor he preached christ so fearlessly in damascus that the people sought to kill him just as they would today for the same offense and he had to escape and flee to jerusalem  then we called at the tomb of mahomets children and at a tomb which purported to be that of st george who killed the dragon and so on out to the hollow place under a rock where paul hid during his flight till his pursuers gave him up and to the mausoleum of the five thousand christians who were massacred in damascus in 1861 by the turks  they say those narrow streets ran blood for several days and that men women and children were butchered indiscriminately and left to rot by hundreds all through the christian quarter they say further that the stench was dreadful  all the christians who could get away fled from the city and the mohammedans would not defile their hands by burying the infidel dogs  the thirst for blood extended to the high lands of hermon and antilebanon and in a short time twentyfive thousand more christians were massacred and their possessions laid waste  how they hate a christian in damascusand pretty much all over turkeydom as well  and how they will pay for it when russia turns her guns upon them again  it is soothing to the heart to abuse england and france for interposing to save the ottoman empire from the destruction it has so richly deserved for a thousand years  it hurts my vanity to see these pagans refuse to eat of food that has been cooked for us or to eat from a dish we have eaten from or to drink from a goatskin which we have polluted with our christian lips except by filtering the water through a rag which they put over the mouth of it or through a sponge  i never disliked a chinaman as i do these degraded turks and arabs and when russia is ready to war with them again i hope england and france will not find it good breeding or good judgment to interfere  in damascus they think there are no such rivers in all the world as their little abana and pharpar  the damascenes have always thought that way in 2 kings chapter v naaman boasts extravagantly about them  that was three thousand years ago  he says are not abana and pharpar rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel  may i not wash in them and be clean  but some of my readers have forgotten who naaman was long ago  naaman was the commander of the syrian armies  he was the favorite of the king and lived in great state  he was a mighty man of valor but he was a leper  strangely enough the house they point out to you now as his has been turned into a leper hospital and the inmates expose their horrid deformities and hold up their hands and beg for bucksheesh when a stranger enters  one can not appreciate the horror of this disease until he looks upon it in all its ghastliness in naamans ancient dwelling in damascus  bones all twisted out of shape great knots protruding from face and body joints decaying and dropping awayhorrible     chapter xlv  the last twentyfour hours we staid in damascus i lay prostrate with a violent attack of cholera or cholera morbus and therefore had a good chance and a good excuse to lie there on that wide divan and take an honest rest  i had nothing to do but listen to the pattering of the fountains and take medicine and throw it up again  it was dangerous recreation but it was pleasanter than traveling in syria  i had plenty of snow from mount hermon and as it would not stay on my stomach there was nothing to interfere with my eating itthere was always room for more  i enjoyed myself very well  syrian travel has its interesting features like travel in any other part of the world and yet to break your leg or have the cholera adds a welcome variety to it  we left damascus at noon and rode across the plain a couple of hours and then the party stopped a while in the shade of some figtrees to give me a chance to rest  it was the hottest day we had seen yetthe sunflames shot down like the shafts of fire that stream out before a blowpipethe rays seemed to fall in a steady deluge on the head and pass downward like rain from a roof  i imagined i could distinguish between the floods of raysi thought i could tell when each flood struck my head when it reached my shoulders and when the next one came  it was terrible  all the desert glared so fiercely that my eyes were swimming in tears all the time  the boys had white umbrellas heavily lined with dark green  they were a priceless blessing  i thanked fortune that i had one too notwithstanding it was packed up with the baggage and was ten miles ahead  it is madness to travel in syria without an umbrella  they told me in beirout these people who always gorge you with advice that it was madness to travel in syria without an umbrella  it was on this account that i got one  but honestly i think an umbrella is a nuisance any where when its business is to keep the sun off  no arab wears a brim to his fez or uses an umbrella or any thing to shade his eyes or his face and he always looks comfortable and proper in the sun  but of all the ridiculous sights i ever have seen our party of eight is the most so they do cut such an outlandish figure  they travel single file they all wear the endless white rag of constantinople wrapped round and round their hats and dangling down their backs they all wear thick green spectacles with sideglasses to them they all hold white umbrellas lined with green over their heads without exception their stirrups are too shortthey are the very worst gang of horsemen on earth their animals to a horse trot fearfully hardand when they get strung out one after the other glaring straight ahead and breathless bouncing high and out of turn all along the line knees well up and stiff elbows flapping like a roosters that is going to crow and the long file of umbrellas popping convulsively up and downwhen one sees this outrageous picture exposed to the light of day he is amazed that the gods dont get out their thunderbolts and destroy them off the face of the earth  i doi wonder at it  i wouldnt let any such caravan go through a country of mine  and when the sun drops below the horizon and the boys close their umbrellas and put them under their arms it is only a variation of the picture not a modification of its absurdity  but may be you can not see the wild extravagance of my panorama  you could if you were here  here you feel all the time just as if you were living about the year 1200 before christor back to the patriarchsor forward to the new era  the scenery of the bible is about youthe customs of the patriarchs are around youthe same people in the same flowing robes and in sandals cross your paththe same long trains of stately camels go and comethe same impressive religious solemnity and silence rest upon the desert and the mountains that were upon them in the remote ages of antiquity and behold intruding upon a scene like this comes this fantastic mob of greenspectacled yanks with their flapping elbows and bobbing umbrellas  it is daniel in the lions den with a green cotton umbrella under his arm all over again  my umbrella is with the baggage and so are my green spectaclesand there they shall stay  i will not use them  i will show some respect for the eternal fitness of things  it will be bad enough to get sunstruck without looking ridiculous into the bargain  if i fall let me fall bearing about me the semblance of a christian at least  three or four hours out from damascus we passed the spot where saul was so abruptly converted and from this place we looked back over the scorching desert and had our last glimpse of beautiful damascus decked in its robes of shining green  after nightfall we reached our tents just outside of the nasty arab village of jonesborough  of course the real name of the place is el something or other but the boys still refuse to recognize the arab names or try to pronounce them  when i say that that village is of the usual style i mean to insinuate that all syrian villages within fifty miles of damascus are alikeso much alike that it would require more than human intelligence to tell wherein one differed from another  a syrian village is a hive of huts one story high the height of a man and as square as a drygoods box it is mudplastered all over flat roof and all and generally whitewashed after a fashion  the same roof often extends over half the town covering many of the streets which are generally about a yard wide when you ride through one of these villages at noonday you first meet a melancholy dog that looks up at you and silently begs that you wont run over him but he does not offer to get out of the way next you meet a young boy without any clothes on and he holds out his hand and says bucksheeshhe dont really expect a cent but then he learned to say that before he learned to say mother and now he can not break himself of it next you meet a woman with a black veil drawn closely over her face and her bust exposed finally you come to several soreeyed children and children in all stages of mutilation and decay and sitting humbly in the dust and all fringed with filthy rags is a poor devil whose arms and legs are gnarled and twisted like grapevines these are all the people you are likely to see  the balance of the population are asleep within doors or abroad tending goats in the plains and on the hillsides  the village is built on some consumptive little watercourse and about it is a little freshlooking vegetation beyond this charmed circle for miles on every side stretches a weary desert of sand and gravel which produces a gray bunchy shrub like sagebrush  a syrian village is the sorriest sight in the world and its surroundings are eminently in keeping with it  i would not have gone into this dissertation upon syrian villages but for the fact that nimrod the mighty hunter of scriptural notoriety is buried in jonesborough and i wished the public to know about how he is located  like homer he is said to be buried in many other places but this is the only true and genuine place his ashes inhabit  when the original tribes were dispersed more than four thousand years ago nimrod and a large party traveled three or four hundred miles and settled where the great city of babylon afterwards stood  nimrod built that city  he also began to build the famous tower of babel but circumstances over which he had no control put it out of his power to finish it  he ran it up eight stories high however and two of them still stand at this daya colossal mass of brickwork rent down the centre by earthquakes and seared and vitrified by the lightnings of an angry god  but the vast ruin will still stand for ages to shame the puny labors of these modern generations of men  its huge compartments are tenanted by owls and lions and old nimrod lies neglected in this wretched village far from the scene of his grand enterprise  we left jonesborough very early in the morning and rode forever and forever and forever it seemed to me over parched deserts and rocky hills hungry and with no water to drink  we had drained the goatskins dry in a little while  at noon we halted before the wretched arab town of el yuba dam perched on the side of a mountain but the dragoman said if we applied there for water we would be attacked by the whole tribe for they did not love christians  we had to journey on  two hours later we reached the foot of a tall isolated mountain which is crowned by the crumbling castle of banias the stateliest ruin of that kind on earth no doubt  it is a thousand feet long and two hundred wide all of the most symmetrical and at the same time the most ponderous masonry  the massive towers and bastions are more than thirty feet high and have been sixty  from the mountains peak its broken turrets rise above the groves of ancient oaks and olives and look wonderfully picturesque  it is of such high antiquity that no man knows who built it or when it was built it is utterly inaccessible except in one place where a bridlepath winds upward among the solid rocks to the old portcullis  the horses hoofs have bored holes in these rocks to the depth of six inches during the hundreds and hundreds of years that the castle was garrisoned  we wandered for three hours among the chambers and crypts and dungeons of the fortress and trod where the mailed heels of many a knightly crusader had rang and where phenician heroes had walked ages before them  we wondered how such a solid mass of masonry could be affected even by an earthquake and could not understand what agency had made banias a ruin but we found the destroyer after a while and then our wonder was increased tenfold  seeds had fallen in crevices in the vast walls the seeds had sprouted the tender insignificant sprouts had hardened they grew larger and larger and by a steady imperceptible pressure forced the great stones apart and now are bringing sure destruction upon a giant work that has even mocked the earthquakes to scorn  gnarled and twisted trees spring from the old walls every where and beautify and overshadow the gray battlements with a wild luxuriance of foliage  from these old towers we looked down upon a broad farreaching green plain glittering with the pools and rivulets which are the sources of the sacred river jordan  it was a grateful vision after so much desert  and as the evening drew near we clambered down the mountain through groves of the biblical oaks of bashan for we were just stepping over the border and entering the longsought holy land and at its extreme foot toward the wide valley we entered this little execrable village of banias and camped in a great grove of olive trees near a torrent of sparkling water whose banks are arrayed in figtrees pomegranates and oleanders in full leaf  barring the proximity of the village it is a sort of paradise  the very first thing one feels like doing when he gets into camp all burning up and dusty is to hunt up a bath  we followed the stream up to where it gushes out of the mountain side three hundred yards from the tents and took a bath that was so icy that if i did not know this was the main source of the sacred river i would expect harm to come of it it was bathing at noonday in the chilly source of the abana river of damascus that gave me the cholera so dr b  said  however it generally does give me the cholera to take a bath  the incorrigible pilgrims have come in with their pockets full of specimens broken from the ruins  i wish this vandalism could be stopped they broke off fragments from noahs tomb from the exquisite sculptures of the temples of baalbec from the houses of judas and ananias in damascus from the tomb of nimrod the mighty hunter in jonesborough from the worn greek and roman inscriptions set in the hoary walls of the castle of banias and now they have been hacking and chipping these old arches here that jesus looked upon in the flesh  heaven protect the sepulchre when this tribe invades jerusalem  the ruins here are not very interesting  there are the massive walls of a great square building that was once the citadel there are many ponderous old arches that are so smothered with debris that they barely project above the ground there are heavywalled sewers through which the crystal brook of which jordan is born still runs in the hillside are the substructions of a costly marble temple that herod the great built herepatches of its handsome mosaic floors still remain there is a quaint old stone bridge that was here before herods time may be scattered every where in the paths and in the woods are corinthian capitals broken porphyry pillars and little fragments of sculpture and up yonder in the precipice where the fountain gushes out are wellworn greek inscriptions over niches in the rock where in ancient times the greeks and after them the romans worshipped the sylvan god pan  but trees and bushes grow above many of these ruins now the miserable huts of a little crew of filthy arabs are perched upon the broken masonry of antiquity the whole place has a sleepy stupid rural look about it and one can hardly bring himself to believe that a busy substantially built city once existed here even two thousand years ago  the place was nevertheless the scene of an event whose effects have added page after page and volume after volume to the worlds history  for in this place christ stood when he said to peter       thou art peter and upon this rock will i build my church and the      gates of hell shall not prevail against it  and i will give unto      thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt      bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt      loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven  on those little sentences have been built up the mighty edifice of the church of rome in them lie the authority for the imperial power of the popes over temporal affairs and their godlike power to curse a soul or wash it white from sin  to sustain the position of the only true church which rome claims was thus conferred upon her she has fought and labored and struggled for many a century and will continue to keep herself busy in the same work to the end of time  the memorable words i have quoted give to this ruined city about all the interest it possesses to people of the present day  it seems curious enough to us to be standing on ground that was once actually pressed by the feet of the saviour  the situation is suggestive of a reality and a tangibility that seem at variance with the vagueness and mystery and ghostliness that one naturally attaches to the character of a god  i can not comprehend yet that i am sitting where a god has stood and looking upon the brook and the mountains which that god looked upon and am surrounded by dusky men and women whose ancestors saw him and even talked with him face to face and carelessly just as they would have done with any other stranger  i can not comprehend this the gods of my understanding have been always hidden in clouds and very far away  this morning during breakfast the usual assemblage of squalid humanity sat patiently without the charmed circle of the camp and waited for such crumbs as pity might bestow upon their misery  there were old and young brownskinned and yellow  some of the men were tall and stalwart for one hardly sees any where such splendidlooking men as here in the east but all the women and children looked worn and sad and distressed with hunger  they reminded me much of indians did these people  they had but little clothing but such as they had was fanciful in character and fantastic in its arrangement  any little absurd gewgaw or gimcrack they had they disposed in such a way as to make it attract attention most readily  they sat in silence and with tireless patience watched our every motion with that vile uncomplaining impoliteness which is so truly indian and which makes a white man so nervous and uncomfortable and savage that he wants to exterminate the whole tribe  these people about us had other peculiarities which i have noticed in the noble red man too they were infested with vermin and the dirt had caked on them till it amounted to bark  the little children were in a pitiable conditionthey all had sore eyes and were otherwise afflicted in various ways  they say that hardly a native child in all the east is free from sore eyes and that thousands of them go blind of one eye or both every year  i think this must be so for i see plenty of blind people every day and i do not remember seeing any children that hadnt sore eyes  and would you suppose that an american mother could sit for an hour with her child in her arms and let a hundred flies roost upon its eyes all that time undisturbed  i see that every day  it makes my flesh creep  yesterday we met a woman riding on a little jackass and she had a little child in her arms honestly i thought the child had goggles on as we approached and i wondered how its mother could afford so much style  but when we drew near we saw that the goggles were nothing but a camp meeting of flies assembled around each of the childs eyes and at the same time there was a detachment prospecting its nose  the flies were happy the child was contented and so the mother did not interfere  as soon as the tribe found out that we had a doctor in our party they began to flock in from all quarters  dr b in the charity of his nature had taken a child from a woman who sat near by and put some sort of a wash upon its diseased eyes  that woman went off and started the whole nation and it was a sight to see them swarm  the lame the halt the blind the leprousall the distempers that are bred of indolence dirt and iniquitywere represented in the congress in ten minutes and still they came  every woman that had a sick baby brought it along and every woman that hadnt borrowed one  what reverent and what worshiping looks they bent upon that dread mysterious power the doctor  they watched him take his phials out they watched him measure the particles of white powder they watched him add drops of one precious liquid and drops of another they lost not the slightest movement their eyes were riveted upon him with a fascination that nothing could distract i believe they thought he was gifted like a god  when each individual got his portion of medicine his eyes were radiant with joy notwithstanding by nature they are a thankless and impassive raceand upon his face was written the unquestioning faith that nothing on earth could prevent the patient from getting well now  christ knew how to preach to these simple superstitious diseasetortured creatures he healed the sick  they flocked to our poor human doctor this morning when the fame of what he had done to the sick child went abroad in the land and they worshiped him with their eyes while they did not know as yet whether there was virtue in his simples or not the ancestors of thesepeople precisely like them in color dress manners customs simplicityflocked in vast multitudes after christ and when they saw him make the afflicted whole with a word it is no wonder they worshiped him  no wonder his deeds were the talk of the nation  no wonder the multitude that followed him was so great that at one timethirty miles from herethey had to let a sick man down through the roof because no approach could be made to the door no wonder his audiences were so great at galilee that he had to preach from a ship removed a little distance from the shore no wonder that even in the desert places about bethsaida five thousand invaded his solitude and he had to feed them by a miracle or else see them suffer for their confiding faith and devotion no wonder when there was a great commotion in a city in those days one neighbor explained it to another in words to this effect they say that jesus of nazareth is come  well as i was saying the doctor distributed medicine as long as he had any to distribute and his reputation is mighty in galilee this day among his patients was the child of the shieks daughterfor even this poor ragged handful of sores and sin has its royal shieka poor old mummy that looked as if he would be more at home in a poorhouse than in the chief magistracy of this tribe of hopeless shirtless savages  the princessi mean the shieks daughterwas only thirteen or fourteen years old and had a very sweet face and a pretty one  she was the only syrian female we have seen yet who was not so sinfully ugly that she couldnt smile after ten oclock saturday night without breaking the sabbath  her child was a hard specimen thoughthere wasnt enough of it to make a pie and the poor little thing looked so pleadingly up at all who came near it as if it had an idea that now was its chance or never that we were filled with compassion which was genuine and not put on  but this last new horse i have got is trying to break his neck over the tentropes and i shall have to go out and anchor him  jericho and i have parted company  the new horse is not much to boast of i think one of his hind legs bends the wrong way and the other one is as straight and stiff as a tentpole  most of his teeth are gone and he is as blind as bat  his nose has been broken at some time or other and is arched like a culvert now  his under lip hangs down like a camels and his ears are chopped off close to his head  i had some trouble at first to find a name for him but i finally concluded to call him baalbec because he is such a magnificent ruin  i can not keep from talking about my horses because i have a very long and tedious journey before me and they naturally occupy my thoughts about as much as matters of apparently much greater importance  we satisfied our pilgrims by making those hard rides from baalbec to damascus but dans horse and jacks were so crippled we had to leave them behind and get fresh animals for them  the dragoman says jacks horse died  i swapped horses with mohammed the kinglylooking egyptian who is our fergusons lieutenant  by ferguson i mean our dragoman abraham of course  i did not take this horse on account of his personal appearance but because i have not seen his back  i do not wish to see it  i have seen the backs of all the other horses and found most of them covered with dreadful saddleboils which i know have not been washed or doctored for years  the idea of riding all day long over such ghastly inquisitions of torture is sickening  my horse must be like the others but i have at least the consolation of not knowing it to be so  i hope that in future i may be spared any more sentimental praises of the arabs idolatry of his horse  in boyhood i longed to be an arab of the desert and have a beautiful mare and call her selim or benjamin or mohammed and feed her with my own hands and let her come into the tent and teach her to caress me and look fondly upon me with her great tender eyes and i wished that a stranger might come at such a time and offer me a hundred thousand dollars for her so that i could do like the other arabshesitate yearn for the money but overcome by my love for my mare at last say part with thee my beautiful one  never with my life  away tempter i scorn thy gold  and then bound into the saddle and speed over the desert like the wind  but i recall those aspirations  if these arabs be like the other arabs their love for their beautiful mares is a fraud  these of my acquaintance have no love for their horses no sentiment of pity for them and no knowledge of how to treat them or care for them  the syrian saddleblanket is a quilted mattress two or three inches thick  it is never removed from the horse day or night  it gets full of dirt and hair and becomes soaked with sweat  it is bound to breed sores  these pirates never think of washing a horses back  they do not shelter the horses in the tents eitherthey must stay out and take the weather as it comes  look at poor cropped and dilapidated baalbec and weep for the sentiment that has been wasted upon the selims of romance     chapter xlvi  about an hours ride over a rough rocky road half flooded with water and through a forest of oaks of bashan brought us to dan  from a little mound here in the plain issues a broad stream of limpid water and forms a large shallow pool and then rushes furiously onward augmented in volume  this puddle is an important source of the jordan its banks and those of the brook are respectably adorned with blooming oleanders but the unutterable beauty of the spot will not throw a wellbalanced man into convulsions as the syrian books of travel would lead one to suppose  from the spot i am speaking of a cannonball would carry beyond the confines of holy land and light upon profane ground three miles away we were only one little hours travel within the borders of holy landwe had hardly begun to appreciate yet that we were standing upon any different sort of earth than that we had always been used to and see how the historic names began already to cluster  danbashanlake huleh the sources of jordanthe sea of galilee  they were all in sight but the last and it was not far away  the little township of bashan was once the kingdom so famous in scripture for its bulls and its oaks lake huleh is the biblical waters of merom  dan was the northern and beersheba the southern limit of palestinehence the expression from dan to beersheba  it is equivalent to our phrases from maine to texas from baltimore to san francisco  our expression and that of the israelites both mean the samegreat distance  with their slow camels and asses it was about a seven days journey from dan to beershebasay a hundred and fifty or sixty milesit was the entire length of their country and was not to be undertaken without great preparation and much ceremony  when the prodigal traveled to a far country it is not likely that he went more than eighty or ninety miles  palestine is only from forty to sixty miles wide  the state of missouri could be split into three palestines and there would then be enough material left for part of anotherpossibly a whole one  from baltimore to san francisco is several thousand miles but it will be only a seven days journey in the cars when i am two or three years olderthe railroad has been completed since the above was writtenif i live i shall necessarily have to go across the continent every now and then in those cars but one journey from dan to beersheba will be sufficient no doubt  it must be the most trying of the two  therefore if we chance to discover that from dan to beersheba seemed a mighty stretch of country to the israelites let us not be airy with them but reflect that it was and is a mighty stretch when one can not traverse it by rail  the small mound i have mentioned a while ago was once occupied by the phenician city of laish  a party of filibusters from zorah and eschol captured the place and lived there in a free and easy way worshiping gods of their own manufacture and stealing idols from their neighbors whenever they wore their own out  jeroboam set up a golden calf here to fascinate his people and keep them from making dangerous trips to jerusalem to worship which might result in a return to their rightful allegiance  with all respect for those ancient israelites i can not overlook the fact that they were not always virtuous enough to withstand the seductions of a golden calf  human nature has not changed much since then  some forty centuries ago the city of sodom was pillaged by the arab princes of mesopotamia and among other prisoners they seized upon the patriarch lot and brought him here on their way to their own possessions they brought him to dan and father abraham who was pursuing them crept softly in at dead of night among the whispering oleanders and under the shadows of the stately oaks and fell upon the slumbering victors and startled them from their dreams with the clash of steel  he recaptured lot and all the other plunder  we moved on  we were now in a green valley five or six miles wide and fifteen long  the streams which are called the sources of the jordan flow through it to lake huleh a shallow pond three miles in diameter and from the southern extremity of the lake the concentrated jordan flows out  the lake is surrounded by a broad marsh grown with reeds  between the marsh and the mountains which wall the valley is a respectable strip of fertile land at the end of the valley toward dan as much as half the land is solid and fertile and watered by jordans sources  there is enough of it to make a farm  it almost warrants the enthusiasm of the spies of that rabble of adventurers who captured dan  they said we have seen the land and behold it is very good      a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth  their enthusiasm was at least warranted by the fact that they had never seen a country as good as this  there was enough of it for the ample support of their six hundred men and their families too  when we got fairly down on the level part of the danite farm we came to places where we could actually run our horses  it was a notable circumstance  we had been painfully clambering over interminable hills and rocks for days together and when we suddenly came upon this astonishing piece of rockless plain every man drove the spurs into his horse and sped away with a velocity he could surely enjoy to the utmost but could never hope to comprehend in syria  here were evidences of cultivationa rare sight in this countryan acre or two of rich soil studded with last seasons dead cornstalks of the thickness of your thumb and very wide apart  but in such a land it was a thrilling spectacle  close to it was a stream and on its banks a great herd of curiouslooking syrian goats and sheep were gratefully eating gravel  i do not state this as a petrified facti only suppose they were eating gravel because there did not appear to be any thing else for them to eat  the shepherds that tended them were the very pictures of joseph and his brethren i have no doubt in the world  they were tall muscular and very darkskinned bedouins with inky black beards  they had firm lips unquailing eyes and a kingly stateliness of bearing they wore the particolored half bonnet half hood with fringed ends falling upon their shoulders and the full flowing robe barred with broad black stripesthe dress one sees in all pictures of the swarthy sons of the desert  these chaps would sell their younger brothers if they had a chance i think  they have the manners the customs the dress the occupation and the loose principles of the ancient stock they attacked our camp last night and i bear them no good will they had with them the pigmy jackasses one sees all over syria and remembers in all pictures of the flight into egypt where mary and the young child are riding and joseph is walking alongside towering high above the little donkeys shoulders  but really here the man rides and carries the child as a general thing and the woman walks  the customs have not changed since josephs time we would not have in our houses a picture representing joseph riding and mary walking we would see profanation in it but a syrian christian would not  i know that hereafter the picture i first spoke of will look odd to me  we could not stop to rest two or three hours out from our camp of course albeit the brook was beside us  so we went on an hour longer we saw water then but nowhere in all the waste around was there a foot of shade and we were scorching to death  like unto the shadow of a great rock in a weary land  nothing in the bible is more beautiful than that and surely there is no place we have wandered to that is able to give it such touching expression as this blistering naked treeless land  here you do not stop just when you please but when you can  we found water but no shade  we traveled on and found a tree at last but no water  we rested and lunched and came on to this place ain mellahah the boys call it baldwinsville it was a very short days run but the dragoman does not want to go further and has invented a plausible lie about the country beyond this being infested by ferocious arabs who would make sleeping in their midst a dangerous pastime  well they ought to be dangerous  they carry a rusty old weatherbeaten flintlock gun with a barrel that is longer than themselves it has no sights on it it will not carry farther than a brickbat and is not half so certain  and the great sash they wear in many a fold around their waists has two or three absurd old horsepistols in it that are rusty from eternal disuse weapons that would hang fire just about long enough for you to walk out of range and then burst and blow the arabs head off  exceedingly dangerous these sons of the desert are  it used to make my blood run cold to read wm c grimes hairbreadth escapes from bedouins but i think i could read them now without a tremor  he never said he was attacked by bedouins i believe or was ever treated uncivilly but then in about every other chapter he discovered them approaching any how and he had a bloodcurdling fashion of working up the peril and of wondering how his relations far away would feel could they see their poor wandering boy with his weary feet and his dim eyes in such fearful danger and of thinking for the last time of the old homestead and the dear old church and the cow and those things and of finally straightening his form to its utmost height in the saddle drawing his trusty revolver and then dashing the spurs into mohammed and sweeping down upon the ferocious enemy determined to sell his life as dearly as possible  true the bedouins never did any thing to him when he arrived and never had any intention of doing any thing to him in the first place and wondered what in the mischief he was making all that todo about but still i could not divest myself of the idea somehow that a frightful peril had been escaped through that mans daredevil bravery and so i never could read about wm c grimes bedouins and sleep comfortably afterward  but i believe the bedouins to be a fraud now  i have seen the monster and i can outrun him  i shall never be afraid of his daring to stand behind his own gun and discharge it  about fifteen hundred years before christ this campground of ours by the waters of merom was the scene of one of joshuas exterminating battles  jabin king of hazor up yonder above dan called all the sheiks about him together with their hosts to make ready for israels terrible general who was approaching       and when all these kings were met together they came and pitched      together by the waters of merom to fight against israel  and they      went out they and all their hosts with them much people even as      the sand that is upon the seashore for multitude etc  but joshua fell upon them and utterly destroyed them root and branch that was his usual policy in war  he never left any chance for newspaper controversies about who won the battle  he made this valley so quiet now a reeking slaughterpen  somewhere in this part of the countryi do not know exactly where israel fought another bloody battle a hundred years later  deborah the prophetess told barak to take ten thousand men and sally forth against another king jabin who had been doing something  barak came down from mount tabor twenty or twentyfive miles from here and gave battle to jabins forces who were in command of sisera  barak won the fight and while he was making the victory complete by the usual method of exterminating the remnant of the defeated host sisera fled away on foot and when he was nearly exhausted by fatigue and thirst one jael a woman he seems to have been acquainted with invited him to come into her tent and rest himself  the weary soldier acceded readily enough and jael put him to bed  he said he was very thirsty and asked his generous preserver to get him a cup of water  she brought him some milk and he drank of it gratefully and lay down again to forget in pleasant dreams his lost battle and his humbled pride  presently when he was asleep she came softly in with a hammer and drove a hideous tentpen down through his brain  for he was fast asleep and weary  so he died  such is the touching language of the bible  the song of deborah and barak praises jael for the memorable service she had rendered in an exultant strain       blessed above women shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be      blessed shall she be above women in the tent       he asked for water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter      in a lordly dish       she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmans      hammer and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote off his head      when she had pierced and stricken through his temples       at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed      he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead  stirring scenes like these occur in this valley no more  there is not a solitary village throughout its whole extentnot for thirty miles in either direction  there are two or three small clusters of bedouin tents but not a single permanent habitation  one may ride ten miles hereabouts and not see ten human beings  to this region one of the prophecies is applied       i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies which dwell      therein shall be astonished at it  and i will scatter you among the      heathen and i will draw out a sword after you and your land shall      be desolate and your cities waste  no man can stand here by deserted ain mellahah and say the prophecy has not been fulfilled  in a verse from the bible which i have quoted above occurs the phrase all these kings  it attracted my attention in a moment because it carries to my mind such a vastly different significance from what it always did at home  i can see easily enough that if i wish to profit by this tour and come to a correct understanding of the matters of interest connected with it i must studiously and faithfully unlearn a great many things i have somehow absorbed concerning palestine  i must begin a system of reduction  like my grapes which the spies bore out of the promised land i have got every thing in palestine on too large a scale some of my ideas were wild enough  the word palestine always brought to my mind a vague suggestion of a country as large as the united states i do not know why but such was the case  i suppose it was because i could not conceive of a small country having so large a history  i think i was a little surprised to find that the grand sultan of turkey was a man of only ordinary size  i must try to reduce my ideas of palestine to a more reasonable shape  one gets large impressions in boyhood sometimes which he has to fight against all his life  all these kings  when i used to read that in sunday school it suggested to me the several kings of such countries as england france spain germany russia etc arrayed in splendid robes ablaze with jewels marching in grave procession with sceptres of gold in their hands and flashing crowns upon their heads  but here in ain mellahah after coming through syria and after giving serious study to the character and customs of the country the phrase all these kings loses its grandeur  it suggests only a parcel of petty chiefsillclad and illconditioned savages much like our indians who lived in full sight of each other and whose kingdoms were large when they were five miles square and contained two thousand souls  the combined monarchies of the thirty kings destroyed by joshua on one of his famous campaigns only covered an area about equal to four of our counties of ordinary size  the poor old sheik we saw at cesarea philippi with his ragged band of a hundred followers would have been called a king in those ancient times  it is seven in the morning and as we are in the country the grass ought to be sparkling with dew the flowers enriching the air with their fragrance and the birds singing in the trees  but alas there is no dew here nor flowers nor birds nor trees  there is a plain and an unshaded lake and beyond them some barren mountains  the tents are tumbling the arabs are quarreling like dogs and cats as usual the campground is strewn with packages and bundles the labor of packing them upon the backs of the mules is progressing with great activity the horses are saddled the umbrellas are out and in ten minutes we shall mount and the long procession will move again  the white city of the mellahah resurrected for a moment out of the dead centuries will have disappeared again and left no sign     chapter xlvii  we traversed some miles of desolate country whose soil is rich enough but is given over wholly to weedsa silent mournful expanse wherein we saw only three personsarabs with nothing on but a long coarse shirt like the towlinen shirts which used to form the only summer garment of little negro boys on southern plantations  shepherds they were and they charmed their flocks with the traditional shepherds pipea reed instrument that made music as exquisitely infernal as these same arabs create when they sing  in their pipes lingered no echo of the wonderful music the shepherd forefathers heard in the plains of bethlehem what time the angels sang peace on earth good will to men  part of the ground we came over was not ground at all but rockscreamcolored rocks worn smooth as if by water with seldom an edge or a corner on them but scooped out honeycombed bored out with eyeholes and thus wrought into all manner of quaint shapes among which the uncouth imitation of skulls was frequent  over this part of the route were occasional remains of an old roman road like the appian way whose pavingstones still clung to their places with roman tenacity  gray lizards those heirs of ruin of sepulchres and desolation glided in and out among the rocks or lay still and sunned themselves  where prosperity has reigned and fallen where glory has flamed and gone out where beauty has dwelt and passed away where gladness was and sorrow is where the pomp of life has been and silence and death brood in its high places there this reptile makes his home and mocks at human vanity  his coat is the color of ashes and ashes are the symbol of hopes that have perished of aspirations that came to nought of loves that are buried  if he could speak he would say build temples i will lord it in their ruins build palaces i will inhabit them erect empires i will inherit them bury your beautiful i will watch the worms at their work and you who stand here and moralize over me i will crawl over your corpse at the last  a few ants were in this desert place but merely to spend the summer they brought their provisions from ain mellahaheleven miles  jack is not very well today it is easy to see but boy as he is he is too much of a man to speak of it  he exposed himself to the sun too much yesterday but since it came of his earnest desire to learn and to make this journey as useful as the opportunities will allow no one seeks to discourage him by faultfinding  we missed him an hour from the camp and then found him some distance away by the edge of a brook and with no umbrella to protect him from the fierce sun  if he had been used to going without his umbrella it would have been well enough of course but he was not  he was just in the act of throwing a clod at a mudturtle which was sunning itself on a small log in the brook we said  dont do that jack  what do you want to harm him for  what has he done  well then i wont kill him but i ought to because he is a fraud  we asked him why but he said it was no matter  we asked him why once or twice as we walked back to the camp but he still said it was no matter  but late at night when he was sitting in a thoughtful mood on the bed we asked him again and he said  well it dont matter i dont mind it now but i did not like it today you know because i dont tell any thing that isnt so and i dont think the colonel ought to either  but he did he told us at prayers in the pilgrims tent last night and he seemed as if he was reading it out of the bible too about this country flowing with milk and honey and about the voice of the turtle being heard in the land  i thought that was drawing it a little strong about the turtles any how but i asked mr church if it was so and he said it was and what mr church tells me i believe  but i sat there and watched that turtle nearly an hour today and i almost burned up in the sun but i never heard him sing  i believe i sweated a double handful of sweati know i didbecause it got in my eyes and it was running down over my nose all the time and you know my pants are tighter than any body elsesparis foolishnessand the buckskin seat of them got wet with sweat and then got dry again and began to draw up and pinch and tear looseit was awfulbut i never heard him sing  finally i said this is a fraudthat is what it is it is a fraudand if i had had any sense i might have known a cursed mudturtle couldnt sing  and then i said i dont wish to be hard on this fellow and i will just give him ten minutes to commence ten minutesand then if he dont down goes his building  but he didnt commence you know  i had staid there all that time thinking may be he might pretty soon because he kept on raising his head up and letting it down and drawing the skin over his eyes for a minute and then opening them out again as if he was trying to study up something to sing but just as the ten minutes were up and i was all beat out and blistered he laid his blamed head down on a knot and went fast asleep  it was a little hard after you had waited so long  i should think so  i said well if you wont sing you shant sleep any way and if you fellows had let me alone i would have made him shin out of galilee quicker than any turtle ever did yet  but it isnt any matter nowlet it go  the skin is all off the back of my neck  about ten in the morning we halted at josephs pit  this is a ruined khan of the middle ages in one of whose side courts is a great walled and arched pit with water in it and this pit one tradition says is the one josephs brethren cast him into  a more authentic tradition aided by the geography of the country places the pit in dothan some two days journey from here  however since there are many who believe in this present pit as the true one it has its interest  it is hard to make a choice of the most beautiful passage in a book which is so gemmed with beautiful passages as the bible but it is certain that not many things within its lids may take rank above the exquisite story of joseph  who taught those ancient writers their simplicity of language their felicity of expression their pathos and above all their faculty of sinking themselves entirely out of sight of the reader and making the narrative stand out alone and seem to tell itself shakspeare is always present when one reads his book macaulay is present when we follow the march of his stately sentences but the old testament writers are hidden from view  if the pit i have been speaking of is the right one a scene transpired there long ages ago which is familiar to us all in pictures  the sons of jacob had been pasturing their flocks near there  their father grew uneasy at their long absence and sent joseph his favorite to see if any thing had gone wrong with them  he traveled six or seven days journey he was only seventeen years old and boy like he toiled through that long stretch of the vilest rockiest dustiest country in asia arrayed in the pride of his heart his beautiful clawhammer coat of many colors  joseph was the favorite and that was one crime in the eyes of his brethren he had dreamed dreams and interpreted them to foreshadow his elevation far above all his family in the far future and that was another he was dressed well and had doubtless displayed the harmless vanity of youth in keeping the fact prominently before his brothers  these were crimes his elders fretted over among themselves and proposed to punish when the opportunity should offer  when they saw him coming up from the sea of galilee they recognized him and were glad they said lo here is this dreamerlet us kill him  but reuben pleaded for his life and they spared it  but they seized the boy and stripped the hated coat from his back and pushed him into the pit  they intended to let him die there but reuben intended to liberate him secretly  however while reuben was away for a little while the brethren sold joseph to some ishmaelitish merchants who were journeying towards egypt  such is the history of the pit  and the selfsame pit is there in that place even to this day and there it will remain until the next detachment of imagebreakers and tomb desecraters arrives from the quaker city excursion and they will infallibly dig it up and carry it away with them  for behold in them is no reverence for the solemn monuments of the past and whithersoever they go they destroy and spare not  joseph became rich distinguished powerfulas the bible expresses it lord over all the land of egypt  joseph was the real king the strength the brain of the monarchy though pharaoh held the title joseph is one of the truly great men of the old testament  and he was the noblest and the manliest save esau  why shall we not say a good word for the princely bedouin  the only crime that can be brought against him is that he was unfortunate  why must every body praise josephs greathearted generosity to his cruel brethren without stint of fervent language and fling only a reluctant bone of praise to esau for his still sublimer generosity to the brother who had wronged him  jacob took advantage of esaus consuming hunger to rob him of his birthright and the great honor and consideration that belonged to the position by treachery and falsehood he robbed him of his fathers blessing he made of him a stranger in his home and a wanderer  yet after twenty years had passed away and jacob met esau and fell at his feet quaking with fear and begging piteously to be spared the punishment he knew he deserved what did that magnificent savage do  he fell upon his neck and embraced him  when jacobwho was incapable of comprehending nobility of characterstill doubting still fearing insisted upon finding grace with my lord by the bribe of a present of cattle what did the gorgeous son of the desert say  nay i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself  esau found jacob rich beloved by wives and children and traveling in state with servants herds of cattle and trains of camelsbut he himself was still the uncourted outcast this brother had made him  after thirteen years of romantic mystery the brethren who had wronged joseph came strangers in a strange land hungry and humble to buy a little food and being summoned to a palace charged with crime they beheld in its owner their wronged brother they were trembling beggarshe the lord of a mighty empire  what joseph that ever lived would have thrown away such a chance to show off  who stands firstoutcast esau forgiving jacob in prosperity or joseph on a kings throne forgiving the ragged tremblers whose happy rascality placed him there  just before we came to josephs pit we had raised a hill and there a few miles before us with not a tree or a shrub to interrupt the view lay a vision which millions of worshipers in the far lands of the earth would give half their possessions to seethe sacred sea of galilee  therefore we tarried only a short time at the pit  we rested the horses and ourselves and felt for a few minutes the blessed shade of the ancient buildings  we were out of water but the two or three scowling arabs with their long guns who were idling about the place said they had none and that there was none in the vicinity  they knew there was a little brackish water in the pit but they venerated a place made sacred by their ancestors imprisonment too much to be willing to see christian dogs drink from it  but ferguson tied rags and handkerchiefs together till he made a rope long enough to lower a vessel to the bottom and we drank and then rode on and in a short time we dismounted on those shores which the feet of the saviour have made holy ground  at noon we took a swim in the sea of galileea blessed privilege in this roasting climateand then lunched under a neglected old figtree at the fountain they call ainettin a hundred yards from ruined capernaum every rivulet that gurgles out of the rocks and sands of this part of the world is dubbed with the title of fountain and people familiar with the hudson the great lakes and the mississippi fall into transports of admiration over them and exhaust their powers of composition in writing their praises  if all the poetry and nonsense that have been discharged upon the fountains and the bland scenery of this region were collected in a book it would make a most valuable volume to burn  during luncheon the pilgrim enthusiasts of our party who had been so lighthearted and so happy ever since they touched holy ground that they did little but mutter incoherent rhapsodies could scarcely eat so anxious were they to take shipping and sail in very person upon the waters that had borne the vessels of the apostles  their anxiety grew and their excitement augmented with every fleeting moment until my fears were aroused and i began to have misgivings that in their present condition they might break recklessly loose from all considerations of prudence and buy a whole fleet of ships to sail in instead of hiring a single one for an hour as quiet folk are wont to do  i trembled to think of the ruined purses this days performances might result in i could not help reflecting bodingly upon the intemperate zeal with which middleaged men are apt to surfeit themselves upon a seductive folly which they have tasted for the first time  and yet i did not feel that i had a right to be surprised at the state of things which was giving me so much concern  these men had been taught from infancy to revere almost to worship the holy places whereon their happy eyes were resting now  for many and many a year this very picture had visited their thoughts by day and floated through their dreams by night  to stand before it in the fleshto see it as they saw it nowto sail upon the hallowed sea and kiss the holy soil that compassed it about these were aspirations they had cherished while a generation dragged its lagging seasons by and left its furrows in their faces and its frosts upon their hair  to look upon this picture and sail upon this sea they had forsaken home and its idols and journeyed thousands and thousands of miles in weariness and tribulation  what wonder that the sordid lights of workday prudence should pale before the glory of a hope like theirs in the full splendor of its fruition  let them squander millions i saidwho speaks of money at a time like this  in this frame of mind i followed as fast as i could the eager footsteps of the pilgrims and stood upon the shore of the lake and swelled with hat and voice the frantic hail they sent after the ship that was speeding by  it was a success  the toilers of the sea ran in and beached their barque  joy sat upon every countenance  how muchask him how much fergusonhow much to take us alleight of us and youto bethsaida yonder and to the mouth of jordan and to the place where the swine ran down into the seaquickand we want to coast around every whereevery whereall day longi could sail a year in these watersand tell him well stop at magdala and finish at tiberiasask him how muchany thingany thing whatevertell him we dont care what the expense is  i said to myself i knew how it would be  fergusoninterpretinghe says two napoleonseight dollars  one or two countenances fell  then a pause  too muchwell give him one  i never shall know how it wasi shudder yet when i think how the place is given to miraclesbut in a single instant of time as it seemed to me that ship was twenty paces from the shore and speeding away like a frightened thing  eight crestfallen creatures stood upon the shore and o to think of it thisthisafter all that overmastering ecstacy oh shameful shameful ending after such unseemly boasting  it was too much like ho let me at him  followed by a prudent two of you hold himone can hold me  instantly there was wailing and gnashing of teeth in the camp  the two napoleons were offeredmore if necessaryand pilgrims and dragoman shouted themselves hoarse with pleadings to the retreating boatmen to come back  but they sailed serenely away and paid no further heed to pilgrims who had dreamed all their lives of some day skimming over the sacred waters of galilee and listening to its hallowed story in the whisperings of its waves and had journeyed countless leagues to do it andand then concluded that the fare was too high  impertinent mohammedan arabs to think such things of gentlemen of another faith  well there was nothing to do but just submit and forego the privilege of voyaging on genessaret after coming half around the globe to taste that pleasure  there was a time when the saviour taught here that boats were plenty among the fishermen of the coastsbut boats and fishermen both are gone now and old josephus had a fleet of menofwar in these waters eighteen centuries agoa hundred and thirty bold canoesbut they also have passed away and left no sign  they battle here no more by sea and the commercial marine of galilee numbers only two small ships just of a pattern with the little skiffs the disciples knew  one was lost to us for goodthe other was miles away and far out of hail so we mounted the horses and rode grimly on toward magdala cantering along in the edge of the water for want of the means of passing over it  how the pilgrims abused each other  each said it was the others fault and each in turn denied it  no word was spoken by the sinnerseven the mildest sarcasm might have been dangerous at such a time  sinners that have been kept down and had examples held up to them and suffered frequent lectures and been so put upon in a moral way and in the matter of going slow and being serious and bottling up slang and so crowded in regard to the matter of being proper and always and forever behaving that their lives have become a burden to them would not lag behind pilgrims at such a time as this and wink furtively and be joyful and commit other such crimesbecause it would not occur to them to do it otherwise they would  but they did do it thoughand it did them a world of good to hear the pilgrims abuse each other too  we took an unworthy satisfaction in seeing them fall out now and then because it showed that they were only poor human people like us after all  so we all rode down to magdala while the gnashing of teeth waxed and waned by turns and harsh words troubled the holy calm of galilee  lest any man think i mean to be illnatured when i talk about our pilgrims as i have been talking i wish to say in all sincerity that i do not  i would not listen to lectures from men i did not like and could not respect and none of these can say i ever took their lectures unkindly or was restive under the infliction or failed to try to profit by what they said to me  they are better men than i am i can say that honestly they are good friends of mine tooand besides if they did not wish to be stirred up occasionally in print why in the mischief did they travel with me  they knew me  they knew my liberal waythat i like to give and takewhen it is for me to give and other people to take  when one of them threatened to leave me in damascus when i had the cholera he had no real idea of doing iti know his passionate nature and the good impulses that underlie it  and did i not overhear church another pilgrim say he did not care who went or who staid he would stand by me till i walked out of damascus on my own feet or was carried out in a coffin if it was a year  and do i not include church every time i abuse the pilgrimsand would i be likely to speak illnaturedly of him  i wish to stir them up and make them healthy that is all  we had left capernaum behind us  it was only a shapeless ruin  it bore no semblance to a town and had nothing about it to suggest that it had ever been a town  but all desolate and unpeopled as it was it was illustrious ground  from it sprang that tree of christianity whose broad arms overshadow so many distant lands today  after christ was tempted of the devil in the desert he came here and began his teachings and during the three or four years he lived afterward this place was his home almost altogether  he began to heal the sick and his fame soon spread so widely that sufferers came from syria and beyond jordan and even from jerusalem several days journey away to be cured of their diseases  here he healed the centurions servant and peters motherinlaw and multitudes of the lame and the blind and persons possessed of devils and here also he raised jairuss daughter from the dead  he went into a ship with his disciples and when they roused him from sleep in the midst of a storm he quieted the winds and lulled the troubled sea to rest with his voice  he passed over to the other side a few miles away and relieved two men of devils which passed into some swine  after his return he called matthew from the receipt of customs performed some cures and created scandal by eating with publicans and sinners  then he went healing and teaching through galilee and even journeyed to tyre and sidon  he chose the twelve disciples and sent them abroad to preach the new gospel  he worked miracles in bethsaida and chorazinvillages two or three miles from capernaum  it was near one of them that the miraculous draft of fishes is supposed to have been taken and it was in the desert places near the other that he fed the thousands by the miracles of the loaves and fishes  he cursed them both and capernaum also for not repenting after all the great works he had done in their midst and prophesied against them  they are all in ruins nowwhich is gratifying to the pilgrims for as usual they fit the eternal words of gods to the evanescent things of this earth christ it is more probable referred to the people not their shabby villages of wigwams he said it would be sad for them at the day of judgmentand what business have mudhovels at the day of judgment  it would not affect the prophecy in the least it would neither prove it or disprove itif these towns were splendid cities now instead of the almost vanished ruins they are christ visited magdala which is near by capernaum and he also visited cesarea philippi  he went up to his old home at nazareth and saw his brothers joses and judas and james and simonthose persons who being own brothers to jesus christ one would expect to hear mentioned sometimes yet who ever saw their names in a newspaper or heard them from a pulpit who ever inquires what manner of youths they were and whether they slept with jesus played with him and romped about him quarreled with him concerning toys and trifles struck him in anger not suspecting what he was  who ever wonders what they thought when they saw him come back to nazareth a celebrity and looked long at his unfamiliar face to make sure and then said it is jesus  who wonders what passed in their minds when they saw this brother who was only a brother to them however much he might be to others a mysterious stranger who was a god and had stood face to face with god above the clouds doing strange miracles with crowds of astonished people for witnesses  who wonders if the brothers of jesus asked him to come home with them and said his mother and his sisters were grieved at his long absence and would be wild with delight to see his face again  who ever gives a thought to the sisters of jesus at allyet he had sisters and memories of them must have stolen into his mind often when he was illtreated among strangers when he was homeless and said he had not where to lay his head when all deserted him even peter and he stood alone among his enemies  christ did few miracles in nazareth and staid but a little while  the people said this the son of god  why his father is nothing but a carpenter  we know the family  we see them every day  are not his brothers named so and so and his sisters so and so and is not his mother the person they call mary  this is absurd  he did not curse his home but he shook its dust from his feet and went away  capernaum lies close to the edge of the little sea in a small plain some five miles long and a mile or two wide which is mildly adorned with oleanders which look all the better contrasted with the bald hills and the howling deserts which surround them but they are not as deliriously beautiful as the books paint them  if one be calm and resolute he can look upon their comeliness and live  one of the most astonishing things that have yet fallen under our observation is the exceedingly small portion of the earth from which sprang the now flourishing plant of christianity  the longest journey our saviour ever performed was from here to jerusalemabout one hundred to one hundred and twenty miles  the next longest was from here to sidonsay about sixty or seventy miles  instead of being wide apartas american appreciation of distances would naturally suggestthe places made most particularly celebrated by the presence of christ are nearly all right here in full view and within cannonshot of capernaum leaving out two or three short journeys of the saviour he spent his life preached his gospel and performed his miracles within a compass no larger than an ordinary county in the united states  it is as much as i can do to comprehend this stupefying fact  how it wears a man out to have to read up a hundred pages of history every two or three milesfor verily the celebrated localities of palestine occur that close together how wearily how bewilderingly they swarm about your path  in due time we reached the ancient village of magdala     chapter xlviii  magdala is not a beautiful place  it is thoroughly syrian and that is to say that it is thoroughly ugly and cramped squalid uncomfortable and filthyjust the style of cities that have adorned the country since adams time as all writers have labored hard to prove and have succeeded  the streets of magdala are any where from three to six feet wide and reeking with uncleanliness  the houses are from five to seven feet high and all built upon one arbitrary planthe ungraceful form of a drygoods box  the sides are daubed with a smooth white plaster and tastefully frescoed aloft and alow with disks of cameldung placed there to dry  this gives the edifice the romantic appearance of having been riddled with cannonballs and imparts to it a very warlike aspect  when the artist has arranged his materials with an eye to just proportion the small and the large flakes in alternate rows and separated by carefullyconsidered intervalsi know of nothing more cheerful to look upon than a spirited syrian fresco  the flat plastered roof is garnished by picturesque stacks of fresco materials which having become thoroughly dried and cured are placed there where it will be convenient  it is used for fuel  there is no timber of any consequence in palestinenone at all to waste upon firesand neither are there any mines of coal if my description has been intelligible you will perceive now that a square flatroofed hovel neatly frescoed with its walltops gallantly bastioned and turreted with dried camelrefuse gives to a landscape a feature that is exceedingly festive and picturesque especially if one is careful to remember to stick in a cat wherever about the premises there is room for a cat to sit  there are no windows to a syrian hut and no chimneys  when i used to read that they let a bedridden man down through the roof of a house in capernaum to get him into the presence of the saviour i generally had a threestory brick in my mind and marveled that they did not break his neck with the strange experiment  i perceive now however that they might have taken him by the heels and thrown him clear over the house without discommoding him very much  palestine is not changed any since those days in manners customs architecture or people  as we rode into magdala not a soul was visible  but the ring of the horses hoofs roused the stupid population and they all came trooping outold men and old women boys and girls the blind the crazy and the crippled all in ragged soiled and scanty raiment and all abject beggars by nature instinct and education  how the vermintortured vagabonds did swarm  how they showed their scars and sores and piteously pointed to their maimed and crooked limbs and begged with their pleading eyes for charity  we had invoked a spirit we could not lay  they hung to the horsess tails clung to their manes and the stirrups closed in on every side in scorn of dangerous hoofsand out of their infidel throats with one accord burst an agonizing and most infernal chorus howajji bucksheesh howajji bucksheesh howajji bucksheesh bucksheesh bucksheesh  i never was in a storm like that before  as we paid the bucksheesh out to soreeyed children and brown buxom girls with repulsively tattooed lips and chins we filed through the town and by many an exquisite fresco till we came to a brambleinfested inclosure and a romanlooking ruin which had been the veritable dwelling of st mary magdalene the friend and follower of jesus  the guide believed it and so did i  i could not well do otherwise with the house right there before my eyes as plain as day  the pilgrims took down portions of the front wall for specimens as is their honored custom and then we departed  we are camped in this place now just within the city walls of tiberias we went into the town before nightfall and looked at its peoplewe cared nothing about its houses  its people are best examined at a distance they are particularly uncomely jews arabs and negroes  squalor and poverty are the pride of tiberias  the young women wear their dower strung upon a strong wire that curves downward from the top of the head to the jawturkish silver coins which they have raked together or inherited  most of these maidens were not wealthy but some few had been very kindly dealt with by fortune  i saw heiresses there worth in their own rightworth well i suppose i might venture to say as much as nine dollars and a half  but such cases are rare  when you come across one of these she naturally puts on airs  she will not ask for bucksheesh she will not even permit of undue familiarity  she assumes a crushing dignity and goes on serenely practicing with her finetooth comb and quoting poetry just the same as if you were not present at all  some people can not stand prosperity  they say that the longnosed lanky dyspepticlooking bodysnatchers with the indescribable hats on and a long curl dangling down in front of each ear are the old familiar selfrighteous pharisees we read of in the scriptures  verily they look it  judging merely by their general style and without other evidence one might easily suspect that selfrighteousness was their specialty  from various authorities i have culled information concerning tiberias it was built by herod antipas the murderer of john the baptist and named after the emperor tiberius  it is believed that it stands upon the site of what must have been ages ago a city of considerable architectural pretensions judging by the fine porphyry pillars that are scattered through tiberias and down the lake shore southward  these were fluted once and yet although the stone is about as hard as iron the flutings are almost worn away  these pillars are small and doubtless the edifices they adorned were distinguished more for elegance than grandeur  this modern towntiberiasis only mentioned in the new testament never in the old  the sanhedrim met here last and for three hundred years tiberias was the metropolis of the jews in palestine  it is one of the four holy cities of the israelites and is to them what mecca is to the mohammedan and jerusalem to the christian  it has been the abiding place of many learned and famous jewish rabbins  they lie buried here and near them lie also twentyfive thousand of their faith who traveled far to be near them while they lived and lie with them when they died  the great rabbi ben israel spent three years here in the early part of the third century he is dead now  the celebrated sea of galilee is not so large a sea as lake tahoe i measure all lakes by tahoe partly because i am far more familiar with it than with any other and partly because i have such a high admiration for it and such a world of pleasant recollections of it that it is very nearly impossible for me to speak of lakes and not mention itby a good dealit is just about twothirds as large  and when we come to speak of beauty this sea is no more to be compared to tahoe than a meridian of longitude is to a rainbow  the dim waters of this pool can not suggest the limpid brilliancy of tahoe these low shaven yellow hillocks of rocks and sand so devoid of perspective can not suggest the grand peaks that compass tahoe like a wall and whose ribbed and chasmed fronts are clad with stately pines that seem to grow small and smaller as they climb till one might fancy them reduced to weeds and shrubs far upward where they join the everlasting snows  silence and solitude brood over tahoe and silence and solitude brood also over this lake of genessaret  but the solitude of the one is as cheerful and fascinating as the solitude of the other is dismal and repellant  in the early morning one watches the silent battle of dawn and darkness upon the waters of tahoe with a placid interest but when the shadows sulk away and one by one the hidden beauties of the shore unfold themselves in the full splendor of noon when the still surface is belted like a rainbow with broad bars of blue and green and white half the distance from circumference to centre when in the lazy summer afternoon he lies in a boat far out to where the dead blue of the deep water begins and smokes the pipe of peace and idly winks at the distant crags and patches of snow from under his capbrim when the boat drifts shoreward to the white water and he lolls over the gunwale and gazes by the hour down through the crystal depths and notes the colors of the pebbles and reviews the finny armies gliding in procession a hundred feet below when at night he sees moon and stars mountain ridges feathered with pines jutting white capes bold promontories grand sweeps of rugged scenery topped with bald glimmering peaks all magnificently pictured in the polished mirror of the lake in richest softest detail the tranquil interest that was born with the morning deepens and deepens by sure degrees till it culminates at last in resistless fascination  it is solitude for birds and squirrels on the shore and fishes in the water are all the creatures that are near to make it otherwise but it is not the sort of solitude to make one dreary  come to galilee for that if these unpeopled deserts these rusty mounds of barrenness that never never never do shake the glare from their harsh outlines and fade and faint into vague perspective that melancholy ruin of capernaum this stupid village of tiberias slumbering under its six funereal plumes of palms yonder desolate declivity where the swine of the miracle ran down into the sea and doubtless thought it was better to swallow a devil or two and get drowned into the bargain than have to live longer in such a place this cloudless blistering sky this solemn sailless tintless lake reposing within its rim of yellow hills and low steep banks and looking just as expressionless and unpoetical when we leave its sublime history out of the question as any metropolitan reservoir in christendomif these things are not food for rock me to sleep mother none exist i think  but i should not offer the evidence for the prosecution and leave the defense unheard  wm c grimes deposes as follows       we had taken ship to go over to the other side  the sea was not      more than six miles wide  of the beauty of the scene however i      can not say enough nor can i imagine where those travelers carried      their eyes who have described the scenery of the lake as tame or      uninteresting  the first great characteristic of it is the deep      basin in which it lies  this is from three to four hundred feet      deep on all sides except at the lower end and the sharp slope of      the banks which are all of the richest green is broken and      diversified by the wadys and watercourses which work their way down      through the sides of the basin forming dark chasms or light sunny      valleys  near tiberias these banks are rocky and ancient      sepulchres open in them with their doors toward the water  they      selected grand spots as did the egyptians of old for burial      places as if they designed that when the voice of god should reach      the sleepers they should walk forth and open their eyes on scenes      of glorious beauty  on the east the wild and desolate mountains      contrast finely with the deep blue lake and toward the north      sublime and majestic hermon looks down on the sea lifting his      white crown to heaven with the pride of a hill that has seen the      departing footsteps of a hundred generations  on the northeast      shore of the sea was a single tree and this is the only tree of any      size visible from the water of the lake except a few lonely palms      in the city of tiberias and by its solitary position attracts more      attention than would a forest  the whole appearance of the scene is      precisely what we would expect and desire the scenery of genessaret      to be grand beauty but quiet calm  the very mountains are calm  it is an ingeniously written description and well calculated to deceive but if the paint and the ribbons and the flowers be stripped from it a skeleton will be found beneath  so stripped there remains a lake six miles wide and neutral in color with steep green banks unrelieved by shrubbery at one end bare unsightly rocks with almost invisible holes in them of no consequence to the picture eastward wild and desolate mountains low desolate hills he should have said in the north a mountain called hermon with snow on it peculiarity of the picture calmness its prominent feature one tree  no ingenuity could make such a picture beautifulto ones actual vision  i claim the right to correct misstatements and have so corrected the color of the water in the above recapitulation  the waters of genessaret are of an exceedingly mild blue even from a high elevation and a distance of five miles  close at hand the witness was sailing on the lake it is hardly proper to call them blue at all much less deep blue  i wish to state also not as a correction but as matter of opinion that mount hermon is not a striking or picturesque mountain by any means being too near the height of its immediate neighbors to be so that is all  i do not object to the witness dragging a mountain fortyfive miles to help the scenery under consideration because it is entirely proper to do it and besides the picture needs it  c w e of life in the holy land deposes as follows       a beautiful sea lies unbosomed among the galilean hills in the      midst of that land once possessed by zebulon and naphtali asher and      dan  the azure of the sky penetrates the depths of the lake and      the waters are sweet and cool  on the west stretch broad fertile      plains on the north the rocky shores rise step by step until in the      far distance tower the snowy heights of hermon on the east through      a misty veil are seen the high plains of perea which stretch away      in rugged mountains leading the mind by varied paths toward      jerusalem the holy  flowers bloom in this terrestrial paradise      once beautiful and verdant with waving trees singing birds enchant      the ear the turtledove soothes with its soft note the crested      lark sends up its song toward heaven and the grave and stately      stork inspires the mind with thought and leads it on to meditation      and repose  life here was once idyllic charming here were once no      rich no poor no high no low  it was a world of ease simplicity      and beauty now it is a scene of desolation and misery  this is not an ingenious picture  it is the worst i ever saw  it describes in elaborate detail what it terms a terrestrial paradise and closes with the startling information that this paradise is a scene of desolation and misery  i have given two fair average specimens of the character of the testimony offered by the majority of the writers who visit this region one says of the beauty of the scene i can not say enough and then proceeds to cover up with a woof of glittering sentences a thing which when stripped for inspection proves to be only an unobtrusive basin of water some mountainous desolation and one tree  the other after a conscientious effort to build a terrestrial paradise out of the same materials with the addition of a grave and stately stork spoils it all by blundering upon the ghastly truth at the last  nearly every book concerning galilee and its lake describes the scenery as beautiful  nonot always so straightforward as that  sometimes the impression intentionally conveyed is that it is beautiful at the same time that the author is careful not to say that it is in plain saxon but a careful analysis of these descriptions will show that the materials of which they are formed are not individually beautiful and can not be wrought into combinations that are beautiful  the veneration and the affection which some of these men felt for the scenes they were speaking of heated their fancies and biased their judgment but the pleasant falsities they wrote were full of honest sincerity at any rate  others wrote as they did because they feared it would be unpopular to write otherwise  others were hypocrites and deliberately meant to deceive any of them would say in a moment if asked that it was always right and always best to tell the truth  they would say that at any rate if they did not perceive the drift of the question  but why should not the truth be spoken of this region  is the truth harmful  has it ever needed to hide its face  god made the sea of galilee and its surroundings as they are  is it the province of mr grimes to improve upon the work  i am sure from the tenor of books i have read that many who have visited this land in years gone by were presbyterians and came seeking evidences in support of their particular creed they found a presbyterian palestine and they had already made up their minds to find no other though possibly they did not know it being blinded by their zeal others were baptists seeking baptist evidences and a baptist palestine others were catholics methodists episcopalians seeking evidences indorsing their several creeds and a catholic a methodist an episcopalian palestine  honest as these mens intentions may have been they were full of partialities and prejudices they entered the country with their verdicts already prepared and they could no more write dispassionately and impartially about it than they could about their own wives and children  our pilgrims have brought their verdicts with them they have shown it in their conversation ever since we left beirout i can almost tell in set phrase what they will say when they see tabor nazareth jericho and jerusalembecause i have the books they will smouch their ideas from  these authors write pictures and frame rhapsodies and lesser men follow and see with the authors eyes instead of their own and speak with his tongue  what the pilgrims said at cesarea philippi surprised me with its wisdom  i found it afterwards in robinson  what they said when genessaret burst upon their vision charmed me with its grace  i find it in mr thompsons land and the book  they have spoken often in happily worded language which never varied of how they mean to lay their weary heads upon a stone at bethel as jacob did and close their dim eyes and dream perchance of angels descending out of heaven on a ladder  it was very pretty  but i have recognized the weary head and the dim eyes finally  they borrowed the ideaand the wordsand the constructionand the punctuationfrom grimes  the pilgrims will tell of palestine when they get home not as it appeared to them but as it appeared to thompson and robinson and grimeswith the tints varied to suit each pilgrims creed  pilgrims sinners and arabs are all abed now and the camp is still labor in loneliness is irksome  since i made my last few notes i have been sitting outside the tent for half an hour  night is the time to see galilee  genessaret under these lustrous stars has nothing repulsive about it  genessaret with the glittering reflections of the constellations flecking its surface almost makes me regret that i ever saw the rude glare of the day upon it  its history and its associations are its chiefest charm in any eyes and the spells they weave are feeble in the searching light of the sun  then we scarcely feel the fetters our thoughts wander constantly to the practical concerns of life and refuse to dwell upon things that seem vague and unreal  but when the day is done even the most unimpressible must yield to the dreamy influences of this tranquil starlight  the old traditions of the place steal upon his memory and haunt his reveries and then his fancy clothes all sights and sounds with the supernatural  in the lapping of the waves upon the beach he hears the dip of ghostly oars in the secret noises of the night he hears spirit voices in the soft sweep of the breeze the rush of invisible wings  phantom ships are on the sea the dead of twenty centuries come forth from the tombs and in the dirges of the night wind the songs of old forgotten ages find utterance again  in the starlight galilee has no boundaries but the broad compass of the heavens and is a theatre meet for great events meet for the birth of a religion able to save a world and meet for the stately figure appointed to stand upon its stage and proclaim its high decrees  but in the sunlight one says is it for the deeds which were done and the words which were spoken in this little acre of rocks and sand eighteen centuries gone that the bells are ringing today in the remote islands of the sea and far and wide over continents that clasp the circumference of the huge globe  one can comprehend it only when night has hidden all incongruities and created a theatre proper for so grand a drama     chapter xlix  we took another swim in the sea of galilee at twilight yesterday and another at sunrise this morning  we have not sailed but three swims are equal to a sail are they not  there were plenty of fish visible in the water but we have no outside aids in this pilgrimage but tent life in the holy land the land and the book and other literature of like descriptionno fishingtackle  there were no fish to be had in the village of tiberias  true we saw two or three vagabonds mending their nets but never trying to catch any thing with them  we did not go to the ancient warm baths two miles below tiberias  i had no desire in the world to go there  this seemed a little strange and prompted me to try to discover what the cause of this unreasonable indifference was  it turned out to be simply because pliny mentions them  i have conceived a sort of unwarrantable unfriendliness toward pliny and st paul because it seems as if i can never ferret out a place that i can have to myself  it always and eternally transpires that st paul has been to that place and pliny has mentioned it  in the early morning we mounted and started  and then a weird apparition marched forth at the head of the processiona pirate i thought if ever a pirate dwelt upon land  it was a tall arab as swarthy as an indian youngsay thirty years of age  on his head he had closely bound a gorgeous yellow and red striped silk scarf whose ends lavishly fringed with tassels hung down between his shoulders and dallied with the wind from his neck to his knees in ample folds a robe swept down that was a very starspangled banner of curved and sinuous bars of black and white out of his back somewhere apparently the long stem of a chibouk projected and reached far above his right shoulder  athwart his back diagonally and extending high above his left shoulder was an arab gum of saladins time that was splendid with silver plating from stock clear up to the end of its measureless stretch of barrel  about his waist was bound many and many a yard of elaborately figured but sadly tarnished stuff that came from sumptuous persia and among the baggy folds in front the sunbeams glinted from a formidable battery of old brassmounted horsepistols and the gilded hilts of bloodthirsty knives  there were holsters for more pistols appended to the wonderful stack of longhaired goatskins and persian carpets which the man had been taught to regard in the light of a saddle and down among the pendulous rank of vast tassels that swung from that saddle and clanging against the iron shovel of a stirrup that propped the warriors knees up toward his chin was a crooked silverclad scimitar of such awful dimensions and such implacable expression that no man might hope to look upon it and not shudder  the fringed and bedizened prince whose privilege it is to ride the pony and lead the elephant into a country village is poor and naked compared to this chaos of paraphernalia and the happy vanity of the one is the very poverty of satisfaction compared to the majestic serenity the overwhelming complacency of the other  who is this  what is this  that was the trembling inquiry all down the line  our guard  from galilee to the birthplace of the savior the country is infested with fierce bedouins whose sole happiness it is in this life to cut and stab and mangle and murder unoffending christians  allah be with us  then hire a regiment  would you send us out among these desperate hordes with no salvation in our utmost need but this old turret  the dragoman laughednot at the facetiousness of the simile for verily that guide or that courier or that dragoman never yet lived upon earth who had in him the faintest appreciation of a joke even though that joke were so broad and so ponderous that if it fell on him it would flatten him out like a postage stampthe dragoman laughed and then emboldened by some thought that was in his brain no doubt proceeded to extremities and winked  in straits like these when a man laughs it is encouraging when he winks it is positively reassuring  he finally intimated that one guard would be sufficient to protect us but that that one was an absolute necessity  it was because of the moral weight his awful panoply would have with the bedouins  then i said we didnt want any guard at all if one fantastic vagabond could protect eight armed christians and a pack of arab servants from all harm surely that detachment could protect themselves  he shook his head doubtfully  then i said just think of how it looksthink of how it would read to selfreliant americans that we went sneaking through this deserted wilderness under the protection of this masquerading arab who would break his neck getting out of the country if a man that was a man ever started after him  it was a mean low degrading position  why were we ever told to bring navy revolvers with us if we had to be protected at last by this infamous starspangled scum of the desert  these appeals were vainthe dragoman only smiled and shook his head  i rode to the front and struck up an acquaintance with king solomoninallhisglory and got him to show me his lingering eternity of a gun it had a rusty flint lock it was ringed and barred and plated with silver from end to end but it was as desperately out of the perpendicular as are the billiard cues of 49 that one finds yet in service in the ancient mining camps of california  the muzzle was eaten by the rust of centuries into a ragged filigreework like the end of a burntout stovepipe  i shut one eye and peered withinit was flaked with iron rust like an old steamboat boiler  i borrowed the ponderous pistols and snapped them  they were rusty inside toohad not been loaded for a generation  i went back full of encouragement and reported to the guide and asked him to discharge this dismantled fortress  it came out then  this fellow was a retainer of the sheik of tiberias  he was a source of government revenue  he was to the empire of tiberias what the customs are to america  the sheik imposed guards upon travelers and charged them for it  it is a lucrative source of emolument and sometimes brings into the national treasury as much as thirtyfive or forty dollars a year  i knew the warriors secret now i knew the hollow vanity of his rusty trumpery and despised his asinine complacency  i told on him and with reckless daring the cavalcade straight ahead into the perilous solitudes of the desert and scorned his frantic warnings of the mutilation and death that hovered about them on every side  arrived at an elevation of twelve hundred feet above the lake i ought to mention that the lake lies six hundred feet below the level of the mediterraneanno traveler ever neglects to flourish that fragment of news in his letters as bald and unthrilling a panorama as any land can afford perhaps was spread out before us  yet it was so crowded with historical interest that if all the pages that have been written about it were spread upon its surface they would flag it from horizon to horizon like a pavement  among the localities comprised in this view were mount hermon the hills that border cesarea philippi dan the sources of the jordan and the waters of merom tiberias the sea of galilee josephs pit capernaum bethsaida the supposed scenes of the sermon on the mount the feeding of the multitudes and the miraculous draught of fishes the declivity down which the swine ran to the sea the entrance and the exit of the jordan safed the city set upon a hill one of the four holy cities of the jews and the place where they believe the real messiah will appear when he comes to redeem the world part of the battlefield of hattin where the knightly crusaders fought their last fight and in a blaze of glory passed from the stage and ended their splendid career forever mount tabor the traditional scene of the lords transfiguration  and down toward the southeast lay a landscape that suggested to my mind a quotation imperfectly remembered no doubt       the ephraimites not being called upon to share in the rich spoils      of the ammonitish war assembled a mighty host to fight against      jeptha judge of israel who being apprised of their approach      gathered together the men of israel and gave them battle and put      them to flight  to make his victory the more secure he stationed      guards at the different fords and passages of the jordan with      instructions to let none pass who could not say shibboleth  the      ephraimites being of a different tribe could not frame to      pronounce the word right but called it sibboleth which proved them      enemies and cost them their lives wherefore forty and two thousand      fell at the different fords and passages of the jordan that day  we jogged along peacefully over the great caravan route from damascus to jerusalem and egypt past lubia and other syrian hamlets perched in the unvarying style upon the summit of steep mounds and hills and fenced round about with giant cactuses the sign of worthless land with prickly pears upon them like hams and came at last to the battlefield of hattin  it is a grand irregular plateau and looks as if it might have been created for a battlefield  here the peerless saladin met the christian host some seven hundred years ago and broke their power in palestine for all time to come  there had long been a truce between the opposing forces but according to the guidebook raynauld of chatillon lord of kerak broke it by plundering a damascus caravan and refusing to give up either the merchants or their goods when saladin demanded them  this conduct of an insolent petty chieftain stung the sultan to the quick and he swore that he would slaughter raynauld with his own hand no matter how or when or where he found him  both armies prepared for war under the weak king of jerusalem was the very flower of the christian chivalry  he foolishly compelled them to undergo a long exhausting march in the scorching sun and then without water or other refreshment ordered them to encamp in this open plain  the splendidly mounted masses of moslem soldiers swept round the north end of genessaret burning and destroying as they came and pitched their camp in front of the opposing lines  at dawn the terrific fight began surrounded on all sides by the sultans swarming battalions the christian knights fought on without a hope for their lives  they fought with desperate valor but to no purpose the odds of heat and numbers and consuming thirst were too great against them  towards the middle of the day the bravest of their band cut their way through the moslem ranks and gained the summit of a little hill and there hour after hour they closed around the banner of the cross and beat back the charging squadrons of the enemy  but the doom of the christian power was sealed  sunset found saladin lord of palestine the christian chivalry strewn in heaps upon the field and the king of jerusalem the grand master of the templars and raynauld of chatillon captives in the sultans tent  saladin treated two of the prisoners with princely courtesy and ordered refreshments to be set before them  when the king handed an iced sherbet to chatillon the sultan said it is thou that givest it to him not i  he remembered his oath and slaughtered the hapless knight of chatillon with his own hand  it was hard to realize that this silent plain had once resounded with martial music and trembled to the tramp of armed men  it was hard to people this solitude with rushing columns of cavalry and stir its torpid pulses with the shouts of victors the shrieks of the wounded and the flash of banner and steel above the surging billows of war  a desolation is here that not even imagination can grace with the pomp of life and action  we reached tabor safely and considerably in advance of that old ironclad swindle of a guard  we never saw a human being on the whole route much less lawless hordes of bedouins  tabor stands solitary and alone a giant sentinel above the plain of esdraelon  it rises some fourteen hundred feet above the surrounding level a green wooden cone symmetrical and full of gracea prominent landmark and one that is exceedingly pleasant to eyes surfeited with the repulsive monotony of desert syria  we climbed the steep path to its summit through breezy glades of thorn and oak  the view presented from its highest peak was almost beautiful  below was the broad level plain of esdraelon checkered with fields like a chessboard and full as smooth and level seemingly dotted about its borders with white compact villages and faintly penciled far and near with the curving lines of roads and trails  when it is robed in the fresh verdure of spring it must form a charming picture even by itself  skirting its southern border rises little hermon over whose summit a glimpse of gilboa is caught  nain famous for the raising of the widows son and endor as famous for the performances of her witch are in view  to the eastward lies the valley of the jordan and beyond it the mountains of gilead  westward is mount carmel  hermon in the norththe tablelands of bashansafed the holy city gleaming white upon a tall spur of the mountains of lebanon a steelblue corner of the sea of galileesaddlepeaked hattin traditional mount of beatitudes and mute witness brave fights of the crusading host for holy crossthese fill up the picture  to glance at the salient features of this landscape through the picturesque framework of a ragged and ruined stone windowarch of the time of christ thus hiding from sight all that is unattractive is to secure to yourself a pleasure worth climbing the mountain to enjoy  one must stand on his head to get the best effect in a fine sunset and set a landscape in a bold strong framework that is very close at hand to bring out all its beauty  one learns this latter truth never more to forget it in that mimic land of enchantment the wonderful garden of my lord the count pallavicini near genoa  you go wandering for hours among hills and wooded glens artfully contrived to leave the impression that nature shaped them and not man following winding paths and coming suddenly upon leaping cascades and rustic bridges finding sylvan lakes where you expected them not loitering through battered mediaeval castles in miniature that seem hoary with age and yet were built a dozen years ago meditating over ancient crumbling tombs whose marble columns were marred and broken purposely by the modern artist that made them stumbling unawares upon toy palaces wrought of rare and costly materials and again upon a peasants hut whose dilapidated furniture would never suggest that it was made so to order sweeping round and round in the midst of a forest on an enchanted wooden horse that is moved by some invisible agency traversing roman roads and passing under majestic triumphal arches resting in quaint bowers where unseen spirits discharge jets of water on you from every possible direction and where even the flowers you touch assail you with a shower boating on a subterranean lake among caverns and arches royally draped with clustering stalactites and passing out into open day upon another lake which is bordered with sloping banks of grass and gay with patrician barges that swim at anchor in the shadow of a miniature marble temple that rises out of the clear water and glasses its white statues its rich capitals and fluted columns in the tranquil depths  so from marvel to marvel you have drifted on thinking all the time that the one last seen must be the chiefest  and verily the chiefest wonder is reserved until the last but you do not see it until you step ashore and passing through a wilderness of rare flowers collected from every corner of the earth you stand at the door of one more mimic temple  right in this place the artist taxed his genius to the utmost and fairly opened the gates of fairy land  you look through an unpretending pane of glass stained yellowthe first thing you see is a mass of quivering foliage ten short steps before you in the midst of which is a ragged opening like a gatewaya thing that is common enough in nature and not apt to excite suspicions of a deep human designand above the bottom of the gateway project in the most careless way a few broad tropic leaves and brilliant flowers  all of a sudden through this bright bold gateway you catch a glimpse of the faintest softest richest picture that ever graced the dream of a dying saint since john saw the new jerusalem glimmering above the clouds of heaven  a broad sweep of sea flecked with careening sails a sharp jutting cape and a lofty lighthouse on it a sloping lawn behind it beyond a portion of the old city of palaces with its parks and hills and stately mansions beyond these a prodigious mountain with its strong outlines sharply cut against ocean and sky and over all vagrant shreds and flakes of cloud floating in a sea of gold  the ocean is gold the city is gold the meadow the mountain the skyevery thing is goldenrich and mellow and dreamy as a vision of paradise  no artist could put upon canvas its entrancing beauty and yet without the yellow glass and the carefully contrived accident of a framework that cast it into enchanted distance and shut out from it all unattractive features it was not a picture to fall into ecstasies over  such is life and the trail of the serpent is over us all  there is nothing for it now but to come back to old tabor though the subject is tiresome enough and i can not stick to it for wandering off to scenes that are pleasanter to remember  i think i will skip any how there is nothing about tabor except we concede that it was the scene of the transfiguration but some gray old ruins stacked up there in all ages of the world from the days of stout gideon and parties that flourished thirty centuries ago to the fresh yesterday of crusading times  it has its greek convent and the coffee there is good but never a splinter of the true cross or bone of a hallowed saint to arrest the idle thoughts of worldlings and turn them into graver channels a catholic church is nothing to me that has no relics  the plain of esdraelonthe battlefield of the nationsonly sets one to dreaming of joshua and benhadad and saul and gideon tamerlane tancred coeur de lion and saladin the warrior kings of persia egypts heroes and napoleonfor they all fought here  if the magic of the moonlight could summon from the graves of forgotten centuries and many lands the countless myriads that have battled on this wide farreaching floor and array them in the thousand strange costumes of their hundred nationalities and send the vast host sweeping down the plain splendid with plumes and banners and glittering lances i could stay here an age to see the phantom pageant  but the magic of the moonlight is a vanity and a fraud and whoso putteth his trust in it shall suffer sorrow and disappointment  down at the foot of tabor and just at the edge of the storied plain of esdraelon is the insignificant village of deburieh where deborah prophetess of israel lived  it is just like magdala     chapter l  we descended from mount tabor crossed a deep ravine followed a hilly rocky road to nazarethdistant two hours  all distances in the east are measured by hours not miles  a good horse will walk three miles an hour over nearly any kind of a road therefore an hour here always stands for three miles  this method of computation is bothersome and annoying and until one gets thoroughly accustomed to it it carries no intelligence to his mind until he has stopped and translated the pagan hours into christian miles just as people do with the spoken words of a foreign language they are acquainted with but not familiarly enough to catch the meaning in a moment  distances traveled by human feet are also estimated by hours and minutes though i do not know what the base of the calculation is  in constantinople you ask how far is it to the consulate and they answer about ten minutes  how far is it to the lloyds agency  quarter of an hour  how far is it to the lower bridge  four minutes  i can not be positive about it but i think that there when a man orders a pair of pantaloons he says he wants them a quarter of a minute in the legs and nine seconds around the waist  two hours from tabor to nazarethand as it was an uncommonly narrow crooked trail we necessarily met all the camel trains and jackass caravans between jericho and jacksonville in that particular place and nowhere else  the donkeys do not matter so much because they are so small that you can jump your horse over them if he is an animal of spirit but a camel is not jumpable  a camel is as tall as any ordinary dwellinghouse in syriawhich is to say a camel is from one to two and sometimes nearly three feet taller than a goodsized man  in this part of the country his load is oftenest in the shape of colossal sacksone on each side  he and his cargo take up as much room as a carriage think of meeting this style of obstruction in a narrow trail  the camel would not turn out for a king  he stalks serenely along bringing his cushioned stilts forward with the long regular swing of a pendulum and whatever is in the way must get out of the way peaceably or be wiped out forcibly by the bulky sacks  it was a tiresome ride to us and perfectly exhausting to the horses  we were compelled to jump over upwards of eighteen hundred donkeys and only one person in the party was unseated less than sixty times by the camels  this seems like a powerful statement but the poet has said things are not what they seem  i can not think of any thing now more certain to make one shudder than to have a softfooted camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the ear with its cold flabby underlip  a camel did this for one of the boys who was drooping over his saddle in a brown study  he glanced up and saw the majestic apparition hovering above him and made frantic efforts to get out of the way but the camel reached out and bit him on the shoulder before he accomplished it  this was the only pleasant incident of the journey  at nazareth we camped in an olive grove near the virgin marys fountain and that wonderful arab guard came to collect some bucksheesh for his services in following us from tiberias and warding off invisible dangers with the terrors of his armament  the dragoman had paid his master but that counted as nothingif you hire a man to sneeze for you here and another man chooses to help him you have got to pay both they do nothing whatever without pay  how it must have surprised these people to hear the way of salvation offered to them without money and without price  if the manners the people or the customs of this country have changed since the saviours time the figures and metaphors of the bible are not the evidences to prove it by  we entered the great latin convent which is built over the traditional dwellingplace of the holy family  we went down a flight of fifteen steps below the ground level and stood in a small chapel tricked out with tapestry hangings silver lamps and oil paintings  a spot marked by a cross in the marble floor under the altar was exhibited as the place made forever holy by the feet of the virgin when she stood up to receive the message of the angel  so simple so unpretending a locality to be the scene of so mighty an event  the very scene of the annunciationan event which has been commemorated by splendid shrines and august temples all over the civilized world and one which the princes of art have made it their loftiest ambition to picture worthily on their canvas a spot whose history is familiar to the very children of every house and city and obscure hamlet of the furthest lands of christendom a spot which myriads of men would toil across the breadth of a world to see would consider it a priceless privilege to look upon it was easy to think these thoughts  but it was not easy to bring myself up to the magnitude of the situation  i could sit off several thousand miles and imagine the angel appearing with shadowy wings and lustrous countenance and note the glory that streamed downward upon the virgins head while the message from the throne of god fell upon her earsany one can do that beyond the ocean but few can do it here  i saw the little recess from which the angel stepped but could not fill its void  the angels that i know are creatures of unstable fancythey will not fit in niches of substantial stone  imagination labors best in distant fields i doubt if any man can stand in the grotto of the annunciation and people with the phantom images of his mind its too tangible walls of stone  they showed us a broken granite pillar depending from the roof which they said was hacked in two by the moslem conquerors of nazareth in the vain hope of pulling down the sanctuary  but the pillar remained miraculously suspended in the air and unsupported itself supported then and still supports the roof  by dividing this statement up among eight it was found not difficult to believe it  these gifted latin monks never do any thing by halves  if they were to show you the brazen serpent that was elevated in the wilderness you could depend upon it that they had on hand the pole it was elevated on also and even the hole it stood in  they have got the grotto of the annunciation here and just as convenient to it as ones throat is to his mouth they have also the virgins kitchen and even her sittingroom where she and joseph watched the infant saviour play with hebrew toys eighteen hundred years ago  all under one roof and all clean spacious comfortable grottoes  it seems curious that personages intimately connected with the holy family always lived in grottoesin nazareth in bethlehem in imperial ephesusand yet nobody else in their day and generation thought of doing any thing of the kind  if they ever did their grottoes are all gone and i suppose we ought to wonder at the peculiar marvel of the preservation of these i speak of  when the virgin fled from herods wrath she hid in a grotto in bethlehem and the same is there to this day  the slaughter of the innocents in bethlehem was done in a grotto the saviour was born in a grottoboth are shown to pilgrims yet  it is exceedingly strange that these tremendous events all happened in grottoesand exceedingly fortunate likewise because the strongest houses must crumble to ruin in time but a grotto in the living rock will last forever  it is an imposturethis grotto stuffbut it is one that all men ought to thank the catholics for  wherever they ferret out a lost locality made holy by some scriptural event they straightway build a massivealmost imperishablechurch there and preserve the memory of that locality for the gratification of future generations  if it had been left to protestants to do this most worthy work we would not even know where jerusalem is today and the man who could go and put his finger on nazareth would be too wise for this world  the world owes the catholics its good will even for the happy rascality of hewing out these bogus grottoes in the rock for it is infinitely more satisfactory to look at a grotto where people have faithfully believed for centuries that the virgin once lived than to have to imagine a dwellingplace for her somewhere any where nowhere loose and at large all over this town of nazareth  there is too large a scope of country  the imagination can not work  there is no one particular spot to chain your eye rivet your interest and make you think  the memory of the pilgrims can not perish while plymouth rock remains to us  the old monks are wise  they know how to drive a stake through a pleasant tradition that will hold it to its place forever  we visited the places where jesus worked for fifteen years as a carpenter and where he attempted to teach in the synagogue and was driven out by a mob  catholic chapels stand upon these sites and protect the little fragments of the ancient walls which remain  our pilgrims broke off specimens  we visited also a new chapel in the midst of the town which is built around a boulder some twelve feet long by four feet thick the priests discovered a few years ago that the disciples had sat upon this rock to rest once when they had walked up from capernaum they hastened to preserve the relic  relics are very good property travelers are expected to pay for seeing them and they do it cheerfully we like the idea  ones conscience can never be the worse for the knowledge that he has paid his way like a man  our pilgrims would have liked very well to get out their lampblack and stencilplates and paint their names on that rock together with the names of the villages they hail from in america but the priests permit nothing of that kind to speak the strict truth however our party seldom offend in that way though we have men in the ship who never lose an opportunity to do it our pilgrims chief sin is their lust for specimens  i suppose that by this time they know the dimensions of that rock to an inch and its weight to a ton and i do not hesitate to charge that they will go back there tonight and try to carry it off  this fountain of the virgin is the one which tradition says mary used to get water from twenty times a day when she was a girl and bear it away in a jar upon her head  the water streams through faucets in the face of a wall of ancient masonry which stands removed from the houses of the village  the young girls of nazareth still collect about it by the dozen and keep up a riotous laughter and skylarking  the nazarene girls are homely  some of them have large lustrous eyes but none of them have pretty faces  these girls wear a single garment usually and it is loose shapeless of undecided color it is generally out of repair too they wear from crown to jaw curious strings of old coins after the manner of the belles of tiberias and brass jewelry upon their wrists and in their ears  they wear no shoes and stockings  they are the most human girls we have found in the country yet and the best natured but there is no question that these picturesque maidens sadly lack comeliness  a pilgrimthe enthusiastsaid see that tall graceful girl look at the madonnalike beauty of her countenance  another pilgrim came along presently and said observe that tall graceful girl what queenly madonnalike gracefulness of beauty is in her countenance  i said she is not tall she is short she is not beautiful she is homely she is graceful enough i grant but she is rather boisterous  the third and last pilgrim moved by before long and he said ah what a tall graceful girl what madonnalike gracefulness of queenly beauty  the verdicts were all in  it was time now to look up the authorities for all these opinions  i found this paragraph which follows  written by whom  wm c grimes       after we were in the saddle we rode down to the spring to have a      last look at the women of nazareth who were as a class much the      prettiest that we had seen in the east  as we approached the crowd      a tall girl of nineteen advanced toward miriam and offered her a cup      of water  her movement was graceful and queenly  we exclaimed on      the spot at the madonnalike beauty of her countenance  whitely was      suddenly thirsty and begged for water and drank it slowly with      his eyes over the top of the cup fixed on her large black eyes      which gazed on him quite as curiously as he on her  then moreright      wanted water  she gave it to him and he managed to spill it so as      to ask for another cup and by the time she came to me she saw      through the operation her eyes were full of fun as she looked at      me  i laughed outright and she joined me in as gay a shout as ever      country maiden in old orange county  i wished for a picture of her      a madonna whose face was a portrait of that beautiful nazareth      girl would be a thing of beauty and a joy forever  that is the kind of gruel which has been served out from palestine for ages  commend me to fennimore cooper to find beauty in the indians and to grimes to find it in the arabs  arab men are often fine looking but arab women are not  we can all believe that the virgin mary was beautiful it is not natural to think otherwise but does it follow that it is our duty to find beauty in these present women of nazareth  i love to quote from grimes because he is so dramatic  and because he is so romantic  and because he seems to care but little whether he tells the truth or not so he scares the reader or excites his envy or his admiration  he went through this peaceful land with one hand forever on his revolver and the other on his pockethandkerchief  always when he was not on the point of crying over a holy place he was on the point of killing an arab  more surprising things happened to him in palestine than ever happened to any traveler here or elsewhere since munchausen died  at beit jin where nobody had interfered with him he crept out of his tent at dead of night and shot at what he took to be an arab lying on a rock some distance away planning evil  the ball killed a wolf  just before he fired he makes a dramatic picture of himselfas usual to scare the reader       was it imagination or did i see a moving object on the surface of      the rock  if it were a man why did he not now drop me  he had a      beautiful shot as i stood out in my black boornoose against the      white tent  i had the sensation of an entering bullet in my throat      breast brain  reckless creature  riding toward genessaret they saw two bedouins and we looked to our pistols and loosened them quietly in our shawls etc  always cool  in samaria he charged up a hill in the face of a volley of stones he fired into the crowd of men who threw them  he says       i never lost an opportunity of impressing the arabs with the      perfection of american and english weapons and the danger of      attacking any one of the armed franks  i think the lesson of that      ball not lost  at beit jin he gave his whole band of arab muleteers a piece of his mind and then       i contented myself with a solemn assurance that if there occurred      another instance of disobedience to orders i would thrash the      responsible party as he never dreamed of being thrashed and if i      could not find who was responsible i would whip them all from      first to last whether there was a governor at hand to do it or i      had to do it myself  perfectly fearless this man  he rode down the perpendicular path in the rocks from the castle of banias to the oak grove at a flying gallop his horse striding thirty feet at every bound  i stand prepared to bring thirty reliable witnesses to prove that putnams famous feat at horseneck was insignificant compared to this  behold himalways theatricallooking at jerusalemthis time by an oversight with his hand off his pistol for once       i stood in the road my hand on my horses neck and with my dim      eyes sought to trace the outlines of the holy places which i had      long before fixed in my mind but the fastflowing tears forbade my      succeeding  there were our mohammedan servants a latin monk two      armenians and a jew in our cortege and all alike gazed with      overflowing eyes  if latin monks and arabs cried i know to a moral certainty that the horses cried also and so the picture is complete  but when necessity demanded he could be firm as adamant  in the lebanon valley an arab youtha christian he is particular to explain that mohammedans do not stealrobbed him of a paltry ten dollars worth of powder and shot  he convicted him before a sheik and looked on while he was punished by the terrible bastinado  hear him       he mousa was on his back in a twinkling howling shouting      screaming but he was carried out to the piazza before the door      where we could see the operation and laid face down  one man sat      on his back and one on his legs the latter holding up his feet      while a third laid on the bare soles a rhinoceroshide koorbash      a koorbash is arabic for cowhide the cow being a rhinoceros      it is the most cruel whip known to fame  heavy as lead and      flexible as indiarubber usually about forty inches long and      tapering gradually from an inch in diameter to a point it      administers a blow which leaves its mark for timescow life in      egypt by the same authorthat whizzed through the air at every      stroke  poor moreright was in agony and nama and nama the second      mother and sister of mousa were on their faces begging and      wailing now embracing my knees and now whitelys while the      brother outside made the air ring with cries louder than mousas      even yusef came and asked me on his knees to relent and last of      all betunithe rascal had lost a feedbag in their house and had      been loudest in his denunciations that morningbesought the howajji      to have mercy on the fellow  but not he  the punishment was suspended at the fifteenth blow to hear the confession  then grimes and his party rode away and left the entire christian family to be fined and as severely punished as the mohammedan sheik should deem proper       as i mounted yusef once more begged me to interfere and have mercy      on them but i looked around at the dark faces of the crowd and i      couldnt find one drop of pity in my heart for them  he closes his picture with a rollicking burst of humor which contrasts finely with the grief of the mother and her children  one more paragraph       then once more i bowed my head  it is no shame to have wept in      palestine  i wept when i saw jerusalem i wept when i lay in the      starlight at bethlehem  i wept on the blessed shores of galilee      my hand was no less firm on the rein my anger did not tremble on      the trigger of my pistol when i rode with it in my right hand along      the shore of the blue sea weeping my eye was not dimmed by      those tears nor my heart in aught weakened  let him who would sneer      at my emotion close this volume here for he will find little to his      taste in my journeyings through holy land  he never bored but he struck water  i am aware that this is a pretty voluminous notice of mr grimes book however it is proper and legitimate to speak of it for nomadic life in palestine is a representative bookthe representative of a class of palestine booksand a criticism upon it will serve for a criticism upon them all  and since i am treating it in the comprehensive capacity of a representative book i have taken the liberty of giving to both book and author fictitious names  perhaps it is in better taste any how to do this     chapter li  nazareth is wonderfully interesting because the town has an air about it of being precisely as jesus left it and one finds himself saying all the time the boy jesus has stood in this doorwayhas played in that streethas touched these stones with his handshas rambled over these chalky hills  whoever shall write the boyhood of jesus ingeniously will make a book which will possess a vivid interest for young and old alike i judge so from the greater interest we found in nazareth than any of our speculations upon capernaum and the sea of galilee gave rise to  it was not possible standing by the sea of galilee to frame more than a vague faraway idea of the majestic personage who walked upon the crested waves as if they had been solid earth and who touched the dead and they rose up and spoke  i read among my notes now with a new interest some sentences from an edition of 1621 of the apocryphal new testament extract       christ kissed by a bride made dumb by sorcerers cures her  a      leprous girl cured by the water in which the infant christ was      washed and becomes the servant of joseph and mary  the leprous son      of a prince cured in like manner       a young man who had been bewitched and turned into a mule      miraculously cured by the infant savior being put on his back and      is married to the girl who had been cured of leprosy  whereupon the      bystanders praise god       chapter 16  christ miraculously widens or contracts gates      milkpails sieves or boxes not properly made by joseph he not      being skillful at his carpenters trade  the king of jerusalem      gives joseph an order for a throne  joseph works on it for two      years and makes it two spans too short  the king being angry with      him jesus comforts himcommands him to pull one side of the      throne while he pulls the other and brings it to its proper      dimensions       chapter 19  jesus charged with throwing a boy from the roof of a      house miraculously causes the dead boy to speak and acquit him      fetches water for his mother breaks the pitcher and miraculously      gathers the water in his mantle and brings it home       sent to a schoolmaster refuses to tell his letters and the      schoolmaster going to whip him his hand withers  further on in this quaint volume of rejected gospels is an epistle of st clement to the corinthians which was used in the churches and considered genuine fourteen or fifteen hundred years ago  in it this account of the fabled phoenix occurs       1  let us consider that wonderful type of the resurrection which      is seen in the eastern countries that is to say in arabia       2  there is a certain bird called a phoenix  of this there is      never but one at a time and that lives five hundred years  and      when the time of its dissolution draws near that it must die it      makes itself a nest of frankincense and myrrh and other spices      into which when its time is fulfilled it enters and dies       3  but its flesh putrefying breeds a certain worm which being      nourished by the juice of the dead bird brings forth feathers and      when it is grown to a perfect state it takes up the nest in which      the bones of its parent lie and carries it from arabia into egypt      to a city called heliopolis       4  and flying in open day in the sight of all men lays it upon      the altar of the sun and so returns from whence it came       5  the priests then search into the records of the time and find      that it returned precisely at the end of five hundred years  business is business and there is nothing like punctuality especially in a phoenix  the few chapters relating to the infancy of the saviour contain many things which seem frivolous and not worth preserving  a large part of the remaining portions of the book read like good scripture however there is one verse that ought not to have been rejected because it so evidently prophetically refers to the general run of congresses of the united states       199  they carry themselves high and as prudent men and though      they are fools yet would seem to be teachers  i have set these extracts down as i found them  everywhere among the cathedrals of france and italy one finds traditions of personages that do not figure in the bible and of miracles that are not mentioned in its pages  but they are all in this apocryphal new testament and though they have been ruled out of our modern bible it is claimed that they were accepted gospel twelve or fifteen centuries ago and ranked as high in credit as any  one needs to read this book before he visits those venerable cathedrals with their treasures of tabooed and forgotten tradition  they imposed another pirate upon us at nazarethanother invincible arab guard  we took our last look at the city clinging like a whitewashed wasps nest to the hillside and at eight oclock in the morning departed  we dismounted and drove the horses down a bridlepath which i think was fully as crooked as a corkscrew which i know to be as steep as the downward sweep of a rainbow and which i believe to be the worst piece of road in the geography except one in the sandwich islands which i remember painfully and possibly one or two mountain trails in the sierra nevadas  often in this narrow path the horse had to poise himself nicely on a rude stone step and then drop his forefeet over the edge and down something more than half his own height  this brought his nose near the ground while his tail pointed up toward the sky somewhere and gave him the appearance of preparing to stand on his head  a horse cannot look dignified in this position  we accomplished the long descent at last and trotted across the great plain of esdraelon  some of us will be shot before we finish this pilgrimage  the pilgrims read nomadic life and keep themselves in a constant state of quixotic heroism  they have their hands on their pistols all the time and every now and then when you least expect it they snatch them out and take aim at bedouins who are not visible and draw their knives and make savage passes at other bedouins who do not exist  i am in deadly peril always for these spasms are sudden and irregular and of course i cannot tell when to be getting out of the way  if i am accidentally murdered some time during one of these romantic frenzies of the pilgrims mr grimes must be rigidly held to answer as an accessory before the fact  if the pilgrims would take deliberate aim and shoot at a man it would be all right and properbecause that man would not be in any danger but these random assaults are what i object to  i do not wish to see any more places like esdraelon where the ground is level and people can gallop it puts melodramatic nonsense into the pilgrims heads  all at once when one is jogging along stupidly in the sun and thinking about something ever so far away here they come at a stormy gallop spurring and whooping at those ridgy old sorebacked plugs till their heels fly higher than their heads and as they whiz by out comes a little potatogun of a revolver there is a startling little pop and a small pellet goes singing through the air  now that i have begun this pilgrimage i intend to go through with it though sooth to say nothing but the most desperate valor has kept me to my purpose up to the present time  i do not mind bedouinsi am not afraid of them because neither bedouins nor ordinary arabs have shown any disposition to harm us but i do feel afraid of my own comrades  arriving at the furthest verge of the plain we rode a little way up a hill and found ourselves at endor famous for its witch  her descendants are there yet  they were the wildest horde of halfnaked savages we have found thus far  they swarmed out of mud beehives out of hovels of the drygoods box pattern out of gaping caves under shelving rocks out of crevices in the earth  in five minutes the dead solitude and silence of the place were no more and a begging screeching shouting mob were struggling about the horses feet and blocking the way  bucksheesh bucksheesh bucksheesh howajji bucksheesh  it was magdala over again only here the glare from the infidel eyes was fierce and full of hate  the population numbers two hundred and fifty and more than half the citizens live in caves in the rock  dirt degradation and savagery are endors specialty  we say no more about magdala and deburieh now endor heads the list  it is worse than any indian campoodie  the hill is barren rocky and forbidding  no sprig of grass is visible and only one tree  this is a figtree which maintains a precarious footing among the rocks at the mouth of the dismal cavern once occupied by the veritable witch of endor  in this cavern tradition says saul the king sat at midnight and stared and trembled while the earth shook the thunders crashed among the hills and out of the midst of fire and smoke the spirit of the dead prophet rose up and confronted him  saul had crept to this place in the darkness while his army slept to learn what fate awaited him in the morrows battle  he went away a sad man to meet disgrace and death  a spring trickles out of the rock in the gloomy recesses of the cavern and we were thirsty  the citizens of endor objected to our going in there  they do not mind dirt they do not mind rags they do not mind vermin they do not mind barbarous ignorance and savagery they do not mind a reasonable degree of starvation but they do like to be pure and holy before their god whoever he may be and therefore they shudder and grow almost pale at the idea of christian lips polluting a spring whose waters must descend into their sanctified gullets  we had no wanton desire to wound even their feelings or trample upon their prejudices but we were out of water thus early in the day and were burning up with thirst  it was at this time and under these circumstances that i framed an aphorism which has already become celebrated  i said necessity knows no law  we went in and drank  we got away from the noisy wretches finally dropping them in squads and couples as we filed over the hillsthe aged first the infants next the young girls further on the strong men ran beside us a mile and only left when they had secured the last possible piastre in the way of bucksheesh  in an hour we reached nain where christ raised the widows son to life nain is magdala on a small scale  it has no population of any consequence  within a hundred yards of it is the original graveyard for aught i know the tombstones lie flat on the ground which is jewish fashion in syria  i believe the moslems do not allow them to have upright tombstones  a moslem grave is usually roughly plastered over and whitewashed and has at one end an upright projection which is shaped into exceedingly rude attempts at ornamentation  in the cities there is often no appearance of a grave at all a tall slender marble tombstone elaborately lettred gilded and painted marks the burial place and this is surmounted by a turban so carved and shaped as to signify the dead mans rank in life  they showed a fragment of ancient wall which they said was one side of the gate out of which the widows dead son was being brought so many centuries ago when jesus met the procession       now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a      dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a      widow and much people of the city was with her       and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said weep      not       and he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stood      still  and he said young man i say unto thee arise       and he that was dead sat up and began to speak  and he delivered      him to his mother       and there came a fear on all  and they glorified god saying that      a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visited his      people  a little mosque stands upon the spot which tradition says was occupied by the widows dwelling  two or three aged arabs sat about its door  we entered and the pilgrims broke specimens from the foundation walls though they had to touch and even step upon the praying carpets to do it  it was almost the same as breaking pieces from the hearts of those old arabs  to step rudely upon the sacred praying mats with booted feeta thing not done by any arabwas to inflict pain upon men who had not offended us in any way  suppose a party of armed foreigners were to enter a village church in america and break ornaments from the altar railings for curiosities and climb up and walk upon the bible and the pulpit cushions  however the cases are different  one is the profanation of a temple of our faiththe other only the profanation of a pagan one  we descended to the plain again and halted a moment at a wellof abrahams time no doubt  it was in a desert place  it was walled three feet above ground with squared and heavy blocks of stone after the manner of bible pictures  around it some camels stood and others knelt there was a group of sober little donkeys with naked dusky children clambering about them or sitting astride their rumps or pulling their tails  tawny blackeyed barefooted maids arrayed in rags and adorned with brazen armlets and pinchbeck earrings were poising waterjars upon their heads or drawing water from the well  a flock of sheep stood by waiting for the shepherds to fill the hollowed stones with water so that they might drinkstones which like those that walled the well were worn smooth and deeply creased by the chafing chins of a hundred generations of thirsty animals  picturesque arabs sat upon the ground in groups and solemnly smoked their longstemmed chibouks  other arabs were filling black hogskins with waterskins which well filled and distended with water till the short legs projected painfully out of the proper line looked like the corpses of hogs bloated by drowning  here was a grand oriental picture which i had worshiped a thousand times in soft rich steel engravings  but in the engraving there was no desolation no dirt no rags no fleas no ugly features no sore eyes no feasting flies no besotted ignorance in the countenances no raw places on the donkeys backs no disagreeable jabbering in unknown tongues no stench of camels no suggestion that a couple of tons of powder placed under the party and touched off would heighten the effect and give to the scene a genuine interest and a charm which it would always be pleasant to recall even though a man lived a thousand years oriental scenes look best in steel engravings  i cannot be imposed upon any more by that picture of the queen of sheba visiting solomon  i shall say to myself you look fine madam but your feet are not clean and you smell like a camel  presently a wild arab in charge of a camel train recognized an old friend in ferguson and they ran and fell upon each others necks and kissed each others grimy bearded faces upon both cheeks  it explained instantly a something which had always seemed to me only a farfetched oriental figure of speech  i refer to the circumstance of christs rebuking a pharisee or some such character and reminding him that from him he had received no kiss of welcome  it did not seem reasonable to me that men should kiss each other but i am aware now that they did there was reason in it too  the custom was natural and proper because people must kiss and a man would not be likely to kiss one of the women of this country of his own free will and accord  one must travel to learn  every day now old scriptural phrases that never possessed any significance for me before take to themselves a meaning  we journeyed around the base of the mountainlittle hermonpast the old crusaders castle of el fuleh and arrived at shunem  this was another magdala to a fraction frescoes and all  here tradition says the prophet samuel was born and here the shunamite woman built a little house upon the city wall for the accommodation of the prophet elisha elisha asked her what she expected in return  it was a perfectly natural question for these people are and were in the habit of proffering favors and services and then expecting and begging for pay  elisha knew them well  he could not comprehend that any body should build for him that humble little chamber for the mere sake of old friendship and with no selfish motive whatever  it used to seem a very impolite not to say a rude question for elisha to ask the woman but it does not seem so to me now  the woman said she expected nothing  then for her goodness and her unselfishness he rejoiced her heart with the news that she should bear a son  it was a high rewardbut she would not have thanked him for a daughterdaughters have always been unpopular here  the son was born grew waxed strong died  elisha restored him to life in shunem  we found here a grove of lemon treescool shady hung with fruit  one is apt to overestimate beauty when it is rare but to me this grove seemed very beautiful  it was beautiful  i do not overestimate it  i must always remember shunem gratefully as a place which gave to us this leafy shelter after our long hot ride  we lunched rested chatted smoked our pipes an hour and then mounted and moved on  as we trotted across the plain of jezreel we met half a dozen digger indians bedouins with very long spears in their hands cavorting around on old crowbait horses and spearing imaginary enemies whooping and fluttering their rags in the wind and carrying on in every respect like a pack of hopeless lunatics  at last here were the wild free sons of the desert speeding over the plain like the wind on their beautiful arabian mares we had read so much about and longed so much to see  here were the picturesque costumes  this was the gallant spectacle tatterdemalion vagrantscheap braggadocioarabian mares spined and necked like the ichthyosaurus in the museum and humped and cornered like a dromedary  to glance at the genuine son of the desert is to take the romance out of him foreverto behold his steed is to long in charity to strip his harness off and let him fall to pieces  presently we came to a ruinous old town on a hill the same being the ancient jezreel  ahab king of samaria this was a very vast kingdom for those days and was very nearly half as large as rhode island dwelt in the city of jezreel which was his capital  near him lived a man by the name of naboth who had a vineyard  the king asked him for it and when he would not give it offered to buy it  but naboth refused to sell it  in those days it was considered a sort of crime to part with ones inheritance at any priceand even if a man did part with it it reverted to himself or his heirs again at the next jubilee year  so this spoiled child of a king went and lay down on the bed with his face to the wall and grieved sorely  the queen a notorious character in those days and whose name is a byword and a reproach even in these came in and asked him wherefore he sorrowed and he told her  jezebel said she could secure the vineyard and she went forth and forged letters to the nobles and wise men in the kings name and ordered them to proclaim a fast and set naboth on high before the people and suborn two witnesses to swear that he had blasphemed  they did it and the people stoned the accused by the city wall and he died  then jezebel came and told the king and said behold naboth is no morerise up and seize the vineyard  so ahab seized the vineyard and went into it to possess it  but the prophet elijah came to him there and read his fate to him and the fate of jezebel and said that in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth dogs should also lick his bloodand he said likewise the dogs should eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel  in the course of time the king was killed in battle and when his chariot wheels were washed in the pool of samaria the dogs licked the blood  in after years jehu who was king of israel marched down against jezreel by order of one of the prophets and administered one of those convincing rebukes so common among the people of those days he killed many kings and their subjects and as he came along he saw jezebel painted and finely dressed looking out of a window and ordered that she be thrown down to him  a servant did it and jehus horse trampled her under foot  then jehu went in and sat down to dinner and presently he said go and bury this cursed woman for she is a kings daughter  the spirit of charity came upon him too late however for the prophecy had already been fulfilledthe dogs had eaten her and they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands  ahab the late king had left a helpless family behind him and jehu killed seventy of the orphan sons  then he killed all the relatives and teachers and servants and friends of the family and rested from his labors until he was come near to samaria where he met fortytwo persons and asked them who they were they said they were brothers of the king of judah  he killed them  when he got to samaria he said he would show his zeal for the lord so he gathered all the priests and people together that worshiped baal pretending that he was going to adopt that worship and offer up a great sacrifice and when they were all shut up where they could not defend themselves he caused every person of them to be killed then jehu the good missionary rested from his labors once more  we went back to the valley and rode to the fountain of ain jelud  they call it the fountain of jezreel usually  it is a pond about one hundred feet square and four feet deep with a stream of water trickling into it from under an overhanging ledge of rocks  it is in the midst of a great solitude  here gideon pitched his camp in the old times behind shunem lay the midianites the amalekites and the children of the east who were as grasshoppers for multitude both they and their camels were without number as the sand by the seaside for multitude  which means that there were one hundred and thirtyfive thousand men and that they had transportation service accordingly  gideon with only three hundred men surprised them in the night and stood by and looked on while they butchered each other until a hundred and twenty thousand lay dead on the field  we camped at jenin before night and got up and started again at one oclock in the morning  somewhere towards daylight we passed the locality where the best authenticated tradition locates the pit into which josephs brethren threw him and about noon after passing over a succession of mountain tops clad with groves of fig and olive trees with the mediterranean in sight some forty miles away and going by many ancient biblical cities whose inhabitants glowered savagely upon our christian procession and were seemingly inclined to practice on it with stones we came to the singularly terraced and unlovely hills that betrayed that we were out of galilee and into samaria at last  we climbed a high hill to visit the city of samaria where the woman may have hailed from who conversed with christ at jacobs well and from whence no doubt came also the celebrated good samaritan  herod the great is said to have made a magnificent city of this place and a great number of coarse limestone columns twenty feet high and two feet through that are almost guiltless of architectural grace of shape and ornament are pointed out by many authors as evidence of the fact  they would not have been considered handsome in ancient greece however  the inhabitants of this camp are particularly vicious and stoned two parties of our pilgrims a day or two ago who brought about the difficulty by showing their revolvers when they did not intend to use thema thing which is deemed bad judgment in the far west and ought certainly to be so considered any where  in the new territories when a man puts his hand on a weapon he knows that he must use it he must use it instantly or expect to be shot down where he stands  those pilgrims had been reading grimes  there was nothing for us to do in samaria but buy handfuls of old roman coins at a franc a dozen and look at a dilapidated church of the crusaders and a vault in it which once contained the body of john the baptist  this relic was long ago carried away to genoa  samaria stood a disastrous siege once in the days of elisha at the hands of the king of syria  provisions reached such a figure that an ass head was sold for eighty pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces of silver  an incident recorded of that heavy time will give one a very good idea of the distress that prevailed within these crumbling walls  as the king was walking upon the battlements one day a woman cried out saying help my lord o king  and the king said what aileth thee  and she answered this woman said unto me give thy son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow  so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on the next day give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her son  the prophet elisha declared that within four and twenty hours the prices of food should go down to nothing almost and it was so  the syrian army broke camp and fled for some cause or other the famine was relieved from without and many a shoddy speculator in doves dung and asss meat was ruined  we were glad to leave this hot and dusty old village and hurry on  at two oclock we stopped to lunch and rest at ancient shechem between the historic mounts of gerizim and ebal where in the old times the books of the law the curses and the blessings were read from the heights to the jewish multitudes below     chapter lii  the narrow canon in which nablous or shechem is situated is under high cultivation and the soil is exceedingly black and fertile  it is well watered and its affluent vegetation gains effect by contrast with the barren hills that tower on either side  one of these hills is the ancient mount of blessings and the other the mount of curses and wise men who seek for fulfillments of prophecy think they find here a wonder of this kindto wit that the mount of blessings is strangely fertile and its mate as strangely unproductive  we could not see that there was really much difference between them in this respect however  shechem is distinguished as one of the residences of the patriarch jacob and as the seat of those tribes that cut themselves loose from their brethren of israel and propagated doctrines not in conformity with those of the original jewish creed  for thousands of years this clan have dwelt in shechem under strict tabu and having little commerce or fellowship with their fellow men of any religion or nationality  for generations they have not numbered more than one or two hundred but they still adhere to their ancient faith and maintain their ancient rites and ceremonies  talk of family and old descent  princes and nobles pride themselves upon lineages they can trace back some hundreds of years what is this trifle to this handful of old first families of shechem who can name their fathers straight back without a flaw for thousands straight back to a period so remote that men reared in a country where the days of two hundred years ago are called ancient times grow dazed and bewildered when they try to comprehend it  here is respectability for youhere is familyhere is high descent worth talking about this sad proud remnant of a once mighty community still hold themselves aloof from all the world they still live as their fathers lived labor as their fathers labored think as they did feel as they did worship in the same place in sight of the same landmarks and in the same quaint patriarchal way their ancestors did more than thirty centuries ago  i found myself gazing at any straggling scion of this strange race with a riveted fascination just as one would stare at a living mastodon or a megatherium that had moved in the grey dawn of creation and seen the wonders of that mysterious world that was before the flood  carefully preserved among the sacred archives of this curious community is a mss  copy of the ancient jewish law which is said to be the oldest document on earth  it is written on vellum and is some four or five thousand years old  nothing but bucksheesh can purchase a sight  its fame is somewhat dimmed in these latter days because of the doubts so many authors of palestine travels have felt themselves privileged to cast upon it  speaking of this mss reminds me that i procured from the highpriest of this ancient samaritan community at great expense a secret document of still higher antiquity and far more extraordinary interest which i propose to publish as soon as i have finished translating it  joshua gave his dying injunction to the children of israel at shechem and buried a valuable treasure secretly under an oak tree there about the same time  the superstitious samaritans have always been afraid to hunt for it  they believe it is guarded by fierce spirits invisible to men  about a mile and a half from shechem we halted at the base of mount ebal before a little square area inclosed by a high stone wall neatly whitewashed  across one end of this inclosure is a tomb built after the manner of the moslems  it is the tomb of joseph  no truth is better authenticated than this  when joseph was dying he prophesied that exodus of the israelites from egypt which occurred four hundred years afterwards  at the same time he exacted of his people an oath that when they journeyed to the land of canaan they would bear his bones with them and bury them in the ancient inheritance of his fathers  the oath was kept and the bones of joseph which the children of israel brought up out of egypt buried they in shechem in a parcel of ground which jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for a hundred pieces of silver  few tombs on earth command the veneration of so many races and men of divers creeds as this of joseph  samaritan and jew moslem and christian alike revere it and honor it with their visits  the tomb of joseph the dutiful son the affectionate forgiving brother the virtuous man the wise prince and ruler  egypt felt his influencethe world knows his history  in this same parcel of ground which jacob bought of the sons of hamor for a hundred pieces of silver is jacobs celebrated well  it is cut in the solid rock and is nine feet square and ninety feet deep  the name of this unpretending hole in the ground which one might pass by and take no notice of is as familiar as household words to even the children and the peasants of many a faroff country  it is more famous than the parthenon it is older than the pyramids  it was by this well that jesus sat and talked with a woman of that strange antiquated samaritan community i have been speaking of and told her of the mysterious water of life  as descendants of old english nobles still cherish in the traditions of their houses how that this king or that king tarried a day with some favored ancestor three hundred years ago no doubt the descendants of the woman of samaria living there in shechem still refer with pardonable vanity to this conversation of their ancestor held some little time gone by with the messiah of the christians  it is not likely that they undervalue a distinction such as this  samaritan nature is human nature and human nature remembers contact with the illustrious always  for an offense done to the family honor the sons of jacob exterminated all shechem once  we left jacobs well and traveled till eight in the evening but rather slowly for we had been in the saddle nineteen hours and the horses were cruelly tired  we got so far ahead of the tents that we had to camp in an arab village and sleep on the ground  we could have slept in the largest of the houses but there were some little drawbacks it was populous with vermin it had a dirt floor it was in no respect cleanly and there was a family of goats in the only bedroom and two donkeys in the parlor  outside there were no inconveniences except that the dusky ragged earnesteyed villagers of both sexes and all ages grouped themselves on their haunches all around us and discussed us and criticised us with noisy tongues till midnight  we did not mind the noise being tired but doubtless the reader is aware that it is almost an impossible thing to go to sleep when you know that people are looking at you  we went to bed at ten and got up again at two and started once more  thus are people persecuted by dragomen whose sole ambition in life is to get ahead of each other  about daylight we passed shiloh where the ark of the covenant rested three hundred years and at whose gates good old eli fell down and brake his neck when the messenger riding hard from the battle told him of the defeat of his people the death of his sons and more than all the capture of israels pride her hope her refuge the ancient ark her forefathers brought with them out of egypt  it is little wonder that under circumstances like these he fell down and brake his neck  but shiloh had no charms for us  we were so cold that there was no comfort but in motion and so drowsy we could hardly sit upon the horses  after a while we came to a shapeless mass of ruins which still bears the name of bethel  it was here that jacob lay down and had that superb vision of angels flitting up and down a ladder that reached from the clouds to earth and caught glimpses of their blessed home through the open gates of heaven  the pilgrims took what was left of the hallowed ruin and we pressed on toward the goal of our crusade renowned jerusalem  the further we went the hotter the sun got and the more rocky and bare repulsive and dreary the landscape became  there could not have been more fragments of stone strewn broadcast over this part of the world if every ten square feet of the land had been occupied by a separate and distinct stonecutters establishment for an age  there was hardly a tree or a shrub any where  even the olive and the cactus those fast friends of a worthless soil had almost deserted the country  no landscape exists that is more tiresome to the eye than that which bounds the approaches to jerusalem  the only difference between the roads and the surrounding country perhaps is that there are rather more rocks in the roads than in the surrounding country  we passed ramah and beroth and on the right saw the tomb of the prophet samuel perched high upon a commanding eminence  still no jerusalem came in sight  we hurried on impatiently  we halted a moment at the ancient fountain of beira but its stones worn deeply by the chins of thirsty animals that are dead and gone centuries ago had no interest for uswe longed to see jerusalem  we spurred up hill after hill and usually began to stretch our necks minutes before we got to the topbut disappointment always followedmore stupid hills beyondmore unsightly landscapeno holy city  at last away in the middle of the day ancient bite of wall and crumbling arches began to line the waywe toiled up one more hill and every pilgrim and every sinner swung his hat on high  jerusalem  perched on its eternal hills white and domed and solid massed together and hooped with high gray walls the venerable city gleamed in the sun so small  why it was no larger than an american village of four thousand inhabitants and no larger than an ordinary syrian city of thirty thousand  jerusalem numbers only fourteen thousand people  we dismounted and looked without speaking a dozen sentences across the wide intervening valley for an hour or more and noted those prominent features of the city that pictures make familiar to all men from their school days till their death  we could recognize the tower of hippicus the mosque of omar the damascus gate the mount of olives the valley of jehoshaphat the tower of david and the garden of gethsemaneand dating from these landmarks could tell very nearly the localities of many others we were not able to distinguish  i record it here as a notable but not discreditable fact that not even our pilgrims wept  i think there was no individual in the party whose brain was not teeming with thoughts and images and memories invoked by the grand history of the venerable city that lay before us but still among them all was no voice of them that wept  there was no call for tears  tears would have been out of place  the thoughts jerusalem suggests are full of poetry sublimity and more than all dignity  such thoughts do not find their appropriate expression in the emotions of the nursery  just after noon we entered these narrow crooked streets by the ancient and the famed damascus gate and now for several hours i have been trying to comprehend that i am actually in the illustrious old city where solomon dwelt where abraham held converse with the deity and where walls still stand that witnessed the spectacle of the crucifixion     chapter liii  a fast walker could go outside the walls of jerusalem and walk entirely around the city in an hour  i do not know how else to make one understand how small it is  the appearance of the city is peculiar  it is as knobby with countless little domes as a prison door is with boltheads  every house has from one to half a dozen of these white plastered domes of stone broad and low sitting in the centre of or in a cluster upon the flat roof  wherefore when one looks down from an eminence upon the compact mass of houses so closely crowded together in fact that there is no appearance of streets at all and so the city looks solid he sees the knobbiest town in the world except constantinople it looks as if it might be roofed from centre to circumference with inverted saucers  the monotony of the view is interrupted only by the great mosque of omar the tower of hippicus and one or two other buildings that rise into commanding prominence  the houses are generally two stories high built strongly of masonry whitewashed or plastered outside and have a cage of wooden latticework projecting in front of every window  to reproduce a jerusalem street it would only be necessary to upend a chickencoop and hang it before each window in an alley of american houses  the streets are roughly and badly paved with stone and are tolerably crookedenough so to make each street appear to close together constantly and come to an end about a hundred yards ahead of a pilgrim as long as he chooses to walk in it  projecting from the top of the lower story of many of the houses is a very narrow porchroof or shed without supports from below and i have several times seen cats jump across the street from one shed to the other when they were out calling  the cats could have jumped double the distance without extraordinary exertion  i mention these things to give an idea of how narrow the streets are since a cat can jump across them without the least inconvenience it is hardly necessary to state that such streets are too narrow for carriages these vehicles cannot navigate the holy city  the population of jerusalem is composed of moslems jews greeks latins armenians syrians copts abyssinians greek catholics and a handful of protestants  one hundred of the latter sect are all that dwell now in this birthplace of christianity  the nice shades of nationality comprised in the above list and the languages spoken by them are altogether too numerous to mention  it seems to me that all the races and colors and tongues of the earth must be represented among the fourteen thousand souls that dwell in jerusalem  rags wretchedness poverty and dirt those signs and symbols that indicate the presence of moslem rule more surely than the crescentflag itself abound  lepers cripples the blind and the idiotic assail you on every hand and they know but one word of but one language apparentlythe eternal bucksheesh  to see the numbers of maimed malformed and diseased humanity that throng the holy places and obstruct the gates one might suppose that the ancient days had come again and that the angel of the lord was expected to descend at any moment to stir the waters of bethesda  jerusalem is mournful and dreary and lifeless  i would not desire to live here  one naturally goes first to the holy sepulchre  it is right in the city near the western gate it and the place of the crucifixion and in fact every other place intimately connected with that tremendous event are ingeniously massed together and covered by one roofthe dome of the church of the holy sepulchre  entering the building through the midst of the usual assemblage of beggars one sees on his left a few turkish guardsfor christians of different sects will not only quarrel but fight also in this sacred place if allowed to do it  before you is a marble slab which covers the stone of unction whereon the saviours body was laid to prepare it for burial  it was found necessary to conceal the real stone in this way in order to save it from destruction  pilgrims were too much given to chipping off pieces of it to carry home  near by is a circular railing which marks the spot where the virgin stood when the lords body was anointed  entering the great rotunda we stand before the most sacred locality in christendomthe grave of jesus  it is in the centre of the church and immediately under the great dome  it is inclosed in a sort of little temple of yellow and white stone of fanciful design  within the little temple is a portion of the very stone which was rolled away from the door of the sepulchre and on which the angel was sitting when mary came thither at early dawn  stooping low we enter the vaultthe sepulchre itself  it is only about six feet by seven and the stone couch on which the dead saviour lay extends from end to end of the apartment and occupies half its width  it is covered with a marble slab which has been much worn by the lips of pilgrims  this slab serves as an altar now over it hang some fifty gold and silver lamps which are kept always burning and the place is otherwise scandalized by trumpery gewgaws and tawdry ornamentation  all sects of christians except protestants have chapels under the roof of the church of the holy sepulchre and each must keep to itself and not venture upon anothers ground  it has been proven conclusively that they can not worship together around the grave of the saviour of the world in peace  the chapel of the syrians is not handsome that of the copts is the humblest of them all  it is nothing but a dismal cavern roughly hewn in the living rock of the hill of calvary  in one side of it two ancient tombs are hewn which are claimed to be those in which nicodemus and joseph of aramathea were buried  as we moved among the great piers and pillars of another part of the church we came upon a party of blackrobed animallooking italian monks with candles in their hands who were chanting something in latin and going through some kind of religious performance around a disk of white marble let into the floor  it was there that the risen saviour appeared to mary magdalen in the likeness of a gardener  near by was a similar stone shaped like a starhere the magdalen herself stood at the same time  monks were performing in this place also  they perform everywhereall over the vast building and at all hours  their candles are always flitting about in the gloom and making the dim old church more dismal than there is any necessity that it should be even though it is a tomb  we were shown the place where our lord appeared to his mother after the resurrection  here also a marble slab marks the place where st helena the mother of the emperor constantine found the crosses about three hundred years after the crucifixion  according to the legend this great discovery elicited extravagant demonstrations of joy  but they were of short duration  the question intruded itself which bore the blessed saviour and which the thieves  to be in doubt in so mighty a matter as thisto be uncertain which one to adorewas a grievous misfortune  it turned the public joy to sorrow  but when lived there a holy priest who could not set so simple a trouble as this at rest  one of these soon hit upon a plan that would be a certain test  a noble lady lay very ill in jerusalem  the wise priests ordered that the three crosses be taken to her bedside one at a time  it was done  when her eyes fell upon the first one she uttered a scream that was heard beyond the damascus gate and even upon the mount of olives it was said and then fell back in a deadly swoon  they recovered her and brought the second cross  instantly she went into fearful convulsions and it was with the greatest difficulty that six strong men could hold her  they were afraid now to bring in the third cross  they began to fear that possibly they had fallen upon the wrong crosses and that the true cross was not with this number at all  however as the woman seemed likely to die with the convulsions that were tearing her they concluded that the third could do no more than put her out of her misery with a happy dispatch  so they brought it and behold a miracle  the woman sprang from her bed smiling and joyful and perfectly restored to health  when we listen to evidence like this we cannot but believe  we would be ashamed to doubt and properly too  even the very part of jerusalem where this all occurred is there yet  so there is really no room for doubt  the priests tried to show us through a small screen a fragment of the genuine pillar of flagellation to which christ was bound when they scourged him  but we could not see it because it was dark inside the screen  however a baton is kept here which the pilgrim thrusts through a hole in the screen and then he no longer doubts that the true pillar of flagellation is in there  he can not have any excuse to doubt it for he can feel it with the stick  he can feel it as distinctly as he could feel any thing  not far from here was a niche where they used to preserve a piece of the true cross but it is gone now  this piece of the cross was discovered in the sixteenth century  the latin priests say it was stolen away long ago by priests of another sect  that seems like a hard statement to make but we know very well that it was stolen because we have seen it ourselves in several of the cathedrals of italy and france  but the relic that touched us most was the plain old sword of that stout crusader godfrey of bulloigneking godfrey of jerusalem  no blade in christendom wields such enchantment as thisno blade of all that rust in the ancestral halls of europe is able to invoke such visions of romance in the brain of him who looks upon itnone that can prate of such chivalric deeds or tell such brave tales of the warrior days of old  it stirs within a man every memory of the holy wars that has been sleeping in his brain for years and peoples his thoughts with mailclad images with marching armies with battles and with sieges  it speaks to him of baldwin and tancred the princely saladin and great richard of the lion heart  it was with just such blades as these that these splendid heroes of romance used to segregate a man so to speak and leave the half of him to fall one way and the other half the other  this very sword has cloven hundreds of saracen knights from crown to chin in those old times when godfrey wielded it  it was enchanted then by a genius that was under the command of king solomon  when danger approached its masters tent it always struck the shield and clanged out a fierce alarm upon the startled ear of night  in times of doubt or in fog or darkness if it were drawn from its sheath it would point instantly toward the foe and thus reveal the wayand it would also attempt to start after them of its own accord  a christian could not be so disguised that it would not know him and refuse to hurt himnor a moslem so disguised that it would not leap from its scabbard and take his life  these statements are all well authenticated in many legends that are among the most trustworthy legends the good old catholic monks preserve  i can never forget old godfreys sword now  i tried it on a moslem and clove him in twain like a doughnut  the spirit of grimes was upon me and if i had had a graveyard i would have destroyed all the infidels in jerusalem  i wiped the blood off the old sword and handed it back to the priesti did not want the fresh gore to obliterate those sacred spots that crimsoned its brightness one day six hundred years ago and thus gave godfrey warning that before the sun went down his journey of life would end  still moving through the gloom of the church of the holy sepulchre we came to a small chapel hewn out of the rocka place which has been known as the prison of our lord for many centuries  tradition says that here the saviour was confined just previously to the crucifixion under an altar by the door was a pair of stone stocks for human legs these things are called the bonds of christ and the use they were once put to has given them the name they now bear  the greek chapel is the most roomy the richest and the showiest chapel in the church of the holy sepulchre  its altar like that of all the greek churches is a lofty screen that extends clear across the chapel and is gorgeous with gilding and pictures  the numerous lamps that hang before it are of gold and silver and cost great sums  but the feature of the place is a short column that rises from the middle of the marble pavement of the chapel and marks the exact centre of the earth  the most reliable traditions tell us that this was known to be the earths centre ages ago and that when christ was upon earth he set all doubts upon the subject at rest forever by stating with his own lips that the tradition was correct  remember he said that that particular column stood upon the centre of the world  if the centre of the world changes the column changes its position accordingly  this column has moved three different times of its own accord  this is because in great convulsions of nature at three different times masses of the earth whole ranges of mountains probablyhave flown off into space thus lessening the diameter of the earth and changing the exact locality of its centre by a point or two  this is a very curious and interesting circumstance and is a withering rebuke to those philosophers who would make us believe that it is not possible for any portion of the earth to fly off into space  to satisfy himself that this spot was really the centre of the earth a sceptic once paid well for the privilege of ascending to the dome of the church to see if the sun gave him a shadow at noon  he came down perfectly convinced  the day was very cloudy and the sun threw no shadows at all but the man was satisfied that if the sun had come out and made shadows it could not have made any for him  proofs like these are not to be set aside by the idle tongues of cavilers  to such as are not bigoted and are willing to be convinced they carry a conviction that nothing can ever shake  if even greater proofs than those i have mentioned are wanted to satisfy the headstrong and the foolish that this is the genuine centre of the earth they are here  the greatest of them lies in the fact that from under this very column was taken the dust from which adam was made  this can surely be regarded in the light of a settler  it is not likely that the original first man would have been made from an inferior quality of earth when it was entirely convenient to get first quality from the worlds centre  this will strike any reflecting mind forcibly  that adam was formed of dirt procured in this very spot is amply proven by the fact that in six thousand years no man has ever been able to prove that the dirt was not procured here whereof he was made  it is a singular circumstance that right under the roof of this same great church and not far away from that illustrious column adam himself the father of the human race lies buried  there is no question that he is actually buried in the grave which is pointed out as his there can be nonebecause it has never yet been proven that that grave is not the grave in which he is buried  the tomb of adam  how touching it was here in a land of strangers far away from home and friends and all who cared for me thus to discover the grave of a blood relation  true a distant one but still a relation  the unerring instinct of nature thrilled its recognition  the fountain of my filial affection was stirred to its profoundest depths and i gave way to tumultuous emotion  i leaned upon a pillar and burst into tears  i deem it no shame to have wept over the grave of my poor dead relative  let him who would sneer at my emotion close this volume here for he will find little to his taste in my journeyings through holy land  noble old manhe did not live to see mehe did not live to see his child  and iialas i did not live to see him  weighed down by sorrow and disappointment he died before i was bornsix thousand brief summers before i was born  but let us try to bear it with fortitude let us trust that he is better off where he is  let us take comfort in the thought that his loss is our eternal gain  the next place the guide took us to in the holy church was an altar dedicated to the roman soldier who was of the military guard that attended at the crucifixion to keep order and whowhen the vail of the temple was rent in the awful darkness that followed when the rock of golgotha was split asunder by an earthquake when the artillery of heaven thundered and in the baleful glare of the lightnings the shrouded dead flitted about the streets of jerusalemshook with fear and said surely this was the son of god  where this altar stands now that roman soldier stood then in full view of the crucified saviourin full sight and hearing of all the marvels that were transpiring far and wide about the circumference of the hill of calvary  and in this selfsame spot the priests of the temple beheaded him for those blasphemous words he had spoken  in this altar they used to keep one of the most curious relics that human eyes ever looked upona thing that had power to fascinate the beholder in some mysterious way and keep him gazing for hours together  it was nothing less than the copper plate pilate put upon the saviours cross and upon which he wrote this is the king of the jews  i think st helena the mother of constantine found this wonderful memento when she was here in the third century  she traveled all over palestine and was always fortunate  whenever the good old enthusiast found a thing mentioned in her bible old or new she would go and search for that thing and never stop until she found it  if it was adam she would find adam if it was the ark she would find the ark if it was goliath or joshua she would find them  she found the inscription here that i was speaking of i think  she found it in this very spot close to where the martyred roman soldier stood  that copper plate is in one of the churches in rome now  any one can see it there  the inscription is very distinct  we passed along a few steps and saw the altar built over the very spot where the good catholic priests say the soldiers divided the raiment of the saviour  then we went down into a cavern which cavilers say was once a cistern it is a chapel now howeverthe chapel of st helena  it is fiftyone feet long by fortythree wide  in it is a marble chair which helena used to sit in while she superintended her workmen when they were digging and delving for the true cross  in this place is an altar dedicated to st dimas the penitent thief  a new bronze statue is herea statue of st helena  it reminded us of poor maximilian so lately shot  he presented it to this chapel when he was about to leave for his throne in mexico  from the cistern we descended twelve steps into a large roughlyshaped grotto carved wholly out of the living rock  helena blasted it out when she was searching for the true cross  she had a laborious piece of work here but it was richly rewarded  out of this place she got the crown of thorns the nails of the cross the true cross itself and the cross of the penitent thief  when she thought she had found every thing and was about to stop she was told in a dream to continue a day longer  it was very fortunate  she did so and found the cross of the other thief  the walls and roof of this grotto still weep bitter tears in memory of the event that transpired on calvary and devout pilgrims groan and sob when these sad tears fall upon them from the dripping rock  the monks call this apartment the chapel of the invention of the crossa name which is unfortunate because it leads the ignorant to imagine that a tacit acknowledgment is thus made that the tradition that helena found the true cross here is a fictionan invention  it is a happiness to know however that intelligent people do not doubt the story in any of its particulars  priests of any of the chapels and denominations in the church of the holy sepulchre can visit this sacred grotto to weep and pray and worship the gentle redeemer  two different congregations are not allowed to enter at the same time however because they always fight  still marching through the venerable church of the holy sepulchre among chanting priests in coarse long robes and sandals pilgrims of all colors and many nationalities in all sorts of strange costumes under dusky arches and by dingy piers and columns through a sombre cathedral gloom freighted with smoke and incense and faintly starred with scores of candles that appeared suddenly and as suddenly disappeared or drifted mysteriously hither and thither about the distant aisles like ghostly jackolanternswe came at last to a small chapel which is called the chapel of the mocking  under the altar was a fragment of a marble column this was the seat christ sat on when he was reviled and mockingly made king crowned with a crown of thorns and sceptred with a reed  it was here that they blindfolded him and struck him and said in derision prophesy who it is that smote thee  the tradition that this is the identical spot of the mocking is a very ancient one  the guide said that saewulf was the first to mention it  i do not know saewulf but still i cannot well refuse to receive his evidencenone of us can  they showed us where the great godfrey and his brother baldwin the first christian kings of jerusalem once lay buried by that sacred sepulchre they had fought so long and so valiantly to wrest from the hands of the infidel  but the niches that had contained the ashes of these renowned crusaders were empty  even the coverings of their tombs were gone destroyed by devout members of the greek church because godfrey and baldwin were latin princes and had been reared in a christian faith whose creed differed in some unimportant respects from theirs  we passed on and halted before the tomb of melchisedek  you will remember melchisedek no doubt he was the king who came out and levied a tribute on abraham the time that he pursued lots captors to dan and took all their property from them  that was about four thousand years ago and melchisedek died shortly afterward  however his tomb is in a good state of preservation  when one enters the church of the holy sepulchre the sepulchre itself is the first thing he desires to see and really is almost the first thing he does see  the next thing he has a strong yearning to see is the spot where the saviour was crucified  but this they exhibit last  it is the crowning glory of the place  one is grave and thoughtful when he stands in the little tomb of the saviourhe could not well be otherwise in such a placebut he has not the slightest possible belief that ever the lord lay there and so the interest he feels in the spot is very very greatly marred by that reflection  he looks at the place where mary stood in another part of the church and where john stood and mary magdalen where the mob derided the lord where the angel sat where the crown of thorns was found and the true cross where the risen saviour appeared he looks at all these places with interest but with the same conviction he felt in the case of the sepulchre that there is nothing genuine about them and that they are imaginary holy places created by the monks  but the place of the crucifixion affects him differently  he fully believes that he is looking upon the very spot where the savior gave up his life  he remembers that christ was very celebrated long before he came to jerusalem he knows that his fame was so great that crowds followed him all the time he is aware that his entry into the city produced a stirring sensation and that his reception was a kind of ovation he can not overlook the fact that when he was crucified there were very many in jerusalem who believed that he was the true son of god  to publicly execute such a personage was sufficient in itself to make the locality of the execution a memorable place for ages added to this the storm the darkness the earthquake the rending of the vail of the temple and the untimely waking of the dead were events calculated to fix the execution and the scene of it in the memory of even the most thoughtless witness fathers would tell their sons about the strange affair and point out the spot the sons would transmit the story to their children and thus a period of three hundred years would easily be spannedthe thought is mr primes not mine and is full of good sense  i borrowed it from his tent lifem  tat which time helena came and built a church upon calvary to commemorate the death and burial of the lord and preserve the sacred place in the memories of men since that time there has always been a church there  it is not possible that there can be any mistake about the locality of the crucifixion  not half a dozen persons knew where they buried the saviour perhaps and a burial is not a startling event any how therefore we can be pardoned for unbelief in the sepulchre but not in the place of the crucifixion  five hundred years hence there will be no vestige of bunker hill monument left but america will still know where the battle was fought and where warren fell  the crucifixion of christ was too notable an event in jerusalem and the hill of calvary made too celebrated by it to be forgotten in the short space of three hundred years  i climbed the stairway in the church which brings one to the top of the small inclosed pinnacle of rock and looked upon the place where the true cross once stood with a far more absorbing interest than i had ever felt in any thing earthly before  i could not believe that the three holes in the top of the rock were the actual ones the crosses stood in but i felt satisfied that those crosses had stood so near the place now occupied by them that the few feet of possible difference were a matter of no consequence  when one stands where the saviour was crucified he finds it all he can do to keep it strictly before his mind that christ was not crucified in a catholic church  he must remind himself every now and then that the great event transpired in the open air and not in a gloomy candlelighted cell in a little corner of a vast church upstairs a small cell all bejeweled and bespangled with flashy ornamentation in execrable taste  under a marble altar like a table is a circular hole in the marble floor corresponding with the one just under it in which the true cross stood  the first thing every one does is to kneel down and take a candle and examine this hole  he does this strange prospecting with an amount of gravity that can never be estimated or appreciated by a man who has not seen the operation  then he holds his candle before a richly engraved picture of the saviour done on a messy slab of gold and wonderfully rayed and starred with diamonds which hangs above the hole within the altar and his solemnity changes to lively admiration  he rises and faces the finely wrought figures of the saviour and the malefactors uplifted upon their crosses behind the altar and bright with a metallic lustre of many colors  he turns next to the figures close to them of the virgin and mary magdalen next to the rift in the living rock made by the earthquake at the time of the crucifixion and an extension of which he had seen before in the wall of one of the grottoes below he looks next at the showcase with a figure of the virgin in it and is amazed at the princely fortune in precious gems and jewelry that hangs so thickly about the form as to hide it like a garment almost  all about the apartment the gaudy trappings of the greek church offend the eye and keep the mind on the rack to remember that this is the place of the crucifixiongolgothathe mount of calvary  and the last thing he looks at is that which was also the firstthe place where the true cross stood  that will chain him to the spot and compel him to look once more and once again after he has satisfied all curiosity and lost all interest concerning the other matters pertaining to the locality  and so i close my chapter on the church of the holy sepulchrethe most sacred locality on earth to millions and millions of men and women and children the noble and the humble bond and free  in its history from the first and in its tremendous associations it is the most illustrious edifice in christendom  with all its claptrap sideshows and unseemly impostures of every kind it is still grand reverend venerablefor a god died there for fifteen hundred years its shrines have been wet with the tears of pilgrims from the earths remotest confines for more than two hundred the most gallant knights that ever wielded sword wasted their lives away in a struggle to seize it and hold it sacred from infidel pollution  even in our own day a war that cost millions of treasure and rivers of blood was fought because two rival nations claimed the sole right to put a new dome upon it  history is full of this old church of the holy sepulchrefull of blood that was shed because of the respect and the veneration in which men held the last restingplace of the meek and lowly the mild and gentle prince of peace     chapter liv  we were standing in a narrow street by the tower of antonio  on these stones that are crumbling away the guide said the saviour sat and rested before taking up the cross  this is the beginning of the sorrowful way or the way of grief  the party took note of the sacred spot and moved on  we passed under the ecce homo arch and saw the very window from which pilates wife warned her husband to have nothing to do with the persecution of the just man  this window is in an excellent state of preservation considering its great age  they showed us where jesus rested the second time and where the mob refused to give him up and said let his blood be upon our heads and upon our childrens children forever  the french catholics are building a church on this spot and with their usual veneration for historical relics are incorporating into the new such scraps of ancient walls as they have found there  further on we saw the spot where the fainting saviour fell under the weight of his cross  a great granite column of some ancient temple lay there at the time and the heavy cross struck it such a blow that it broke in two in the middle  such was the guides story when he halted us before the broken column  we crossed a street and came presently to the former residence of st veronica  when the saviour passed there she came out full of womanly compassion and spoke pitying words to him undaunted by the hootings and the threatenings of the mob and wiped the perspiration from his face with her handkerchief  we had heard so much of st veronica and seen her picture by so many masters that it was like meeting an old friend unexpectedly to come upon her ancient home in jerusalem  the strangest thing about the incident that has made her name so famous is that when she wiped the perspiration away the print of the saviours face remained upon the handkerchief a perfect portrait and so remains unto this day we knew this because we saw this handkerchief in a cathedral in paris in another in spain and in two others in italy  in the milan cathedral it costs five francs to see it and at st peters at rome it is almost impossible to see it at any price  no tradition is so amply verified as this of st veronica and her handkerchief  at the next corner we saw a deep indention in the hard stone masonry of the corner of a house but might have gone heedlessly by it but that the guide said it was made by the elbow of the saviour who stumbled here and fell  presently we came to just such another indention in a stone wall the guide said the saviour fell here also and made this depression with his elbow  there were other places where the lord fell and others where he rested but one of the most curious landmarks of ancient history we found on this morning walk through the crooked lanes that lead toward calvary was a certain stone built into a housea stone that was so seamed and scarred that it bore a sort of grotesque resemblance to the human face  the projections that answered for cheeks were worn smooth by the passionate kisses of generations of pilgrims from distant lands  we asked why the guide said it was because this was one of the very stones of jerusalem that christ mentioned when he was reproved for permitting the people to cry hosannah  when he made his memorable entry into the city upon an ass  one of the pilgrims said but there is no evidence that the stones did cry outchrist said that if the people stopped from shouting hosannah the very stones would do it  the guide was perfectly serene  he said calmly this is one of the stones that would have cried out it was of little use to try to shake this fellows simple faithit was easy to see that  and so we came at last to another wonder of deep and abiding interest the veritable house where the unhappy wretch once lived who has been celebrated in song and story for more than eighteen hundred years as the wandering jew  on the memorable day of the crucifixion he stood in this old doorway with his arms akimbo looking out upon the struggling mob that was approaching and when the weary saviour would have sat down and rested him a moment pushed him rudely away and said move on  the lord said move on thou likewise and the command has never been revoked from that day to this  all men know how that the miscreant upon whose head that just curse fell has roamed up and down the wide world for ages and ages seeking rest and never finding itcourting death but always in vainlonging to stop in city in wilderness in desert solitudes yet hearing always that relentless warning to marchmarch on they saydo these hoary traditionsthat when titus sacked jerusalem and slaughtered eleven hundred thousand jews in her streets and byways the wandering jew was seen always in the thickest of the fight and that when battleaxes gleamed in the air he bowed his head beneath them when swords flashed their deadly lightnings he sprang in their way he bared his breast to whizzing javelins to hissing arrows to any and to every weapon that promised death and forgetfulness and rest  but it was uselesshe walked forth out of the carnage without a wound  and it is said that five hundred years afterward he followed mahomet when he carried destruction to the cities of arabia and then turned against him hoping in this way to win the death of a traitor  his calculations were wrong again  no quarter was given to any living creature but one and that was the only one of all the host that did not want it  he sought death five hundred years later in the wars of the crusades and offered himself to famine and pestilence at ascalon  he escaped againhe could not die  these repeated annoyances could have at last but one effect they shook his confidence  since then the wandering jew has carried on a kind of desultory toying with the most promising of the aids and implements of destruction but with small hope as a general thing  he has speculated some in cholera and railroads and has taken almost a lively interest in infernal machines and patent medicines  he is old now and grave as becomes an age like his he indulges in no light amusements save that he goes sometimes to executions and is fond of funerals  there is one thing he can not avoid go where he will about the world he must never fail to report in jerusalem every fiftieth year  only a year or two ago he was here for the thirtyseventh time since jesus was crucified on calvary  they say that many old people who are here now saw him then and had seen him before  he looks always the sameold and withered and holloweyed and listless save that there is about him something which seems to suggest that he is looking for some one expecting some onethe friends of his youth perhaps  but the most of them are dead now  he always pokes about the old streets looking lonesome making his mark on a wall here and there and eyeing the oldest buildings with a sort of friendly half interest and he sheds a few tears at the threshold of his ancient dwelling and bitter bitter tears they are  then he collects his rent and leaves again  he has been seen standing near the church of the holy sepulchre on many a starlight night for he has cherished an idea for many centuries that if he could only enter there he could rest  but when he approaches the doors slam to with a crash the earth trembles and all the lights in jerusalem burn a ghastly blue  he does this every fifty years just the same  it is hopeless but then it is hard to break habits one has been eighteen hundred years accustomed to  the old tourist is far away on his wanderings now  how he must smile to see a pack of blockheads like us galloping about the world and looking wise and imagining we are finding out a good deal about it  he must have a consuming contempt for the ignorant complacent asses that go skurrying about the world in these railroading days and call it traveling  when the guide pointed out where the wandering jew had left his familiar mark upon a wall i was filled with astonishment  it read                           s t1860x  all i have revealed about the wandering jew can be amply proven by reference to our guide  the mighty mosque of omar and the paved court around it occupy a fourth part of jerusalem  they are upon mount moriah where king solomons temple stood  this mosque is the holiest place the mohammedan knows outside of mecca  up to within a year or two past no christian could gain admission to it or its court for love or money  but the prohibition has been removed and we entered freely for bucksheesh  i need not speak of the wonderful beauty and the exquisite grace and symmetry that have made this mosque so celebratedbecause i did not see them  one can not see such things at an instant glanceone frequently only finds out how really beautiful a really beautiful woman is after considerable acquaintance with her and the rule applies to niagara falls to majestic mountains and to mosquesespecially to mosques  the great feature of the mosque of omar is the prodigious rock in the centre of its rotunda  it was upon this rock that abraham came so near offering up his son isaacthis at least is authenticit is very much more to be relied on than most of the traditions at any rate  on this rock also the angel stood and threatened jerusalem and david persuaded him to spare the city  mahomet was well acquainted with this stone from it he ascended to heaven  the stone tried to follow him and if the angel gabriel had not happened by the merest good luck to be there to seize it it would have done it  very few people have a grip like gabrielthe prints of his monstrous fingers two inches deep are to be seen in that rock today  this rock large as it is is suspended in the air  it does not touch any thing at all  the guide said so  this is very wonderful  in the place on it where mahomet stood he left his footprints in the solid stone  i should judge that he wore about eighteens  but what i was going to say when i spoke of the rock being suspended was that in the floor of the cavern under it they showed us a slab which they said covered a hole which was a thing of extraordinary interest to all mohammedans because that hole leads down to perdition and every soul that is transferred from thence to heaven must pass up through this orifice  mahomet stands there and lifts them out by the hair  all mohammedans shave their heads but they are careful to leave a lock of hair for the prophet to take hold of  our guide observed that a good mohammedan would consider himself doomed to stay with the damned forever if he were to lose his scalplock and die before it grew again  the most of them that i have seen ought to stay with the damned any how without reference to how they were barbered  for several ages no woman has been allowed to enter the cavern where that important hole is  the reason is that one of the sex was once caught there blabbing every thing she knew about what was going on above ground to the rapscallions in the infernal regions down below  she carried her gossiping to such an extreme that nothing could be kept privatenothing could be done or said on earth but every body in perdition knew all about it before the sun went down  it was about time to suppress this womans telegraph and it was promptly done  her breath subsided about the same time  the inside of the great mosque is very showy with variegated marble walls and with windows and inscriptions of elaborate mosaic  the turks have their sacred relics like the catholics  the guide showed us the veritable armor worn by the great soninlaw and successor of mahomet and also the buckler of mahomets uncle  the great iron railing which surrounds the rock was ornamented in one place with a thousand rags tied to its open work  these are to remind mahomet not to forget the worshipers who placed them there  it is considered the next best thing to tying threads around his finger by way of reminders  just outside the mosque is a miniature temple which marks the spot where david and goliah used to sit and judge the peoplea pilgrim informs me that it was not david and goliah but david and saul  i stick to my own statementthe guide told me and he ought to know  every where about the mosque of omar are portions of pillars curiously wrought altars and fragments of elegantly carved marbleprecious remains of solomons temple  these have been dug from all depths in the soil and rubbish of mount moriah and the moslems have always shown a disposition to preserve them with the utmost care  at that portion of the ancient wall of solomons temple which is called the jews place of wailing and where the hebrews assemble every friday to kiss the venerated stones and weep over the fallen greatness of zion any one can see a part of the unquestioned and undisputed temple of solomon the same consisting of three or four stones lying one upon the other each of which is about twice as long as a sevenoctave piano and about as thick as such a piano is high  but as i have remarked before it is only a year or two ago that the ancient edict prohibiting christian rubbish like ourselves to enter the mosque of omar and see the costly marbles that once adorned the inner temple was annulled  the designs wrought upon these fragments are all quaint and peculiar and so the charm of novelty is added to the deep interest they naturally inspire  one meets with these venerable scraps at every turn especially in the neighboring mosque el aksa into whose inner walls a very large number of them are carefully built for preservation  these pieces of stone stained and dusty with age dimly hint at a grandeur we have all been taught to regard as the princeliest ever seen on earth and they call up pictures of a pageant that is familiar to all imaginationscamels laden with spices and treasurebeautiful slaves presents for solomons harema long cavalcade of richly caparisoned beasts and warriorsand shebas queen in the van of this vision of oriental magnificence  these elegant fragments bear a richer interest than the solemn vastness of the stones the jews kiss in the place of wailing can ever have for the heedless sinner  down in the hollow ground underneath the olives and the orangetrees that flourish in the court of the great mosque is a wilderness of pillarsremains of the ancient temple they supported it  there are ponderous archways down there also over which the destroying plough of prophecy passed harmless  it is pleasant to know we are disappointed in that we never dreamed we might see portions of the actual temple of solomon and yet experience no shadow of suspicion that they were a monkish humbug and a fraud  we are surfeited with sights  nothing has any fascination for us now but the church of the holy sepulchre  we have been there every day and have not grown tired of it but we are weary of every thing else  the sights are too many  they swarm about you at every step no single foot of ground in all jerusalem or within its neighborhood seems to be without a stirring and important history of its own  it is a very relief to steal a walk of a hundred yards without a guide along to talk unceasingly about every stone you step upon and drag you back ages and ages to the day when it achieved celebrity  it seems hardly real when i find myself leaning for a moment on a ruined wall and looking listlessly down into the historic pool of bethesda  i did not think such things could be so crowded together as to diminish their interest  but in serious truth we have been drifting about for several days using our eyes and our ears more from a sense of duty than any higher and worthier reason  and too often we have been glad when it was time to go home and be distressed no more about illustrious localities  our pilgrims compress too much into one day  one can gorge sights to repletion as well as sweetmeats  since we breakfasted this morning we have seen enough to have furnished us food for a years reflection if we could have seen the various objects in comfort and looked upon them deliberately  we visited the pool of hezekiah where david saw uriahs wife coming from the bath and fell in love with her  we went out of the city by the jaffa gate and of course were told many things about its tower of hippicus  we rode across the valley of hinnom between two of the pools of gihon and by an aqueduct built by solomon which still conveys water to the city  we ascended the hill of evil counsel where judas received his thirty pieces of silver and we also lingered a moment under the tree a venerable tradition says he hanged himself on  we descended to the canon again and then the guide began to give name and history to every bank and boulder we came to this was the field of blood these cuttings in the rocks were shrines and temples of moloch here they sacrificed children yonder is the zion gate the tyropean valley the hill of ophel here is the junction of the valley of jehoshaphaton your right is the well of job  we turned up jehoshaphat  the recital went on  this is the mount of olives this is the hill of offense the nest of huts is the village of siloam here yonder every where is the kings garden under this great tree zacharias the high priest was murdered yonder is mount moriah and the temple wall the tomb of absalom the tomb of st james the tomb of zacharias beyond are the garden of gethsemane and the tomb of the virgin mary here is the pool of siloam and  we said we would dismount and quench our thirst and rest  we were burning up with the heat  we were failing under the accumulated fatigue of days and days of ceaseless marching  all were willing  the pool is a deep walled ditch through which a clear stream of water runs that comes from under jerusalem somewhere and passing through the fountain of the virgin or being supplied from it reaches this place by way of a tunnel of heavy masonry  the famous pool looked exactly as it looked in solomons time no doubt and the same dusky oriental women came down in their old oriental way and carried off jars of the water on their heads just as they did three thousand years ago and just as they will do fifty thousand years hence if any of them are still left on earth  we went away from there and stopped at the fountain of the virgin  but the water was not good and there was no comfort or peace any where on account of the regiment of boys and girls and beggars that persecuted us all the time for bucksheesh  the guide wanted us to give them some money and we did it but when he went on to say that they were starving to death we could not but feel that we had done a great sin in throwing obstacles in the way of such a desirable consummation and so we tried to collect it back but it could not be done  we entered the garden of gethsemane and we visited the tomb of the virgin both of which we had seen before  it is not meet that i should speak of them now  a more fitting time will come  i can not speak now of the mount of olives or its view of jerusalem the dead sea and the mountains of moab nor of the damascus gate or the tree that was planted by king godfrey of jerusalem  one ought to feel pleasantly when he talks of these things  i can not say any thing about the stone column that projects over jehoshaphat from the temple wall like a cannon except that the moslems believe mahomet will sit astride of it when he comes to judge the world  it is a pity he could not judge it from some roost of his own in mecca without trespassing on our holy ground  close by is the golden gate in the temple walla gate that was an elegant piece of sculpture in the time of the temple and is even so yet  from it in ancient times the jewish high priest turned loose the scapegoat and let him flee to the wilderness and bear away his twelvemonth load of the sins of the people  if they were to turn one loose now he would not get as far as the garden of gethsemane till these miserable vagabonds here would gobble him upfavorite pilgrim expressionsins and all  they wouldnt care  muttonchops and sin is good enough living for them  the moslems watch the golden gate with a jealous eye and an anxious one for they have an honored tradition that when it falls islamism will fall and with it the ottoman empire it did not grieve me any to notice that the old gate was getting a little shaky  we are at home again  we are exhausted  the sun has roasted us almost we have full comfort in one reflection however  our experiences in europe have taught us that in time this fatigue will be forgotten the heat will be forgotten the thirst the tiresome volubility of the guide the persecutions of the beggarsand then all that will be left will be pleasant memories of jerusalem memories we shall call up with always increasing interest as the years go by memories which some day will become all beautiful when the last annoyance that incumbers them shall have faded out of our minds never again to return  schoolboy days are no happier than the days of after life but we look back upon them regretfully because we have forgotten our punishments at school and how we grieved when our marbles were lost and our kites destroyedbecause we have forgotten all the sorrows and privations of that canonized epoch and remember only its orchard robberies its wooden sword pageants and its fishing holydays  we are satisfied  we can wait  our reward will come to us jerusalem and todays experiences will be an enchanted memory a year hencememory which money could not buy from us     chapter lv  we cast up the account  it footed up pretty fairly  there was nothing more at jerusalem to be seen except the traditional houses of dives and lazarus of the parable the tombs of the kings and those of the judges the spot where they stoned one of the disciples to death and beheaded another the room and the table made celebrated by the last supper the figtree that jesus withered a number of historical places about gethsemane and the mount of olives and fifteen or twenty others in different portions of the city itself  we were approaching the end  human nature asserted itself now overwork and consequent exhaustion began to have their natural effect they began to master the energies and dull the ardor of the party perfectly secure now against failing to accomplish any detail of the pilgrimage they felt like drawing in advance upon the holiday soon to be placed to their credit  they grew a little lazy  they were late to breakfast and sat long at dinner  thirty or forty pilgrims had arrived from the ship by the short routes and much swapping of gossip had to be indulged in  and in hot afternoons they showed a strong disposition to lie on the cool divans in the hotel and smoke and talk about pleasant experiences of a month or so gone byfor even thus early do episodes of travel which were sometimes annoying sometimes exasperating and full as often of no consequence at all when they transpired begin to rise above the dead level of monotonous reminiscences and become shapely landmarks in ones memory  the fogwhistle smothered among a million of trifling sounds is not noticed a block away in the city but the sailor hears it far at sea whither none of those thousands of trifling sounds can reach when one is in rome all the domes are alike but when he has gone away twelve miles the city fades utterly from sight and leaves st peters swelling above the level plain like an anchored balloon  when one is traveling in europe the daily incidents seem all alike but when he has placed them all two months and two thousand miles behind him those that were worthy of being remembered are prominent and those that were really insignificant have vanished  this disposition to smoke and idle and talk was not well  it was plain that it must not be allowed to gain ground  a diversion must be tried or demoralization would ensue  the jordan jericho and the dead sea were suggested  the remainder of jerusalem must be left unvisited for a little while  the journey was approved at once  new life stirred in every pulse  in the saddle abroad on the plainssleeping in beds bounded only by the horizon fancy was at work with these things in a momentit was painful to note how readily these townbred men had taken to the free life of the camp and the desert the nomadic instinct is a human instinct it was born with adam and transmitted through the patriarchs and after thirty centuries of steady effort civilization has not educated it entirely out of us yet  it has a charm which once tasted a man will yearn to taste again the nomadic instinct can not be educated out of an indian at all  the jordan journey being approved our dragoman was notified  at nine in the morning the caravan was before the hotel door and we were at breakfast  there was a commotion about the place  rumors of war and bloodshed were flying every where  the lawless bedouins in the valley of the jordan and the deserts down by the dead sea were up in arms and were going to destroy all comers  they had had a battle with a troop of turkish cavalry and defeated them several men killed  they had shut up the inhabitants of a village and a turkish garrison in an old fort near jericho and were besieging them  they had marched upon a camp of our excursionists by the jordan and the pilgrims only saved their lives by stealing away and flying to jerusalem under whip and spur in the darkness of the night  another of our parties had been fired on from an ambush and then attacked in the open day  shots were fired on both sides fortunately there was no bloodshed  we spoke with the very pilgrim who had fired one of the shots and learned from his own lips how in this imminent deadly peril only the cool courage of the pilgrims their strength of numbers and imposing display of war material had saved them from utter destruction  it was reported that the consul had requested that no more of our pilgrims should go to the jordan while this state of things lasted and further that he was unwilling that any more should go at least without an unusually strong military guard  here was trouble  but with the horses at the door and every body aware of what they were there for what would you have done  acknowledged that you were afraid and backed shamefully out  hardly  it would not be human nature where there were so many women  you would have done as we did said you were not afraid of a million bedouinsand made your will and proposed quietly to yourself to take up an unostentatious position in the rear of the procession  i think we must all have determined upon the same line of tactics for it did seem as if we never would get to jericho  i had a notoriously slow horse but somehow i could not keep him in the rear to save my neck he was forever turning up in the lead  in such cases i trembled a little and got down to fix my saddle  but it was not of any use  the others all got down to fix their saddles too  i never saw such a time with saddles  it was the first time any of them had got out of order in three weeks and now they had all broken down at once  i tried walking for exercisei had not had enough in jerusalem searching for holy places  but it was a failure  the whole mob were suffering for exercise and it was not fifteen minutes till they were all on foot and i had the lead again  it was very discouraging  this was all after we got beyond bethany  we stopped at the village of bethany an hour out from jerusalem  they showed us the tomb of lazarus i had rather live in it than in any house in the town  and they showed us also a large fountain of lazarus and in the centre of the village the ancient dwelling of lazarus  lazarus appears to have been a man of property  the legends of the sunday schools do him great injustice they give one the impression that he was poor  it is because they get him confused with that lazarus who had no merit but his virtue and virtue never has been as respectable as money  the house of lazarus is a threestory edifice of stone masonry but the accumulated rubbish of ages has buried all of it but the upper story  we took candles and descended to the dismal celllike chambers where jesus sat at meat with martha and mary and conversed with them about their brother  we could not but look upon these old dingy apartments with a more than common interest  we had had a glimpse from a mountain top of the dead sea lying like a blue shield in the plain of the jordan and now we were marching down a close flaming rugged desolate defile where no living creature could enjoy life except perhaps a salamander  it was such a dreary repulsive horrible solitude  it was the wilderness where john preached with camels hair about his loinsraiment enoughbut he never could have got his locusts and wild honey here  we were moping along down through this dreadful place every man in the rear  our guardstwo gorgeous young arab sheiks with cargoes of swords guns pistols and daggers on boardwere loafing ahead  bedouins  every man shrunk up and disappeared in his clothes like a mudturtle my first impulse was to dash forward and destroy the bedouins  my second was to dash to the rear to see if there were any coming in that direction  i acted on the latter impulse  so did all the others  if any bedouins had approached us then from that point of the compass they would have paid dearly for their rashness  we all remarked that afterwards  there would have been scenes of riot and bloodshed there that no pen could describe  i know that because each man told what he would have done individually and such a medley of strange and unheardof inventions of cruelty you could not conceive of  one man said he had calmly made up his mind to perish where he stood if need be but never yield an inch he was going to wait with deadly patience till he could count the stripes upon the first bedouins jacket and then count them and let him have it  another was going to sit still till the first lance reached within an inch of his breast and then dodge it and seize it  i forbear to tell what he was going to do to that bedouin that owned it it makes my blood run cold to think of it another was going to scalp such bedouins as fell to his share and take his baldheaded sons of the desert home with him alive for trophies but the wildeyed pilgrim rhapsodist was silent  his orbs gleamed with a deadly light but his lips moved not  anxiety grew and he was questioned  if he had got a bedouin what would he have done with him shot him  he smiled a smile of grim contempt and shook his head would he have stabbed him  another shake  would he have quartered him flayed him  more shakes  oh horror what would he have done  eat him  such was the awful sentence that thundered from his lips  what was grammar to a desperado like that  i was glad in my heart that i had been spared these scenes of malignant carnage  no bedouins attacked our terrible rear  and none attacked the front  the newcomers were only a reinforcement of cadaverous arabs in shirts and bare legs sent far ahead of us to brandish rusty guns and shout and brag and carry on like lunatics and thus scare away all bands of marauding bedouins that might lurk about our path  what a shame it is that armed white christians must travel under guard of vermin like this as a protection against the prowling vagabonds of the desertthose sanguinary outlaws who are always going to do something desperate but never do it  i may as well mention here that on our whole trip we saw no bedouins and had no more use for an arab guard than we could have had for patent leather boots and white kid gloves  the bedouins that attacked the other parties of pilgrims so fiercely were provided for the occasion by the arab guards of those parties and shipped from jerusalem for temporary service as bedouins they met together in full view of the pilgrims after the battle and took lunch divided the bucksheesh extorted in the season of danger and then accompanied the cavalcade home to the city  the nuisance of an arab guard is one which is created by the sheiks and the bedouins together for mutual profit it is said and no doubt there is a good deal of truth in it  we visited the fountain the prophet elisha sweetened it is sweet yet where he remained some time and was fed by the ravens  ancient jericho is not very picturesque as a ruin  when joshua marched around it seven times some three thousand years ago and blew it down with his trumpet he did the work so well and so completely that he hardly left enough of the city to cast a shadow  the curse pronounced against the rebuilding of it has never been removed  one king holding the curse in light estimation made the attempt but was stricken sorely for his presumption  its site will always remain unoccupied and yet it is one of the very best locations for a town we have seen in all palestine  at two in the morning they routed us out of bedanother piece of unwarranted crueltyanother stupid effort of our dragoman to get ahead of a rival  it was not two hours to the jordan  however we were dressed and under way before any one thought of looking to see what time it was and so we drowsed on through the chill night air and dreamed of camp fires warm beds and other comfortable things  there was no conversation  people do not talk when they are cold and wretched and sleepy  we nodded in the saddle at times and woke up with a start to find that the procession had disappeared in the gloom then there was energy and attention to business until its dusky outlines came in sight again  occasionally the order was passed in a low voice down the line close upclose up  bedouins lurk here every where what an exquisite shudder it sent shivering along ones spine  we reached the famous river before four oclock and the night was so black that we could have ridden into it without seeing it  some of us were in an unhappy frame of mind  we waited and waited for daylight but it did not come  finally we went away in the dark and slept an hour on the ground in the bushes and caught cold  it was a costly nap on that account but otherwise it was a paying investment because it brought unconsciousness of the dreary minutes and put us in a somewhat fitter mood for a first glimpse of the sacred river  with the first suspicion of dawn every pilgrim took off his clothes and waded into the dark torrent singing                 on jordans stormy banks i stand                and cast a wistful eye                to canaans fair and happy land                where my possessions lie  but they did not sing long  the water was so fearfully cold that they were obliged to stop singing and scamper out again  then they stood on the bank shivering and so chagrined and so grieved that they merited holiest compassion  because another dream another cherished hope had failed  they had promised themselves all along that they would cross the jordan where the israelites crossed it when they entered canaan from their long pilgrimage in the desert  they would cross where the twelve stones were placed in memory of that great event  while they did it they would picture to themselves that vast army of pilgrims marching through the cloven waters bearing the hallowed ark of the covenant and shouting hosannahs and singing songs of thanksgiving and praise  each had promised himself that he would be the first to cross  they were at the goal of their hopes at last but the current was too swift the water was too cold  it was then that jack did them a service  with that engaging recklessness of consequences which is natural to youth and so proper and so seemly as well he went and led the way across the jordan and all was happiness again  every individual waded over then and stood upon the further bank  the water was not quite breast deep any where  if it had been more we could hardly have accomplished the feat for the strong current would have swept us down the stream and we would have been exhausted and drowned before reaching a place where we could make a landing  the main object compassed the drooping miserable party sat down to wait for the sun again for all wanted to see the water as well as feel it  but it was too cold a pastime  some cans were filled from the holy river some canes cut from its banks and then we mounted and rode reluctantly away to keep from freezing to death  so we saw the jordan very dimly  the thickets of bushes that bordered its banks threw their shadows across its shallow turbulent waters stormy the hymn makes them which is rather a complimentary stretch of fancy and we could not judge of the width of the stream by the eye  we knew by our wading experience however that many streets in america are double as wide as the jordan  daylight came soon after we got under way and in the course of an hour or two we reached the dead sea  nothing grows in the flat burning desert around it but weeds and the dead sea apple the poets say is beautiful to the eye but crumbles to ashes and dust when you break it such as we found were not handsome but they were bitter to the taste they yielded no dust  it was because they were not ripe perhaps  the desert and the barren hills gleam painfully in the sun around the dead sea and there is no pleasant thing or living creature upon it or about its borders to cheer the eye  it is a scorching arid repulsive solitude  a silence broods over the scene that is depressing to the spirits  it makes one think of funerals and death  the dead sea is small  its waters are very clear and it has a pebbly bottom and is shallow for some distance out from the shores  it yields quantities of asphaltum fragments of it lie all about its banks this stuff gives the place something of an unpleasant smell  all our reading had taught us to expect that the first plunge into the dead sea would be attended with distressing resultsour bodies would feel as if they were suddenly pierced by millions of redhot needles the dreadful smarting would continue for hours we might even look to be blistered from head to foot and suffer miserably for many days  we were disappointed  our eight sprang in at the same time that another party of pilgrims did and nobody screamed once  none of them ever did complain of any thing more than a slight pricking sensation in places where their skin was abraded and then only for a short time  my face smarted for a couple of hours but it was partly because i got it badly sunburned while i was bathing and staid in so long that it became plastered over with salt  no the water did not blister us it did not cover us with a slimy ooze and confer upon us an atrocious fragrance it was not very slimy and i could not discover that we smelt really any worse than we have always smelt since we have been in palestine  it was only a different kind of smell but not conspicuous on that account because we have a great deal of variety in that respect  we didnt smell there on the jordan the same as we do in jerusalem and we dont smell in jerusalem just as we did in nazareth or tiberias or cesarea philippi or any of those other ruinous ancient towns in galilee  no we change all the time and generally for the worse  we do our own washing  it was a funny bath  we could not sink  one could stretch himself at full length on his back with his arms on his breast and all of his body above a line drawn from the corner of his jaw past the middle of his side the middle of his leg and through his ancle bone would remain out of water  he could lift his head clear out if he chose  no position can be retained long you lose your balance and whirl over first on your back and then on your face and so on  you can lie comfortably on your back with your head out and your legs out from your knees down by steadying yourself with your hands  you can sit with your knees drawn up to your chin and your arms clasped around them but you are bound to turn over presently because you are topheavy in that position  you can stand up straight in water that is over your head and from the middle of your breast upward you will not be wet  but you can not remain so  the water will soon float your feet to the surface  you can not swim on your back and make any progress of any consequence because your feet stick away above the surface and there is nothing to propel yourself with but your heels  if you swim on your face you kick up the water like a sternwheel boat  you make no headway  a horse is so topheavy that he can neither swim nor stand up in the dead sea  he turns over on his side at once  some of us bathed for more than an hour and then came out coated with salt till we shone like icicles  we scrubbed it off with a coarse towel and rode off with a splendid brandnew smell though it was one which was not any more disagreeable than those we have been for several weeks enjoying  it was the variegated villainy and novelty of it that charmed us  salt crystals glitter in the sun about the shores of the lake  in places they coat the ground like a brilliant crust of ice  when i was a boy i somehow got the impression that the river jordan was four thousand miles long and thirtyfive miles wide  it is only ninety miles long and so crooked that a man does not know which side of it he is on half the time  in going ninety miles it does not get over more than fifty miles of ground  it is not any wider than broadway in new york  there is the sea of galilee and this dead seaneither of them twenty miles long or thirteen wide  and yet when i was in sunday school i thought they were sixty thousand miles in diameter  travel and experience mar the grandest pictures and rob us of the most cherished traditions of our boyhood  well let them go  i have already seen the empire of king solomon diminish to the size of the state of pennsylvania i suppose i can bear the reduction of the seas and the river  we looked every where as we passed along but never saw grain or crystal of lots wife  it was a great disappointment  for many and many a year we had known her sad story and taken that interest in her which misfortune always inspires  but she was gone  her picturesque form no longer looms above the desert of the dead sea to remind the tourist of the doom that fell upon the lost cities  i can not describe the hideous afternoons ride from the dead sea to mars saba  it oppresses me yet to think of it  the sun so pelted us that the tears ran down our cheeks once or twice  the ghastly treeless grassless breathless canons smothered us as if we had been in an oven the sun had positive weight to it i think  not a man could sit erect under it  all drooped low in the saddles  john preached in this wilderness  it must have been exhausting work  what a very heaven the messy towers and ramparts of vast mars saba looked to us when we caught a first glimpse of them  we staid at this great convent all night guests of the hospitable priests  mars saba perched upon a crag a human nest stock high up against a perpendicular mountain wall is a world of grand masonry that rises terrace upon terrace away above your head like the terraced and retreating colonnades one sees in fanciful pictures of belshazzars feast and the palaces of the ancient pharaohs  no other human dwelling is near  it was founded many ages ago by a holy recluse who lived at first in a cave in the rocka cave which is inclosed in the convent walls now and was reverently shown to us by the priests  this recluse by his rigorous torturing of his flesh his diet of bread and water his utter withdrawal from all society and from the vanities of the world and his constant prayer and saintly contemplation of a skull inspired an emulation that brought about him many disciples  the precipice on the opposite side of the canyon is well perforated with the small holes they dug in the rock to live in  the present occupants of mars saba about seventy in number are all hermits  they wear a coarse robe an ugly brimless stovepipe of a hat and go without shoes  they eat nothing whatever but bread and salt they drink nothing but water  as long as they live they can never go outside the walls or look upon a womanfor no woman is permitted to enter mars saba upon any pretext whatsoever  some of those men have been shut up there for thirty years  in all that dreary time they have not heard the laughter of a child or the blessed voice of a woman they have seen no human tears no human smiles they have known no human joys no wholesome human sorrows  in their hearts are no memories of the past in their brains no dreams of the future all that is lovable beautiful worthy they have put far away from them against all things that are pleasant to look upon and all sounds that are music to the ear they have barred their massive doors and reared their relentless walls of stone forever  they have banished the tender grace of life and left only the sapped and skinny mockery  their lips are lips that never kiss and never sing their hearts are hearts that never hate and never love their breasts are breasts that never swell with the sentiment i have a country and a flag  they are dead men who walk  i set down these first thoughts because they are naturalnot because they are just or because it is right to set them down  it is easy for bookmakers to say i thought so and so as i looked upon such and such a scenewhen the truth is they thought all those fine things afterwards ones first thought is not likely to be strictly accurate yet it is no crime to think it and none to write it down subject to modification by later experience  these hermits are dead men in several respects but not in all and it is not proper that thinking ill of them at first i should go on doing so or speaking ill of them i should reiterate the words and stick to them  no they treated us too kindly for that  there is something human about them somewhere  they knew we were foreigners and protestants and not likely to feel admiration or much friendliness toward them  but their large charity was above considering such things they simply saw in us men who were hungry and thirsty and tired and that was sufficient  they opened their doors and gave us welcome  they asked no questions and they made no selfrighteous display of their hospitality  they fished for no compliments  they moved quietly about setting the table for us making the beds and bringing water to wash in and paid no heed when we said it was wrong for them to do that when we had men whose business it was to perform such offices  we fared most comfortably and sat late at dinner  we walked all over the building with the hermits afterward and then sat on the lofty battlements and smoked while we enjoyed the cool air the wild scenery and the sunset one or two chose cosy bedrooms to sleep in but the nomadic instinct prompted the rest to sleep on the broad divan that extended around the great hall because it seemed like sleeping out of doors and so was more cheery and inviting  it was a royal rest we had  when we got up to breakfast in the morning we were new men  for all this hospitality no strict charge was made  we could give something if we chose we need give nothing if we were poor or if we were stingy the pauper and the miser are as free as any in the catholic convents of palestine  i have been educated to enmity toward every thing that is catholic and sometimes in consequence of this i find it much easier to discover catholic faults than catholic merits  but there is one thing i feel no disposition to overlook and no disposition to forget and that is the honest gratitude i and all pilgrims owe to the convent fathers in palestine  their doors are always open and there is always a welcome for any worthy man who comes whether he comes in rags or clad in purple the catholic convents are a priceless blessing to the poor  a pilgrim without money whether he be a protestant or a catholic can travel the length and breadth of palestine and in the midst of her desert wastes find wholesome food and a clean bed every night in these buildings pilgrims in better circumstances are often stricken down by the sun and the fevers of the country and then their saving refuge is the convent without these hospitable retreats travel in palestine would be a pleasure which none but the strongest men could dare to undertake  our party pilgrims and all will always be ready and always willing to touch glasses and drink health prosperity and long life to the convent fathers of palestine  so rested and refreshed we fell into line and filed away over the barren mountains of judea and along rocky ridges and through sterile gorges where eternal silence and solitude reigned  even the scattering groups of armed shepherds we met the afternoon before tending their flocks of longhaired goats were wanting here  we saw but two living creatures  they were gazelles of softeyed notoriety  they looked like very young kids but they annihilated distance like an express train  i have not seen animals that moved faster unless i might say it of the antelopes of our own great plains  at nine or ten in the morning we reached the plain of the shepherds and stood in a walled garden of olives where the shepherds were watching their flocks by night eighteen centuries ago when the multitude of angels brought them the tidings that the saviour was born  a quarter of a mile away was bethlehem of judea and the pilgrims took some of the stone wall and hurried on  the plain of the shepherds is a desert paved with loose stones void of vegetation glaring in the fierce sun  only the music of the angels it knew once could charm its shrubs and flowers to life again and restore its vanished beauty  no less potent enchantment could avail to work this miracle  in the huge church of the nativity in bethlehem built fifteen hundred years ago by the inveterate st helena they took us below ground and into a grotto cut in the living rock  this was the manger where christ was born  a silver star set in the floor bears a latin inscription to that effect  it is polished with the kisses of many generations of worshiping pilgrims  the grotto was tricked out in the usual tasteless style observable in all the holy places of palestine  as in the church of the holy sepulchre envy and uncharitableness were apparent here  the priests and the members of the greek and latin churches can not come by the same corridor to kneel in the sacred birthplace of the redeemer but are compelled to approach and retire by different avenues lest they quarrel and fight on this holiest ground on earth  i have no meditations suggested by this spot where the very first merry christmas was uttered in all the world and from whence the friend of my childhood santa claus departed on his first journey to gladden and continue to gladden roaring firesides on wintry mornings in many a distant land forever and forever  i touch with reverent finger the actual spot where the infant jesus lay but i thinknothing  you can not think in this place any more than you can in any other in palestine that would be likely to inspire reflection  beggars cripples and monks compass you about and make you think only of bucksheesh when you would rather think of something more in keeping with the character of the spot  i was glad to get away and glad when we had walked through the grottoes where eusebius wrote and jerome fasted and joseph prepared for the flight into egypt and the dozen other distinguished grottoes and knew we were done  the church of the nativity is almost as well packed with exceeding holy places as the church of the holy sepulchre itself  they even have in it a grotto wherein twenty thousand children were slaughtered by herod when he was seeking the life of the infant saviour  we went to the milk grotto of coursea cavern where mary hid herself for a while before the flight into egypt  its walls were black before she entered but in suckling the child a drop of her milk fell upon the floor and instantly changed the darkness of the walls to its own snowy hue  we took many little fragments of stone from here because it is well known in all the east that a barren woman hath need only to touch her lips to one of these and her failing will depart from her  we took many specimens to the end that we might confer happiness upon certain households that we wot of  we got away from bethlehem and its troops of beggars and relicpeddlers in the afternoon and after spending some little time at rachels tomb hurried to jerusalem as fast as possible  i never was so glad to get home again before  i never have enjoyed rest as i have enjoyed it during these last few hours  the journey to the dead sea the jordan and bethlehem was short but it was an exhausting one  such roasting heat such oppressive solitude and such dismal desolation can not surely exist elsewhere on earth  and such fatigue  the commonest sagacity warns me that i ought to tell the customary pleasant lie and say i tore myself reluctantly away from every noted place in palestine  every body tells that but with as little ostentation as i may i doubt the word of every he who tells it  i could take a dreadful oath that i have never heard any one of our forty pilgrims say any thing of the sort and they are as worthy and as sincerely devout as any that come here  they will say it when they get home fast enough but why should they not  they do not wish to array themselves against all the lamartines and grimeses in the world  it does not stand to reason that men are reluctant to leave places where the very life is almost badgered out of them by importunate swarms of beggars and peddlers who hang in strings to ones sleeves and coattails and shriek and shout in his ears and horrify his vision with the ghastly sores and malformations they exhibit  one is glad to get away  i have heard shameless people say they were glad to get away from ladies festivals where they were importuned to buy by bevies of lovely young ladies transform those houris into dusky hags and ragged savages and replace their rounded forms with shrunken and knotted distortions their soft hands with scarred and hideous deformities and the persuasive music of their voices with the discordant din of a hated language and then see how much lingering reluctance to leave could be mustered  no it is the neat thing to say you were reluctant and then append the profound thoughts that struggled for utterance in your brain but it is the true thing to say you were not reluctant and found it impossible to think at allthough in good sooth it is not respectable to say it and not poetical either  we do not think in the holy places we think in bed afterwards when the glare and the noise and the confusion are gone and in fancy we revisit alone the solemn monuments of the past and summon the phantom pageants of an age that has passed away     chapter lvi  we visited all the holy places about jerusalem which we had left unvisited when we journeyed to the jordan and then about three oclock one afternoon we fell into procession and marched out at the stately damascus gate and the walls of jerusalem shut us out forever  we paused on the summit of a distant hill and took a final look and made a final farewell to the venerable city which had been such a good home to us  for about four hours we traveled down hill constantly  we followed a narrow bridlepath which traversed the beds of the mountain gorges and when we could we got out of the way of the long trains of laden camels and asses and when we could not we suffered the misery of being mashed up against perpendicular walls of rock and having our legs bruised by the passing freight  jack was caught two or three times and dan and moult as often  one horse had a heavy fall on the slippery rocks and the others had narrow escapes  however this was as good a road as we had found in palestine and possibly even the best and so there was not much grumbling  sometimes in the glens we came upon luxuriant orchards of figs apricots pomegranates and such things but oftener the scenery was rugged mountainous verdureless and forbidding  here and there towers were perched high up on acclivities which seemed almost inaccessible this fashion is as old as palestine itself and was adopted in ancient times for security against enemies  we crossed the brook which furnished david the stone that killed goliah and no doubt we looked upon the very ground whereon that noted battle was fought  we passed by a picturesque old gothic ruin whose stone pavements had rung to the armed heels of many a valorous crusader and we rode through a piece of country which we were told once knew samson as a citizen  we staid all night with the good monks at the convent of ramleh and in the morning got up and galloped the horses a good part of the distance from there to jaffa or joppa for the plain was as level as a floor and free from stones and besides this was our last march in holy land these two or three hours finished we and the tired horses could have rest and sleep as long as we wanted it  this was the plain of which joshua spoke when he said sun stand thou still on gibeon and thou moon in the valley of ajalon  as we drew near to jaffa the boys spurred up the horses and indulged in the excitement of an actual race an experience we had hardly had since we raced on donkeys in the azores islands  we came finally to the noble grove of orangetrees in which the oriental city of jaffa lies buried we passed through the walls and rode again down narrow streets and among swarms of animated rags and saw other sights and had other experiences we had long been familiar with  we dismounted for the last time and out in the offing riding at anchor we saw the ship  i put an exclamation point there because we felt one when we saw the vessel  the long pilgrimage was ended and somehow we seemed to feel glad of it  for description of jaffa see universal gazetteer simon the tanner formerly lived here  we went to his house  all the pilgrims visit simon the tanners house  peter saw the vision of the beasts let down in a sheet when he lay upon the roof of simon the tanners house  it was from jaffa that jonah sailed when he was told to go and prophesy against nineveh and no doubt it was not far from the town that the whale threw him up when he discovered that he had no ticket  jonah was disobedient and of a faultfinding complaining disposition and deserves to be lightly spoken of almost  the timbers used in the construction of solomons temple were floated to jaffa in rafts and the narrow opening in the reef through which they passed to the shore is not an inch wider or a shade less dangerous to navigate than it was then  such is the sleepy nature of the population palestines only good seaport has now and always had  jaffa has a history and a stirring one  it will not be discovered any where in this book  if the reader will call at the circulating library and mention my name he will be furnished with books which will afford him the fullest information concerning jaffa  so ends the pilgrimage  we ought to be glad that we did not make it for the purpose of feasting our eyes upon fascinating aspects of nature for we should have been disappointedat least at this season of the year  a writer in life in the holy land observes       monotonous and uninviting as much of the holy land will appear to      persons accustomed to the almost constant verdure of flowers ample      streams and varied surface of our own country we must remember that      its aspect to the israelites after the weary march of forty years      through the desert must have been very different  which all of us will freely grant  but it truly is monotonous and uninviting and there is no sufficient reason for describing it as being otherwise  of all the lands there are for dismal scenery i think palestine must be the prince  the hills are barren they are dull of color they are unpicturesque in shape  the valleys are unsightly deserts fringed with a feeble vegetation that has an expression about it of being sorrowful and despondent  the dead sea and the sea of galilee sleep in the midst of a vast stretch of hill and plain wherein the eye rests upon no pleasant tint no striking object no soft picture dreaming in a purple haze or mottled with the shadows of the clouds  every outline is harsh every feature is distinct there is no perspectivedistance works no enchantment here  it is a hopeless dreary heartbroken land  small shreds and patches of it must be very beautiful in the full flush of spring however and all the more beautiful by contrast with the farreaching desolation that surrounds them on every side  i would like much to see the fringes of the jordan in springtime and shechem esdraelon ajalon and the borders of galileebut even then these spots would seem mere toy gardens set at wide intervals in the waste of a limitless desolation  palestine sits in sackcloth and ashes  over it broods the spell of a curse that has withered its fields and fettered its energies  where sodom and gomorrah reared their domes and towers that solemn sea now floods the plain in whose bitter waters no living thing existsover whose waveless surface the blistering air hangs motionless and dead about whose borders nothing grows but weeds and scattering tufts of cane and that treacherous fruit that promises refreshment to parching lips but turns to ashes at the touch  nazareth is forlorn about that ford of jordan where the hosts of israel entered the promised land with songs of rejoicing one finds only a squalid camp of fantastic bedouins of the desert jericho the accursed lies a moldering ruin today even as joshuas miracle left it more than three thousand years ago bethlehem and bethany in their poverty and their humiliation have nothing about them now to remind one that they once knew the high honor of the saviours presence the hallowed spot where the shepherds watched their flocks by night and where the angels sang peace on earth good will to men is untenanted by any living creature and unblessed by any feature that is pleasant to the eye  renowned jerusalem itself the stateliest name in history has lost all its ancient grandeur and is become a pauper village the riches of solomon are no longer there to compel the admiration of visiting oriental queens the wonderful temple which was the pride and the glory of israel is gone and the ottoman crescent is lifted above the spot where on that most memorable day in the annals of the world they reared the holy cross  the noted sea of galilee where roman fleets once rode at anchor and the disciples of the saviour sailed in their ships was long ago deserted by the devotees of war and commerce and its borders are a silent wilderness capernaum is a shapeless ruin magdala is the home of beggared arabs bethsaida and chorazin have vanished from the earth and the desert places round about them where thousands of men once listened to the saviours voice and ate the miraculous bread sleep in the hush of a solitude that is inhabited only by birds of prey and skulking foxes  palestine is desolate and unlovely  and why should it be otherwise  can the curse of the deity beautify a land  palestine is no more of this workday world  it is sacred to poetry and traditionit is dreamland     chapter lvii  it was worth a kingdom to be at sea again  it was a relief to drop all anxiety whatsoeverall questions as to where we should go how long we should stay whether it were worth while to go or not all anxieties about the condition of the horses all such questions as shall we ever get to water  shall we ever lunch  ferguson how many more million miles have we got to creep under this awful sun before we camp  it was a relief to cast all these torturing little anxieties far awayropes of steel they were and every one with a separate and distinct strain on it and feel the temporary contentment that is born of the banishment of all care and responsibility  we did not look at the compass we did not care now where the ship went to so that she went out of sight of land as quickly as possible  when i travel again i wish to go in a pleasure ship  no amount of money could have purchased for us in a strange vessel and among unfamiliar faces the perfect satisfaction and the sense of being at home again which we experienced when we stepped on board the quaker cityour own shipafter this wearisome pilgrimage  it is a something we have felt always when we returned to her and a something we had no desire to sell  we took off our blue woollen shirts our spurs and heavy boots our sanguinary revolvers and our buckskinseated pantaloons and got shaved and came out in christian costume once more  all but jack who changed all other articles of his dress but clung to his traveling pantaloons they still preserved their ample buckskin seat intact and so his short pea jacket and his long thin legs assisted to make him a picturesque object whenever he stood on the forecastle looking abroad upon the ocean over the bows  at such times his fathers last injunction suggested itself to me  he said  jack my boy you are about to go among a brilliant company of gentlemen and ladies who are refined and cultivated and thoroughly accomplished in the manners and customs of good society  listen to their conversation study their habits of life and learn  be polite and obliging to all and considerate towards every ones opinions failings and prejudices  command the just respect of all your fellowvoyagers even though you fail to win their friendly regard  and jackdont you ever dare while you live appear in public on those decks in fair weather in a costume unbecoming your mothers drawingroom  it would have been worth any price if the father of this hopeful youth could have stepped on board some time and seen him standing high on the forecastle pea jacket tasseled red fez buckskin patch and all placidly contemplating the oceana rare spectacle for any bodys drawingroom  after a pleasant voyage and a good rest we drew near to egypt and out of the mellowest of sunsets we saw the domes and minarets of alexandria rise into view  as soon as the anchor was down jack and i got a boat and went ashore  it was night by this time and the other passengers were content to remain at home and visit ancient egypt after breakfast  it was the way they did at constantinople  they took a lively interest in new countries but their schoolboy impatience had worn off and they had learned that it was wisdom to take things easy and go along comfortably these old countries do not go away in the night they stay till after breakfast  when we reached the pier we found an army of egyptian boys with donkeys no larger than themselves waiting for passengersfor donkeys are the omnibuses of egypt  we preferred to walk but we could not have our own way  the boys crowded about us clamored around us and slewed their donkeys exactly across our path no matter which way we turned  they were goodnatured rascals and so were the donkeys  we mounted and the boys ran behind us and kept the donkeys in a furious gallop as is the fashion at damascus  i believe i would rather ride a donkey than any beast in the world  he goes briskly he puts on no airs he is docile though opinionated  satan himself could not scare him and he is convenientvery convenient  when you are tired riding you can rest your feet on the ground and let him gallop from under you  we found the hotel and secured rooms and were happy to know that the prince of wales had stopped there once  they had it every where on signs  no other princes had stopped there since till jack and i came we went abroad through the town then and found it a city of huge commercial buildings and broad handsome streets brilliant with gaslight  by night it was a sort of reminiscence of paris  but finally jack found an icecream saloon and that closed investigations for that evening  the weather was very hot it had been many a day since jack had seen icecream and so it was useless to talk of leaving the saloon till it shut up  in the morning the lost tribes of america came ashore and infested the hotels and took possession of all the donkeys and other open barouches that offered  they went in picturesque procession to the american consuls to the great gardens to cleopatras needles to pompeys pillar to the palace of the viceroy of egypt to the nile to the superb groves of datepalms  one of our most inveterate relichunters had his hammer with him and tried to break a fragment off the upright needle and could not do it he tried the prostrate one and failed he borrowed a heavy sledge hammer from a mason and tried again  he tried pompeys pillar and this baffled him  scattered all about the mighty monolith were sphinxes of noble countenance carved out of egyptian granite as hard as blue steel and whose shapely features the wear of five thousand years had failed to mark or mar  the relichunter battered at these persistently and sweated profusely over his work  he might as well have attempted to deface the moon  they regarded him serenely with the stately smile they had worn so long and which seemed to say peck away poor insect we were not made to fear such as you in tenscore dragging ages we have seen more of your kind than there are sands at your feet have they left a blemish upon us  but i am forgetting the jaffa colonists  at jaffa we had taken on board some forty members of a very celebrated community  they were male and female babies young boys and young girls young married people and some who had passed a shade beyond the prime of life  i refer to the adams jaffa colony  others had deserted before  we left in jaffa mr adams his wife and fifteen unfortunates who not only had no money but did not know where to turn or whither to go  such was the statement made to us  our forty were miserable enough in the first place and they lay about the decks seasick all the voyage which about completed their misery i take it  however one or two young men remained upright and by constant persecution we wormed out of them some little information they gave it reluctantly and in a very fragmentary condition for having been shamefully humbugged by their prophet they felt humiliated and unhappy  in such circumstances people do not like to talk  the colony was a complete fiasco  i have already said that such as could get away did so from time to time  the prophet adamsonce an actor then several other things afterward a mormon and a missionary always an adventurerremains at jaffa with his handful of sorrowful subjects  the forty we brought away with us were chiefly destitute though not all of them  they wished to get to egypt  what might become of them then they did not know and probably did not careany thing to get away from hated jaffa  they had little to hope for  because after many appeals to the sympathies of new england made by strangers of boston through the newspapers and after the establishment of an office there for the reception of moneyed contributions for the jaffa colonists one dollar was subscribed  the consulgeneral for egypt showed me the newspaper paragraph which mentioned the circumstance and mentioned also the discontinuance of the effort and the closing of the office  it was evident that practical new england was not sorry to be rid of such visionaries and was not in the least inclined to hire any body to bring them back to her  still to get to egypt was something in the eyes of the unfortunate colonists hopeless as the prospect seemed of ever getting further  thus circumstanced they landed at alexandria from our ship  one of our passengers mr moses s beach of the new york sun inquired of the consulgeneral what it would cost to send these people to their home in maine by the way of liverpool and he said fifteen hundred dollars in gold would do it  mr beach gave his check for the money and so the troubles of the jaffa colonists were at an endit was an unselfish act of benevolence it was done without any ostentation and has never been mentioned in any newspaper i think  therefore it is refreshing to learn now several months after the above narrative was written that another man received all the credit of this rescue of the colonists such is life  alexandria was too much like a european city to be novel and we soon tired of it  we took the cars and came up here to ancient cairo which is an oriental city and of the completest pattern  there is little about it to disabuse ones mind of the error if he should take it into his head that he was in the heart of arabia  stately camels and dromedaries swarthy egyptians and likewise turks and black ethiopians turbaned sashed and blazing in a rich variety of oriental costumes of all shades of flashy colors are what one sees on every hand crowding the narrow streets and the honeycombed bazaars  we are stopping at shepherds hotel which is the worst on earth except the one i stopped at once in a small town in the united states  it is pleasant to read this sketch in my notebook now and know that i can stand shepherds hotel sure because i have been in one just like it in america and survived       i stopped at the benton house  it used to be a good hotel but that      proves nothingi used to be a good boy for that matter  both of      us have lost character of late years  the benton is not a good      hotel  the benton lacks a very great deal of being a good hotel      perdition is full of better hotels than the benton       it was late at night when i got there and i told the clerk i would      like plenty of lights because i wanted to read an hour or two      when i reached no 15 with the porter we came along a dim hall that      was clad in ancient carpeting faded worn out in many places and      patched with old scraps of oil clotha hall that sank under ones      feet and creaked dismally to every footstep he struck a light      two inches of sallow sorrowful consumptive tallow candle that      burned blue and sputtered and got discouraged and went out  the      porter lit it again and i asked if that was all the light the clerk      sent  he said oh no ive got another one here and he produced      another couple of inches of tallow candle  i said light them both      ill have to have one to see the other by  he did it but the      result was drearier than darkness itself  he was a cheery      accommodating rascal  he said he would go somewheres and steal a      lamp  i abetted and encouraged him in his criminal design  i heard      the landlord get after him in the hall ten minutes afterward       where are you going with that lamp       fifteen wants it sir       fifteen why hes got a double lot of candlesdoes the man want      to illuminate the housedoes he want to get up a torchlight      processionwhat is he up to any how       he dont like them candlessays he wants a lamp       why what in the nation doeswhy i never heard of such a thing      what on earth can he want with that lamp       well he only wants to readthats what he says       wants to read does heaint satisfied with a thousand candles      but has to have a lampi do wonder what the devil that fellow      wants that lamp for  take him another candle and then if       but he wants the lampsays hell burn the dd old house down if      he dont get a lamp a remark which i never made       id like to see him at it once  well you take it alongbut i      swear it beats my time thoughand see if you cant find out what      in the very nation he wants with that lamp       and he went off growling to himself and still wondering and      wondering over the unaccountable conduct of no 15  the lamp was a      good one but it revealed some disagreeable thingsa bed in the      suburbs of a desert of rooma bed that had hills and valleys in it      and youd have to accommodate your body to the impression left in it      by the man that slept there last before you could lie comfortably      a carpet that had seen better days a melancholy washstand in a      remote corner and a dejected pitcher on it sorrowing over a broken      nose a lookingglass split across the centre which chopped your      head off at the chin and made you look like some dreadful unfinished      monster or other the paper peeling in shreds from the walls       i sighed and said this is charming and now dont you think you      could get me something to read       the porter said oh certainly the old mans got dead loads of      books and he was gone before i could tell him what sort of      literature i would rather have  and yet his countenance expressed      the utmost confidence in his ability to execute the commission with      credit to himself  the old man made a descent on him       what are you going to do with that pile of books       fifteen wants em sir       fifteen is it  hell want a warmingpan nexthell want a      nurse  take him every thing there is in the housetake him the      barkeepertake him the baggagewagontake him a chambermaid      confound me i never saw any thing like it  what did he say he      wants with those books       wants to read em like enough it aint likely he wants to eat      em i dont reckon       wants to read emwants to read em this time of night the      infernal lunatic  well he cant have them       but he says hes morly bound to have em he says hell just go      arairin and achargin through this house and raise morewell      theres no tellin what he wont do if he dont get em because      hes drunk and crazy and desperate and nothingll soothe him down      but them cussed books  i had not made any threats and was not in      the condition ascribed to me by the porter       well go on but i will be around when he goes to rairing and      charging and the first rair he makes ill make him rair out of the      window  and then the old gentleman went off growling as before       the genius of that porter was something wonderful  he put an armful      of books on the bed and said good night as confidently as if he      knew perfectly well that those books were exactly my style of      reading matter  and well he might  his selection covered the whole      range of legitimate literature  it comprised the great      consummation by rev dr cummingstheology revised statutes of      the state of missourilaw the complete horsedoctormedicine      the toilers of the sea by victor hugoromance the works of      william shakspearepoetry  i shall never cease to admire the tact      and the intelligence of that gifted porter  but all the donkeys in christendom and most of the egyptian boys i think are at the door and there is some noise going on not to put it in stronger languagewe are about starting to the illustrious pyramids of egypt and the donkeys for the voyage are under inspection  i will go and select one before the choice animals are all taken     chapter lviii  the donkeys were all good all handsome all strong and in good condition all fast and all willing to prove it  they were the best we had found any where and the most recherche  i do not know what recherche is but that is what these donkeys were anyhow  some were of a soft mousecolor and the others were white black and varicolored  some were closeshaven all over except that a tuft like a paintbrush was left on the end of the tail  others were so shaven in fanciful landscape garden patterns as to mark their bodies with curving lines which were bounded on one side by hair and on the other by the close plush left by the shears  they had all been newly barbered and were exceedingly stylish  several of the white ones were barred like zebras with rainbow stripes of blue and red and yellow paint  these were indescribably gorgeous  dan and jack selected from this lot because they brought back italian reminiscences of the old masters the saddles were the high stuffy frogshaped things we had known in ephesus and smyrna  the donkeyboys were lively young egyptian rascals who could follow a donkey and keep him in a canter half a day without tiring  we had plenty of spectators when we mounted for the hotel was full of english people bound overland to india and officers getting ready for the african campaign against the abyssinian king theodorus we were not a very large party but as we charged through the streets of the great metropolis we made noise for five hundred and displayed activity and created excitement in proportion  nobody can steer a donkey and some collided with camels dervishes effendis asses beggars and every thing else that offered to the donkeys a reasonable chance for a collision when we turned into the broad avenue that leads out of the city toward old cairo there was plenty of room  the walls of stately datepalms that fenced the gardens and bordered the way threw their shadows down and made the air cool and bracing  we rose to the spirit of the time and the race became a wild rout a stampede a terrific panic  i wish to live to enjoy it again  somewhere along this route we had a few startling exhibitions of oriental simplicity  a girl apparently thirteen years of age came along the great thoroughfare dressed like eve before the fall  we would have called her thirteen at home but here girls who look thirteen are often not more than nine in reality  occasionally we saw starknaked men of superb build bathing and making no attempt at concealment  however an hours acquaintance with this cheerful custom reconciled the pilgrims to it and then it ceased to occasion remark  thus easily do even the most startling novelties grow tame and spiritless to these sightsurfeited wanderers  arrived at old cairo the campfollowers took up the donkeys and tumbled them bodily aboard a small boat with a lateen sail and we followed and got under way  the deck was closely packed with donkeys and men the two sailors had to climb over and under and through the wedged mass to work the sails and the steersman had to crowd four or five donkeys out of the way when he wished to swing his tiller and put his helm harddown  but what were their troubles to us  we had nothing to do nothing to do but enjoy the trip nothing to do but shove the donkeys off our corns and look at the charming scenery of the nile  on the island at our right was the machine they call the nilometer a stonecolumn whose business it is to mark the rise of the river and prophecy whether it will reach only thirtytwo feet and produce a famine or whether it will properly flood the land at forty and produce plenty or whether it will rise to fortythree and bring death and destruction to flocks and cropsbut how it does all this they could not explain to us so that we could understand  on the same island is still shown the spot where pharaohs daughter found moses in the bulrushes  near the spot we sailed from the holy family dwelt when they sojourned in egypt till herod should complete his slaughter of the innocents  the same tree they rested under when they first arrived was there a short time ago but the viceroy of egypt sent it to the empress eugenie lately  he was just in time otherwise our pilgrims would have had it  the nile at this point is muddy swift and turbid and does not lack a great deal of being as wide as the mississippi  we scrambled up the steep bank at the shabby town of ghizeh mounted the donkeys again and scampered away  for four or five miles the route lay along a high embankment which they say is to be the bed of a railway the sultan means to build for no other reason than that when the empress of the french comes to visit him she can go to the pyramids in comfort this is true oriental hospitality  i am very glad it is our privilege to have donkeys instead of cars  at the distance of a few miles the pyramids rising above the palms looked very cleancut very grand and imposing and very soft and filmy as well  they swam in a rich haze that took from them all suggestions of unfeeling stone and made them seem only the airy nothings of a dream structures which might blossom into tiers of vague arches or ornate colonnades may be and change and change again into all graceful forms of architecture while we looked and then melt deliciously away and blend with the tremulous atmosphere  at the end of the levee we left the mules and went in a sailboat across an arm of the nile or an overflow and landed where the sands of the great sahara left their embankment as straight as a wall along the verge of the alluvial plain of the river  a laborious walk in the flaming sun brought us to the foot of the great pyramid of cheops  it was a fairy vision no longer  it was a corrugated unsightly mountain of stone  each of its monstrous sides was a wide stairway which rose upward step above step narrowing as it went till it tapered to a point far aloft in the air  insect men and womenpilgrims from the quaker citywere creeping about its dizzy perches and one little black swarm were waving postage stamps from the airy summithandkerchiefs will be understood  of course we were besieged by a rabble of muscular egyptians and arabs who wanted the contract of dragging us to the topall tourists are  of course you could not hear your own voice for the din that was around you of course the sheiks said they were the only responsible parties that all contracts must be made with them all moneys paid over to them and none exacted from us by any but themselves alone  of course they contracted that the varlets who dragged us up should not mention bucksheesh once  for such is the usual routine  of course we contracted with them paid them were delivered into the hands of the draggers dragged up the pyramids and harried and bedeviled for bucksheesh from the foundation clear to the summit  we paid it too for we were purposely spread very far apart over the vast side of the pyramid  there was no help near if we called and the herculeses who dragged us had a way of asking sweetly and flatteringly for bucksheesh which was seductive and of looking fierce and threatening to throw us down the precipice which was persuasive and convincing  each step being full as high as a dinnertable there being very very many of the steps an arab having hold of each of our arms and springing upward from step to step and snatching us with them forcing us to lift our feet as high as our breasts every time and do it rapidly and keep it up till we were ready to faint who shall say it is not lively exhilarating lacerating musclestraining bonewrenching and perfectly excruciating and exhausting pastime climbing the pyramids  i beseeched the varlets not to twist all my joints asunder i iterated reiterated even swore to them that i did not wish to beat any body to the top did all i could to convince them that if i got there the last of all i would feel blessed above men and grateful to them forever i begged them prayed them pleaded with them to let me stop and rest a momentonly one little moment and they only answered with some more frightful springs and an unenlisted volunteer behind opened a bombardment of determined boosts with his head which threatened to batter my whole political economy to wreck and ruin  twice for one minute they let me rest while they extorted bucksheesh and then continued their maniac flight up the pyramid  they wished to beat the other parties  it was nothing to them that i a stranger must be sacrificed upon the altar of their unholy ambition  but in the midst of sorrow joy blooms  even in this dark hour i had a sweet consolation for i knew that except these mohammedans repented they would go straight to perdition some day  and they never repentthey never forsake their paganism  this thought calmed me cheered me and i sank down limp and exhausted upon the summit but happy so happy and serene within  on the one hand a mighty sea of yellow sand stretched away toward the ends of the earth solemn silent shorn of vegetation its solitude uncheered by any forms of creature life on the other the eden of egypt was spread below usa broad green floor cloven by the sinuous river dotted with villages its vast distances measured and marked by the diminishing stature of receding clusters of palms  it lay asleep in an enchanted atmosphere  there was no sound no motion  above the dateplumes in the middle distance swelled a domed and pinnacled mass glimmering through a tinted exquisite mist away toward the horizon a dozen shapely pyramids watched over ruined memphis and at our feet the bland impassible sphynx looked out upon the picture from her throne in the sands as placidly and pensively as she had looked upon its like full fifty lagging centuries ago  we suffered torture no pen can describe from the hungry appeals for bucksheesh that gleamed from arab eyes and poured incessantly from arab lips  why try to call up the traditions of vanished egyptian grandeur why try to fancy egypt following dead rameses to his tomb in the pyramid or the long multitude of israel departing over the desert yonder  why try to think at all  the thing was impossible  one must bring his meditations cut and dried or else cut and dry them afterward  the traditional arab proposed in the traditional way to run down cheops cross the eighth of a mile of sand intervening between it and the tall pyramid of cephron ascend to cephrons summit and return to us on the top of cheopsall in nine minutes by the watch and the whole service to be rendered for a single dollar  in the first flush of irritation i said let the arab and his exploits go to the mischief but stay  the upper third of cephron was coated with dressed marble smooth as glass  a blessed thought entered my brain  he must infallibly break his neck  close the contract with dispatch i said and let him go  he started  we watched  he went bounding down the vast broadside spring after spring like an ibex  he grew small and smaller till he became a bobbing pigmy away down toward the bottomthen disappeared we turned and peered over the other sideforty secondseighty seconds a hundredhappiness he is dead alreadytwo minutesand a quarter there he goes  too trueit was too true  he was very small now gradually but surely he overcame the level ground  he began to spring and climb again  up up upat last he reached the smooth coatingnow for it  but he clung to it with toes and fingers like a fly  he crawled this way and thataway to the right slanting upwardaway to the left still slanting upwardand stood at last a black peg on the summit and waved his pigmy scarf  then he crept downward to the raw steps again then picked up his agile heels and flew  we lost him presently  but presently again we saw him under us mounting with undiminished energy  shortly he bounded into our midst with a gallant warwhoop  time eight minutes fortyone seconds  he had won  his bones were intact  it was a failure  i reflected  i said to myself he is tired and must grow dizzy  i will risk another dollar on him  he started again  made the trip again  slipped on the smooth coating i almost had him  but an infamous crevice saved him  he was with us once moreperfectly sound  time eight minutes fortysix seconds  i said to dan lend me a dollari can beat this game yet  worse and worse  he won again  time eight minutes fortyeight seconds  i was out of all patience now  i was desperatemoney was no longer of any consequence  i said sirrah i will give you a hundred dollars to jump off this pyramid head first  if you do not like the terms name your bet  i scorn to stand on expenses now  i will stay right here and risk money on you as long as dan has got a cent  i was in a fair way to win now for it was a dazzling opportunity for an arab  he pondered a moment and would have done it i think but his mother arrived then and interfered  her tears moved mei never can look upon the tears of woman with indifferenceand i said i would give her a hundred to jump off too  but it was a failure  the arabs are too highpriced in egypt  they put on airs unbecoming to such savages  we descended hot and out of humor  the dragoman lit candles and we all entered a hole near the base of the pyramid attended by a crazy rabble of arabs who thrust their services upon us uninvited  they dragged us up a long inclined chute and dripped candlegrease all over us  this chute was not more than twice as wide and high as a saratoga trunk and was walled roofed and floored with solid blocks of egyptian granite as wide as a wardrobe twice as thick and three times as long  we kept on climbing through the oppressive gloom till i thought we ought to be nearing the top of the pyramid again and then came to the queens chamber and shortly to the chamber of the king  these large apartments were tombs  the walls were built of monstrous masses of smoothed granite neatly joined together  some of them were nearly as large square as an ordinary parlor  a great stone sarcophagus like a bathtub stood in the centre of the kings chamber  around it were gathered a picturesque group of arab savages and soiled and tattered pilgrims who held their candles aloft in the gloom while they chattered and the winking blurs of light shed a dim glory down upon one of the irrepressible mementoseekers who was pecking at the venerable sarcophagus with his sacrilegious hammer  we struggled out to the open air and the bright sunshine and for the space of thirty minutes received ragged arabs by couples dozens and platoons and paid them bucksheesh for services they swore and proved by each other that they had rendered but which we had not been aware of beforeand as each party was paid they dropped into the rear of the procession and in due time arrived again with a newlyinvented delinquent list for liquidation  we lunched in the shade of the pyramid and in the midst of this encroaching and unwelcome company and then dan and jack and i started away for a walk  a howling swarm of beggars followed ussurrounded us almost headed us off  a sheik in flowing white bournous and gaudy headgear was with them  he wanted more bucksheesh  but we had adopted a new codeit was millions for defense but not a cent for bucksheesh  i asked him if he could persuade the others to depart if we paid him  he said yesfor ten francs  we accepted the contract and said  now persuade your vassals to fall back  he swung his long staff round his head and three arabs bit the dust  he capered among the mob like a very maniac  his blows fell like hail and wherever one fell a subject went down  we had to hurry to the rescue and tell him it was only necessary to damage them a little he need not kill themin two minutes we were alone with the sheik and remained so the persuasive powers of this illiterate savage were remarkable  each side of the pyramid of cheops is about as long as the capitol at washington or the sultans new palace on the bosporus and is longer than the greatest depth of st peters at romewhich is to say that each side of cheops extends seven hundred and some odd feet  it is about seventyfive feet higher than the cross on st peters  the first time i ever went down the mississippi i thought the highest bluff on the river between st louis and new orleansit was near selma missouriwas probably the highest mountain in the world  it is four hundred and thirteen feet high  it still looms in my memory with undiminished grandeur  i can still see the trees and bushes growing smaller and smaller as i followed them up its huge slant with my eye till they became a feathery fringe on the distant summit  this symmetrical pyramid of cheopsthis solid mountain of stone reared by the patient hands of menthis mighty tomb of a forgotten monarchdwarfs my cherished mountain  for it is four hundred and eighty feet high  in still earlier years than those i have been recalling hollidays hill in our town was to me the noblest work of god  it appeared to pierce the skies  it was nearly three hundred feet high  in those days i pondered the subject much but i never could understand why it did not swathe its summit with neverfailing clouds and crown its majestic brow with everlasting snows i had heard that such was the custom of great mountains in other parts of the world  i remembered how i worked with another boy at odd afternoons stolen from study and paid for with stripes to undermine and start from its bed an immense boulder that rested upon the edge of that hilltop i remembered how one saturday afternoon we gave three hours of honest effort to the task and saw at last that our reward was at hand i remembered how we sat down then and wiped the perspiration away and waited to let a picnic party get out of the way in the road belowand then we started the boulder  it was splendid  it went crashing down the hillside tearing up saplings mowing bushes down like grass ripping and crushing and smashing every thing in its patheternally splintered and scattered a wood pile at the foot of the hill and then sprang from the high bank clear over a dray in the roadthe negro glanced up once and dodgedand the next second it made infinitesimal mincemeat of a frame coopershop and the coopers swarmed out like bees  then we said it was perfectly magnificent and left  because the coopers were starting up the hill to inquire  still that mountain prodigious as it was was nothing to the pyramid of cheops  i could conjure up no comparison that would convey to my mind a satisfactory comprehension of the magnitude of a pile of monstrous stones that covered thirteen acres of ground and stretched upward four hundred and eighty tiresome feet and so i gave it up and walked down to the sphynx  after years of waiting it was before me at last  the great face was so sad so earnest so longing so patient  there was a dignity not of earth in its mien and in its countenance a benignity such as never any thing human wore  it was stone but it seemed sentient  if ever image of stone thought it was thinking  it was looking toward the verge of the landscape yet looking at nothingnothing but distance and vacancy it was looking over and beyond every thing of the present and far into the past  it was gazing out over the ocean of timeover lines of centurywaves which further and further receding closed nearer and nearer together and blended at last into one unbroken tide away toward the horizon of remote antiquity  it was thinking of the wars of departed ages of the empires it had seen created and destroyed of the nations whose birth it had witnessed whose progress it had watched whose annihilation it had noted of the joy and sorrow the life and death the grandeur and decay of five thousand slow revolving years  it was the type of an attribute of manof a faculty of his heart and brain  it was memoryretrospectionwrought into visible tangible form  all who know what pathos there is in memories of days that are accomplished and faces that have vanishedalbeit only a trifling score of years gone bywill have some appreciation of the pathos that dwells in these grave eyes that look so steadfastly back upon the things they knew before history was bornbefore tradition had beingthings that were and forms that moved in a vague era which even poetry and romance scarce know ofand passed one by one away and left the stony dreamer solitary in the midst of a strange new age and uncomprehended scenes  the sphynx is grand in its loneliness it is imposing in its magnitude it is impressive in the mystery that hangs over its story  and there is that in the overshadowing majesty of this eternal figure of stone with its accusing memory of the deeds of all ages which reveals to one something of what he shall feel when he shall stand at last in the awful presence of god  there are some things which for the credit of america should be left unsaid perhaps but these very things happen sometimes to be the very things which for the real benefit of americans ought to have prominent notice  while we stood looking a wart or an excrescence of some kind appeared on the jaw of the sphynx  we heard the familiar clink of a hammer and understood the case at once  one of our well meaning reptilesi mean relichuntershad crawled up there and was trying to break a specimen from the face of this the most majestic creation the hand of man has wrought  but the great image contemplated the dead ages as calmly as ever unconscious of the small insect that was fretting at its jaw  egyptian granite that has defied the storms and earthquakes of all time has nothing to fear from the tackhammers of ignorant excursionistshighwaymen like this specimen  he failed in his enterprise  we sent a sheik to arrest him if he had the authority or to warn him if he had not that by the laws of egypt the crime he was attempting to commit was punishable with imprisonment or the bastinado then he desisted and went away  the sphynx a hundred and twentyfive feet long sixty feet high and a hundred and two feet around the head if i remember rightlycarved out of one solid block of stone harder than any iron  the block must have been as large as the fifth avenue hotel before the usual waste by the necessities of sculpture of a fourth or a half of the original mass was begun  i only set down these figures and these remarks to suggest the prodigious labor the carving of it so elegantly so symmetrically so faultlessly must have cost  this species of stone is so hard that figures cut in it remain sharp and unmarred after exposure to the weather for two or three thousand years  now did it take a hundred years of patient toil to carve the sphynx  it seems probable  something interfered and we did not visit the red sea and walk upon the sands of arabia  i shall not describe the great mosque of mehemet ali whose entire inner walls are built of polished and glistening alabaster i shall not tell how the little birds have built their nests in the globes of the great chandeliers that hang in the mosque and how they fill the whole place with their music and are not afraid of any body because their audacity is pardoned their rights are respected and nobody is allowed to interfere with them even though the mosque be thus doomed to go unlighted i certainly shall not tell the hackneyed story of the massacre of the mamelukes because i am glad the lawless rascals were massacred and i do not wish to get up any sympathy in their behalf i shall not tell how that one solitary mameluke jumped his horse a hundred feet down from the battlements of the citadel and escaped because i do not think much of thati could have done it myself i shall not tell of josephs well which he dug in the solid rock of the citadel hill and which is still as good as new nor how the same mules he bought to draw up the water with an endless chain are still at it yet and are getting tired of it too i shall not tell about josephs granaries which he built to store the grain in what time the egyptian brokers were selling short unwitting that there would be no corn in all the land when it should be time for them to deliver i shall not tell any thing about the strange strange city of cairo because it is only a repetition a good deal intensified and exaggerated of the oriental cities i have already spoken of i shall not tell of the great caravan which leaves for mecca every year for i did not see it nor of the fashion the people have of prostrating themselves and so forming a long human pavement to be ridden over by the chief of the expedition on its return to the end that their salvation may be thus secured for i did not see that either i shall not speak of the railway for it is like any other railwayi shall only say that the fuel they use for the locomotive is composed of mummies three thousand years old purchased by the ton or by the graveyard for that purpose and that sometimes one hears the profane engineer call out pettishly dn these plebeians they dont burn worth a centpass out a kingstated to me for a fact  i only tell it as i got it  i am willing to believe it  i can believe any thingi shall not tell of the groups of mud cones stuck like wasps nests upon a thousand mounds above high watermark the length and breadth of egyptvillages of the lower classes i shall not speak of the boundless sweep of level plain green with luxuriant grain that gladdens the eye as far as it can pierce through the soft rich atmosphere of egypt i shall not speak of the vision of the pyramids seen at a distance of five and twenty miles for the picture is too ethereal to be limned by an uninspired pen i shall not tell of the crowds of dusky women who flocked to the cars when they stopped a moment at a station to sell us a drink of water or a ruddy juicy pomegranate i shall not tell of the motley multitudes and wild costumes that graced a fair we found in full blast at another barbarous station i shall not tell how we feasted on fresh dates and enjoyed the pleasant landscape all through the flying journey nor how we thundered into alexandria at last swarmed out of the cars rowed aboard the ship left a comrade behind who was to return to europe thence home raised the anchor and turned our bows homeward finally and forever from the long voyage nor how as the mellow sun went down upon the oldest land on earth jack and moult assembled in solemn state in the smokingroom and mourned over the lost comrade the whole night long and would not be comforted  i shall not speak a word of any of these things or write a line  they shall be as a sealed book  i do not know what a sealed book is because i never saw one but a sealed book is the expression to use in this connection because it is popular  we were glad to have seen the land which was the mother of civilization which taught greece her letters and through greece rome and through rome the world the land which could have humanized and civilized the hapless children of israel but allowed them to depart out of her borders little better than savages  we were glad to have seen that land which had an enlightened religion with future eternal rewards and punishment in it while even israels religion contained no promise of a hereafter we were glad to have seen that land which had glass three thousand years before england had it and could paint upon it as none of us can paint now that land which knew three thousand years ago well nigh all of medicine and surgery which science has discovered lately which had all those curious surgical instruments which science has invented recently which had in high excellence a thousand luxuries and necessities of an advanced civilization which we have gradually contrived and accumulated in modern times and claimed as things that were new under the sun that had paper untold centuries before we dreampt of itand waterfalls before our women thought of them that had a perfect system of common schools so long before we boasted of our achievements in that direction that it seems forever and forever ago that so embalmed the dead that flesh was made almost immortalwhich we can not do that built temples which mock at destroying time and smile grimly upon our lauded little prodigies of architecture that old land that knew all which we know now perchance and more that walked in the broad highway of civilization in the gray dawn of creation ages and ages before we were born that left the impress of exalted cultivated mind upon the eternal front of the sphynx to confound all scoffers who when all her other proofs had passed away might seek to persuade the world that imperial egypt in the days of her high renown had groped in darkness     chapter lix  we were at sea now for a very long voyagewe were to pass through the entire length of the levant through the entire length of the mediterranean proper also and then cross the full width of the atlantica voyage of several weeks  we naturally settled down into a very slow stayathome manner of life and resolved to be quiet exemplary people and roam no more for twenty or thirty days  no more at least than from stem to stern of the ship  it was a very comfortable prospect though for we were tired and needed a long rest  we were all lazy and satisfied now as the meager entries in my notebook

however that even at that early age i washed when i got up  that journal finished me  i never have had the nerve to keep one since  my loss of confidence in myself in that line was permanent  the ship had to stay a week or more at gibraltar to take in coal for the home voyage  it would be very tiresome staying here and so four of us ran the quarantine blockade and spent seven delightful days in seville cordova cadiz and wandering through the pleasant rural scenery of andalusia the garden of old spain  the experiences of that cheery week were too varied and numerous for a short chapter and i have not room for a long one therefore i shall leave them all out     chapter lx  ten or eleven oclock found us coming down to breakfast one morning in cadiz  they told us the ship had been lying at anchor in the harbor two or three hours  it was time for us to bestir ourselves  the ship could wait only a little while because of the quarantine  we were soon on board and within the hour the white city and the pleasant shores of spain sank down behind the waves and passed out of sight  we had seen no land fade from view so regretfully  it had long ago been decided in a noisy public meeting in the main cabin that we could not go to lisbon because we must surely be quarantined there  we did every thing by massmeeting in the good old national way from swapping off one empire for another on the programme of the voyage down to complaining of the cookery and the scarcity of napkins  i am reminded now of one of these complaints of the cookery made by a passenger  the coffee had been steadily growing more and more execrable for the space of three weeks till at last it had ceased to be coffee altogether and had assumed the nature of mere discolored waterso this person said  he said it was so weak that it was transparent an inch in depth around the edge of the cup  as he approached the table one morning he saw the transparent edgeby means of his extraordinary vision long before he got to his seat  he went back and complained in a highhanded way to capt  duncan  he said the coffee was disgraceful  the captain showed his  it seemed tolerably good  the incipient mutineer was more outraged than ever then at what he denounced as the partiality shown the captains table over the other tables in the ship  he flourished back and got his cup and set it down triumphantly and said  just try that mixture once captain duncan  he smelt ittasted itsmiled benignantlythen said  it is inferiorfor coffeebut it is pretty fair tea  the humbled mutineer smelt it tasted it and returned to his seat  he had made an egregious ass of himself before the whole ship  he did it no more  after that he took things as they came  that was me  the oldfashioned shiplife had returned now that we were no longer in sight of land  for days and days it continued just the same one day being exactly like another and to me every one of them pleasant  at last we anchored in the open roadstead of funchal in the beautiful islands we call the madeiras  the mountains looked surpassingly lovely clad as they were in living green ribbed with lava ridges flecked with white cottages riven by deep chasms purple with shade the great slopes dashed with sunshine and mottled with shadows flung from the drifting squadrons of the sky and the superb picture fitly crowned by towering peaks whose fronts were swept by the trailing fringes of the clouds  but we could not land  we staid all day and looked we abused the man who invented quarantine we held half a dozen massmeetings and crammed them full of interrupted speeches motions that fell stillborn amendments that came to nought and resolutions that died from sheer exhaustion in trying to get before the house  at night we set sail  we averaged four massmeetings a week for the voyagewe seemed always in labor in this way and yet so often fallaciously that whenever at long intervals we were safely delivered of a resolution it was cause for public rejoicing and we hoisted the flag and fired a salute  days passedand nights and then the beautiful bermudas rose out of the sea we entered the tortuous channel steamed hither and thither among the bright summer islands and rested at last under the flag of england and were welcome  we were not a nightmare here where were civilization and intelligence in place of spanish and italian superstition dirt and dread of cholera  a few days among the breezy groves the flower gardens the coral caves and the lovely vistas of blue water that went curving in and out disappearing and anon again appearing through jungle walls of brilliant foliage restored the energies dulled by long drowsing on the ocean and fitted us for our final cruiseour little run of a thousand miles to new yorkamericahome  we bade goodbye to our friends the bermudians as our programme hath itthe majority of those we were most intimate with were negroesand courted the great deep again  i said the majority  we knew more negroes than white people because we had a deal of washing to be done but we made some most excellent friends among the whites whom it will be a pleasant duty to hold long in grateful remembrance  we sailed and from that hour all idling ceased  such another system of overhauling general littering of cabins and packing of trunks we had not seen since we let go the anchor in the harbor of beirout  every body was busy  lists of all purchases had to be made out and values attached to facilitate matters at the customhouse  purchases bought by bulk in partnership had to be equitably divided outstanding debts canceled accounts compared and trunks boxes and packages labeled  all day long the bustle and confusion continued  and now came our first accident  a passenger was running through a gangway between decks one stormy night when he caught his foot in the iron staple of a door that had been heedlessly left off a hatchway and the bones of his leg broke at the ancle  it was our first serious misfortune  we had traveled much more than twenty thousand miles by land and sea in many trying climates without a single hurt without a serious case of sickness and without a death among five and sixty passengers  our good fortune had been wonderful  a sailor had jumped overboard at constantinople one night and was seen no more but it was suspected that his object was to desert and there was a slim chance at least that he reached the shore  but the passenger list was complete there was no name missing from the register  at last one pleasant morning we steamed up the harbor of new york all on deck all dressed in christian garbby special order for there was a latent disposition in some quarters to come out as turksand amid a waving of handkerchiefs from welcoming friends the glad pilgrims noted the shiver of the decks that told that ship and pier had joined hands again and the long strange cruise was over  amen     chapter lxi  in this place i will print an article which i wrote for the new york herald the night we arrived  i do it partly because my contract with my publishers makes it compulsory partly because it is a proper tolerably accurate and exhaustive summing up of the cruise of the ship and the performances of the pilgrims in foreign lands and partly because some of the passengers have abused me for writing it and i wish the public to see how thankless a task it is to put ones self to trouble to glorify unappreciative people  i was charged with rushing into print with these compliments  i did not rush  i had written news letters to the herald sometimes but yet when i visited the office that day i did not say any thing about writing a valedictory  i did go to the tribune office to see if such an article was wanted because i belonged on the regular staff of that paper and it was simply a duty to do it  the managing editor was absent and so i thought no more about it  at night when the heralds request came for an article i did not rush  in fact i demurred for a while because i did not feel like writing compliments then and therefore was afraid to speak of the cruise lest i might be betrayed into using other than complimentary language  however i reflected that it would be a just and righteous thing to go down and write a kind word for the hadjishadjis are people who have made the pilgrimagebecause parties not interested could not do it so feelingly as i a fellowhadji and so i penned the valedictory  i have read it and read it again and if there is a sentence in it that is not fulsomely complimentary to captain ship and passengers i can not find it  if it is not a chapter that any company might be proud to have a body write about them my judgment is fit for nothing  with these remarks i confidently submit it to the unprejudiced judgment of the reader       return of the holy land excursioniststhe story of the cruise       to the editor of the herald       the steamer quaker city has accomplished at last her extraordinary      voyage and returned to her old pier at the foot of wall street      the expedition was a success in some respects in some it was not      originally it was advertised as a pleasure excursion  well      perhaps it was a pleasure excursion but certainly it did not look      like one certainly it did not act like one  any bodys and every      bodys notion of a pleasure excursion is that the parties to it will      of a necessity be young and giddy and somewhat boisterous  they      will dance a good deal sing a good deal make love but sermonize      very little  any bodys and every bodys notion of a well conducted      funeral is that there must be a hearse and a corpse and chief      mourners and mourners by courtesy many old people much solemnity      no levity and a prayer and a sermon withal  threefourths of the      quaker citys passengers were between forty and seventy years of      age  there was a picnic crowd for you  it may be supposed that the      other fourth was composed of young girls  but it was not  it was      chiefly composed of rusty old bachelors and a child of six years      let us average the ages of the quaker citys pilgrims and set the      figure down as fifty years  is any man insane enough to imagine      that this picnic of patriarchs sang made love danced laughed      told anecdotes dealt in ungodly levity  in my experience they      sinned little in these matters  no doubt it was presumed here at      home that these frolicsome veterans laughed and sang and romped all      day and day after day and kept up a noisy excitement from one end      of the ship to the other and that they played blindmans buff or      danced quadrilles and waltzes on moonlight evenings on the      quarterdeck and that at odd moments of unoccupied time they jotted      a laconic item or two in the journals they opened on such an      elaborate plan when they left home and then skurried off to their      whist and euchre labors under the cabin lamps  if these things were      presumed the presumption was at fault  the venerable excursionists      were not gay and frisky  they played no blindmans buff they      dealt not in whist they shirked not the irksome journal for alas      most of them were even writing books  they never romped they      talked but little they never sang save in the nightly      prayermeeting  the pleasure ship was a synagogue and the pleasure      trip was a funeral excursion without a corpse  there is nothing      exhilarating about a funeral excursion without a corpse a free      hearty laugh was a sound that was not heard oftener than once in      seven days about those decks or in those cabins and when it was      heard it met with precious little sympathy  the excursionists      danced on three separate evenings long long ago it seems an      age quadrilles of a single set made up of three ladies and five      gentlemen the latter with handkerchiefs around their arms to      signify their sex who timed their feet to the solemn wheezing of a      melodeon but even this melancholy orgie was voted to be sinful and      dancing was discontinued       the pilgrims played dominoes when too much josephus or robinsons      holy land researches or bookwriting made recreation necessary      for dominoes is about as mild and sinless a game as any in the      world perhaps excepting always the ineffably insipid diversion      they call croquet which is a game where you dont pocket any balls      and dont carom on any thing of any consequence and when you are      done nobody has to pay and there are no refreshments to saw off      and consequently there isnt any satisfaction whatever about it      they played dominoes till they were rested and then they      blackguarded each other privately till prayertime  when they were      not seasick they were uncommonly prompt when the dinnergong      sounded  such was our daily life on board the shipsolemnity      decorum dinner dominoes devotions slander  it was not lively      enough for a pleasure trip but if we had only had a corpse it would      have made a noble funeral excursion  it is all over now but when i      look back the idea of these venerable fossils skipping forth on a      six months picnic seems exquisitely refreshing  the advertised      title of the expeditionthe grand holy land pleasure excursion      was a misnomer  the grand holy land funeral procession would have      been bettermuch better       wherever we went in europe asia or africa we made a sensation      and i suppose i may add created a famine  none of us had ever      been any where before we all hailed from the interior travel was a      wild novelty to us and we conducted ourselves in accordance with      the natural instincts that were in us and trammeled ourselves with      no ceremonies no conventionalities  we always took care to make it      understood that we were americansamericans  when we found that a      good many foreigners had hardly ever heard of america and that a      good many more knew it only as a barbarous province away off      somewhere that had lately been at war with somebody we pitied the      ignorance of the old world but abated no jot of our importance      many and many a simple community in the eastern hemisphere will      remember for years the incursion of the strange horde in the year of      our lord 1867 that called themselves americans and seemed to      imagine in some unaccountable way that they had a right to be proud      of it  we generally created a famine partly because the coffee on      the quaker city was unendurable and sometimes the more substantial      fare was not strictly first class and partly because one naturally      tires of sitting long at the same board and eating from the same      dishes       the people of those foreign countries are very very ignorant  they      looked curiously at the costumes we had brought from the wilds of      america  they observed that we talked loudly at table sometimes      they noticed that we looked out for expenses and got what we      conveniently could out of a franc and wondered where in the      mischief we came from  in paris they just simply opened their eyes      and stared when we spoke to them in french  we never did succeed in      making those idiots understand their own language  one of our      passengers said to a shopkeeper in reference to a proposed return      to buy a pair of gloves allong restay trankeelmay be ve coom      moonday and would you believe it that shopkeeper a born      frenchman had to ask what it was that had been said  sometimes it      seems to me somehow that there must be a difference between      parisian french and quaker city french       the people stared at us every where and we stared at them  we      generally made them feel rather small too before we got done with      them because we bore down on them with americas greatness until we      crushed them  and yet we took kindly to the manners and customs      and especially to the fashions of the various people we visited      when we left the azores we wore awful capotes and used fine tooth      combssuccessfully  when we came back from tangier in africa we      were topped with fezzes of the bloodiest hue hung with tassels like      an indians scalplock  in france and spain we attracted some      attention in these costumes  in italy they naturally took us for      distempered garibaldians and set a gunboat to look for any thing      significant in our changes of uniform  we made rome howl  we could      have made any place howl when we had all our clothes on  we got no      fresh raiment in greecethey had but little there of any kind  but      at constantinople how we turned out  turbans scimetars fezzes      horsepistols tunics sashes baggy trowsers yellow slippersoh      we were gorgeous  the illustrious dogs of constantinople barked      their under jaws off and even then failed to do us justice  they      are all dead by this time  they could not go through such a run of      business as we gave them and survive       and then we went to see the emperor of russia  we just called on      him as comfortably as if we had known him a century or so and when      we had finished our visit we variegated ourselves with selections      from russian costumes and sailed away again more picturesque than      ever  in smyrna we picked up camels hair shawls and other dressy      things from persia but in palestineah in palestineour splendid      career ended  they didnt wear any clothes there to speak of  we      were satisfied and stopped  we made no experiments  we did not      try their costume  but we astonished the natives of that country      we astonished them with such eccentricities of dress as we could      muster  we prowled through the holy land from cesarea philippi to      jerusalem and the dead sea a weird procession of pilgrims gotten      up regardless of expense solemn gorgeous greenspectacled      drowsing under blue umbrellas and astride of a sorrier lot of      horses camels and asses than those that came out of noahs ark      after eleven months of seasickness and short rations  if ever those      children of israel in palestine forget when gideons band went      through there from america they ought to be cursed once more and      finished  it was the rarest spectacle that ever astounded mortal      eyes perhaps       well we were at home in palestine  it was easy to see that that      was the grand feature of the expedition  we had cared nothing much      about europe  we galloped through the louvre the pitti the      ufizzi the vaticanall the galleriesand through the pictured and      frescoed churches of venice naples and the cathedrals of spain      some of us said that certain of the great works of the old masters      were glorious creations of genius we found it out in the      guidebook though we got hold of the wrong picture sometimes and      the others said they were disgraceful old daubs  we examined modern      and ancient statuary with a critical eye in florence rome or any      where we found it and praised it if we saw fit and if we didnt we      said we preferred the wooden indians in front of the cigar stores of      america  but the holy land brought out all our enthusiasm  we fell      into raptures by the barren shores of galilee we pondered at tabor      and at nazareth we exploded into poetry over the questionable      loveliness of esdraelon we meditated at jezreel and samaria over      the missionary zeal of jehu we riotedfairly rioted among the holy      places of jerusalem we bathed in jordan and the dead sea reckless      whether our accidentinsurance policies were extrahazardous or not      and brought away so many jugs of precious water from both places      that all the country from jericho to the mountains of moab will      suffer from drouth this year i think  yet the pilgrimage part of      the excursion was its pet featurethere is no question about that      after dismal smileless palestine beautiful egypt had few charms      for us  we merely glanced at it and were ready for home       they wouldnt let us land at maltaquarantine they would not let      us land in sardinia nor at algiers africa nor at malaga spain      nor cadiz nor at the madeira islands  so we got offended at all      foreigners and turned our backs upon them and came home  i suppose      we only stopped at the bermudas because they were in the programme      we did not care any thing about any place at all  we wanted to go      home  homesickness was abroad in the shipit was epidemic  if the      authorities of new york had known how badly we had it they would      have quarantined us here       the grand pilgrimage is over  goodbye to it and a pleasant memory      to it i am able to say in all kindness  i bear no malice no      illwill toward any individual that was connected with it either as      passenger or officer  things i did not like at all yesterday i like      very well today now that i am at home and always hereafter i      shall be able to poke fun at the whole gang if the spirit so moves      me to do without ever saying a malicious word  the expedition      accomplished all that its programme promised that it should      accomplish and we ought all to be satisfied with the management of      the matter certainly  byebye                                               mark twain   i call that complimentary  it is complimentary and yet i never have received a word of thanks for it from the hadjis on the contrary i speak nothing but the serious truth when i say that many of them even took exceptions to the article  in endeavoring to please them i slaved over that sketch for two hours and had my labor for my pains  i never will do a generous deed again     conclusion  nearly one year has flown since this notable pilgrimage was ended and as i sit here at home in san francisco thinking i am moved to confess that day by day the mass of my memories of the excursion have grown more and more pleasant as the disagreeable incidents of travel which encumbered them flitted one by one out of my mindand now if the quaker city were weighing her anchor to sail away on the very same cruise again nothing could gratify me more than to be a passenger  with the same captain and even the same pilgrims the same sinners  i was on excellent terms with eight or nine of the excursionists they are my staunch friends yet and was even on speaking terms with the rest of the sixtyfive  i have been at sea quite enough to know that that was a very good average  because a long seavoyage not only brings out all the mean traits one has and exaggerates them but raises up others which he never suspected he possessed and even creates new ones  a twelve months voyage at sea would make of an ordinary man a very miracle of meanness  on the other hand if a man has good qualities the spirit seldom moves him to exhibit them on shipboard at least with any sort of emphasis  now i am satisfied that our pilgrims are pleasant old people on shore i am also satisfied that at sea on a second voyage they would be pleasanter somewhat than they were on our grand excursion and so i say without hesitation that i would be glad enough to sail with them again  i could at least enjoy life with my handful of old friends  they could enjoy life with their cliques as wellpassengers invariably divide up into cliques on all ships  and i will say here that i would rather travel with an excursion party of methuselahs than have to be changing ships and comrades constantly as people do who travel in the ordinary way  those latter are always grieving over some other ship they have known and lost and over other comrades whom diverging routes have separated from them  they learn to love a ship just in time to change it for another and they become attached to a pleasant traveling companion only to lose him  they have that most dismal experience of being in a strange vessel among strange people who care nothing about them and of undergoing the customary bullying by strange officers and the insolence of strange servants repeated over and over again within the compass of every month  they have also that other misery of packing and unpacking trunksof running the distressing gauntlet of customhousesof the anxieties attendant upon getting a mass of baggage from point to point on land in safety i had rasher sail with a whole brigade of patriarchs than suffer so we never packed our trunks but twicewhen we sailed from new york and when we returned to it  whenever we made a land journey we estimated how many days we should be gone and what amount of clothing we should need figured it down to a mathematical nicety packed a valise or two accordingly and left the trunks on board  we chose our comrades from among our old tried friends and started  we were never dependent upon strangers for companionship  we often had occasion to pity americans whom we found traveling drearily among strangers with no friends to exchange pains and pleasures with  whenever we were coming back from a land journey our eyes sought one thing in the distance firstthe ship and when we saw it riding at anchor with the flag apeak we felt as a returning wanderer feels when he sees his home  when we stepped on board our cares vanished our troubles were at an endfor the ship was home to us  we always had the same familiar old stateroom to go to and feel safe and at peace and comfortable again  i have no fault to find with the manner in which our excursion was conducted  its programme was faithfully carried outa thing which surprised me for great enterprises usually promise vastly more than they perform  it would be well if such an excursion could be gotten up every year and the system regularly inaugurated  travel is fatal to prejudice bigotry and narrowmindedness and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts  broad wholesome charitable views of men and things can not be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all ones lifetime  the excursion is ended and has passed to its place among the things that were  but its varied scenes and its manifold incidents will linger pleasantly in our memories for many a year to come  always on the wing as we were and merely pausing a moment to catch fitful glimpses of the wonders of half a world we could not hope to receive or retain vivid impressions of all it was our fortune to see  yet our holyday flight has not been in vainfor above the confusion of vague recollections certain of its best prized pictures lift themselves and will still continue perfect in tint and outline after their surroundings shall have faded away  we shall remember something of pleasant france and something also of paris though it flashed upon us a splendid meteor and was gone again we hardly knew how or where  we shall remember always how we saw majestic gibraltar glorified with the rich coloring of a spanish sunset and swimming in a sea of rainbows  in fancy we shall see milan again and her stately cathedral with its marble wilderness of graceful spires and paduaveronacomo jeweled with stars and patrician venice afloat on her stagnant floodsilent desolate haughtyscornful of her humbled statewrapping herself in memories of her lost fleets of battle and triumph and all the pageantry of a glory that is departed  we can not forget florencenaplesnor the foretaste of heaven that is in the delicious atmosphere of greeceand surely not athens and the broken temples of the acropolis  surely not venerable romenor the green plain that compasses her round about contrasting its brightness with her gray decaynor the ruined arches that stand apart in the plain and clothe their looped and windowed raggedness with vines  we shall remember st peters not as one sees it when he walks the streets of rome and fancies all her domes are just alike but as he sees it leagues away when every meaner edifice has faded out of sight and that one dome looms superbly up in the flush of sunset full of dignity and grace strongly outlined as a mountain  we shall remember constantinople and the bosporusthe colossal magnificence of baalbecthe pyramids of egyptthe prodigious form the benignant countenance of the sphynxoriental smyrnasacred jerusalem damascus the pearl of the east the pride of syria the fabled garden of eden the home of princes and genii of the arabian nights the oldest metropolis on earth the one city in all the world that has kept its name and held its place and looked serenely on while the kingdoms and empires of four thousand years have risen to life enjoyed their little season of pride and pomp and then vanished and been forgotten
