laying the foundation of the chivalrous epic a poet appeared in lombardy whether inspired by his example is uncertain who was destined to carry it to a graver though still cheerful height and prepare the way for the crowning glories of ariosto in some respects he even excelled ariosto in all with the exception of style shewed himself a genuine though immature master  little is known of his life but that little is very pleasant it exhibits him in the rare light of a poet who was at once rich romantic an arcadian and a man of the world a feudal lord and an indulgent philosopher a courtier equally beloved by prince and people  matteo maria boiardo count of scandiano lord of arceto casalgrande c governor of reggio and captain of the citadel of modena it is pleasant to repeat such titles when so adorned is understood to have been born about the year 1434 at scandiano a castle at the foot of the apennines not far from reggio and famous for its vines  he was of an ancient family once lords of rubiera and son of giovanni second count of scandiano and lucia a lady of a branch of the strozzi family in florence and sister and aunt of tito and erole strozzi celebrated latin poets his parents appear to have been wise people for they gave him an education that fitted him equally for public and private life he was even taught or acquired more greek than was common to the men of letters of that age his whole life seems accordingly to have been divided with equal success between his duties as a servant of the dukes of modena both military and civil and the prosecution of his beloved art of poetrya combination of pursuits which have been idly supposed incompatible miltons poetry did not hinder him from being secretary to cromwell and an active partisan even the sequestered spenser was a statesman and poets and writers of fiction abound in the political histories of all the great nations of europe when a man possesses a thorough insight into any one intellectual department except perhaps in certain corners of science it only sharpens his powers of perception for the others if he chooses to apply them  in the year 1469 boiardo was one of the noblemen who went to meet the emperor frederick the third on his way to ferrara when duke borso of modena entertained him in that city two years afterwards borso who had been only marquis of ferrara received its ducal title from the pope and on going to rome to be invested with his new honours the name of our poet is again found among the adorners of his state a few days after his return home this prince died and boiardo favoured as he had been by him appears to have succeeded to a double portion of regard in the friendship of the new duke ercole who was more of his own age  during all this period from his youth to his prime our author varied his occupations with italian and latin poetry some of it addressed to a lady of the name of antonia caprara and some to another whose name is thought to have been rosa but whether these ladies died or his love was diverted elsewhere he took to wife in the year 1472 taddea gonzaga of the noble house of that name daughter of the count of novellara in the course of the same year he is supposed to have begun his great poem a popular courtfavourite in the prime of life marrying and commencing a great poem nearly at one and the same time presents an image of prosperity singularly delightful by this lady boiardo had two sons and four daughters the younger son francesco maria died in his childhood but the elder camillo succeeded to his fathers title and left an heir to itthe last i believe of the name the reception given to the poets bride when he took her to scandiano is said to have been very splendid  in the ensuing year the duke his master took a wife himself she was eleonora daughter of the king of naples and the newlymarried poet was among the noblemen who were sent to escort her to ferrara for several years afterwards his time was probably filled up with the composition of the orlando innamorato and the entertainments given by a splendid court he was appointed governor of reggio probably in 1478 at the expiration of two or three years he was made captain of the citadel of modena and in 1482 a war broke out with the venetians in which he took part for it interrupted the progress of his poem in 1484 he returned to it but ten years afterwards was again and finally interrupted by the unprincipled descent of the french on italy under charles the eighth and in the december following he died the orlando innamorato was thus left unfinished eight years before his decease the author published what he had written of it up to that time but the first complete edition was posthumous the poet was writing when the french came he breaks off with an anxious and bitter notice of the interruption though still unable to deny himself a last word on the episode which he was relating and a hope that he should conclude it another time    mentre che io canto o dio redentore     vedo litalia tutta a fiamma e foco   per questi galli che con gran valore     vengon per disertar non so che loco   però vi lascio in questo vano amore     di fiordespina ardente poco a poco   un altra volta se mi fia concesso   racconterovvi il tutto per espresso    but while i sing mine eyes great god behold     a flaming fire light all the italian sky   brought by these french who with their myriads bold     come to lay waste i know not where or why   therefore at present i must leave untold     how love misled poor fiordespinas eye2   another time fate willing i shall tell   from first to last how every thing befell  besides the orlando innamorato boiardo wrote a variety of prose works a comedy in verse on the subject of timon lyrics of great elegance with a vein of natural feeling running through them and latin poetry of a like sort not indeed as classical in its style as that of politian and the other subsequent revivers of the ancient manner but perhaps not the less interesting on that account for it is difficult to conceive a thorough copyist in style expressing his own thorough feelings mr panizzi if i am not mistaken promised the world a collection of the miscellaneous poems of boiardo but we have not yet had the pleasure of seeing them in his life of the poet however he has given several specimens both latin and italian which are extremely agreeable the latin poems consist of ten eclogues and a few epigrams but the epigrams this critic tells us are neither good nor on a fitting subject being satirical sallies against nicolò of este who had attempted to seize on ferrara and been beheaded boiardo was not of a nature qualified to indulge in bitterness a man of his chivalrous disposition probably misgave himself while he was writing these epigrams perhaps he suffered them to escape his pen out of friendship for the reigning branch of the family but it must be confessed that some of the bestnatured men have too often lost sight of their higher feelings during the pleasure and pride of composition  with respect to the comedy of timon if the whole of it is written as well as the concluding address of the misanthrope which mr panizzi has extracted into his pages it must be very pleasant timon conceals a treasure in a tomb and thinks he has baffled some knaves who had a design upon it he therefore takes leave of his audience with the following benedictions            pur ho scacciate queste due formiche   che raspavano l oro alla mia buca   or vadan pur che dio le malediche       cotal fortuna a casa li conduca   che lor fiacchi le gambe al primo passo   e nel secondo losso della nuca      voi altri che ascoltate giuso al basso   chiedete se volete alcuna cosa   prima ch io parta perchè mo vi lasso      benchè abbia lalma irata e disdegnosa   da ingiusti oltraggi combattuta e vinta   a voi già non lavrò tanto ritrosa      in me non è pietade al tutto estinta   faccia di voi la prova chi gli pare   sino alla corda the mi trovo cinta    gli presterò volendosi impiccare       so ive got rid of these two creeping things   that fain would have scratched up my buried gold   theyre gone and may the curse of god go with them   may they reach home dust in good time enough   to break their legs at the first step in doors   and necks i the secondand now then as to you   good audiencegroundlingsfolks who love low places   you too perhaps would fain get something of me   ere i take leavewellangered though i be   scornful and torn with rage at being ground   into the dust with wrong im not so lost   to all concern and charity for others   as not to be still kind enough to part   with something near to mesomething thats wound   about my very self here sirs mark this                                  untying the cord round his waist   let any that would put me to the test   take it with all my heart and hang themselves  the comedy of timon which was chiefly taken from lucian and one if not more of boiardos prose translations from other ancients were written at the request of duke ercole who was a great lover of dramatic versions of this kind and built a theatre for their exhibition at an enormous expense these prose translations consist of apuleiuss golden ass herodotus the dukes order the golden ass of lucian xenophons cyropædia not printed emilius probus also not printed and supposed to be cornelius nepos and riccobaldos credulous historia universalis with additions it seems not improbable that he also translated homer and diodorus and doni the bookmaker asserts that he wrote a work called the testamento dell anima the souls testament but mr panizzi calls doni a barefaced impostor and says that as the work is mentioned by nobody else we may be certain that it never existed and that the title was a forgery of the impudent priest  nothing else of boiardos writing is known to exist but a collection of official letters in the archives of modena which according to tiraboschi are of no great importance it is difficult to suppose however that they would not be worth looking at the author of the orlando innamorato could hardly write even upon the driest matters of government with the aridity of a common clerk some little lurking wellhead of character or circumstance interesting to readers of a later age would probably break through the barren ground perhaps the letters went counter to some of the good jesuits theology  boiardos prose translations from the authors of antiquity are so scarce that mr panizzi himself a learned and miscellaneous reader says he never saw them i am willing to get the only advantage in my power over an italian critic by saying that i have had some of them in my handsbrought there by the pleasant chances of the bookstalls but i can give no account of them a modern critic quoted by this gentleman gamba testi di lingua calls the version of apuleius rude and curious3 but adds that it contains expressions full of liveliness and propriety by rude is probably meant obsolete and comparatively unlearned correctness of interpretation and classical nicety of style as mr panizzi observes were the growths of a later age  nothing is told us by his biographers of the person of boiardo and it is not safe to determine a mans physique from his writings unless perhaps with respect to the greater or less amount of his animal spirits for the ablebodied may write effeminately and the feeblest supply the defect of corporal stamina with spiritual portraits however seem to be extant mazzuchelli discovered that a medal had been struck in the poets honour and in the castle of scandiano though the halls where knights and ladies listened to the adventures of the paladin are now turned into granaries and orlando himself has nearly disappeared from the outside where he was painted in huge dimensions as if entrusted with the wardenship there was a likeness of boiardo executed by niccolo dell abate together with the principal events of the orlando innamorato and the Æneidbut part of these paintings mr panizzi tells us were destroyed and part removed from the castle to modena to save them from certain loss and he does not add whether the portrait was among the latter  from anecdotes however and from the poets writings we gather the nature of the man and this appears to have been very amiable there is an aristocratic tone in his poem when speaking of the sort of people of whom the mass of soldiers is wont to consist and foscolo says that the count of scandiano writes like a feudal lord but common soldiers are not apt to be the elite of mankind neither do we know with how goodnatured a smile the mention of them may have been accompanied people often give a tone to what they read more belonging to their own minds than the authors all the accounts left us of boiardo hostile as well as friendly prove him to have been an indulgent and popular man according to one he was fond of making personal inquiries among its inhabitants into the history of his native place and he requited them so generously for their information that it was customary with them to say when they wished good fortune to one another heaven send boiardo to your house there is said to have been a tradition at scandiano that having tried in vain one day as he was riding out to discover a name for one of his heroes expressive of his lofty character and the word rodamonte coming into his head he galloped back with a pleasant ostentation to his castle crying it out aloud and ordering the bells of the place to be rung in its holiour to the astonishment of the good people who took rodamonte for some newlydiscovered saint his friend paganelli of modena who wrote a latin poem on the empire of cupid extolled the governor of reggio for ranking among the deitys most generous vassalsone who in spite of his office of magistrate looked with an indulgent eye on errors to which himself was liable and who was accustomed to prefer the study of loveverses to that of the law the learned lawyer his countryman panciroli probably in resentment as panizzi says of this preference accused him of an excess of benignity and of being fitter for writing poems than punishing ill deeds and in truth as the same critic observes he must have been considered crazy by the whole tribe of lawyers of that age if it be true that he anticipated the opinion of beccaria in thinking that no crime ought to be punished with death  the great work of this interesting and accomplished person the orlando innamorato is an epic romance founded on the love of the great paladin for the peerless beauty angelica whose name has enamoured the ears of posterity the poem introduces us to the pleasantest paths in that track of reading in which milton has told us that his young feet delighted to wander nor did he forsake it in his age    such forces met not nor so wide a camp   when agrican with all his northern powers   besieged albracca as romances tell   the city of gallaphrone from whence to win   the fairest of her sex angelica                                              paradise regained  the orlando innamorato may be divided into three principal portionsthe search for angelica by orlando and her other lovers the siege of her fathers city albracca by the tartars and that of paris and charlemagne by the moors these however are all more or less intermingled and with the greatest art and there are numerous episodes of a like intertexture the fairies and fairygardens of british romance and the fabulous glories of the house of este now proclaimed for the first time were added by the author to the enchantments of pulci together with a pervading elegance and had the poem been completed we were to have heard again of the traitor gan of maganza for the purpose of exalting the imaginary founder of that house ruggero  this resuscitation of the helen of antiquity under a more seducing form was an invention of boiardos so was the subjection of charless hero orlando to the passion of love so besides the heroine and her name was that of other interesting characters with beautiful names which afterwards figured in ariosto this inventive faculty is indeed so conspicuous in every part of the work on small as well as great occasions in fairyadventures and those of flesh and blood that although the author appears to have had both his loves and his fairies suggested to him by our romances of arthur and the round table it constitutes next to the pervading elegance above mentioned his chief claim to our admiration another of his merits is a certain tender gallantry or rather an honest admixture of animal passion with spiritual also the precursor of the like ingenuous emotions in ariosto and he furthermore set his follower the example not only of good breeding but of a constant heroical cheerfulness looking with faith on nature pulci has a constant cheerfulness but not with so much grace and dignity foscolo has remarked that boiardos characters even surpass those of ariosto in truth and variety and that his angelica more engages our feelings4 to which i will venture to add that if his style is less strong and complete it never gives us a sense of elaboration i should take boiardo to have been the healthier man though of a less determined will than ariosto and perhaps on the whole less robust you find in boiardo almost which ariosto perfectedchivalry battles combats loves and graces passions enchantments classical and romantic fable eulogy satire mirth pathos philosophy it is like the first sketch of a great picture not the worse in some respects for being a sketch free and light though not so grandly coloured it is the morning before the sun is up and when the dew is on the grass take the stories which are translated in the present volume and you might fancy them all written by ariosto with a difference the death of agrican perhaps with minuter touches of nature but certainly not with greater simplicity and earnestness in the saracen friends there is just ariostos balance of passion and levity and in the story which i have entitled seeing and believing his exhibition of triumphant cunning during the lives of pulci and boiardo the fierce passions and severe ethics of dante had been gradually giving way to a gentler and laxer state of opinion before the progress of luxury and though boiardos enamoured paladin retains a kind of virtue not common in any age to the heroes of warfare the lord of scandiano who appears to have recited his poem sometimes to his vassals and sometimes to the ducal circle at court intimates a smiling suspicion that such a virtue would be considered a little rude and obsolete by his hearers pulcis wandering gallant uliviero who in dantes time would have been a scandalous profligate had become the prototype of the courtlover in boiardos the poet however in his most favourite characters retained and recommended a truer sentiment as in the instance of the loves of brandimart and fiordelisa and there is a graceful cheerfulness in some of his least sentimental ones which redeems them from grossness i know not a more charming fancy in the whole loving circle of fairyland than the females shaking her long tresses round mandricardo in order to furnish him with a mantle when he issues out of the enchanted fountain5  but boiardos poem was unfinished there are many prosaical passages in it many lame and harsh lines incorrect and even ungrammatical expressions trivial images and above all many lombard provincialisms which are not in their nature of a significant or graceful sort6 and which shocked the fastidious florentines the arbiters of italian taste it was to avoid these in his own poetry that boiardos countryman ariosto carefully studied the tuscan dialect if not visited florence itself and the consequence was that his greater genius so obscured the popularity of his predecessor that a remarkable process unique in the history of letters appears to have been thought necessary to restore its perusal the facetious berni a tuscan wit full of genius without omitting any particulars of consequence or adding a single story except of himself recast the whole poem of boiardo altering the diction of almost every stanza and supplying introductions to the cantos after the manner of ariosto and the florentine idiom and unfailing spirit of this refashioners verse though what is very curious not till after a long chance of its being overlooked itself and a posthumous editorship which has left doubts on the authority of the text gradually effaced almost the very mention of the mans name who had supplied him with the whole staple commodity of his book with all the heart of its interest and with far the greater part of the actual words the first edition of berni was prohibited in consequence of its containing a severe attack on the clergy but even the prohibition did not help to make it popular the reader may imagine a similar occurrence in england by supposing that dryden had rewritten the whole of chaucer and that his reconstruction had in the course of time as much surpassed the original in popularity as his version of the flower and the leaf did up to the beginning of the present century  i do not mean to compare chaucer with boiardo or dryden with berni fine poet as i think boiardo i hold chaucer to be a far finer and spirited and in some respects admirable as are drydens versions of chaucer they do not equal that of boiardo by the tuscan dryden did not apprehend the sentiment of chaucer in any such degree as berni did that of his original indeed mr panizzi himself to whom the world is indebted both for the only good edition of boiardo and for the knowledge of the most curious facts respecting bernis rifacimento declares himself unable to pronounce which of the two poems is the better one the original boiardo or the remodelled it would therefore not very well become a foreigner to give a verdict even if he were able and i confess after no little consideration and apart of course from questions of dialect which i cannot pretend to look into i feel myself almost entirely at a loss to conjecture on which side the superiority lies except in point of invention and a certain early simplicity the advantage in those two respects unquestionably belongs to boiardo and a great one it is and may not unreasonably be supposed to settle the rest of the question in his favour and yet bernis fancy during a more sophisticate period of italian manners exhibited itself so abundantly in his own witty poems his pen at all times has such a charming facility and he proved himself in his version of boiardo to have so strong a sympathy with the earnestness and sentiment of his original in his gravest moments that i cannot help thinking the two men would have been each what the other was in their respective timesthe lombard the comparative idler given more to witty than serious invention under a corrupt roman court and the tuscan the originator of romantic fictions in a court more suited to him than the one he avowedly despised i look upon them as two men singularly well matched the nature of the present work does not require and the limits to which it is confined do not permit me to indulge myself in a comparison between them corroborated by proofs but it is impossible not to notice the connexion and therefore begging the readers pardon for the sorry substitute of affirmative for demonstrative criticism i may be allowed to say that if boiardo has the praise of invention to himself berni thoroughly appreciated and even enriched it that if boiardo has sometimes a more thoroughly charming simplicity berni still appreciates it so well that the difference of their times is sufficient to restore the claim of equality of feeling and finally that if berni strengthens and adorns the interest of the composition with more felicitous expressions and with a variety of lively and beautiful trains of thought you feel that boiardo was quite capable of them all and might have done precisely the same had he lived in bernis age in the greater part of the poem the original is altered in nothing except diction and often so at least it seems to me for no other reason than the requirements of the tuscan manner and this is the case with most of the noblest and even the liveliest passages my first acquaintance for example with the orlando innamorato was through the medium of berni and on turning to those stories in his version which i have translated from his original for the present volume i found that every passage but one to which i had given a mark of admiration was the property of the old poet that single one however was in the exquisitest taste full of as deep a feeling as any thing in its company i have noticed it in the translated passage and then in the celebrated introductions to his cantos and the additions to boiardos passages of description and character those about rodamonte for example so admired by foscolo if berni occasionally spews a comparative want of faith which you regret he does it with a regret on his own part visible through all his jesting lastly the singular and indignant strength of his execution often makes up for the trustingness that he was sorry to miss if i were asked in short which of the two poems i should prefer keeping were i compelled to choose i should first complain of being forced upon so hard an alternative and then with many a look after berni retain boiardo the invention is his the first earnest impulse the unmisgivings joy the primitive morning breath when the townsmoke has not polluted the fields and the birds are singing their woodnotes wild besides after all one cannot be sure that berni could have invented as boiardo did if he could he would probably have written some fine serious poem of his own and panizzi has observed with striking and conclusive truth that without berni the orlando innamorato will be read and enjoyed without boiardo not even the name of the poem remains7  nevertheless this conclusion need not deprive us of either work berni raised a fine polished edifice copied and enlarged after that of boiardoon the other hand the old house thank heaven remains and our best way of settling the question between the two is to be glad that we have got both let the reader who is rich in such possessions look upon bernis as one of his town mansions erected in the parklike neighbourhood of some metropolis and boiardos as the ancient country original of it embosomed in the woods afar off and beautiful as the enchanted castle of claude    lone sitting by the shores of old romance                                       footnote 1 the materials for the biography in this notice have been gathered from tiraboschi and others but more immediately from the copious critical memoir from the pen of mr panizzi in that gentlemans admirable edition of the combined poems of boiardo and ariosto in nine volumes octavo published by mr pickering i have been under obligations to this work in the notice of pulci and shall again be so in that of boiardos successor but i must not a third time run the risk of omitting to give it my thanks such as they are and of earnestly recommending every lover of italian poetry who can afford it to possess himself of this learned entertaining and only satisfactory edition of either of the orlandos the author writes an english almost as correct as it is elegant and he is as painstaking as he is lively  footnote 2 she had taken a damsel in male attire for a man  footnote 3 crescimbeni himself had not seen the translation from apuleius nor apparently several

foscolo ut sup p 528  footnote 7 a late amiable man of wit mr stewart rose has given a prose abstract of bernis orlando innamorato with occasional versification but it is hardly more than a dry outline and was indeed intended only as an introduction to his version of the furioso a good idea however of one of the phases of bernis humour may be obtained from the same gentlemans abridgment of the animali parlanti of casti in which he has introduced a translation of the tuscans description of himself and of his way of life out of his additions to boiardos poem the verses in the prohibited edition of bernis orlando in which he denounced the corruptions of the clergy have been published for the first time in this country in the notes to the twentieth canto of mr panizzis boiardo they have all his peculiar wit together with a lutheran earnestness and shew him as that critic observes to have been protestant at his heart  since writing this note i have called to mind that a translation of bernis account of himself is to be found in mr roses prose abstract of the innamorato   the adventures of angelica  argument  angelica daughter of galafron king of cathay the most beautiful of womankind and a possessor of the art of magic comes with her brother argalia to the court of charlemagne under false pretences in order to carry away his knights to the country of her father her immediate purpose is defeated and her brother slain but all the knights orlando in particular fall in love with her and she herself in consequence of drinking at an enchanted fountain becomes in love with rinaldo on the other hand rinaldo from drinking a neighbouring fountain of a reverse quality finds his own love converted to loathing various adventures arise out of these circumstances and the fountains are again drunk with a mutual reversal of their effects  the adventures of angelica  it was the month of may and the feast of pentecost and charlemagne had ordained a great jousting which brought into paris an infinite number of people baptised and infidel for there was truce proclaimed in order that every knight might come there was king grandonio from spain with his serpents face and ferragus with his eyes like an eagle and balugante the emperors kinsman and orlando and rinaldo and duke namo and astolfo of england the handsomest of mankind and the enchanter malagigi and isoliero and salamone and the traitor gan with his scoundrel followers and in short the whole flower of the chivalry of the age the greatest in the world the tables at which they feasted were on three sides of the hall with the emperors canopy midway at the top and at that first table sat crowned heads and down the table on the right sat dukes and marquises and down the table on the left counts and cavaliers but the saracen nobles after their doggish fashion looked neither for chair nor bench but preferred a carpet on the floor which was accordingly spread for them in the midst  high sat charlemagne at the head of his vassals and his paladins rejoicing in the thought of all the great men of which they consisted and holding the infidels cheap as the sands which are scattered by the tempest to each of his lords as they drank he sent round by his pages gifts of enamelled cups of exquisite workmanship and to every body some mark of his princely distinction and so they were all sitting and hearing music and feasting off dishes of gold and talking of lovely things with low voices1 when suddenly there came into the hall four enormous giants in the midst of whom was a lady and behind the lady there followed a cavalier she was a very lily of the field and a rose of the garden and a morningstar in short so beautiful that the like had never been seen there was galerana in the hall there was alda the wife of orlando and clarice and armellina the kindhearted and abundance of other ladies all beautiful till she made her appearance but after that they seemed nothing every christian knight turned his face that way and not a pagan remained on the floor but arose and got as near to her as he could while she with a cheerful sweetness and a smile fit to enamour a heart of stone began speaking the following words  highminded lord the renown of your worthiness and the valour of these your knights which echoes from sea to sea encourages me to hope that two pilgrims who have come from the ends of the world to behold you will not have encountered their fatigue in vain and to the end that i may not hold your attention too long with speaking let me briefly say that this knight here uberto of the lion a prince renowned also for his achievements has been wrongfully driven from out his dominions and that i who was driven out with him am his sister whose name is angelica fame has told us of the jousting this day appointed and of the noble press of knights here assembled and how your generous natures care not to win prizes of gold or jewels or gifts of cities but only a wreath of roses and so the prince my brother has come to prove his own valour and to say that if any or all of your guests whether baptised or infidel choose to meet him in the joust he will encounter them one by one in the green meadow without the walls near the place called the horseblock of merlin by the fountain of the pine and his conditions are thesethat no knight who chances to be thrown shall have license to renew the combat in any way whatsoever but remain a submissive prisoner in his hands he on the other hand if himself be thrown agreeing to take his departure out of the country with his giants and to leave his sister for prize in the hands of the conqueror  kneeling at the close of these words the lady awaited the answer of charlemagne and every body gazed on her with astonishment orlando especially more than all the rest felt irresistibly drawn towards her so that his heart trembled and he changed countenance but he felt ashamed at the same time and casting his eyes down he said to himself ah mad and unworthy orlando whither is thy soul being hurried i am drawn and cannot say nay to what draws me i reckoned the whole world as nothing and now i am conquered by a girl i cannot get her sweet look out of my heart my soul seems to die within me at the thought of being without her it is love that has seized me and i feel that nothing will set me freenot strength nor courage nor my own wisdom nor that of any adviser i see the better part and cleave to the worse2  thus secretly in his heart did the frank and noble orlando lament over his new feelings and no wonder for every knight in the hall was enamoured of the beautiful stranger not excepting even old whiteheaded duke namo charlemagne himself did not escape  all stood for awhile in silence lost in the delight of looking at her the fiery youth ferragus was the first to exhibit symptoms in his countenance of uncontrollable passion he refrained with difficulty from going up to the giants and tearing her out of their keeping rinaldo also turned as red as fire while his cousin malagigi the enchanter who had discovered that the stranger was not speaking truth muttered softly as he looked at her exquisite false creature i will play thee such a trick for this as will leave thee no cause to boast of thy visit  charlemagne to detain her as long as possible before him made a speech in answer in which he talked and looked and looked and talked till there seemed no end of it at length however the challenge was accepted in all its forms and the lady quitted the hall with her brother and the giants  she had not yet passed the gates when malagigi the enchanter consulted his books and that no means might be wanting to complete the counteraction of what he suspected he summoned to his aid three spirits out of the lower regions but how serious his look turned how his very soul within him was shaken when he discovered that the most dreadful disasters hung over charles and his court and that the sister of the pretended uberto was daughter of king galafron of cathay a beauty accomplished in every species of enchantment and sent there by her father on purpose to betray them all her brothers name was not uberto but argalia galafron had given him a horse swifter than the wind an enchanted sword a golden lance also enchanted which overthrew all whom it touched3 and a ring of a virtue so extraordinary that if put into the mouth it rendered the person invisible and if worn on the finger nullified every enchantment but beyond even all this he gave him his sister for a companion rightly judging that every body that saw her would fall into the proposal of the joust and trusting that at the close of it she would bring him the whole court of france into cathay prisoners in her hands  such malagigi discovered was the plot of the accursed infidel hound king galafron4  meantime the pretended uberto had returned to his station at the horseblock of merlin he had had a beautiful pavilion pitched there and under this pavilion he lay down awhile to refresh himself with sleep his sister angelica lay down also but in the open air under the great pine by the fountain the four giants kept watch and as she lay thus asleep with her fair head on the grass she appeared like an angel come down from heaven  by this time malagigi borne by one of his demons had arrived in the same place he saw the beauty asleep by the flowery water and the four giants all wide awake and he said within his teeth brute scoundrels i will take every one of you into my net without a blow  malagigi took his book and cast a spell out of it and in an instant the whole four giants were buried in sleep then drawing his sword he softly approached the young lady intending to despatch her as quickly but seeing her look so lovely as she slept he paused and considered within himself and resolved to detain her in the same state by enchantment so long as it should please him laying down the naked sword in the grass he again took his book and read and read on and still read on and fancied he was locking up her senses all the while in a sleep unwakeable but the ring of which i have spoken was on her finger she had borrowed it of her brother and a superior power rendered all other magic of no avail a touch from malagigi to prove the force of his spell awoke her to the magicians consternation with a great cry she fled into the arms of her brother whom it aroused and by the help of his sisters knowledge of enchantment argalia mastered and bound the magician the book was then turned against him and the place was suddenly filled with a crowd of his own demons every one of them crying out to angelica what commandest thou  take this man said angelica and bear him prisoner to the great city between tartary and india where my father galafron is lord present him to him in my name and say it was i that took him and add that having so taken the master of the book i care not for all the other lords of the court of charlemagne  at the end of these words and at one and the same instant the magician was conveyed to the feet of galafron in cathay and locked up in a rock under the sea  in due time the enamoured knights according to agreement came to the spot for the purpose of jousting with the supposed uberto each anxious to have the first encounter particularly orlando in order that he might not see the beauty carried off by another but they were obliged to draw lots and thirty other names appeared before his the first of which was that of astolfo the englishman  now astolfo was son of the king of england and as i said before he was the handsomest man in the world he was also very rich and well bred and loved to dress well and was as brave as he was handsome but his success was not always equal to his bravery he had a trick of being thrown from his horse a failing which he was accustomed to attribute to accident and then he would mount again and be again thrown from the saddle in the boldest manner conceivable  this gallant prince was habited on the present occasion in arms worth a whole treasury his shield had a border of large pearls his mail was of gold on his helmet was a ruby as big as a chestnut and his horse was covered with a cloth all over golden leopards5 he issued to the combat looking at nobody and fearing nothing and on his sounding the horn to battle argalia came forth to meet him after courteous salutations the two combatants rushed together but the moment the englishman was touched with the golden lance his legs flew over his head  cursed fortune cried he as he lay on the grass this is out of all calculation but it was entirely owing to the saddle you cant but acknowledge that if i had kept my seat the beautiful lady would have been mine but thus it is when fortune chooses to befriend infidels6  the four giants who had by this time been disenchanted out of their sleep by angelica took up the english prince and put him in the pavilion but when he was stripped of his armour he looked so handsome that the lovely stranger secretly took pity on him and bade them shew him all the courtesies that captivity allowed he was permitted to walk outside by the fountain and angelica from a dark corner looked at him with admiration as he walked up and down in the moonlight7  the violent ferragus had the next chance in the encounter and was thrown no less speedily than astolfo but he did not so easily put up with the mischance crying out what are the emperors engagements to me he rushed with his sword against argalia who being forced to defend himself unexpectedly dismounted and set aside his lance and got so much the worse of the fight that he listened to proposals of marriage from ferragus to his sister the beauty however not feeling an inclination to match with so rough and savagelooking a person was so dismayed at the offer that hastily bidding her brother meet her in the forest of arden she vanished from the sight of both by means of the enchanted ring argalia seeing this took to his horse of swiftness and dashed away in the same direction ferragus in distraction pursued argalia and astolfo thus left to himself took possession of the golden lance and again issued forthnot indeed with quite his usual confidence of the result but determined to run all risks in any thing that might ensue for the sake of the emperor in fine to cut this part of the history short charlemagne finding the lady and her brother gone ordered the joust to be restored to its first intention and astolfo who was as ignorant as the others of the treasure he possessed in the enchanted lance unhorsed all comers against him like so many children equally to their astonishment and his own  the paladin rinaldo now learnt the issue of the fight between ferragus and the stranger and galloped in a loving agony of pursuit after the fair fugitive orlando learnt the disappearance of rinaldo and distracted with jealousy pushed forth in like manner and at length all three are in the forest of arden hunting about for her who is invisible  now in this forest were two enchanted waters the one a running stream and the other a built fountain the first caused every body who tasted it to fall in love and the other so to speak to fall out of love say rather to feel the love turned into hate to the latter of these two waters rinaldo happened to come and being flushed with heat and anxiety he dismounted from his horse and quenched in one cold draught both his thirst and his passion so far from loving angelica as before or holding her beauty of any account he became disgusted with its pursuit nay hated her from the bottom of his heart and so in this new state of mind and with feelings of lofty contempt he remounted and rode away and happened to come on the bank of the running stream there enticed by the beauty of the place which was all sweet meadowground and bowers of trees he again quitted his saddle and throwing himself on the ground fell fast asleep unfortunately for the proud beauty angelica or rather in just punishment for her contempt her palfrey conducted her to this very place the water tempted her to drink and dismounting and tying the animal to one of the trees she did so and then cast her eyes on the sleeping rinaldo love instantly seized her and she stood rooted to the spot  the meadow round about was all full of lilies of the valley and wild roses angelica not knowing what to do at length plucked a quantity of these and with her white hand she dropped them on the face of the sleeper he woke up and seeing who it was not only received her salutations with a change of countenance but remounting his horse galloped away through the thickest part of the forest in vain the beautiful creature followed and called after him in vain asked him what she had done to be so despised and entreated him at any rate to take care how he went so fast rinaldo disappeared leaving her to wring her hands in despair and she returned in tears to the spot on which she had found him sleeping there in her turn she herself lay down pressing the spot of earth on which he had lain and so weeping and lamenting yet blessing every flower and bit of grass that he had touched fell asleep out of fatigue and sorrow  as angelica thus lay the good or bad fortune of orlando conducted him to the same place the attitude in which she was sleeping was so lovely that it is not even to be conceived much less expressed the very grass seemed to flower on all sides of her for joy and the stream as it murmured along to go talking of love8 orlando stood gazing like a man who had been transported to another sphere am i on earth thought he or am i in paradise surely it is i myself that am sleeping and this is my dream  but his dream was proved to be none in a manner which he little desired ferragus who had slain argalia came up raging with jealousy and a combat ensued which awoke the sleeper terrified at what she beheld she rushed to her palfrey and while the fighters were occupied with one another fled away through the forest  fast fled the beauty in the direction taken by rinaldo nor did she cease travelling by one conveyance or another till she reached her own country whither she had sent malagigi him she freed from his prison on condition that he would employ his art for the purpose of bringing rinaldo to a palace of hers which she possessed in an island and accordingly rinaldo was inveigled by a spirit into an enchanted barque which he found on a seashore and which conveyed him without any visible pilot into joyous palace for so the island was called  the whole island was a garden fifteen miles in extent it was full of trees and lawns and on the western side close to the sea was the palace built of a marble so clear and polished that it reflected the landscape round about rinaldo not knowing what to think of his strange conveyance lost no time in leaping to shore upon which a lady made her appearance who invited him within the house was a most beautiful house full of rooms adorned with azure and gold and with noble paintings and within as well as without it were the loveliest flowers the purest fountains and a fragrance fit to turn sorrow to joy the lady led the knight into an apartment painted with stories and opening to the garden through pillars of crystal with golden capitals here he found a bevy of ladies three of whom were singing in concert while another played on some foreign instrument of exquisite accord and the rest were dancing round about them when the ladies beheld him coming they turned the dance into a circuit round about himself and then one of them in the sweetest manner said sir knight the tables are set and the hour for the banquet is come and with these words they all drew him still dancing across the lawn in front of the apartment to a table that was spread with cloth of gold and fine linen under a bower of damask roses by the side of a fountain9  four ladies were already seated there who rose and placed rinaldo at their head in a chair set with pearls and truly indeed was he astonished a repast ensued consisting of viands the most delicate and wines as fragrant as they were fine drunk out of jewelled cups and when it drew towards its conclusion harps and lutes were heard in the distance and one of the ladies said in the knights ear this house and all that you see in it are yours for you alone was it built and the builder is a queen and happy indeed must you think yourself for she loves you and she is the greatest beauty in the world her name is angelica  the moment rinaldo heard the name he so detested disgust and wretchedness fell upon his heart notwithstanding the joys around him he started up with a changed countenance and in spite of all that the lady could say broke off across the garden and never ceased hastening till he reached the place where he landed he would have thrown himself into the sea rather than stay any longer in that island but the enchanted barque was still on the shore he sprang into it and attempted instantly to push off for he still saw nobody in it but himself but the barque for a while resisted his efforts till on his feeling a wish to drown himself or to do any thing rather than return to that detested house it suddenly loosed itself from its moorings and dashed away with him over the sea as if in a fury  all night did the pilotless barque dash on till it reached in the morning a distant shore covered with a gloomy forest here rinaldo surrounded by enchantments of a very different sort from those which he had lately resisted was entrapped into a pit the pit belonged to a castle which was hung with human heads and painted red with blood and as the paladin was calling upon god to help him a hideous whiteheaded old woman of a spiteful countenance made her appearance on the edge of the pit and told him that he must fight with a monster born of death and desire  be it so said the paladin let me but remain armed as i am and i fear nothing for rinaldo had with him his renowned sword fusberta10  the old woman laughed in derision rinaldo remained in the den all night and next day was taken to a place where a portcullis was lifted up and the monster rushed forth he was a mixture of hog and serpent larger than an ox and not to be looked at without horror he had eyes like a traitor the hands of a man but clawed a beard dabbled with blood a skin of coarse variegated colours too hard to be cut through and two horns on his temples which he could turn on all sides of him at his pleasure and which were so sharp that they cut like a sword  rising on his hindlegs and opening a mouth six palms in width this horrible beast fell heavily on rinaldo who was nevertheless quick enough to give it a blow on the snout which increased its fury returning the knight a tremendous cuff it seized his coat of mail between breast and shoulder and tore away a great strip of it down to the girdle leaving the skin bare every successive rent and blow was of the like irresistible violence and though the paladin himself never fought with more force and fury he lost blood every instant the monster at length tearing his sword out of his hand the paladin surely began to think that his last hour was arrived  looking about to see what might possibly help him he observed overhead a beam sticking out of a wall at the height of some ten feet he took a leap more than human and reaching the beam with his hand succeeded in flinging himself up across it here he sat for hours the furious brute continually trying to reach him nighttime then came on with a clear starry sky and moonlight and the paladin could discern no way of escaping when he heard a sound of something he knew not what coming through the air like a bird suddenly a female figure stood on the end of the beam holding something in her hand towards him and speaking in a loving voice  it was angelica come with means for destroying the monster and carrying the knight away  but the moment rinaldo saw her desperate as seemed to be his condition he renounced all offers of her assistance and at length became so exasperated with her good offices especially when she opened her arms and offered to bear him away in them that he threatened to cast himself down to the monster if she did not go away11  angelica saying that she would lose her life rather than displease him descended from the beam and having given the monster a cake of wax which fastened up his teeth and then caught and fixed him in a set of nooses she had brought for that purpose took her miserable departure rinaldo upon this got down from the beam himself and having succeeded though with the greatest difficulty in beating and squeezing the life out of the monster dealt such havoc among the people of the castle who assailed him that the horrible old woman whose crimes had made her the creatures housekeeper and led her to take delight in its cruelty threw herself headlong from a tower the paladin then took his way forth turning his back on the castle and the seashore  angelica returned to the capital of her fathers dominion albracca and the pertinacity of others in seeking her love being as great as that of hers for rinaldo she found king galafron in a short time besieged there for her sake by the fierce agrican king of tartary  in a short time a jealous feud sprang up between the loving friends rinaldo and orlando and angelica torn with conflicting emotions from her dread on her fathers account as well as her own and her aversion to every knight but her detester was at one time compelled to apply to orlando for assistance and at another being afraid that he would have the better of rinaldo in combat to send him away on a perilous adventure elsewhere with a promise of accepting his love should he succeed12 orlando went but not before he had slain agrican and delivered albracca circumstances however again took him with her to a distance as the reader will see ere he could bring her to perform her promise and the paladins in general having again been scattered abroad it happened that rinaldo a second time found himself in the forest of arden and here without expecting it he became an altered man for he now tasted a very different stream from that which had given him his hate for angelica namely the one which had made her fall in love with himself he was led to do this by a very extraordinary adventure  in the thick of the forest he had come upon a mead full of flowers in which there was a naked youth singing in the midst of three damsels who were naked also and who were dancing round about him they had bunches of flowers in their hands and garlands on their heads and as they were thus delighting themselves with faces full of love and joy they suddenly changed countenance on seeing rinaldo behold cried they the traitor behold him villain that he is and the scorner of all delights he has fallen into the net at last with these words they fell upon him with the flowers like so many furies and tender as such scourges might be thought every blow which the roses and violets gave him every fresh stroke of the lilies and the hyacinths smote him to the very heart and filled his veins with fire the flowers in the bands of the nymphs being exhausted the youth gave him a blow on the helmet with a tall gardenlily which felled him to the earth and so taking him by the legs and dragging him over the grass his conqueror went the whole circuit of the mead with him the nymphs taking the very garlands off their heads and again scourging him with their white and red roses13  at the close of this discipline which left him more exhausted than twenty battles his enemies suddenly developed wings from their shoulders the feathers of which were of white and gold and vermilion every feather having an eye in it not like those in the peacocks feathers but one full of life and motion being a female eye lovely and gracious and with these wings they poised themselves a little and so sprung up to heaven14  the paladin more dead than alive lay helpless among the flowers when a fourth nymph came up to him of inexpressible beauty she told him that he had grievously offended the naked youth who was no other than love himself and added that his only remedy was to be penitent and to drink of the waters of a stream hard by which he would find running from the roots of an olivetree and a pine with these words she vanished in her turn like the rest and rinaldo dragging himself as well as he could to the olive and pine stooped down and greedily drank of the water again and again he drank and wished still to be drinking for it took not only all pain out of his limbs but all hate and bitterness out of his soul and produced such a remorseful and doating memory of angelica that he would fain have galloped that instant to cathay and prostrated himself at her feet by degrees he knew the place and looking round about him and preparing to remount his horse he discerned a knight and a lady in the distance the knight was in a coat of armour unknown to him and the lady kneeling and drinking at a fountain which was the one that had formerly quenched his own thirst to wit the fountain of disdain  alas it was angelica herself and the knight was orlando she had allowed him to bring her into france ostensibly for the purpose of wedding him at the court of charlemagne whither the heros assistance had been called against agramant king of the moors but secretly with the object of discovering rinaldo rinaldo behold is discovered but the fatal averse water has been drunk and angelica now hates him in turn as cordially as he detested her in vain he accosted her in the humblest and most repentant manner calling himself the unworthiest of mankind and entreating to be allowed to love her orlando disclosing himself fiercely interrupted him and a combat so terrific ensued that angelica fled away on her palfrey till she came to a large plain in which she beheld an army encamped  the army was charlemagnes who had come to meet rodamonte one of the vassals of agramant angelica in a tremble related how she had left the two paladins fighting in the wood and charlemagne who was delighted to find orlando so near him proceeded thither with his lords and parting the combatants by his royal authority suppressed the dispute between them for the present by consigning the object of their contention to the care of namo duke of bavaria with the understanding that she was to be the prize of the warrior who should best deserve her in the approaching battle with the infidels  this is the last we hear of angelica in the unfinished poem of boiardo for the close of her history see its continuation by ariosto in the present volume   footnote 1 con parlar basso e bei ragionamenti  footnote 2 video meliora proboque c writers were now beginning to pride themselves on their classical reading the present occasion it must be owned was a very good one for introducing the passage from

which is in our own ancient british romances appears to have been completed by the lively invention of boiardo and is a curious epitome of almost all which has been discerned in the travelled englishmen by the envy of poorer and the wit of livelier foreigners he has the handsomeness and ostentation of a buckingham the wealth of a beckford the generosity of a carlisle the invincible pretensions of a crichton the selfcommitals and bravery of a digby the lucklessness of a stuart and the nonchalance under difficulties of milord whatthen in voltaires princess of babylon where the

whether living eyes of any sort instead of those in the peacocks feathers are in good taste the imagination revolts from life misplaced   the  death of agrican  argument  agrican king of tartary in love with angelica and baffled by the prowess of the unknown orlando in his attempts to bring the siege of albracca to a favourable conclusion entices him apart from the battle into a wood in the hope of killing him in single combat the combat is suspended by the arrival of nighttime and a conversation ensues between the warriors which is furiously interrupted by agricans discovery of his rival and the latters refusal to renounce his love agrican is slain and in his dying moments requests baptism at the hand of his conqueror who with great tenderness bestows it  the  death of agrican  the siege of albracca was going on formidably under the command of agrican and the city of galafron was threatened with the loss of the monarchs daughter angelica when orlando at his earnest prayer came to assist him and changing at once the whole course of the war threw the enemy in his turn into transports of anxiety wherever the great paladin came pennon and standard fell before him men were cut up and cloven down at every stroke of his sword and whereas the indians had been in full rout but a moment before and the tartars ever on their flanks galafron himself being the swiftest among the spurrers away it was now the tartars that fled for their lives for orlando was there and a band of fresh knights were about him and agrican in vain attempted to rally his troops the paladin kept him constantly in his front forcing him to attend to nobody else the tartar king who cared not a button for galafron and all his army1 provided he could but rid himself of this terrible knight whom he guessed at but did not know bethought him of a stratagem he turned his horse and made a show of flying in despair orlando dashed after him as he desired and agrican fled till he reached a green place in a wood with a fountain in it  the place was beautiful and the tartar dismounted to refresh himself at the fountain but without taking off his helmet or laying aside any of his armour orlando was quickly at his back crying out so bold and yet such a fugitive how could you fly from a single arm and yet think to escape when a man can die with honour he should be glad to die for he may live and fare worse he may get death and infamy together  the tartar king had leaped on his saddle the moment he saw his enemy and when the paladin had done speaking he said in a mild voice without doubt you are the best knight i ever encountered and fain would i leave you untouched for your own sake if you would cease to hinder me from rallying my people i pretended to fly in order to bring you out of the field if you insist upon fighting i must needs fight and slay you but i call the sun in the heavens to witness that i would rather not i should be very sorry for your death  the county orlando felt pity for so much gallantry and he said the nobler you shew yourself the more it grieves me to think that in dying without a knowledge of the true faith you will be lost in the other world let me advise you to save body and soul at once receive baptism and go your way in peace  agrican looked him in the face and replied i suspect you to be the paladin orlando if you are i would not lose this opportunity of fighting with you to be king of paradise talk to me no more about your things of the other world for you will preach in vain each of us for himself and let the sword be umpire  no sooner said than done the tartar drew his sword boldly advancing upon orlando and a cut and thrust fight began so long and so terrible each warrior being a miracle of prowess that the story says it lasted from noon till night orlando then seeing the stars come out was the first to propose a respite what are we to do said he now that daylight has left us  agrican answered readily enough let us repose in this meadow and renew the combat at dawn  the repose was taken accordingly each tied up his horse and reclined himself on the grass not far from one another just as if they had been friendsorlando by the fountain agrican beneath a pine it was a beautiful clear night and as they talked together before addressing themselves to sleep the champion of christendom looking up at the firmament said that is a fine piece of workmanship that starry spectacle god made it allthat moon of silver and those stars of gold and the light of day and the sunall for the sake of human kind  you wish i see to talk of matters of faith said the tartar now i may as well tell you at once that i have no sort of skill in such matters nor learning of any kind i never could learn anything when i was a boy i hated it so that i broke the mans head who was commissioned to teach me and it produced such an effect on others that nobody ever afterwards dared so much as shew me a book my boyhood was therefore passed as it should be in horsemanship and hunting and learning to fight what is the good of a gentlemans poring all day over a book prowess to the knight and prattle to the clergyman that is my motto  i acknowledge returned orlando that arms are the first consideration of a gentleman but not at all that he does himself dishonour by knowledge on the contrary knowledge is as great an embellishment of the rest of his attainments as the flowers are to the meadow before us and as to the knowledge of his maker the man that is without it is no better than a stock or a stone or a brute beast neither without study can he reach anything like a due sense of the depth and divineness of the contemplation  learned or not learned said agrican you might skew yourself better bred than by endeavouring to make me talk on a subject on which you have me at a disadvantage i have frankly told you what sort of person i am and i dare say that you for your part are very learned and wise you will therefore permit me if you say anything more of such things to make you no answer if you choose to sleep i wish you good night but if you prefer talking i recommend you to talk of fighting or of fair ladies and by the way pray tell meare you or are you not may i ask that orlando who makes such a noise in the world and what is it pray brings you into these parts were you ever in love i suppose you must have been for to be a knight and never to have been in love would be like being a man with no heart in his breast  the county replied orlando i am and in love i am2 love has made me abandon every thing and brought me into these distant regions and to tell you all in one word my heart is in the hands of the daughter of king galafron you have come against him with fire and sword to get possession of his castles and his dominions and i have come to help him for no object in the world but to please his daughter and win her beautiful hand i care for nothing else in existence  now when the tartar king agrican heard his antagonist speak in this manner and knew him to be indeed orlando and to be in love with angelica his face changed colour for grief and jealousy though it could not be seen for the darkness his heart began beating with such violence that he felt as if he should have died well said he to orlando we are to fight when it is daylight and one or the other is to be left here dead on the ground i have a proposal to make to you nay an entreaty my love is so excessive for the same lady that i beg you to leave her to me i will owe you my thanks and give up the fight myself i cannot bear that any one else should love her and i live to see it why therefore should either of us perish give her up not a soul shall know it3  i never yet answered orlando made a promise which i did not keep and nevertheless i own to you that were i to make a promise like that and even swear to keep it i should not you might as well ask me to tear away the limbs from my body and the eyes out of my head i could as soon live without breath itself as cease loving angelica  agrican bad scarcely patience enough to let the speaker finish ere he leaped furiously on horseback though it was midnight quit her said he or die  orlando seeing the infidel getting up and not being sure that he would not add treachery to fierceness had been hardly less quick in mounting for the combat never exclaimed he i never could have quitted her if i would and now i wouldnt if i could you must seek her by other means than these  fiercely dashed their horses together in the nighttime on the green mead despiteful and terrible were the blows they gave and took by the moonlight there was no need of their looking out for one another nighttime though it was their business was to take as sharp heed of every movement as if it had been noonday4  agrican fought in a rage orlando was cooler and now the struggle had lasted more than five hours and dawn began to be visible when the tartar king furious to find so much trouble given him dealt his enemy a blow sharp and violent beyond conception it cut the shield in two as if it had been a cheesecake and though blood could not be drawn from orlando because he was fated it shook and bruised him as if it had started every joint in his body  his body only however not a particle of his soul so dreadful was the blow which the paladin gave in return that not only shield but every bit of mail on the body of agrican was broken in pieces and three of his left ribs cut asunder  the tartar roaring like a lion raised his sword with still greater vehemence than before and dealt a blow on the paladins helmet such as he had never yet received from mortal man for a moment it took away his senses his sight failed his ears tinkled his frightened horse turned about to fly and he was falling from the saddle when the very action of falling jerked his head upwards and with the jerk he regained his recollection  o my god thought he what a shame is this how shall i ever again dare to face angelica i have been fighting hour after hour with this man and he is but one and i call myself orlando if the combat last any longer i will bury myself in a monastery and never look on sword again  orlando muttered with his lips closed and his teeth ground together and you might have thought that fire instead of breath came out of his nose and mouth he raised his sword durindana with both his hands and sent it down so tremendously on agricans left shoulder that it cut through breastplate and bellypiece down to the very haunch nay crushed the saddlebow though it was made of bone and iron and felled man and horse to the earth from shoulder to hip was agrican cut through his weary soul and he turned as white as ashes and felt death upon him he called orlando to come close to him with a gentle voice and said as well as he could i believe in him who died on the cross baptise me i pray thee with the fountain before my senses are gone i have lived an evil life but need not be rebellious to god in death also may he who came to save all the rest of the world save me he is a god of great mercy  and he shed tears did that king though he had been so lofty and fierce  orlando dismounted quickly with his own face in tears he gathered the king tenderly in his arms and took and laid him by the fountain on a marble cirque which it had and then he wept in concert with him heartily and asked his pardon and so baptised him in the water of the fountain and knelt and prayed to god for him with joined hands  he then paused and looked at him and when he perceived his countenance changed and that his whole person was cold he left him there on the marble cirque by the fountain all armed as he was with the sword by his side and the crown upon his head                                       i think i may anticipate the warm admiration of the reader for the whole of this beautiful episode particularly its close i think says panizzi that tasso had this passage particularly in view when he wrote the duel of clorinda and tancredi and her conversion and baptism before dying the whole passage from stanza xii where agrican receives his mortal blow to this is beautiful and the delicate proceeding of orlando in leaving agricans body armed even with the sword in his hand is in the noblest spirit of chivalryedition of boiardo and ariosto vol

introduced the touching words would i were not so così non fossio  footnote 3 this proposal is in the highest ingenuous spirit of the absurd wilfulness of passion thinking that every thing is to give way before it not excepting the same identical wishes in other people  footnote 4 very fine all this i think   the saracen friends  a fairy lovetale  argument  prasildo a nobleman of babylon to his great anguish falls in love with his friends wife tisbina and being overheard by her and her husband threatening to kill himself the lady hoping to divert him from his passion by time and absence promises to return it on condition of his performing a distant and perilous adventure he performs the adventure and the husband and wife supposing that there is no other way of her escaping the consequences resolve to take poison after which the lady goes to prasildos house and informs him of their having done so prasildo resolves to die with them but hearing in the mean time that the apothecary had given them a drink that was harmless he goes and tells them of their good fortune upon which the husband is so struck with his generosity that he voluntarily quits babylon for life and the lady marries the lover the new husband subsequently hears that his friends life is in danger and quits the wife to go and deliver him from it at the risk of his own which he does  this story which has resemblances to it in boccaccio and chaucer is told to rinaldo while riding through a wood in asia with a damsel behind him on the same horse he has engaged to combat in her behalf with a band of knights and the lady relates it to beguile the way  the reader is to bear in mind that the age of chivalry took delight in mooting points of love and friendship such as in aftertimes would have been out of the question and that the parties in this story are mahometans with whom divorce was an easy thing and caused no scandal  the saracen friends  iroldo a knight of babylon had to wife a lady of the name of tisbina whom he loved with a passion equal to that of tristan for iseult1 and she returned his love with such fondness that her thoughts were occupied with him from morning till night among other pleasant circumstances of their position they had a neighbour who was accounted the greatest nobleman in the city and he deserved his credit for he spent his great riches in doing nothing but honour to his rank he was pleasant in company formidable in battle full of grace in love an openhearted accomplished gentleman  this personage whose name was prasildo happened to be of a party one day with tisbina who were amusing themselves in a garden with a game in which the players knelt down with their faces bent on one anothers laps and guessed who it was that struck them the turn came to himself and he knelt down to the lap of tisbina but no sooner was he there than he experienced feelings he had never dreamt of and instead of trying to guess correctly took all the pains he could to remain in the same position  these feelings pursued him all the rest of the day and still more closely at night he did nothing but think and sigh and find the soft feathers harder than any stone nor did he get better as time advanced his once favourite pastime of hunting now ceased to afford him any delight nothing pleased him but to be giving dinners and balls to make verses and sing them to his lute and to joust and tournay in the eyes of his love dressed in the most sumptuous apparel but above all gentle and graceful as he had been before he now became still more gentle and gracefulfor good qualities are always increased when a man is in love never in my life did i know them turn to ill in that case so in prasildos you may guess what a superexcellent person he became  the passion which had thus taken possession of this gentleman was not lost upon the lady for want of her knowing it a mutual acquaintance was always talking to her on the subject but to no purpose she never relaxed her pride and dignity for a moment the lover at last fell ill he fairly wasted away and was so unhappy that he gave up all his feastings and entertainments the only pleasure he took was in a solitary wood in which he used to plunge himself in order to give way to his grief and lamentations  it happened one day early in the morning while he was thus occupied that iroldo came into the wood to amuse himself with birdcatching he had tisbina with him and as they were coming along they overheard their neighbour during one of his paroxysms and stopped to listen to what he said  hear me exclaimed he ye flowers and ye woods hear to what a pass of wretchedness i am come since that cruel one will hear me not hear o sun that hast taken away the night from the heavens and you ye stars and thou the departing moon hear the voice of my grief for the last time for exist i can no longer my death is the only way left me to gratify that proud beauty to whom it has pleased heaven to give a cruel heart with a merciful countenance fain would i have died in her presence it would have comforted me to see her pleased even with that proof of my love but i pray nevertheless that she may never know it since cruel as she is she might blame herself for having shewn a scorn so extreme and i love her so i would not have her pained for all her cruelty surely i shall love her even in my grave  with these words turning pale with his own mortal resolution prasildo drew his sword and pronouncing the name of tisbina more than once with a loving voice as though its very sound would be sufficient to waft him to paradise was about to plunge the steel into his bosom when the lady herself by leave of her husband whose manly visage was all in tears for pity stood suddenly before him  prasildo said she if you love me listen to me you have often told me that you do so now prove it i happen to be threatened with nothing less than the loss of life and honour nothing short of such a calamity could have induced me to beg of you the service i am going to request since there is no greater shame in the world than to ask favours from those to whom we have refused them but i now promise you that if you do what i desire your love shall be returned i give you my word for it i give you my honour on the other side of the wilds of barbary is a garden which has a wall of iron it has four gates life itself keeps one death another poverty the third the fairy of riches the fourth he who goes in at one gate must go out at the other opposite and in the midst of the garden is a tree tall as the reach of an arrow which produces pearls for blossoms it is called the tree of wealth and has fruit of emeralds and boughs of gold i must have a bough of that tree or suffer the most painful consequences now then if you love me i say prove it prove it and most assuredly i shall love you in turn better than ever you loved myself  what need of saying that prasildo with haste and joy undertook to do all that she required if she had asked the sun and stars and the whole universe he would have promised them quitting her in spite of his love he set out on the journey without delay only dressing himself before he left the city in the habit of a pilgrim  now you must know that iroldo and his lady had set prasildo on that adventure in the hope that the great distance which he would have to travel and the change which it might assist time to produce would deliver him from his passion at all events in case this good end was not effected before he arrived at the garden they counted to a certainty on his getting rid of it when he did because the fairy of that garden which was called the garden of medusa was of such a nature that whosoever did but look on her countenance forgot the reason for his going thither and whoever saluted touched and sat down to converse by her side forgot all that had ever occurred in his lifetime  away however on his steed went our bold lover all alone or rather with love for his companion and so riding hard till he came to the red sea he took ship and journeyed through egypt and came to the mountains of barca where he overtook an old greyheaded palmer  prasildo told the palmer the reason of his coming and the palmer told him what the reader has heard about the garden adding that he must enter by the gate of poverty and take no arms or armour with him excepting a lookingglass for a shield in which the fairy might behold her beauty the old man gave him other directions necessary for his passing out of the gate of riches and prasildo thanking him went on and in thirty days found himself entering the garden with the greatest ease by the gate of poverty  the garden looked like a paradise it was so full of beautiful trees and flowers and fresh grass prasildo took care to hold the shield over his eyes that he might avoid seeing the fairy medusa and in this manner guarding his approach he arrived at the golden tree the fairy who was reclining against the trunk of it looked up and saw herself in the glass wonderful was the effect on her instead of her own whiteandred blooming face she beheld that of a dreadful serpent the spectacle made her take to flight in terror and the lover finding his object so far gained looked freely at the tree and climbed it and bore away a bough2  with this he proceeded to the gate of riches it was all of loadstone and opened with a great noise but he passed through it happily for he made the fairy who kept it a present of half the bough and so he issued forth out of the garden with indescribable joy  behold our loving adventurer now on his road home every step of the way appeared to him a thousand he took the road of nubia to shorten the journey crossed the arabian gulf with a breeze in his favour and travelling by night as well as by day arrived one fine morning in babylon  no sooner was he there than he sent to tell the object of his passion how fortunate he had been he begged her to name her own place and time for receiving the bough at his hands taking care to remind her of her promise and he could not help adding that he should die if she broke it  terrible was the grief of tisbina at this unlookedfor news she threw herself on her couch in despair and bewailed the hour she was born what on earth am i to do cried the wretched lady death itself is no remedy for a case like this since it is only another mode of breaking my word to think that prasildo should return from the garden of medusa who could have supposed it possible and yet in truth what a fool i was to suppose any thing impossible to love o my husband little didst thou think what thou thyself advisedst me to promise  the husband was coming that moment towards the room and overhearing his wife grieving in this distracted manner he entered and clasped her in his arms on learning the cause of her affliction he felt as though he should have died with her on the spot  alas cried he that it should be possible for me to be miserable while i am so dear to your heart but you know o my soul that when love and jealousy come together the torment is the greatest in the world myselfmyself alas caused the mischief and myself alone ought to suffer for it you must keep your promise you must abide by the word you have given especially to one who has undergone so much to perform what you asked him sweet face you must but oh see him not till after i am dead let fortune do with me what she pleases so that i be saved from a disgrace like that it will be a comfort to me in death to think that i alone while i was on earth enjoyed the fond looking of that lovely face nay concluded the wretched husband i feel as though i should die over again if i could call to mind in my grave how you were taken from me  iroldo became dumb for anguish it seemed to him as if his very heart had been taken out of his breast nor was tisbina less miserable she was as pale as death and could hardly speak to him or bear to look at him at length turning her eyes upon him she said and do you believe i could make my poor sorry case out in this world without iroldo can he bear himself to think of leaving his tisbina he who has so often said that if he possessed heaven itself he should not think it heaven without her o dearest husband there is a way to make death not bitter to either of us it is to die together i must only exist long enough to see prasildo death alas is in that thought but the same death will release us it need not even be a hard death saving our misery there are poisons so gentle in their deadliness that we need but faint away into sleep and so in the course of a few hours be delivered our misery and our folly will then alike be ended  iroldo assenting clasped his wife in distraction and for a long time they remained in the same posture half stifled with grief and bathing one anothers cheeks with their tears afterwards they sent quietly for the poison and the apothecary made up a preparation in a cup without asking any questions and so the husband and wife took it iroldo drank first and then endeavoured to give the cup to his wife uttering not a word and trembling in every limb not because he was afraid of death but because he could not bear to ask her to share it at length turning away his face and looking down he held the cup towards her and she took it with a chilled heart and trembling hand and drank the remainder to the dregs iroldo then covered his face and head not daring to see her depart for the house of prasildo and tisbina with pangs bitterer than death left him in solitude  tisbina accompanied by a servant went to prasildo who could scarcely believe his ears when he heard that she was at the door requesting to speak with him he hastened down to shew her all honour leading her from the door into a room by themselves and when he found her in tears addressed her in the most considerate and subdued yet still not unhappy manner taking her confusion for bashfulness and never dreaming what a tragedy had been meditated  finding at length that her grief was not to be done away he conjured her by what she held dearest on earth to let him know the cause of it adding that he could still die for her sake if his death would do her any service tisbina spoke at these words and prasildo then heard what he did not wish to hear i am in your hands answered she while i am yet alive i am bound to my word but i cannot survive the dishonour which it costs me nor above all the loss of the husband of my heart you also to whose eyes i have been so welcome must be prepared for my disappearance from the earth had my affections not belonged to another ungentle would have been my heart not to have loved yourself who are so capable of loving but as you must well know to love two at once is neither fitting nor in ones power it was for that reason i never loved you baron i was only touched with compassion for you and hence the miseries of us all before this day closes i shall have learnt the taste of death and without further preface she disclosed to him how she and her husband had taken poison  prasildo was struck dumb with horror he had thought his felicity at hand and was at the same instant to behold it gone for ever she who was rooted in his heart she who carried his life in her sweet looks even she was sitting there before him already so to speak dead  it has pleased neither heaven nor you tisbina exclaimed the unhappy young man to put my best feelings to the proof often have two lovers perished for love the world will now behold a sacrifice of three oh why did you not make a request to me in your turn and ask me to free you from your promise you say you took pity on me alas cruel one confess that you have killed yourself in order to kill me yet why never did i think of giving you displeasure and i now do what i would have done at any time to prevent it i absolve you from your oath stay or go this instant as it seems best to you  a stronger feeling than compassion moved the heart of tisbina at these words this indeed replied she i feel to be noble and truly could i also now die to save you but life is flitting and how may i prove my regard  prasildo who had in good earnest resolved that three instead of two should perish experienced such anguish at the extraordinary position in which he found all three that even her sweet words came but dimly to his ears he stood like a man stupified then begged of her to give him but one kiss and so took his leave without further ado only intimating that her way out of the house lay before her as he spake he removed himself from her sight  tisbina reached home she found her husband with his head covered up as she left him but when she recounted what had passed and the courtesy of prasildo and how he had exacted from her but a single kiss iroldo got up and removed the covering from his face and then clasping his hands and raising it to heaven he knelt with grateful humility and prayed god to give pardon to himself and reward to his neighbour but before he had ended tisbina sunk on the floor in a swoon her weaker frame was the first to undergo the effects of what she had taken iroldo felt icy chill to see her albeit she seemed to sleep sweetly her aspect was not at all like death he taxed heaven with cruelty for treating two loving hearts so hardly and cried out against fortune and life and love itself  nor was prasildo happier in his chamber he also exclaimed against the bitter tyrant whom men call love and protested that he would gladly encounter any fate to be delivered from the worse evils of his false and cruel ascendency  but his lamentations were interrupted the apothecary who sold the potion to the husband and wife was at the door below requesting to speak with him the servants at first had refused to carry the message but the old man persisting and saying it was a matter of life and death entrance for him into his masters chamber was obtained noble sir said the apothecary i have always held you in love and reverence i have unfortunately reason to fear that somebody is desiring your death this morning a handmaiden of the lady tisbina applied to me for a secret poison and just now it was told me that the lady herself had been at this house i am old sir and you are young and i warn you against the violence and jealousies of womankind talk of their flames of love satan himself burn them say i for they are fit for nothing better do not be too much alarmed however this time for in truth i gave the young woman nothing of the sort that she asked for but only a draught so innocent that if you have taken it it will cost you but four or five hours sleep so in gods name give up the whole foolish sex for you may depend on it that in this city of ours there are ninetynine wicked ones among them to one good  you may guess how prasildos heart revived at these words truly might he be compared to flowers in sunshine after rain he rejoiced through all his being and displayed again a cheerful countenance hastily thanking the old man he lost no time in repairing to the house of his neighbours and telling them of their safety and you may guess how the like joy was theirs but behold a wonder iroldo was so struck with the generosity of his neighbours conduct throughout the whole of this extraordinary affair that nothing would content his grateful though evergrieving heart but he must fairly give up tisbina after all prasildo to do him justice resisted the proposition as stoutly as he could but a mans powers are ill seconded by an unwilling heart and though the contest was long and handsome as is customary between generous natures the husband adhered firmly to his intention in short he abruptly quitted the city declaring that he would never again see it and so left his wife to the lover and i must add concluded the fair lady who was telling the story to rinaldo that although tisbina took his departure greatly to heart and sometimes felt as if she should die at the thoughts of it yet since he persisted in staying away and there appeared no chance of his ever doing otherwise she did as in that case we should all do we at least that are young and kind and took the handsome prasildo for second spouse3  part the second  the conclusion of this part of the history of iroldo and prasildo was scarcely out of the ladys mouth when a tremendous voice was heard among the trees and rinaldo found himself confronting a giant of a frightful aspect who with a griffin on each side of him was guarding a cavern that contained the enchanted horse which had belonged to the brother of angelica a combat ensued and after winning the horse and subsequently losing the company of the lady the paladin in the course of his adventures came upon a knight who lay lamenting in a green place by a fountain the knight heeding nothing but his grief did not perceive the new comer who for some time remained looking at him in silence till desirous to know the cause of his sorrow he dismounted from his horse and courteously begged to be informed of it the stranger in his turn looked a little while in silence at rinaldo and then told him he had resolved to die in order to be rid of a life of misery and yet he added it was not his own lot which grieved him so much as that of a noble friend who would die at the same time and who had nobody to help him  the knight who was no other than tisbinas husband iroldo then briefly related the events which the reader has heard and proceeded to state how he lead traversed the world ever since for two years when it was his misfortune to arrive in the territories of the enchantress falerina whose custom it was to detain foreigners in prison and daily give a couple of them a lady and a cavalier for food to a serpent which kept the entrance of her enchanted garden to this serpent he himself was destined to be sacrificed when prasildo the possessor of his wife tisbina hearing of his peril set out instantly from babylon and rode night and day till he came to the abode of the enchantress determined that nothing should hinder him from doing his utmost to save the life of a friend so generous save it he did and that by a generosity no less devoted for having attempted in vain to bribe the keeper of the prison he succeeded in prevailing on the man to let him substitute himself for his friend and he was that very day perhaps that very moment preparing for the dreadful death to which he would speedily be brought  i will not survive such a friend concluded iroldo i know i shall contend with his warders to no purpose but let the wretches come if they will by thousands i shall fight them to the last gasp one comfort in death one joy i shall at all events experience i shall be with prasildo in the other world and yet when i think what sort of death he must endure even the release from my own miseries afflicts me since it will not prevent him from undergoing that horror  the paladin shed tears to hear of a case so piteous and affectionate and in a tone of encouragement offered his services towards the rescue of his friend iroldo looked at him in astonishment but sighed and said ah sir i thank you with all my heart and you are doubtless a most noble cavalier to be so fearless and goodhearted but what right have i to bring you to destruction for no reason and to no purpose there is not a man on earth but orlando himself or his cousin rinaldo who could possibly do us any good and so i beg you to accept my thanks and depart in safety and may god reward you  it is true replied the paladin i am not orlando and yet for all that i doubt not to be able to effect what i propose nor do i offer my assistance out of desire of glory or of thanks or return of any kind except indeed that if two such unparalleled friends could admit me to be a third i should hold myself a happy man what you have given up the woman of your heart and deprived yourself of all joy and comfort and your friend on the other hand has become a prisoner and devoted to death for your sake and can i be expected to leave two such friends in a jeopardy so monstrous and not do all in my power to save them i would rather die first myself and on your own principle i mean in order to go with you into a better world  while they were talking in this manner a great illlooking rabble upwards of a thousand strong made their appearance carrying a banner and bringing forth two prisoners to die the wretches were armed after their disorderly fashion and the prisoners each tied upon a horse one of these hapless persons too surely was prasildo and the other turned out to be the damsel who had told rinaldo the story of the friends having been deprived of the paladins assistance her subsequent misadventures had brought her to this terrible pass the moment rinaldo beheld her he leaped on his horse and dashed among the villains the sight of such an onset was enough for their cowardly hearts the whole posse fled before him with precipitation all except the leader who was a villain of gigantic strength and him the paladin at one blow clove through the middle iroldo could not speak for joy as he hastened to release prasildo he was forced to give him tears instead of words but when speech at length became possible the two friends fervently and with a religious awe declared that their deliverer must have been divine and not human so tremendous was the deathblow he had given the ruffian and such winged and contemptuous slaughter he had dealt among the fugitives by the time he returned from the pursuit their astonishment had risen to such a pitch that they fell on their knees and worshipped him for the prophet of the saracens not believing such prowess possible to humanity and devoutly thanking him for the mercy he had shewn them in coming thus visibly from heaven rinaldo for the moment was not a little disturbed at this sally of enthusiasm but the singular good faith and simplicity of it restored him to himself and with a smile between lovingness and humility he begged them to lay aside all such fancies and know him for a man like themselves he then disclosed himself for the rinaldo of whom they had spoken and made such an impression on them with his piety and his attributing what had appeared a superhuman valour to nothing but his belief in the christian religion that the transported friends became converts on the spot and accompanied him thenceforth as the most faithful of his knights                                       the story tells us nothing further of tisbina though there can be no doubt that boiardo meant to give us the conclusion of her share in it for the two knights take an active part in the adventures of their new friend rinaldo perhaps however the discontinuance of the poem itself was lucky for the author as far as this episode was concerned for it is difficult to conceive in what manner he would have wound it up to the satisfaction of the reader   footnote 1 the hero and heroine of the famous romance of tristan de leonois  footnote 2 mr rose observes that medusa may be designed by boiardo as the type of conscience and he is confirmed in his opinion by the circumstance mentioned in this canto 12 lib i stan 39 of medusa not being able to contemplate the reflection of her own hideous appearance though beautiful in the sight of others i fully agree with himpanizzi ut sup vol iii p 333  footnote 3 tisbina says panizzi in a note on this passage very wisely acted like emilia in chaucer who when she saw she could not marry arcita because he was killed thought of marrying palemone rather than be a mayden all hire lyf it is to be observed that although she regretted very much what had happened and even fainted away she did not however stand on ceremonies as the poet says in the next stanza but yielded immediately and married prasildo this at first i thought to be a somewhat inconsistent but on consideration i found i was wrong tisbina was wrong because having lost iroldo she did not know what prasildo would do but so soon as the latter offered to fill up the place she nobly and magnanimously resigned herself to her fateut sup vol iii p 336  it might be thought inconsistent in tisbina notwithstanding mr panizzis pleasantry to be so willing to take another husband after having poisoned herself for the first but she seems intended by the poet to exhibit a character of impulse in contradistinction to permanency of sentiment she cannot help shewing pity for prasildo she cannot help poisoning herself for her husband and she cannot help taking his friend when she has lost him nor must it be forgotten that the husband was the first to break the tie we respect him more than we do her because he was capable of greater selfdenial but if he himself preferred his friend to his love we can hardly blame her custom apart for following the example   seeing and believing  argument  a lady has two suitors a young and an old one the latter of whom wins her against her inclinations by practising the artifice of hippomanes in his race with atalanta being very jealous he locks her up in a tower and the youth who continued to be her lover makes a subterraneous passage to it and pretending to have married her sister invites the old man to his house and introduces his own wife to him as the bride the husband deceived but still jealous facilitates their departure out of the country and returns to his tower to find himself deserted  this story like that of the saracen friends is told by a damsel to a knight while riding in his company with this difference that she is the heroine of it herself she is a damsel of a nature still lighter than the former and the readers sympathy with the trouble she brings on herself and the way she gets out of it will be modified accordingly on the other hand nobody can respect the foolish old man with his unwarrantable marriage and the moral of boiardos story is still useful for these enlightened times though conveyed with an air of levity  in addition to the classics the poet has been to the norman fablers for his story the subterranean passage has been more than once repeated in romance and the closing incident the assistance given by the husband to his wifes elopement has been imitated in the farce of lionel and clarissa  seeing and believing  my father said the damsel is king of the distant islands where the treasure of the earth is collected never was greater wealth known and i was heiress of it all  but it is impossible to foresee what is most to be desired for us in this world i was a kings daughter i was rich i was handsome i was lively and yet to all those advantages i owed my illfortune  among other suitors for my hand there came two on the same day one of whom was a youth named ordauro handsome from head to foot the other an old man of seventy whose name was folderico both were rich and of noble birth but the greybeard was counted extremely wise and of a foresight more than human as i did not feel in want of his foresight the youth was far more to my taste and accordingly i listened to him with perfect goodwill and gave the wise man no sort of encouragement i was not at liberty however to determine the matter my father had a voice in it so fearing what he would advise i thought to secure a good result by cunning and management it is an old observation that the craft of a woman exceeds all other craft indeed it is solomons own saying but nowadays people laugh at it and i found to my cost that the laugh is just i requested my father to proclaim first that nobody should have me in marriage who did not surpass me in swiftness for i was a damsel of a mighty agility and secondly that he who did surpass me should be my husband he consented and i thought my happiness secure you must know i have run down a bird and caught it with my own hand  well both my suitors came to the race the youth on a large warhorse trapped with gold which curvetted in a prodigious manner and seemed impatient for a gallop the old roan on a mule carrying a great bag at his side and looking already tired out they dismounted on the place chosen for the trial which was a meadow it was encircled by a world of spectators and the greybeard and myself for his age gave him the first chance only waited for the sound of the trumpet to set off  i held my competitor in such contempt that i let him get the start of me on purpose to make him ridiculous but i was not prepared for his pulling a golden apple out of his bag and throwing it as far as he could in a direction different from that of the goal the sight of a curiosity so tempting was too much for my prudence and it rolled away so roundly and to such a distance that i lost more time in reaching it than i looked for before i overtook the old gentleman he threw another apple and this again led me a chase after it in short i blush to say that resolved as i was to be tempted no further seeing that the end of our course was now at hand and my marriage with an old man instead of a young man was out of the question he seduced me to give chase to a third apple and fairly reached the goal before me i wept for rage and disgust and meditated every species of unconjugal treatment of the old fox what right had he to marry such a child as i was i asked myself the question at the time i asked it a thousand times afterwards and i must confess that the more i have tormented him the more the retaliation delights me  however it was of no use at the moment the old wretch bore me off to his domains with an ostentatious triumph and then his jealousy misgiving him he shut me up in a castle on a rock where he endeavoured from that day forth to keep me from the sight of living being you may judge what sort of castle it was by its namealtamura lofty wall it overlooked a desert on three sides and the sea on the fourth and a man might as well have flown as endeavoured to scale it there was but one path up to the entrance very steep and difficult and when you were there you must have pierced outwork after outwork and picked the lock of gate after gate so there sat i in this delicious retreat hopeless and bursting with rage i called upon death day and night as my only refuge i had no comfort but in seeing my keeper mad with jealousy even in that desolate spot i think he was jealous of the very flies  my handsome youth ordauro however had not forgotten me no nor even given me up luckily he was not only very clever but rich besides without which to be sure his brains would not have availed him a pin what does he do therefore but take a house in the neighbourhood on the seashore and while my tormentor in alarm and horror watches every movement and thinks him coming if he sees a cloud or a bird ordauro sets people secretly to work night and day and makes a subterraneous passage up to the very tower guess what i felt when i saw him enter assuredly i did not show him the face which i shewed folderico i die with joy this moment to think of my delight as soon as we could discourse of any thing but our meeting ordauro concerted measures for my escape and the greatest difficulty being surmounted by the subterraneous passage they at last succeeded but our enemy gave us a frightful degree of trouble  there was no end of the old mans pryings peepings and precautions he left me as little as possible by myself and he had all the coast thereabouts at his command together with the few boats that ever touched it  ordauro however did a thing at once the most bold and the most ingenious he gave out that he was married and inviting my husband to dinner who had heard the news with transport presented me to his astonished eyes for the bride the old man looked as if he would have died for rage and misery  horrible villain cried he what is this  ordauro professed astonishment in his turn  what asked he do you not know that the princess your ladys sister is wonderfully like her and that she has done me the honour of becoming my wife i invited you in order to do honour to yourself and so bring the good families together  detestable falsehood cried folderico do you think im blind or a born idiot but ill see to this business directly and terrible shall be my revenge  so saying he flung out and hastened as fast as age would let him to the room in the tower where he expected to find me not but there he did find methere was i sitting as if nothing had happened with my hand on my cheek and full of my old melancholy  god preserve me exclaimed he this is astonishing indeed never could i have dreamt that one sister could be so like another but is it so or is it not i have terrible suspicions it is impossible to believe it tell me truly he continued answer me on the faith of a daring woman and you shall get no hurt by it has any one opened the portals for you today who was it how did you get out tell me the truth and you shall not suffer for it but deceive me and there is no punishment that you may not look for  it is needless to say how i vowed and protested that i had never stirred that it was quite impossible that i could not have done it if i would c i took all the saints to witness to my veracity and swore i had never seen the outside of his tremendous castle  the monster had nothing to say to this but i saw what he meant to doi saw that he would return instantly to the house of ordauro and ascertain if the bride was there accordingly the moment he turned the key on me i flew down the subterraneous passage tossed on my new clothes like lightning and sat in my lovers house as before waiting the arrival of the panting old gentleman  well exclaimed he as soon as he set eyes upon me never in all my lifenoi must allow it to be impossiblenever can my wife at home be the lady sitting here  from that day forth the old man whenever he saw me in ordauros house treated me as if i were indeed his sisterinlaw though he never had the heart to bring the two wives together for fear of old recollections nevertheless this state of things was still very perilous and my new husband and myself lost no time in considering how we should put an end to it by leaving the country ordauro resorted as before to a bold expedient he told folderico that the air of the seacoast disagreed with him and the old man whose delight at getting rid of his neighbour helped to blind him to the deceit not only expedited the movement but offered to see him part of the way on his journey  the offer was accepted six miles he rode forth with us the stupid old man and then taking his leave to return home we pushed our horses like lightning and so left him to tear his hair and his old beard with cries and curses as soon as he opened the door of his tower    ariosto  critical notice of his life and genius  critical notice  of  ariostos life and genius1  the congenial spirits of pulci and boiardo may be said to have attained to their height in the person of ariosto upon the principle of a transmigration of souls or after the fashion of that hero in romance who was heir to the bodily strengths of all whom he conquered  lodovico giovanni ariosto was born on the 8th of september 1474 in the fortress at reggio in lombardy and was the son of niccolò ariosto captain of that citadel as boiardo had been and daria maleguzzi whose family still exists the race was transplanted from bologna in the century previous when obizzo the third of este marquess of ferrara married a lady belonging to it whose christian name was lippa niccolò ariosto besides holding the same office as boiardo had done at modena as well as at reggio was master of the household to his two successive patrons the dukes borso and ercole he was also employed like him in diplomacy and was made a count by the emperor frederick the third though not it seems with remainder to his heirs  lodovico was the eldest of ten children five sons and five daughters during his boyhood theatrical entertainments were in great vogue at court as we have seen in the life of boiardo and at the age of twelve a year after the decease of that poet who must have been well known to him and probably encouraged his attempts his successor is understood to have dramatised after his infant fashion the story of pyramus and thisbe and to have got his brothers and sisters to perform it panizzi doubts the possibility of these precocious private theatricals but considering what is called writing on the part of children and that only one other performer was required in the piece or at best a third for the lion which some little brother might have roared like any suckingdove i cannot see good reason for disbelieving the story pope was not twelve years old when he turned the siege of troy into a play and got his schoolfellows to perform it the part of ajax being given to the gardener man is a theatrical animal greek zoon mimaetikon and the instinct is developed at a very early period as almost every family can witness that has taken its children to the playhouse  at fifteen the young poet like so many others of his class was consigned to the study of the law and took a great dislike to it the extreme mobility of his nature and the wish to please his father appear to have made him enter on it willingly enough in the first instance2 but as soon as he betrayed symptoms of disgust niccolò whose affairs were in a bad way drove him back to it with a vehemence which must have made bad worse3 at the expiration of five years he was allowed to give it up  there is reason to believe that ariosto was theatricalising during no little portion of this time for in his nineteenth year he is understood to have been taken by duke ercole to pavia and to milan either as a writer or performer of comedies probably both since the courtiers and ducal family themselves occasionally appeared on the stage and one of the poets brothers mentions his having frequently seen him dressed in character4  on being delivered from the study of the law the young poet appears to have led a cheerful and unrestrained life for the next four or five years  he wrote or began to write the comedy of the cassaria probably meditated some poem in the style of boiardo then in the height of his fame and he cultivated the latin language and intended to learn greek but delayed and unfortunately missed it in consequence of losing his tutor some of his happiest days were passed at a villa still possessed by the maleguzzi family called la mauriziana two miles from reggio twentyfive years afterwards he called to mind with sighs the pleasant spots there which used to invite him to write verses the garden the little river the mill the trees by the waterside and all the other shady places in which he enjoyed himself during that sweet season of his life betwixt april and may5 to complete his happiness he had a friend and cousin pandolfo ariosto who loved every thing that he loved and for whom he augured a brilliant reputation  but a dismal cloud was approaching in his twentyfirst year he lost his father and found a large family left on his hands in narrow circumstances the charge was at first so heavy especially when aggravated by the death of pandolfo that he tells us he wished to die he took to it manfully however in spite of these fits of gloom and he lived to see his admirable efforts rewarded his brothers enabled to seek their fortunes and his sisters properly taken care of two of them it seems had become nuns a third married and a fourth remained long in his house it is not known what became of the fifth  in these familymatters the anxious son and brother was occupied for three or four years not however without recreating himself with his verses latin and italian and recording his admiration of a number of goddesses of his youth he mentions in particular one of the name of lydia who kept him often from his dear mother and household and who is probably represented by the princess of the same name in the orlando punished in the smoke of tartarus for being a jilt and coquette6 his friend bembo afterwards the celebrated cardinal recommended him to be blind to such little immaterial points as ladies infidelities but he is shocked at the advice he was far more of othellos opinion than congreves in such matters and declared that he would not have shared his mistress goodwill with jupiter himself7  towards the year 1504 the poet entered the service of the unworthy prince cardinal ippolito of este brother of the new duke of ferrara alfonso the first his eminence who had been made a prince of the church at thirteen years of age by the infamous alexander the sixth borgia was at this period little more than oneandtwenty but he took an active part in the dukes affairs both civil and military and is said to have made himself conspicuous in his fathers lifetime for his vices and brutality he is charged with having ordered a papal messenger to be severely beaten for bringing him some unpleasant despatches which so exasperated his unfortunate parent that he was exiled to mantua and the marquess of that city his brotherinlaw was obliged to come to ferrara to obtain his pardon but this was a trifle compared with what he is accused of having done to one of his brothers a female of their acquaintance in answer to a speech made her by the reverend gallant had been so unlucky as to say that she preferred his brother giulios eyes to his eminences whole body upon which the monstrous villain hired two ruffians to put out his brothers eyes some say was present at the attempt attempt only it fortunately turned out to be at least in part the opinion being that the sight of one of the eyes was preserved8  partyspirit has so much to do with stories of princes and princes are so little in a condition to notice them that on the principle of not condemning a man till he has been heard in his defence an honest biographer would be loath to credit these horrors of cardinal ippolito did not the violent nature of the times and the general character of the man even with his defenders incline him to do so his being a soldier rather than a churchman was a fault of the age perhaps a credit to the man for he appears to have had abilities for war and it was no crime of his if he was put into the church when a boy but his conduct to ariosto shewed him coarse and selfish and those who say all they can for him admit that he was proud and revengeful and that nobody regretted him when he died he is said to have had a taste for mathematics as his brother had for mechanics the truth seems to be that he and the duke who lived in troubled times and had to exert all their strength to hinder ferrara from becoming a prey to the court of rome were clever harsh men of no grace or elevation of character and with no taste but for war and if it had not been for their connexion with ariosto nobody would have heard of them except while perusing the annals of the time ippolito might have been and probably was the ruffian which the anecdote of his brother giulio represents him but the world would have heard little of the villany had he not treated a poet with contempt  the admirers of our author may wonder how he could become the servant of such a man much more how he could praise him as he did in the great work which he was soon to begin writing but ariosto was the son of a man who had passed his life in the service of the family he had probably been taught a loyal blindness to its defects gratuitous panegyrics of princes had been the fashion of men of letters since the time of augustus and the poet wanted help for his relatives and was of a nature to take the least show of favour for a virtue till he had learnt as he unfortunately did to be disappointed in the substance it is not known what his appointment was under the cardinal probably he was a kind of gentleman of all work an officer in his guards a companion to amuse and a confidential agent for the transaction of business the employment in which he is chiefly seen is that of an envoy but he is said also to have been in the field of battle and he intimates in his satires that household attentions were expected of him which he was not quick to offer such as pulling off his eminences boots and putting on his spurs9 it is certain that he was employed in very delicate negotiations sometimes to the risk of his life from the perils of roads and torrents ippolito who was a man of no delicacy probably made use of him on every occasion that required address the smallest as well as greatestan interview with a pope one day and a despatch to a dogfancier the next  his great poem however proceeded it was probably begun before he entered the cardinals service certainly was in progress during the early part of his engagement this appears from a letter written to ippolito by his sister the marchioness of mantua to whom he had sent ariosto at the beginning of the year 1509 to congratulate her on the birth of a child she gives her brother special thanks for sending his message to her by messer ludovico ariosto who had made her she says pass two delightful days with giving her an account of the poem he was writing10 isabella was the name of this princess and the grateful poet did not forget to embalm it in his verse11  ariostos latest biographer panizzi thinks he never served under any other leader than the cardinal but i cannot help being of opinion with a former one whom he quotes that he once took arms under a captain of the name of pio probably a kinsman of his friend alberto pio to whom he addresses a latin poem it was probably on occasion of some early disgust with the cardinal but i am at a loss to discover at what period of time perhaps indeed he had the cardinals permission both to quit his service and return to it possibly he was not to quit it at all except according to events but merely had leave given him to join a party in arms who were furthering ippolitos own objects italy was full of captains in arms and conflicting interests the poet might even at some period of his life have headed a troop under another cardinal his friend giovanni de medici afterwards leo the tenth he had certainly been with him in various parts of italy and might have taken part in some of his bloodless if not his most military equitations  be this as it may it is understood that ariosto was present at the repulse given to the venetians by ippolito when they came up the river po against ferrara towards the close of the year 1509 though he was away from the scene of action at his subsequent capture of their flotilla the poet having been despatched between the two events to pope julius the second on the delicate business of at once appeasing his anger with the duke for resisting his allies and requesting his help to a feudatary of the church julius was in one of his towering passions at first but gave way before the address of the envoy and did what he desired but ariostos success in this mission was nearly being the death of him in another for alfonso having accompanied the french the year following in their attack on vicenza where they committed cruelties of the same horrible kind as have shocked europe within a few months past12 the poets tongue it was thought might be equally efficacious a second time but julius worn out of patience with his too independent vassal who maintained an alliance with the french when the pope had ceased to desire it was to be appeased no longer he excommunicated alfonso and threatened to pitch his envoy into the tiber so that the poet was fain to run for it as the duke himself was afterwards when he visited rome to be absolved would julius have thus treated ariosto could he have foreseen his renown probably he would the greater the opposition to the will the greater the will itself to chuck an accomplished envoy into the river would have been much but to chuck the immortal poet there laurels and all in the teeth of the amazement of posterity would have been a temptation irresistible  it was on this occasion that ariosto probably from inability to choose his times or anodes of returning home contracted a cough which is understood to have shortened his existence so that julius may have killed him after all but the pope had a worse enemy in his own bosomhis violencewhich killed himself in a much shorter period he died in little more than two years afterwards and the poets prospects were all now of a very different sortat least he thought so for in march 1513 his friend giovanni de medici succeeded to the papacy under the title of leo the tenth  ariosto hastened to rome among a shoal of visitants to congratulate the new pope perhaps not without a commission from alfonso to see what he could do for his native country on which the rival medici family never ceased to have designs the poet was full of hope for he had known leo under various fortunes had been styled by him not only a friend but a brother and promised all sorts of participations of his prosperity not one of them came the visitor was cordially received leo stooped from his throne squeezed his hand and kissed him on both his cheeks but at night says ariosto i went all the way to the sheep to get my supper wet through all that leo gave him was a bull probably the one securing to him the profits of his orlando and the poets friend bibbienawit cardinal and kinsman of bernifacilitated the bull but the receiver discharged the fees he did not get one penny by promise pope or friend13 he complains a little but all in good humour and goodnaturedly asks what he was to expect when so many hungry kinsmen and partisans were to be served first well and wisely asked too and with a superiority to his fortunes which leo and bibbiena might have envied  it is thought probable however that if the poet had been less a friend to the house of este leo would have kept his word with him for their intimacy had undoubtedly been of the most cordial description but it is supposed that leo was afraid he should have a ferrarese envoy constantly about him had he detained ariosto in rome the poet however it is admitted was not a good hunter of preferment he could not play the assenter and bow and importune and sovereigns however friendly they may have been before their elevation go the way of most princely flesh when they have attained it they like to take out a mans gratitude beforehand perhaps because they feel little security in it afterwards  the elevation to the papacy of the cheerful and indulgent son of lorenzo de medici after the troublous reign of julius was hailed with delight by all christendom and nowhere more so than in the popes native place florence ariosto went there to see the spectacles and there in the midst of them he found himself robbed of his heart by the lady whom he afterwards married her name was alessandra benucci she was the widow of one of the strozzi family whom he had known in ferrara and he had long admired her the poet who like petrarch and boccaccio has recorded the day on which he fell in love which was that of st john the baptist the showy saintdays of the south offer special temptations to that effect dwells with minute fondness on the particulars of the ladys appearance her dress was black silk embroidered with two grapebearing vines intertwisted and between her serene forehead and the path that went dividing in two her rich and golden tresses was a sprig of laurel in bud her observer probably her welcome if not yet accepted lover beheld something very significant in this attire and a mysterious poem in which he records a device of a black pen feathered with gold which he wore embroidered on a gown of his own has been supposed to allude to it as every body is tempted to make his guess on such occasions i take the pen to have been the blackhaired poet himself and the golden feather the tresses of the lady beautiful as he describes her with a face full of sweetness and manners noble and engaging he speaks most of the charms of her golden locks the black gown could hardly have implied her widowhood the allusion would not have been delicate the vine belongs to dramatic poets among whom the lover was at that time to be classed the orlando not having appeared its duplification intimated another self and the crowning laurel was the success that awaited the heroic poet and the conqueror of the ladys heart14  the marriage was never acknowledged the husband was in the receipt of profits arising from churchoffices which put him into the condition of the fellow of a college with us who cannot marry so long as he retains his fellowship but it is proved to have taken place though the date of it is uncertain ariosto in a satire written three or four years after his falling in love says he never intends either to marry or to take orders because if he takes orders he cannot marry and if he marries he cannot take ordersthat is to say must give up his semipriestly emoluments this is one of the falsehoods which the roman catholic religion thinks itself warranted in tempting honest men to fall into thus perplexing their faith as to the very roots of all faith and tending to maintain a sensual hypocrisy which can do no good to the strongest minds and must terribly injure the weak  ariostos love for this lady i take to have been one of the causes of dissatisfaction between him and the cardinal fortunately for the poet as panizzi observes ippolito was not always in ferrara he travelled in italy and he had an archbishopric in hungary the tenure of which compelled occasional residence his company was not desired in rome so that he was seldom there ariosto however was an amusing companion and the cardinal seems not to have liked to go anywhere without him in the year 1515 he was attended by the poet part of the way on a journey to rome and urbino but ariosto fell ill and had leave to return he confesses that his illness was owing to an anxiety of love and he even makes an appeal to the cardinals experience of such feelings so that it might seem he was not afraid of ippolitos displeasure in that direction but the weakness which selfish people excuse in themselves becomes a very different thing as they phrase it in another the appeal to the cardinals experience might only have exasperated him in its assumption of the identity of the case however the poet was at all events left this time to the indulgence of his love and his poetry and in the course of the ensuing year a copy of the first edition of the orlando furioso in forty cantos was put into the hands of the illustrious person to whom it was dedicated  the words in which the cardinal was pleased to express himself on this occasion have become memorable where the devil master lodovick said the reverend personage have you picked up such a parcel of trumpery the original term is much stronger aggravating the insult with indecency there is no equivalent for it in english and i shall not repeat it in italian it is as low and indecent says panizzi as any in the language suffice it to say that although the age was not scrupulous in such matters it was one of the last words befitting the lips of the reverend catholic and that when ippolito of este as ginguéné observes made that speech to the great poet he utteredprince cardinal and mathematician as he wasan impertinence15  was the cardinal put out of temper by a device which appeared in this book on the leaf succeeding the titlepage was the privilege for its publication granted by leo in terms of the most flattering personal recognition16 so far so good unless the unpoetical este patron was not pleased to see such interest taken in the book by the tasteful medici patron but on the back of this leaf was a device of a hive with the bees burnt out of it for their honey and the motto evil for good pro bono malum most biographers are of opinion that this device was aimed at the cardinals ill return for all the sweet words lavished on him and his house if so and supposing ariosto to have presented the dedicationcopy in person it would have been curious to see the faces of the two men while his eminence was looking at it some will think that the goodnatured poet could hardly have taken such an occasion of displaying his resentment but the device did not express at whom it was aimed the cardinal need not have applied it to himself if he did not choose especially as the book was full of his praises and goodnatured people will not always miss an opportunity of covertly inflicting a sting the device at all events shewed that the honeymaker had got worse than nothing by his honey and the house of este could not say they had done any thing to contradict it  i think it probable that neither the poets device nor the cardinals speech were forgotten when in the course of the next year the parties came to a rupture in consequence of the servants refusing to attend his master into hungary ariosto excused himself on account of the state of his health and of his family he said that a cold climate did not agree with him that his chest was affected and could not bear even the stoves of hungary and that he could not in common decency and humanity leave his mother in her old age especially as all the rest of the family were away but his youngest sister whose interests he had also to take care of but ippolito was not to be appeased the public have seen in a late female biography a deplorable instance of the unfeelingness with which even a princess with a reputation for religion could treat the declining health and unwilling retirement of a poor slave in her service fifty times her superior in every thing but servility greater delicacy was not to be expected of the military priest the nobler the servant the greater the desire to trample upon him and keep him at a disadvantage it is a grudge which rank owes to genius and which it can only wave when its possessor is himself one of god almightys gentlemen i do not mean in point of genius which is by no means the highest thing in the world whatever its owners may think of it but in point of the highest of all things which is nobleness of heart i confess i think ariosto was wrong in expecting what he did of a man he must have known so well and in complaining so much of courts however goodhumouredly a prince occupies the station he does to avert the perils of disputed successions and not to be what his birth cannot make himif nature has not supplied the materials besides the cardinal in his quality of a mechanicalminded man with no taste might with reason have complained of his servants attending to poetry when it was not in his bond when it diverted him from the only attentions which his employer understood or desired ippolito candidly confessed as ariosto himself tells us that he not only did not care for poetry but never gave his attendant one stiver in patronage of it or for any thing whatsoever but going his journeys and doing as he was bidden17 on the other hand the cardinals payments were sorry ones and the poet might with justice have thought that he was not bound to consider them an equivalent for the time be was expected to give up the only thing to have been desired in this case was that he should have said so and in truth at the close of the explanation which he gave on the subject to his friends at court he didboldly desiring them as became him to tell the cardinal that if his eminence expected him to be a serf for what he received he should decline the bargain and that he preferred the humblest freedom and his studies to a slavery so preposterous18 the truth is the poet should have attached himself wholly to the medici had he not adhered to the duller house he might have led as happy a life with the pope as pulci did with the popes father perhaps have been made a cardinal like his friends bembo and sadolet but then we might have lost the orlando  the only sinecure which the poet is now supposed to have retained was a grant of twentyfive crowns every four months on the episcopal chancery of milan so to help out his petty income he proceeded to enter into the service of alfonso which shews that both the brothers were not angry with him he tells us that he would gladly have had no new master could he have helped it but that if he must needs serve he would rather serve the master of every body else than a subordinate one at this juncture he had a brief prospect of being as free as he wished for an uncle died leaving a large landed property still known as the ariosto lands le arioste but a convent demanded it on the part of one of their brotherhood who was a natural son of this gentleman and a more formidable and ultimately successful claim was advanced in a court of law by the chamber of the duchy of ferrara the first judge in the cause being the dukes own steward and a personal enemy of the poets ariosto therefore while the suit was going on was obliged to content himself with his fees from milan and a monthly allowance which he received from the duke of about thirtyeight shillings together with provisions for three servants and two horses he entered the dukes service in the spring of 1518 and remained in it for the rest of his life but it was not so burdensome as that of the cardinal and the consequence of the poets greater leisure was a second edition of the furioso in the year 1521 with additions and corrections still however in forty cantos only it appears by a deed of agreement19 that the work was printed at the authors expense that he was to sell the bookseller one hundred copies for sixty livres about 5l 12s on condition of the books not being sold at the rate of more than sixteen sous 1s 8d that the author was not to give sell or allow to be sold any copy of the book at ferrara except by the bookseller that the bookseller after disposing of the hundred copies was to have as many more as he chose on the same terms and that on his failing to require a further supply ariosto was to be at liberty to sell his volumes to whom he pleased with such profits observes panizzi it was not likely that the poet would soon become independent and it may be added that he certainly got nothing by the first edition whatever he may have done by the second he expressly tells us in the satire which he wrote on declining to go abroad with ippolito that all his poetry had not procured him money enough to purchase a cloak20 twenty years afterwards when he was dead the poem was in such request that between 1542 and 1551 panizzi calculates there must have been a sale of it in europe to the amount of a hundred thousand copies21  the second edition of the furioso did not extricate the author from very serious difficulties for the next year he was compelled to apply to either to relieve him from his necessities or permit him to look for some employment more profitable than the ducal service the answer of this prince who was now rich but had always been penurious and who never laid out a farthing if he could help it except in defence of his capital was an appointment of ariosto to the government of a district in a state of anarchy called garfagnana which had nominally returned to his rule in consequence of the death of leo who had wrested it from him it was a wild spot in the apennines on the borders of the ferrarese and papal territories ariosto was there three years and is said to have reduced it to order but according to his own account he had very doubtful work of it the place was overrun with banditti including the troops commissioned to suppress them it required a severer governor than he was inclined to be and alfonso did not attend to his requisitions for supplies the candid and goodnatured poet intimates that the duke might have given him the appointment rather for the governors sake than the peoples and the cold the loneliness and barrenness of the place and above all his absence from the object of his affections oppressed him he did not write a verse for twelve months he says he felt like a bird moulting22 the best thing got out of it was an anecdote for posterity the poet was riding out one day with a few attendantssome say walking out in a fit of absence of mindwhen he found himself in the midst of a band of outlaws who in a suspicious manner barely suffered him to pass a reader of mrs radcliffe might suppose them a band of condottieri under the command of some profligate desperado and such perhaps they were the governor had scarcely gone by when the leader of the band discovering who he was came riding back with much earnestness and making his obeisance to the poet said that he never should have allowed him to pass in that manner had he known him to be the signor ludovico ariosto author of the orlando furioso that his own name was filippo pacchione a celebrated personage of his order and that his men and himself so far from doing the signor displeasure would have the honour of conducting him back to his castle and so they did says baretti entertaining him all along the way with the various excellences they had discerned in his poem and bestowing upon it the most rapturous praises23  on his return from garfagnana ariosto is understood to have made several journeys in italy either with or without the duke his master some of them to mantua where it has been said that he was crowned with laurel by the emperor charles the fifth but the truth seems to be that he only received a laureate diploma it does not appear that charles made him any other gift his majesty and the whole house of este and the pope and all the other italian princes left that to be done by the imperial general the celebrated alfonso davallos marquess of vasto to whom he was sent on some mission by the duke of ferrara and who settled on him an annuity of a hundred golden ducats the only reward says panizzi which we find to have been conferred on ariosto expressly as a poet24 davallos was one of the conquerors of francis the first young and handsome and himself a writer of verses the grateful poet accordingly availed himself of his benefactors accomplishments to make him in turn a present of every virtue under the sun cæsar was not so liberal nestor so wise achilles so potent nireus so beautiful nor even ladas alexanders messenger so swift25 ariosto was now verging towards the grave and he probably saw in the hundred ducats a golden sunset of his cares  meantime however the poet had built a house which although small was raised with his own money so that the second edition of the orlando may have realised some profits at last he recorded the pleasant fact in an inscription over the door which has become celebrated    parva sed apta mihi sed nulli obnoxia sed non     sordida parta meo sed tamen acre domus   small yet it suits me is of no offence   was built not meanly at my own expense  what a pity to compare great things with small that he had not as long a life before him to enjoy it as gil blas had with his own comfortable quotation over his retreat at lirias26  the house still remains but the inscription unfortunately became effaced though the following one remains which was added by his son virginio                   sic domus hæc areostea   propitios habeat deos olim ut pindarica    dear to the gods whatever come to pass   be ariostos house as pindars was  this was an anticipationperhaps the originof miltons sonnet about his own house addressed to captains and collonels during the civil war27  davallos made the poet his generous present in the october of the year 1513 and in the same month of the year following the orlando was published as it now stands with various insertions throughout chiefly stories and six additional cantos cardinal ippolito had been dead some time and the device of the beehive was exchanged for one of two vipers with a hand and pair of shears cutting out their tongues and the motto thou hast preferred illwill to good dilexisti malitiam super benignitatem the allusion is understood to have been to certain critics whose names have all perished unless sperone of whom we shall hear more by and by was one of them the appearance of this edition was eagerly looked for but the trouble of correcting the press and the destruction of a theatre by fire which had been built under the poets direction did his health no good in its rapidly declining condition and after suffering greatly from an obstruction he died much attenuated on the sixth day of june 1533 his decease his fond biographers have told us took place about three in the afternoon and he was aged fiftyeight years eight months and twentyeight days his body according to his direction was taken to the church of the benedictines during the night by four men with only two tapers and in the most private and simple manner the monks followed it to the grave out of respect contrary to their usual custom  so lived and so died and so desired humbly to be buried one of the delights of the world  his son virginio had erected a chapel in the garden of the house built by his father and he wished to have his body removed thither but the monks would not allow it the tomb at first a very humble one was subsequently altered and enriched several times but remains i believe as rebuilt at the beginning of the century before last by his grandnephew ludovico ariosto with a bust of the poet and two statues representing poetry and glory  ariosto was tall and stout with a dark complexion bright black eyes black and curling hair aquiline nose and shoulders broad but a little stooping his aspect was thoughtful and his gestures deliberate titian besides painting his portrait designed that which appeared in the woodcut of the authors own third edition of his poem which has been copied into mr panizzis it has all the look of truth of that great artists vital hand but though there is an expression of the genial character of the mouth notwithstanding the exuberance of beard it does not suggest the sweetness observable in one of the medals of ariosto a wax impression of which is now before me nor has the nose so much delicacy and grace28  the poets temperament inclined him to melancholy but his intercourse was always cheerful one biographer says he was strong and healthyanother that he was neither in all probability he was naturally strong but weakened by a life full of emotion he talks of growing old at forty four and of leaving been bald for some time29 he had a cough for many years before he died his son says he cured it by drinking good old wine ariosto says that vin fumoso did not agree with him but that might only mean wine of a heady sort the chances under such circumstances were probably against wine of any kind and panizzi thinks the cough was never subdued his physicians forbade him all sorts of stimulants with his food30  his temper and habits were those of a man wholly given up to love and poetry in his youth he was volatile and at no time without what is called some affair of the heart every woman attracted him who had modesty and agreeableness and as at the same time he was very jealous one might imagine that his wife who had a right to be equally so would have led no easy life but it is evident he could practise very generous selfdenial and probably the married portion of his existence supposing alessandras sweet countenance not to have belied her was happy on both sides he was beloved by his family which is never the case with the unamiable among his friends were most of the great names of the age including a world of ladies and the whole graceful court of guidobaldo da montefeltro duke of urbino for which catiglione wrote his book of the gentleman il cortegiano raphael addressed him a sonnet and titian painted his likeness he knew vittoria colonna and veronica da gambera and giulia gonzaga whom the turks would have run away with and ippolita sforza the beautiful bluestocking who set bandello on writing his novels and bembo and flaminio and berni and molza and sannazzaro and the medici family and vida and macchiavelli and nobody doubts that he might have shone at the court of leo the brightest of the bright but he thought it better to enjoy a little in peace than seek after much with trouble31 he cared for none of the pleasures of the great except building and that he was content to satisfy in cowleys fashion with a small house in a large garden he was plain in his diet disliked ceremony and was frequently absorbed in thought his indignation was roused by mean and brutal vices but he took a large and liberal view of human nature in general and if he was somewhat free in his life must be pardoned for the custom of the times for his charity to others and for the genial disposition which made him an enchanting poet above all he was an affectionate son lived like a friend with his children and in spite of his tendency to pleasure supplied the place of an anxious and careful father to his brothers and sisters who idolized him    ornabat pietas et grata modestia vatem  wrote his brother gabriel    sancta fides dictique memor munitaque recto   justitia et nullo patientia victa labore   et constans virtus animi et elementia mitis   ambitione procul pulsa fastûsque tumore   credere uti posses natum felicibus horis   felici fulgente astro jovis atque diones32    devoted tenderness adornd the bard   and grateful modesty and grave regard   to his least word and justice armd with right   and patience counting every labour light   and constancy of soul and meekness too   that neither pride nor worldly wishes knew   you might have thought him born when there concur   the sweet star and the strong venus and jupiter  his son virginio and others have left a variety of anecdotes corroborating points in his character i shall give them all for they put us into his company it is recorded as an instance of his reputation for honesty that an old kinsman a clergyman who was afraid of being poisoned for his possessions would trust himself in no other hands but the clergyman was his own granduncle and namesake probably godfather so that the compliment is not so very great  in his youth he underwent a long rebuke one day from his father without saying a word though a satisfactory answer was in his power on which his brother gabriel expressing his surprise he said that he was thinking all the time of a scene in a comedy he was writing for which the paternal lecture afforded an excellent study  he loved gardening better than he understood it was always shifting his plants and destroying the seeds out of impatience to see them germinate he was rejoicing once on the coming up of some capers which he had been visiting every day to see how they got on when it turned out that his capers were eldertrees  he was perpetually altering his verses his manuscripts are full of corrections he wrote the exordium of the orlando over and over again and at last could only be satisfied with it in proportion as it was not his own that is to say in proportion as it came nearer to the beautiful passage in dante from which his ear and his feelings had caught it33  he however discovered that correction was not always improvement he used to say it was with verses as with trees a plant naturally well growing might be made perfect by a little delicate treatment but overcultivation destroyed its native grace in like manner you might perfect a happilyinspired verse by taking away any little fault of expression but too great a polish deprived it of the charm of the first conception it was like overtraining a naturally graceful child if it be wondered how he who corrected so much should succeed so well even to an appearance of happy negligence it is to be considered that the most impulsive writers often put down their thoughts too hastily then correct and recorrect them in the same impatient manner and so have to bring them round by as many steps to the feeling which they really had at first though they were too hasty to do it justice  ariosto would have altered his house as often as his verses but did not find it so convenient somebody wondering that he contented himself with so small an abode when he built such magnificent mansions in his poetry he said it was easier to put words together than blocks of stone34  he liked virgil commended the style of tibullus did not care for propertius but expressed high approbation of catullus and horace i suspect his favourite to have been ovid his son says he did not study much nor look after books but this may have been in his decline or when virginio first took to observing him a different conclusion as to study is to be drawn from the corrected state of his manuscripts and the variety of his knowledge and with regard to books he not only mentions the library of the vatican as one of his greatest temptations to visit rome but describes himself with all the gusto of a bookworm as enjoying them in his chimneycorner35  to intimate his secrecy in lovematters he had an inkstand with a cupid on it holding a finger on his lips i believe it is still in existence36 he did not disclose his mistresses names as dante did for the purpose of treating them with contempt nor on the other hand does he appear to have been so indiscriminately gallant as to be fond of goitres37 the only mistress of whom he complained he concealed in a latin appellation and of her he did not complain with scorn he had loved besides alessandra benucci a lady of the name of ginevra the mother of one of his children is recorded as a certain orsolina and that of the other was named maria and is understood to have been a governess in his fathers family38  he ate fast and of whatever was next him often beginning with the bread on the table before the dishes came and he would finish his dinner with another bit of bread appetiva le rape says his good son videlicet he was fond of turnips in his fourth satire he mentions as a favourite dish turnips seasoned with vinegar and boiled must sapa which seems not unjustifiably to startle mr panizzi39 he cared so little for good eating that he said of himself he should have done very well in the days when people lived on acorns  a stranger coming in one day at the dinnerhour he ate up what was provided for both saying afterwards when told of it that the gentleman should have taken care of himself this does not look very polite but of course it was said in jest his son attributed this carelessness at table to absorption in his studies  he carried this absence of mind so far and was at the same time so good a pedestrian that virginio tells us he once walked all the way from carpi to ferrara in his slippers owing to his having strolled out of doors in that direction  the same biographers who describe him as a brave soldier add that he was a timid horseman and seaman and indeed he appears to have eschewed every kind of unnecessary danger it was a maxim of his to be the last in going out of a boat i know not what orlando would have said to this but there is no doubt that the good son and brother avoided no pain in pursuit of his duty he more than once risked his life in the service of government from the perils of travelling among warmakers and banditti imagination finds something worthy of itself on great occasions but is apt to discover the absurdity of staking existence on small ones ariosto did not care to travel out of italy he preferred he says going round the earth in a map visiting countries without having to pay innkeepers and ploughing harmless seas without thunder and lightning40  his outward religion like the one he ascribed to his friend cardinal bembo was that of other people he did not think it of use to disturb their belief yet excused rather than blamed luther attributing his heresy to the necessary consequences of mooting points too subtle for human apprehension41 he found it impossible however to restrain his contempt of bigotry and like most great writers in catholic countries was a derider of the pretensions of devotees and the discords and hypocrisies of the convent he evidently laughed at dantes figments about the other world not at the poetry of them for that he admired and sometimes imitated but at the superstition and presumption he turned the florentines moon into a depository of nonsense and found no hell so bad as the hearts of tyrants the only other people he put into the infernal regions are ladies who were cruel to their lovers he had a noble confidence in the intentions of his creator and died ill the expectation of meeting his friends again in a higher state of existence  of ariostos four brothers one became a courtier at naples another a clergyman another an envoy to the emperor charles the fifth and the fourth who was a cripple and a scholar lived with lodovico and celebrated his memory his two sons whose names were virginio and gianbattista and who were illegitimate the reader is always to bear in mind the more indulgent customs of italy in matters of this nature especially in the poets time became the first a canon in the cathedral of ferrara and the other an officer in the army it does not appear that he had any other children  ariostos renown is wholly founded on the orlando furioso though he wrote satires comedies and a good deal of miscellaneous poetry all occasionally exhibiting a masterhand the comedies however were unfortunately modelled on those of the ancients and the constant termination of the verse with trisyllables contributes to render them tedious what comedies might he not have written had he given himself up to existing times and manners42  the satires are rather goodnatured epistles to his friends written with a charming ease and straightforwardness and containing much exquisite sense and interesting autobiography  on his lyrical poetry he set little value and his latin verse is not of the best order critics have expressed their surprise at its inferiority to that of contemporaries inferior to him in genius but the reason lay in the very circumstance i mean that his large and liberal inspiration could only find its proper vent in his own language he could not be content with potting up little delicacies in oldfashioned vessels  the orlando furioso is literally a continuation of the orlando innamorato so much so that the story is not thoroughly intelligible without it this was probably the reason of a circumstance that would be otherwise unaccountable and that was ridiculously charged against him as a proof of despairing envy by the despairing envy of sperone namely his never having once mentioned the name of his predecessor if ariosto had despaired of equalling boiardo he must have been hopeless of reaching posterity in which case his silence must have been useless and in any case it is clear that he looked on himself as the continuator of anothers narration but boiardo was so popular when he wrote that the very silence shews he must have thought the mention of his name superfluous still it is curious that he never should have alluded to it in the course of the poem it could not have been from any dislike to the name itself or the family for in his latin poems he has eulogised the hospitality of the house of boiardo43  the furioso continued not only what boiardo did but what he intended to do for as its subject is orlandos love and knighterrantry in general so its object was to extol the house of este and deduce it from its fabulous ancestor ruggiero orlando is the open ruggiero the covert hero and almost all the incidents of this supposed irregular poem which as panizzi has shewn is one of the most regular in the world go to crown with triumph and wedlock the originator of that unworthy race this is done on the old groundwork of charlemagne and his paladins of the treacheries of the house of gan of maganza and of the wars of the saracens against christendom bradamante the amazonian intended of ruggiero is of the same race as orlando and a great overthrower of infidels ruggiero begins with being an infidel himself and is kept from the wars like a second achilles by the devices of an anxious guardian but ultimately fights is converted and marries and orlando all the while slays his thousands as of old loves goes mad for jealousy is the foolishest and wisest of mankind somewhat like the poet himself and crowns the glory of ruggiero not only by being present at his marriage but putting on his spurs with his own hand when he goes forth to conclude the war by the death of the king of algiers  the great charm however of the orlando furioso is not in its knighterrantry or its main plot or the cunning interweavement of its minor ones but in its endless variety truth force and animal spirits in its fidelity to actual nature while it keeps within the bounds of the probable and its no less enchanting verisimilitude during its wildest sallies of imagination at one moment we are in the midst of flesh and blood like ourselves at the next with fairies and goblins at the next in a tremendous battle or tempest then in one of the loveliest of solitudes then hearing a tragedy then a comedy then mystified in some enchanted palace then riding dancing dining looking at pictures then again descending to the depths of the earth or soaring to the moon or seeing lovers in a glade or witnessing the extravagances of the great jealous hero orlando and the music of an enchanting style perpetually attends us and the sweet face of angelica glances here and there like a bud and there are gallantries of all kinds and stories endless and honest tears and joyous bursts of laughter and beardings for all base opinions and no bigotry and reverence for whatsoever is venerable and candour exquisite and the happy interwoven names of angelica and medoro young for ever  but so great a work is not to be dismissed with a mere rhapsody of panegyric ariosto is inferior in some remarkable respects to his predecessors pulci and boiardo his characters for the most part do not interest us as much as theirs by their variety and good fellowship he invented none as boiardo did with the exception indeed of orlandos as modified by jealousy and he has no passage i thick equal in pathos to that of the struggle at roncesvalles for though orlandos jealousy is pathetic as well as appalling the effects of it are confined to one person and disputed by his excessive strength ariosto has taken all tenderness out of angelica except that of a kind of boardingschool first love which however as hereafter intimated may have simplified and improved her general effect and he has omitted all that was amusing in the character of astolfo knighterrantry has fallen off a little in his hands from its first youthful and trusting freshness more sophisticate times are opening upon us and satire more frequently and bitterly interferes the licentious passages though never gross in words like those of his contemporaries are not redeemed by sentiment as in boiardo and it seems to me that ariosto hardly improved so much as he might have done upon his predecessors imitations of the classics i cannot help thinking that upon the whole he had better have left them alone and depended entirely on himself shelley says he has too much fighting and revenge44which is true but the revenge was only among his knights he was himself like my admirable friend one of the most forgiving of men and the fighting was the taste of the age in which chivalry was still flourishing in the shape of such men as bayard and ferocity in men like gaston de foix ariosto certainly did not anticipate any more than shakspeare did that spirit of human amelioration which has ennobled the present age he thought only of reflecting nature as he found it he is sometimes even as uninteresting as he found other people but the tiresome passages thank god all belong to the house of este his panegyrics of ippolito and his ancestors recoiled on the poet with a retributive dulness  but in all the rest there is a wonderful invigoration and enlargement the genius of romance has increased to an extraordinary degree in power if not in simplicity its shoulders have grown broader its voice louder and more sustained and if it has lost a little on the sentimental side it has gained prodigiously not only in animal vigour but above all in knowledge of human nature and a brave and joyous candour in shewing it the poet takes a universal an acute and upon the whole a cheerful view like the sun itself of all which the sun looks on and readers are charmed to see a knowledge at once so keen and so happy herein lies the secret of ariostos greatness which is great not because it has the intensity of dante or the incessant thought and passion of shakspeare or the dignified imagination of milton to all of whom he is far inferior in sustained excellencebut because he is like very nature herself whether great small serious pleasureable or even indifferent he still has the life ease and beauty of the operations of the daily planet even where he seems dull and commonplace his brightness and originality at other times make it look like a goodnatured condescension to our own common habits of thought and discourse as though he did it but on purpose to leave nothing unsaid that could bring him within the category of ourselves his charming manner intimates that instead of taking thought he chooses to take pleasure with us and compare old notes and we are delighted that he does us so much honour and makes as it were ariostos of us all he is shakspearian in going all lengths with nature as he found her not blinking the fact of evil yet finding a soul of goodness in it and at the same time never compromising the worth of noble and generous qualities his young and handsome medoro is a pitiless slayer of his enemies but they were his masters enemies and he would have lost his life even to preserve his dead body his orlando for all his wisdom and greatness runs mad for love of a coquette who triumphs over warriors and kings only to fall in love herself with an obscure lad his kings laugh with all their hearts like common people his mourners weep like such unaffected children of sorrow that they must needs swallow some of their tears45 his heroes on the arrival of intelligence that excites them leap out of bed and write letters before they dress from natural impatience thinking nothing of their dignity when astolfo blows the magic horn which drives every body out of the castle of atlantes not a mouse stays behindnot as hoole and such critics think because the poet is here writing ludicrously but because he uses the same image seriously to give an idea of desolation as shakspeare in hamlet does to give that of silence when not a mouse is stirring instead of being mere comic writing such incidents are in the highest epic taste of the meeting of extremesof the impartial eye with which nature regards high and low so give ariosto his hippogriff and other marvels with which he has enriched the stock of romance and nature takes as much care of the verisimilitude of their actions as if she had made them herself his hippogriff returns like a common horse to the stable to which he has been accustomed his enchanter who is gifted with the power of surviving decapitation and pursuing the decapitator so long as a fated hair remains on his head turns deadly pale in the face when it is scalped and falls lifeless from his horse his truth indeed is so genuine and at the same time his style is so unaffected sometimes so familiar in its grace and sets us so much at ease in his company that the familiarity is in danger of bringing him into contempt with the inexperienced and the truth of being considered old and obvious because the mode of its introduction makes it seem an old acquaintance when voltaire was a young man and to anglicise a favourite gallic phrase fancied he had profounded every thing deep and knowing he thought nothing of ariosto some years afterwards he took him for the first of grotesque writers but nothing more at last he pronounced him equally entertaining and sublime and humbly apologised for his error foscolo quotes this passage from the dictionnaire philosophique and adds another from sir joshua reynolds in which the painter speaks of a similar inability on his own part when young to enjoy the perfect nature of raphael and the admiration and astonishment which in his riper years he grew to feel for it46  the excessive wildness attributed to ariosto is not wilder than many things in homer or even than some things in virgil such as the transformation of ships into seanymphs the reason why it has been thought so is that he rendered them more popular by mixing them with satire and thus brought them more universally into notice one main secret of the delight they give us is their being poetical comments as it were on fancies and metaphors of our own thus we say of a suspicious man that he is suspicion itself ariosto turns him accordingly into an actual being of that name we speak of the flights of the poets ariosto makes them literally flightsflights on a hippogriff and to the moon the moon it has been said makes lunatics he accordingly puts a mans wits into that planet vice deforms beauty therefore his beautiful enchantress turns out to be an old hag ancient defeated empires are sounds and emptiness therefore the assyrian and persian monarchies become in his limbo of vanities a heap of positive bladders youth is headstrong and kissing goes by favour so angelica queen of cathay and beauty of the world jilts warriors and kings and marries a common soldier  and what a creature is this angelica what effect has she not had upon the world in spite of all her faults nay probably by very reason of them i know not whether it has been remarked before but it appears to me that the charm which every body has felt in the story of angelica consists mainly in that very fact of her being nothing but a beauty and a woman dashed even with coquetry which renders her so inferior in character to most heroines of romance her interest is founded on nothing exclusive or prejudiced it is not addressed to any special class she might or might not have been liked by this person or that but the world in general will adore her because nature has made them to adore beauty and the sex apart from prejudices right or wrong youth will attribute virtues to her whether she has them or not middleage be unable to help gazing on her oldage dote on her she is womankind itself in form and substance and that is a stronger thing for the most part than all our figments about it two musical names angelica and medoro have become identified in the minds of poetical readers with the honeymoon of youthful passion  the only false acid insipid fiction i can call to mind in the orlando furioso is that of the swans who rescue medals from the river of oblivion canto xxxv it betrays a singular forgetfulness of the poets wonted verisimilitude for what metaphor can reconcile us to swans taking an interest in medals popular belief had made them singers but it was not a wise step to convert them into antiquaries  ariostos animal spirits and the brilliant hurry and abundance of his incidents blind a careless reader to his endless particular beauties which though he may too often describe instead of paint on account as foscolo says of his writing to the many spew that no man could paint better when he chose the bosoms of his females come and go like the waves on the seacoast in summer airs47 his witches draw the fish out of the water    with simple words and a pure warbled spell48  he borrows the word painting itselflike a true italian and friend of raphael and titian to express the commiseration in the faces of the blest for the sufferings of mortality    dipinte di pietade il viso pio49    their pious looks painted with tenderness  jesus is very finely called in the same passage il sempiterno amante the eternal lover the female sex are the    schiera gentil the pur adorna il mondo50    the gentle bevy that adorns the world  he paints cabinetpictures like spenser in isolated stanzas with a pencil at once solid and light as in the instance of the charming one that tells the story of mercury and his net how he watched the goddess of flowers as she issued forth at dawn with her lap full of roses and violets and so threw the net over her one day and took her    un dì lo prese51  but he does not confine himself to these gentle pictures he has many as strong as michael angelo some as intense as dante he paints the conquest of america in five words    veggio da diece cacciar mille52   i see thousands   hunted by tens  he compares the noise of a tremendous battle heard in the neighbourhood to the sound of the cataracts of the nile    un alto suon ch a quel s accorda   con che i vicin cadendo il nil assorda53  he scourges ships at sea with tempestssay rather the miserable seamen while nighttime grows blacker and blacker on the exasperated waters54   when rodomont has plunged into the thick of paris and is carrying every thing before him like a serpent that has newly cast his skin and goes shaking his three tongues under his eyes of fire he makes this tremendous hero break the middle of the palacegate into a huge window and look through it with a countenance which is suddenly beheld by a crowd of faces as pale as death    e dentro fatto l ha tanta finestra   che ben vedere e veduto esser puote   dai visi impressi di color di morte55  the whole description of orlandos jealousy and growing madness is shakspearian for passion and circumstance as the reader may see even in the prose abstract of it in this volume and his sublimation of a suspicious king into suspicion itself which it also contains is as grandly and felicitously audacious as any thing ever invented by poet spenser thought so and has imitated and emulated it in one of his own finest passages ariosto has not the spleen and gall of dante and therefore his satire is not so tremendous yet it is very exquisite as all the world have acknowledged in the instances of the lost things found in the moon and the angel who finds discord in a convent he does not take things so much to heart as chaucer he has nothing so profoundly pathetic as our great poets griselda yet many a gentle eye has moistened at the conclusion of the story of isabella and to recur once more to orlandos jealousy all who have experienced that passion will feel it shake them i have read somewhere of a visit paid to voltaire by an italian gentleman who recited it to him and who being moved perhaps by the recollection of some passage in his own history had the tears all the while pouring down his cheeks  such is the poem which the gracious and good cardinal ippolito designated as a parcel of trumpery it had indeed to contend with more slights than his like all originals it was obliged to wait for the death of the envious and the selfloving before it acquired a popularity which surpassed all precedent foscolo says that macchiavelli and ariosto the two writers of that age who really possessed most excellence were the least praised during their lives bembo was approached in a posture of adoration and fear the infamous aretino extorted a fulsome letter of praises from the great and the learned56 he might have added that the writer most in request in the circles was a gentleman of the name of bernardo accolti then called the unique now never heard of ariosto himself eulogised him among a shoal of writers half of whose names have perished and who most likely included in that half the men who thought he did not praise them enough for such was the fact i allude to the charming invention in his last canto in which he supposes himself welcomed home after a long voyage gay imitated it very pleasantly in an address to pope on the conclusion of his homer some of the persons thus honoured by ariosto were vexed it is said at not being praised highly enough others at seeing so many praised in their company some at being left out of the list and some others at being mentioned at all these silly people thought it taking too great a liberty the poor flies of a day did not know that a god had taken them in hand to give them wings for eternity happily for them the names of most of these mighty personages are not known one or two however took care to make posterity laugh trissino a very great man in his day and the wouldbe restorer of the ancient epic had the face in return for the poets too honourable mention of him to speak in his own absurd verses of ariosto with that furioso of his which pleases the vulgar    l ariosto   con quel furioso suo the piace al volgo  his poem adds panizzi has the merit of not having pleased any body57 a sullen critic sperone the same that afterwards plagued tasso was so disappointed at being left out that he became the poets bitter enemy he talked of ariosto taking himself for a swan and dying like a goose the allusion was to the fragment he left called the five cantos what has become of the swan sperone bernardo tasso torquatos father made a more reasonable but which turned out to be an unfounded complaint that ariosto had established a precedent which poets would find inconvenient and macchiavelli like the true genius he was expressed a goodnatured and flattering regret that his friend ariosto had left him out of his list of congratulators in a work which was fine throughout and in some places wonderful58  the great galileo knew ariosto nearly by heart59  he is a poet whom it may require a certain amount of animal spirits to relish thoroughly the air of his verse must agree with you before you can perceive all its freshness and vitality but if read with any thing like italian sympathy with allowance for times and manners and with a sense as well as admittance of the different kinds of the beautiful in poetry two very different things you will be almost as much charmed with the divine ariosto as his countrymen have been for ages   footnote 1 the materials for this notice have been chiefly collected from the poets own writings rich in autobiographical intimation and from his latest editor panizzi i was unable to see this writers principal authority baruffaldi till i corrected the proofs and the press was waiting otherwise i might have added two or three more particulars not however of any great consequence panizzi is as usual copious and to the purpose and has for the first time i believe critically proved the regularity and connectedness of ariostos plots as well as the hollowness of the pretensions of the house of este to be considered patrons of literature it is only a pity that his life of ariosto is not better arranged i have of course drawn my own conclusions respecting particulars and sometimes have thought i had reason to differ with those who have preceded me but not i hope with a presumption unbecoming a foreigner  footnote 2 see in his latin poems the lines beginning hæc me verbosas suasit perdiscere

this passage and the one referred to in the preceding note but i think the conclusion in the test the probable one and that he was not compelled to study the law in the first instance he speaks more

of being made the prize of the conqueror resolved to escape before the battle with the pagans she accordingly mounted her palfrey at once and fled with all her might till she found herself in a wood  scarcely had she congratulated herself on being in a place of refuge when she met a warrior full armed whom with terror she recognised to be the onceloved but now detested rinaldo he had lost his horse and was looking for it angelica turned her palfrey aside instantly and galloped whithersoever it chose to carry her till she came to a riverside where she found another of her suitors ferragus she called loudly upon him for help rinaldo had recognised her in turn and though he was on foot she knew he would be coming after her  come after her he did a fight between the rivals ensued and the beauty taking advantage of it again fled awayfled like the fawn that having seen its mothers throat seized by a wild beast scours through the woods and fancies herself every instant in the jaws of the monster every sweep of the wind in the treesevery shadow across her pathdrove her with sudden starts into the wildest crossroads for it made her feel as if rinaldo was at her shoulders2  slackening her speed by degrees she wandered afterwards she knew not whither till she came next day to a pleasant wood that was gently stirring with the breeze there were two streams in it which kept the grass always green and when you listened you heard them softly running among the pebbles with a broken murmur  thinking herself secure at last and indeed feeling as if she were now a thousand miles off from rinaldotired also with her long journey and with the heat of the summer sunshe here determined to rest herself she dismounted and having relieved her horse of his bridle and let him wander away in the fresh pasture she cast her eyes upon a lovely natural bower formed of wild roses which made a sort of little room by the waters side the bower beheld itself in the water trees enclosed it overhead on the three other sides and in the middle was room enough to lie down on the sward while the whole was so thickly trellised with the leaves and branches that the sunbeams themselves could not enter much less any prying sight the place invited her to rest and accordingly the beautiful creature laid herself down and so gathering herself as it were together went fast asleep3  she had not slept long when she was awakened by the trampling of a horse and getting up and looking cautiously through the trees she perceived a cavalier who dismounted from his steed and sat himself down by the water in a melancholy posture it was sacripant king of circassia one of her lovers wretched at the thought of having missed her in the camp of king charles angelica loved sacripant no more than the rest but considering him a man of great conscientiousness she thought he would make her a good protector while on her journey home she therefore suddenly appeared before him out of the bower like a goddess of the woods or venus herself and claimed his protection  never did a mother bathe the eyes of her son with tears of such exquisite joy when he came home after news of his death in battle as the saracen king beheld this sudden apparition with    così vôto nel mezo the concede   fresca stanza fra lombre più nascose   e la foglie coi rami in modo è mista   che l sol non v entra non che minor vista

            st37  an exquisite picture its divine face and beautiful manners4 he could not help clasping her in his arms and very different intentions were coming into his head than those for which she had given him credit when the noise of a second warrior thundering through the woods made him remount his horse and prepare for an encounter the stranger speedily made his appearance a personage of a gallant and fiery bearing clad in a surcoat white as snow with a white streamer for a crest he seemed more bent on having the way cleared before him than anxious about the manner of it so couching his lance as he came while sacripant did the like with his he dashed upon the circassian with such violence as to cast him on the ground and though his own horse slipped at the same time he had it up again in an instant with his spurs and so continuing his way was a mile off before the saracen recovered from his astonishment  as the stunned and stupid ploughman who has been stretched by a thunderbolt beside his slain oxen raises himself from the ground after the lofty crash and looks with astonishment at the old pinetree near him which has been stripped from head to foot with just such amazement the circassian got up from his downfall and stood in the presence of angelica who had witnessed it never in his life had he blushed so red as at that moment  angelica comforted him in sorry fashion attributing the disaster to his tired and illfed horse and observing that his enemy had chosen to risk no second encounter but while she was talking a messenger with an appearance of great fatigue and anxiety came riding up who asked sacripant if he had seen a knight in a white surcoat and crest  he has this instant answered the king overthrown me and galloped away who is he  it is no he replied the messenger the rider who has overthrown you and thus taken possession of whatever glory you may have acquired is a damsel and she is still more beautiful than brave bradalnante is her illustrious name and with these words the horseman set spurs to his horse and left the saracen more miserable than before he mounted angelicas horse without a word his own having been disabled and so taking her up behind him proceeded on the road in continued silence5  they had just gone a couple of miles when they again heard a noise as of some powerful body in haste and in a little while a horse without a rider came rushing towards them in golden trappings it was rinaldos horse bayardo6 the circassian dismounting thought to seize it but was welcomed with a curvet which made him beware how he hazarded something worse the horse then went straight to angelica in a way as caressing as a dog for he remembered how she fed him in albracca at the time when she was in love with his ungracious master and the beauty recollected bayardo with equal pleasure for she had need of him sacripant however watched his opportunity and mounted the horse so that now the two companions had each a separate steed they were about to proceed more at their ease when again a great noise was heard and rinaldo himself was seen coming after them on foot threatening the saracen with furious gestures for he saw that he had got his horse and he recognised above all in a rage of jealousy the lovely face beside him angelica in vain implored the circassian to fly with her he asked if she had forgotten the wars of albracca and all which he had done to serve her that thus she supposed him afraid of another battle  sacripant endeavoured to push bayardo against rinaldo but the horse refusing to fight his master he dismounted and the two rivals encountered each other with their swords at first they went through the whole swordexercise to no effect but rinaldo tired of the delay raised the terrible fusberta7 and at one blow cut through the others twofold buckler of bone and steel and benumbed his arm angelica turned as pale as a criminal going to execution and without farther waiting galloped off through the forest looking round every instant to see if rinaldo was upon her  she had not gone far when she met an old man who seemed to be a hermit but was in reality a magician coming along upon an ass he was of venerable aspect and seemed worn out with age and mortifications yet when he beheld the exquisite face before him and heard the lady explain how it was she needed his assistance even he old as he really was began to fancy himself a lover and determined to use his art for the purpose of keeping his two rivals at a distance taking out a book and reading a little in it there issued from the air a spirit in likeness of a servant whom he sent to the two combatants with directions to give them a false account of orlandos having gone off to france with angelica the spirit disappeared and the magician journeying with his companion to the seacoast raised another who entered angelicas horse and carried her to her astonishment and terror out to sea and so round to some lonely rocks there to her great comfort at first the old man rejoined her but his proceedings becoming very mysterious and exciting her indignation he cast her into a deep sleep  it happened at this moment that a ship was passing by the rocks bound upon a tragical commission from the island of ebuda it was the custom of that place to consign a female daily to the jaws of a seamonster for the purpose of averting the wrath of one of their gods and as it was thought that the god would be appeased if they brought him one of singular beauty the mariners of the ship seized with avidity on the sleeping angelica and carried her off together with the old man the people of ebuda out of love and pity kept her unexposed to the seamonster for some days but at length she was bound to the rock where it was accustomed to seek its food and thus in tears and horror with not a friend to look to the delight of the world expected her fate east and west she looked in vain to the heavens she looked in vain every where she looked in vain that beauty which had made king agrican come from the caspian gates with half scythia to find his death from the hands of orlando that beauty which had made king sacripant forget both his country and his honour that beauty which had tarnished the renown and the wisdom of the great orlando himself and turned the whole east upside down and laid it at the feet of loveliness has now not a soul near it to give it the comfort of a word  leaving our heroine awhile in this condition i must now tell you that ruggiero the greatest of all the infidel warriors had been presented by his guardian the magician atlantes with two wonderful gifts the one a shield of dazzling metal which blinded and overthrew every one that looked at it and the other an animal which combined the bird with the quadruped and was called the hippogriff or griffinhorse it had the plumage the wings head beak and frontlegs of a griffin and the rest like a horse it was not made by enchantment but was a creature of a natural kind found but very rarely in the riphæan mountains far on the other side of the frozen sea8  with these gifts high mounted in the air the young ward of atlantes was now making the grandest of grand tours he had for some time been confined by the magician in a castle in order to save him from the dangers threatened in his horoscope from this he had been set free by the lady with whom he was destined to fall in love he had then been inveigled by a wicked fairy into her tower and set free by a good one and now he was on his travels through the world to seek his mistress and pursue knightly adventures  casting his eyes on the coast of ebuda the rider of the hippogriff beheld the amazing spectacle of the lady tied to the rock and struck with a beauty which reminded him of her whom he loved he resolved to deliver her from a peril which soon became too manifest  a noise was heard in the sea and the huge monster the orc appeared half in the water and half out of it like a ship which drags its way into port after a long and tempestuous voyage9 it seemed a huge mass without form except the head which had eyes sticking out and bristles like a boar ruggiero who had dashed down to the side of angelica and attempted to encourage her in vain now rose in the air and the monster whose attention was diverted by a shadow on the water of a couple of great wings dashing round and above him presently felt a spear on his deck but only to irritate him for it could not pierce the skin in vain ruggiero tried to do so a hundred times the combat was of no more effect than that of the fly with the mastiff when it dashes against his eyes and mouth and at last comes once too often within the gape of his snapping teeth the orc raised such a foam and tempest in the waters with the flapping of his tail that the knight of the hippogriff hardly knew whether he was in air or sea he began to fear that the monster would disable the creatures wings and where would its rider be then he therefore had recourse to a weapon which he never used but at the last moment when skill and courage became of no service he unveiled the magic shield but first he flew to angelica and put on her finger the ring which neutralised its effect the shield blazed on the water like another sun the orc beholding it felt it smite its eyes like lightning and rolling over its unwieldy body in the foam which it had raised lay turned up like a dead fish insensible but it was not dead and ruggiero was so long in making ineffectual efforts to pierce it that angelica cried out to him for gods sake to release her while he had the opportunity lest the monster should revive take ime with you she said drown me any thing rather than let me be food for this horror  the knight released her instantly he set her behind him on the winged horse and in a few minutes was in the air transported with having deprived the brute of his delicate supper then turning as he went he imprinted on her a thousand kisses he had intended to make a tour of spain which was not far off but he now altered his mind and descended with his prize into a lovely spot on the coast of brittany encircled with oaks full of nightingales with here and there a solitary mountain  it was a little green meadow with a brook10  ruggiero looked about him with transport and was preparing to disencumber himself of his hot armour when the blushing beauty casting her eyes downwards beheld on her finger the identical magic ring which her father had given her when she first entered christendom and which had delivered her out of so many dangers if put on the finger only it neutralised all enchantment but put into the mouth it rendered the wearer invisible it had been stolen from her and came into the hands of a good fairy who gave it to ruggiero in order to deliver him from the wiles of a bad one falsehood to the good fairys friend his own mistress bradamante now rendered him unworthy of its possession and at the moment when he thought angelica his own beyond redemption she vanished out of his sight in vain he knew the secret of the ring and the possibility of her being still presentthe certainty at all events of her not being very far off he ran hither and thither like a madman hoping to clasp her in his arms and embracing nothing but the air in a little while she was distant far enough and ruggiero stamping about to no purpose in a rage of disappointment and at length resolving to take horse perceived he had been deprived in the mean time of his hippogriff it had loosened itself from the tree to which he had tied it and taken its own course over the mountains thus he had lost horse ring and lady all at once11  pursuing his way with contending emotions through a valley between lofty woods he heard a great noise in the thick of them he rushed to see what it was and found a giant combating with a young knight the giant got the better of the knight and having cast him on the ground unloosed his helmet for the purpose of slaying him when ruggiero to his horror beheld in the youths face that of his unworthilytreated mistress bradamante he rushed to assault her enemy but the giant seizing her in his arms took to his heels and the penitent lover followed him with all his might but in vain the wretch was hidden from his eyes by the trees at length ruggiero incessantly pursuing him issued forth into a great meadow containing a noble mansion and here he beheld the giant in the act of dashing through the gate of it with his prize  the mansion was an enchanted one raised by the anxious old guardian of ruggiero for the purpose of enticing into it both the youth himself and all from whom he could experience danger in the course of his adventures orlando had just been brought there by a similar device that of the apparition of a knight carrying off angelica for the supposed bradamante was equally a deception and the giant no other than the magician himself there also were the knights ferragus and brandimart and grandonio and king sacripant all searching for something they had missed they wandered about the house to no purpose and sometimes ruggiero heard bradamante calling him and sometimes orlando beheld angelicas face at a window12  at length the beauty arrived in her own veritable person she was again on horseback and once more on the lookout for a knight who should conduct her safely homewhether orlando or sacripant she had not determined the same road which had brought ruggiero to the enchanted house having done as much for her she now entered it invisibly by means of the ring  finding both the knights in the place and feeling under the necessity of coming to a determination respecting one or the other angelica made up her mind in favour of king sacripant whom she reckoned to be more at her disposal contriving therefore to meet him by himself she took the ring out of her mouth and suddenly appeared before him he had hardly recovered from his amazement when ferragus and orlando himself came up and as angelica now was visible to all she took occasion to deliver them from the enchanted house by hastening before them into a wood they all followed of course in a frenzy of anxiety and delight but the lady being perplexed with the presence of the whole three and recollecting that she had again obtained possession of her ring resolved to trust her safe conduct to invisibility alone so in the old fashion she left them to new quarrels by suddenly vanishing from their eyes she stopped nevertheless a while to laugh at them as they all turned their stupefied faces hither and thither then suffered them to pass her in a blind thunder of pursuit and so gently following at her leisure on the same road took her way towards the east  it was a long journey and she saw many places and people and was now hidden and now seen like the moon till she calve one day into a forest near the walls of paris where she beheld a youth lying wounded on the grass between two companions that were dead  part the second  angelica and medoro  now in order to understand who the youth was that angelica found lying on the grass between the two dead companions and how he came to be so lying you must know that a great battle had been fought there between charlemagne and the saracens in which the latter were defeated and that these three people belonged to the saracens the two that were slain were dardinel king of zumara and cloridan one of his followers and the wounded survivor was another whose name was medoro cloridan and medoro had been loving and grateful servants of dardinel and very fast friends of one another such friends indeed that on their own account as well as in honour of what they did for their master their history deserves a particular mention  they were of a lowly stock on the coast of syria and in all the various fortunes of their lord had shewn him a special attachment cloridan had been bred a huntsman and was the robuster person of the two medoro was in the first bloom of youth with a complexion rosy and fair and a most pleasant as well as beautiful countenance he had black eyes and hair that ran into curls of gold in short looked like a very angel from heaven  these two were keeping anxious watch upon the trenches of the defeated army when medoro unable to cease thinking of the master who had been left dead on the field told his friend that he could no longer delay to go and look for his dead body and bury it you said he will remain and so be able to do justice to my memory in case i fail  cloridan though he delighted in this proof of his friends nobleheartedness did all he could to dissuade him from so perilous an enterprise but medoro in the fervour of his gratitude for benefits conferred on him by his lord was immovable in his determination to die or to succeed and cloridan seeing this determined to go with him  they took their way accordingly out of the saracen camp and in a short time found themselves in that of the enemy the christians had been drinking overnight for joy at their victory and were buried in wine and sleep cloridan halted a moment and said in a whisper to his friend do you see this ought i to lose such an opportunity of revenging our beloved master keep watch and i will do it look about you and listen on every side while i make a passage for us among these sleepers with my sword  without waiting an answer the vigorous huntsman pushed into the first tent before him it contained among other occupants a certain alpheus a physician and caster of nativities who had prophesied to himself a long life and a death in the bosom of his family cloridan cautiously put the swords point in his throat and there was an end of his dreams four other sleepers were despatched in like manner without time given them to utter a syllable after them went another who had entrenched himself between two horses then the luckless grill who had made himself a pillow of a barrel which he had emptied he was dreaming of opening a second barrel but alas was tapped himself a greek and a german followed who had been playing late at dice fortunate if they had continued to do so a little longer but they never counted a throw like this among their chances  by this time the saracen had grown ferocious with his bloody work and went slaughtering along like a wild beast among sheep nor could medoro keep his own sword unemployed but he disdained to strike indiscriminatelyhe was choice in his victims among these was a certain duke la brett who had his lady fast asleep in his arms shall i pity them that will i not sweet was their fated hour most happy their departure for embraced as the sword found them even so i believe it dismissed them into the other world loving and enfolded  two brothers were slain next sons of the count of flanders and newlymade valorous knights charlemagne had seen them turn red with slaughter in the field and had augmented their coat of arms with his lilies and promised them lands beside in friesland and he would have bestowed the lands only medoro forbade it  the friends now discovered that they had approached the quarter in which the paladins kept guard about their sovereign they were afraid therefore to continue the slaughter any further so they put up their swords and picked their way cautiously through the rest of the camp into the field where the battle had taken place there they experienced so much difficulty in the search for their masters body in consequence of the horrible mixture of the corpses that they might have searched till the perilous return of daylight had not the moon at the close of a prayer of medoros sent forth its beams right on the spot where the king was lying medoro knew him by his cognizance argent and gulesthe poor youth burst into tears at the sight weeping plentifully as he approached him only he was obliged to let his tears flow without noise not that he cared for deathat that moment he would gladly have embraced it so deep was his affection for his lord but he was anxious not to be hindered in his pious office of consigning him to the earth  the two friends took up the dead king on their shoulders and were hasting away with the beloved burden when the whiteness of dawn began to appear and with it unfortunately a troop of horsemen in the distance right in their path  it was zerbino prince of scotland with a party of horse he was a warrior of extreme vigilance and activity and was returning to the camp after having been occupied all night in pursuing such of the enemy as had not succeeded in getting into their entrenchments13  my friend exclaimed the huntsman we must een take to our heels two living people must not be sacrificed to one who is dead  with these words he let go his share of the burden taking for granted that the friend whose life as well as his own he was thinking to secure would do as he himself did but attached as cloridan had been to his master medoro was far more so he accordingly received the whole burden on his shoulders cloridan meantime scoured away as fast as feet could carry him thinking his companion was at his side otherwise he would sooner have died a hundred times over than have left him  in the interim the party of the scottish prince had dispersed themselves about the plain for the purpose of intercepting the two fugitives whichever way they went for they saw plainly they were enemies by the alarm they shewed  there was an old forest at hand in those days which besides being thick and dark was full of the most intricate crosspaths and inhabited only by game into this cloridan had plunged medoro as well as he could hastened after him but hampered as he was with his burden the more he sought the darkest and most intricate paths the less advanced he found himself especially as he had no acquaintance with the place  on a sudden cloridan having arrived at a spot so quiet that he became aware of the silence missed his beloved friend great god he exclaimed what have i done left him i know not where or how the swift runner instantly turned about and retracing his steps came voluntarily back on the road to his own death as he approached the scene where it was to take place he began to hear the noise of men and horses then he discerned voices threatening then the voice of his unhappy friend and at length he saw him still bearing his load in the midst of the whole troop of horsemen the prince was commanding them to seize him the poor youth however burdened as he was rendered it no such easy matter for he turned himself about like a wheel and entrenched himself now behind this tree and now behind that finding this would not do he laid his beloved burden on the ground and then strode hither and thither over and round about it parrying the horsemens endeavours to take him prisoner never did poor hunted bear feel more conflicting emotions when surprised in her den she stands over her offspring with uncertain heart groaning with a mingled sound of tenderness and rage wrath bids her rush forward and bury her nails in the flesh of their enemy love melts her and holds her back in the middle of her fury to look upon those whom she bore14  cloridan was in an agony of perplexity what to do he longed to rush forth and die with his friend he longed also still to do what he could and not to let him die unavenged he therefore halted awhile before he issued from the trees and putting an arrow to his bow sent it wellaimed among the horsemen a scotsman fell dead from his saddle the troop all turned to see whence the arrow came and as they were raging and crying out a second stuck in the throat of the loudest  this is not to be borne cried the prince pushing his horse towards medoro you shall suffer for this and so speaking he thrust his hand into the golden locks of the youth and dragged him violently backwards intending to kill him but when he looked on his beautiful face he couldnt do it  the youth betook himself to entreaty for gods sake sir knight cried he be not so cruel as to deny me leave to bury my lord and master he was a king i ask nothing for myselfnot even my life i do not care for my life i care for nothing but to bury my lord and master  these words were spoken in a manner so earnest that the good prince could feel nothing but pity but a ruffian among the troop losing sight even of respect for his lord thrust his lance into the poor youths bosom right over the princes hand zerbino turned with indignation to smite him but the villain seeing what was coming galloped off and meanwhile cloridan thinking that his friend was slain came leaping full of rage out of the wood and laid about him with his sword in mortal desperation twenty swords were upon him in a moment and perceiving life flowing out of him he let himself fall down by the side of his friend15  the scotsmen supposing both the friends to be dead now took their departure and medoro indeed would have been dead before long he bled so profusely but assistance of a very unusual sort was at hand  a lady on a palfrey happened to be coming by who observed signs of life in him and was struck with his youth and beauty she was attired with great simplicity but her air was that of a person of high rank and her beauty inexpressible in short it was the proud daughter of the lord of cathay angelica herself finding that she could travel in safety and independence by means of the magic ring her selfestimation had risen to such a height that she disdained to stoop to the companionship of the greatest man living she could not even call to mind that such lovers as the county orlando or king sacripant existed and it mortified her beyond measure to think of the affection she had entertained for rinaldo  such arrogance thought love is not to be endured the little archer with the wings put an arrow to his bow and stood waiting for her by the spot where medoro lay  now when the beauty beheld the youth lying half dead with his wounds and yet on accosting him found that he lamented less for himself than for the unburied body of the king his master she felt a tenderness unknown before creep into every particle of her being and as the greatest ladies of india were accustomed to dress the wounds of their knights she bethought her of a balsam which she had observed in coming along and so looking about for it brought it back with her to the spot together with a herdsman whom she had met on horseback in search of one of his stray cattle the blood was ebbing so fast that the poor youth was on the point of expiring but angelica bruised the plant between stones and gathered the juice into her delicate hands and restored his strength with infusing it into the wounds so that in a little while he was able to get on the horse belonging to the herdsman and be carried away to the mans cottage he would not quit his lords body however nor that of his friend till he had seen them laid in the ground he then went with the lady and she took up her abode with him in the cottage and attended him till he recovered loving him more and more day by day so that at length she fairly told him as much and he loved her in turn and the kings daughter married the lowlyborn soldier  o county orlando o king sacripant that renowned valour of yours say what has it availed you that lofty honour tell us at what price is it rated what is the reward ye have obtained for all your services shew us a single courtesy which the lady ever vouchsafed late or early for all that you ever suffered in her behalf  o king agrican if you could return to life how hard would you think it to call to mind all the repulses she gave youall the pride and aversion and contempt with which she received your advances o ferragus o thousands of others too numerous to speak of who performed thousands of exploits for this ungrateful one what would you all think at beholding her in the arms of the courted boy  yes medoro had the first gathering of the kiss off the lips of angelicathose lips never touched beforethat garden of roses on the threshold of which nobody ever yet dared to venture the love was headlong and irresistible but the priest was called in to sanctify it and the brideswoman of the daughter of cathay was the wife of the cottager the lovers remained upwards of a month in the cottage angelica could not bear her young husband out of her sight she was for ever gazing on him and hanging on his neck indoors and outofdoors day as well as night she had him at her side in the morning or evening they wandered forth along the banks of some stream or by the hedgerows of some verdant meadow in the middle of the day they took refuge from the heat in a grotto that seemed made for lovers and wherever in their wanderings they found a tree fit to carve and write on by the side of fount or river or even a slab of rock soft enough for the purpose there they were sure to leave their names on the bark or marble so that what with the inscriptions indoors and outofdoors for the walls of the cottage displayed them also a visitor of the place could not have turned his eye in any direction without seeing the words    angelica and medoro  written in as many different ways as truelovers knots could run16  having thus awhile enjoyed themselves in the rustic solitude the queen of cathay for in the course of her adventures in christendom she had succeeded to her fathers crown thought it time to return to her beautiful empire and complete the triumph of love by crowning medoro king of it  she took leave of the cottagers with a princely gift the islanders of ebuda had deprived her of every thing valuable but a rich bracelet which for some strange perhaps superstitious reason they left on her arm this she took off and made a present of it to the good couple for their hospitality and so bade them farewell  the bracelet was of inimitable workmanship adorned with gems and had been given by the enchantress morgana to a favourite youth who was rescued from her wiles by orlando the youth in gratitude bestowed it on his preserver and the hero had humbly presented it to angelica who vouchsafed to accept it not because of the giver but for the rarity of the gift  the happy bride and bridegroom bidding farewell to france proceeded by easy journeys and crossed the mountains into spain where it was their intention to take ship for the levant descending the pyrenees they discerned the ocean in the distance and had now reached the coast and were proceeding by the waterside along the high road to barcelona when they beheld a miserablelooking creature a madman all over mud and dirt lying naked in the sands he had buried himself half inside them for shelter from the sun but having observed the lovers as they came along he leaped out of his hole like a dog and came raging against them  but before i proceed to relate who this madman was i must return to the cottage which the two lovers had occupied and recount what passed in it during the interval between their bidding it adieu and their arrival in this place  part the third  the jealousy of orlando  during the course of his search for angelica the county orlando had just restored two lovers to one another and was pursuing a pagan enemy to no purpose through a wild and tangled wood when he came into a beautiful spot by a rivers side which tempted him to rest himself from the heat it was a small meadow full of daisies and buttercups and surrounded with trees there was an air abroad notwithstanding the heat which made the shepherds glad to sit without their jerkins and receive the coolness on their naked bodies even the hardskinned cattle were glad of it and orlando who was armed capapie was delighted to take off his helmet and lay aside his buckler and repose awhile in the midst of a scene so refreshing alas it was the unhappiest moment of his life  casting his eyes around him while about to get off his horse he observed a handwriting on many of the trees which he thought he knew riding up to the trees and looking more closely he was sure he knew it and in truth it was no other than that of his adored mistress angelica and the inscription one of those numerous inscriptions of which i have spoken the spot was one of the haunts of the lovers while they abode in the shepherds cottage wherever the county turned his eyes he beheld tied together in truelovers knots nothing but the words    angelica and medoro  all the trees had themhis eyes could see nothing else and every letter was a dagger that pierced his heart  the unhappy lover tried in vain to disbelieve what he saw he endeavoured to compel himself to think that it was some other angelica who had written the words but he knew the handwriting too well too often had he dwelt upon it and made himself familiar with every turn of the letters he then strove to fancy that medoro was a feigned name intended for himself but he felt that he was trying to delude himself and that the more he tried the bitterer was his conviction of the truth he was like a bird fixing itself only the more deeply in the lime in which it is caught by struggling and beating its wings  orlando turned his horse away in his anguish and paced it towards a grotto covered with vine and ivy which he looked into the grotto both outside and in was full of the like inscriptions it was the retreat the lovers were so fond of at noon their names were written on all sides of it some in chalk and coal17 others carved with a knife  the wretched beholder got off his horse and entered the grotto the first thing that met his eyes was a larger inscription in the saracen lovers own handwriting and tonguea language which the slayer of the infidels was too well acquainted with the words were in verse and expressed the gratitude of the poor medoro the writer for having had in his arms in that grotto the beautiful angelica daughter of king galafron whom so many had loved in vain the writer invoked a blessing on every part of it its shades its waters its flowers its creeping plants and entreated every person high and low who should chance to visit it particularly lovers that they would bless the place likewise and take care that it was never polluted by foot of herd  thrice and four times did the unhappy orlando read these words trying always but in vain to disbelieve what he saw every time he read they appeared plainer and plainer and every time did a cold hand seem to be wringing the heart in his bosom at length he remained with his eyes fixed on the stone seeing nothing more not even the stone itself he felt as if his wits were leaving him so abandoned did he seem of all comfort let those imagine what he felt who have experienced the same emotionswho know by their own sufferings that this is the grief which surpasses all other griefs his head had fallen on his bosom his look was deprived of all confidence he could not even speak or shed a tear his impetuous grief remained within him by reason of his impetuositylike water which attempts to rush out of the narrownecked bottle but which is so compressed as it comes that it scarcely issues drop by drop  again he endeavoured to disbelieve his eyesto conclude that somebody had wished to calumniate his mistress and drive her lover mad and so had done his best to imitate her handwriting with these sorry attempts at consolation he again took horse the sun having now given way to the moon and so rode a little onward till he beheld smoke rising out of the tops of the trees and heard the barking of dogs and the lowing of cattle by these signs he knew that he was approaching a village he entered it and going into the first house he came to gave his horse to the care of a youth and was disarmed and had his spurs of gold taken off and so went into a room that was shewn him without demanding either meat or drink so entirely was he filled with his sorrow  now it happened that this was the very cottage into which medoro had been carried out of the wood by the loving angelica there he had been cured of his woundsthere he had been loved and made happyand there wherever the county orlando turned his eyes he beheld the detested writing on the walls the windows the doors he made no inquiries about it of the people of the house he still dreaded to render the certainty clearer than he would fain suppose it  but the cowardice availed him nothing for the host seeing him unhappy and thinking to cheer him came in as he was getting into bed and opened on the subject of his own accord it was a story be told to every body who came and he was accustomed to have it admired so with little preface he related all the particulars to his new guesthow the youth had been left for dead on the field and how the lady had found him and had him brought to the cottageand how she fell in love with him as he grew welland how she could be content with nothing but marrying him though she was daughter of the greatest king of the east and a queen herself at the conclusion of his narrative the good man produced the bracelet which had been given him by angelica as evidence of the truth of all that he had been saying  this was the final stroke the last fatal blow given to the poor hopes of orlando by the executioner love he tried to conceal his misery but it was no longer to be repressed so finding the tears rush into his eyes he desired to be alone as soon as the man had retired he let them flow in passion and agony in vain he attempted to rest much less to sleep every part of the bed appeared to be made of stones and thorns  at length it occurred to him that most likely they had slept in that very bed he rose instantly as if he had been lying on a serpent the bed the house the herdsman every thing about the place gave him such horror and detestation that without waiting for dawn or the light of moon he dressed himself and went forth and took his horse from the stable and galloped onwards into the middle of the woods there as soon as he found himself in the solitude he opened all the floodgates of his grief and gave way to cries and outcries  but he still rode on day and night did orlando ride on weeping and lamenting he avoided towns and cities and made his bed on the hard earth and wondered at himself that he could weep so long  these thought he are no tears that are thus poured forth they are life itself the fountains of vitality and i am weeping and dying both these are no sighs that i thus eternally exhale nature could not supply them they are love himself storming in my heart and at once consuming me and keeping me alive with his miraculous fires no moreno more am i the man i seem he that was orlando is dead and buried his ungrateful mistress has slain him i am but the soul divided from his bodydoomed to wander here in this misery an example to those that put their trust in love  for the wits of the county orlando were going and he wandered all night round and round in the wood till he came back to the grotto where medoro had written his triumphant verses madness then indeed fell upon him every particle of his being seemed torn up with rage and fury and he drew his mighty sword and hewed the grotto and the writing till the words flew in pieces to the heavens woe to every spot in the place in which were written the names of angelica and medoro woe to the place itself never again did it afford refuge from the heat of day to sheep or shepherd for not a particle of it remained as it was with arm and sword orlando defaced it all the clear and gentle fountain included he hacked and hewed it inside and out and cut down the branches of the trees that hung over it and tore away the ivy and the vine and rooted up great bits of earth and stone and filled the sweet water with the rubbish so that it was never clear and sweet again and at the end of his toil not having satisfied or being able to satisfy his soul with the excess of his violence he cast himself on the ground in rage and disdain and lay groaning towards the heavens  on the ground orlando threw himself and on the ground he remained his eyes fixed on heaven his lips closed in dumbness and thus he continued for the space of three days and three nights till his frenzy had mounted to such a pitch that it turned against himself he then arose in fury and tore off mail and breastplate and every particle of clothing from his body till humanity was degraded in his heroical person and he became naked as the beasts of the field in this condition and his wits quite gone sword was forgotten as well as shield and helm and he tore up firtree and ash and began running through the woods the shepherds hearing the cries of the strong man and the crashing of the boughs came hastening from all quarters to know what it was but when he saw them he gave them chase and smote to death those whom he reached till the whole country was up in arms though to no purpose for they were seized with such terror that while they threatened and closed after him they avoided him he entered cottages and tore away the food from the tables and ran up the craggy hills and down into the valleys and chased beasts as well as men tearing the fawn and the goat to pieces and stuffing their flesh into his stomach with fierce will  raging and scouring onwards in this manner he arrived one day at a bridge over a torrent on which the fierce rodomont had fixed himself for the purpose of throwing any one that attempted to pass it into the water it was a very narrow bridge with scarcely room for two horses but orlando took no heed of its narrowness he dashed right forwards against man and steed and forced the champion to wrestle with him on foot and winding himself about him with hideous strength he leaped backwards with him into the torrent where he left him and so mounted the opposite bank and again rushed over the country a more terrible bridge than this was in his wayeven a precipitous pass of frightful height over a valley but still he scoured onwards throwing over it the agonised passengers that dared in their ignorance of his strength to oppose him and so always rushing and raging he came down the mountains by the seaside to barcelona where he cast his eyes on the sands and thought in his idiot mind to make himself a house in them for coolness and repose and so he grubbed up the sand and laid himself down in it and this was the terrible madman whom angelica and medoro saw looking at them as they were approaching the city  neither of them knew him nor did he know angelica but with an idiot laugh he looked at her beauty and liked her and came horribly towards her to carry her away shrieking she put spurs to her horse and fled and medoro in a fury came after the pursuer and smote him but to no purpose the great madman turned round and smote the others horse to the ground and so renewed his chase after angelica who suddenly regained enough of her wits to recollect the enchanted ring instantly she put it into her lips and disappeared but in her hurry she fell from her palfrey and orlando forgot her in the instant and mounting the poor beast dashed off with it over the country till it died and so at last after many dreadful adventures by flood and field he came running into a camp full of his brother paladins who recognised him with tears and all joining their forces succeeded in pulling him down and binding him though not without many wounds and by the help of these friends and the special grace of the apostle st john as will be told in another place the wits of the champion of the church were restored and he became ashamed of that passion for an infidel beauty which the heavenly powers had thus resolved to punish  but angelica and medoro pursued the rest of their journey in peace and took ship on the coast of spain for india and there she crowned her bridegroom king of cathay the description of orlandos jealousy and growing madness is reckoned one of the finest things in italian poetry and very fine it surely isas strong as the heros strength and sensitive as the heart of man the circumstances are heightened one after the other with the utmost art as well as nature there is a scriptural awfulness in the account of the heros becoming naked and the violent result is tremendous i have not followed orlando into his feats of ultrasupernatural strength the reader requires to be prepared for them by the whole poem nor are they necessary i think to the production of the best effect perhaps would hurt it in an age unaccustomed to the old romances                                       footnote 1 see p 58 of the present volume

heroine of the warlike part of the poem and the beauty from whose marriage with ruggiero is to spring the house of este nor without her appearance at this moment as panizzi has shewn vol i p cvi could a variety of subsequent events have taken place necessary to the greatest interests of the story all the previous passages in romance about amazons are nothing compared with this flash of a thunderbolt  footnote 6 from bayard old french baycolour  footnote 7 his famous sword vide p 48  footnote 8 to richness and rarity how much is added by remoteness it adds distance to the other difficulties of procuring it  footnote 9    ecco apparir lo smisurato mostro   mezo ascoso ne londa e mezo sorto   come sospinto suol da borca o dostro   venir lungo navilio a pigliar porto

a galley with sharp beak comes fierce   ploughing the waves with many a sweating oar  ovid is brisker and more obviously to the purpose but ariosto gives the ponderousness and dreary triumph of the monster the comparison of the fly and the mastiff is in the same higher and more epic taste the classical reader need not be told that the whole ensuing passage as far as the combat is concerned is imitated from ovids story of perseus and andromeda  footnote 10      sul lito un bosco era di querce ombrose   dove ogn or par che filomena piagna   chin mezo avea un pratel con una fonte      e

a charm beyond painting he has put into it with his nightingales and then what figures besides a knight on a winged steed descending with a naked beauty into a meadow in the thick of woods with here and there a solitary mountain the mountains make no formal circle they keep their separate distances with their various intervals of light and shade and what a heart of solitude is given to the meadow by the loneliness of these its waiters aloof  footnote 11 nothing can be more perfectly wrought up than this sudden change of circumstances  footnote 12 to feel the complete force of this picture a reader should have been in the south and beheld the like sudden apparitions at open windows of ladies looking forth in dresses of beautiful colours and with faces the most interesting i remember a vision of this sort at carrara on a bright but not too hot day i fancied that the marble mountains there cooled it it resembled one of titians women with its broad shoulders and boddice and sleeves differently coloured from the petticoat and seemed literally framed in the unsashed window but i am digressing  footnote 13 ariosto elsewhere represents him as the handsomest man in the world saying of him in a line that has become famous    natura il fece e poi roppe la stampa                                                   canto x st 84    nature made him and then broke the mould  the word is

character of astolfo p 41  footnote 14    come orsa che lalpestre cacciatore     ne la pietrosa tana assalita abbia   sta sopra i figli con incerto core     e freme in suono di pieta e di rabbia   ira

old stony den and dare and goad   stands oer her children with uncertain heart     and roars for rage and sorrow in one mood   anger impels her and her natural part     to use her nails and bathe her lips in blood   love melts her and for all her angry roar   holds back her eyes to look on those she bore  this stanza in ariosto has become famous as a beautiful transcript of a beautiful passage in statius which indeed it surpasses in style but not in feeling especially when we consider with whom the comparison originates    ut lea quam saevo foetam pressere cubili     venantes numidae natos erecta superstat   mente sub incerta torvum ac miserabile frendens     illa quidem turbare globes et frangere morsu   tela queat sed prolis amor crudelia vincit     pectora et in media catulos

critic quoted by panizzi says that the way in which cloridan exposes himself to the enemy is inferior to the latin poets famous    me me adsum qui feci in me convertite ferrum    me me tis i who did the deed slay me  and the reader will agree with panizzi that he is right the circumstance also of euryaluss bequeathing his aged mother to the care of his prince in case he fails in his enterprise is very touching and the main honour both of the invention of the whole episode and its particulars remains with virgil on the other hand the enterprise of the friends in the italian poet which is that of burying their dead master and not merely of communicating with an absent general is more affecting though it may be less patriotic the inability of zerbino to kill him when he looked on his face is extremely so and as panizzi has shewn the adventure is made of importance to the whole story of the poem and is not simply an episode like that in the Æneid it serves too in a very particular manner to introduce medoro worthily to the affection of angelica for mere female though she be we should hardly have gone along with her passion as we do in a poem of any seriousness had it been founded merely on his beauty  footnote 16 canto xix st 34 c all the world have felt this to be a true picture of first love the inscription may be said to be that of every other pair of lovers that ever existed who knew how to write their names how musical too are the words angelica and medoro boiardo invented the one ariosto found the match for it one has no end to the pleasure of repeating them all hail to the moment when i first became aware of their existence more than fifty years ago in the house of the gentle artist benjamin west let the reader indulge me with this recollection i sighed with pleasure to look on them at that time i sigh now with far more pleasure than pain to look back on them for they never come across me but with delight and poetry is a world in which nothing beautiful ever thoroughly forsakes us  footnote 17    scritti qual con carbone e qual con gesso                                                     canto xxiii st 106  ariosto did not mind soiling the beautiful

of which overthrew all such abodes and put to flight whoever heard it and so the house of atlantes vanished and the enchanter fled and the paladin took possession of the griffinhorse and rode away with it on farther adventures  one of these was the deliverance of senapus king of ethiopia from the visitation of the dreadful harpies of old who came infesting his table as they did those of Æneas and phineus astolfo drove them with his horse towards the sources of the river nile in the mountains of the moon and pursued them with the hippogriff till they entered a great cavern which by the dreadful cries and lamentings that issued from the depths within it the paladin discovered to be the entrance from earth to hell  the daring englishman whose curiosity was excited resolved to penetrate to the regions of darkness what have i to fear thought he the horn will assist me if i want it ill drive the triplemouthed dog out of the way and put pluto and satan to flight2  astolfo tied the hippogriff to a tree and pushed forward in spite of a smoke that grew thicker and thicker offending his eyes and nostrils it became however so exceedingly heavy and noisome that he found it would be impossible to complete his enterprise still he pushed forward as far as he could especially as he began to discern in the darkness something that appeared to stir with an involuntary motion it looked like a dead body which has hung up many days in the rain and sun and is waved unsteadily by the wind it turned out to be a condemned spirit in this first threshold of hell sentenced there with thousands of others for having been cruel and false in love her name was lydia and she had been princess of the country so called3 anaxarete was among them who for her hardheartedness became a stone and daphne who now discovered how she had erred in making apollo run so much and multitudes of other women but a far greater number of menmen being worthier of punishment in offences of love because women are proner to believe theseus and jason were among them and amnon the abuser of tamar and he that disturbed the old kingdom of latinus4  astolfo would fain have gone deeper into the jaws of hell but the smoke grew so thick and palpable it was impossible to move a step farther turning about therefore he regained the entrance and having refreshed himself in a fountain hard by and remounted the hippogriff felt an inclination to ascend as high as he possibly could in the air the excessive loftiness of the mountain above the cavern made him think that its top could be at no great distance from the region of the moon and accordingly he pushed his horse upwards and rose and rose till at length he found himself on its tableland it exhibited a region of celestial beauty the flowers were like beds of precious stones for colour and brightness the grass if you could have brought any to earth would have been found to surpass emeralds and the trees whose leaves were no less beautiful were in fruit and flower at once birds of as many colours were singing in the branches the murmuring rivulets and dumb lakes were more limpid than crystal a sweet air was for ever stirring which reduced the warmth to a gentle temperature and every breath of it brought an odour from flowers fruittrees and herbage all at once which nourished the soul with sweetness5  in the middle of this lonely plain was a palace radiant as fire astolfo rode his horse round about it constantly admiring all he saw and filled with increasing astonishment for he found that the dwelling was thirty miles in circuit and composed of one entire carbuncle lucid and vermilion what became of the boasted wonders of the world before this the world itself in the comparison appeared but a lump of brute and fetid matter6  as the paladin approached the vestibule he was met by a venerable old man clad in a white gown and red mantle whose beard descended on his bosom and whose aspect announced him as one of the elect of paradise it was st john the evangelist who lived in that mansion with enoch and elijah the only three mortals who never tasted death for the place as the saint informed him was the terrestrial paradise and the inhabitants were to live there till the angelical trumpet announced the coming of christ on the white cloud the paladin he said had been allowed to visit it by the favour of god for the purpose of fetching away to earth the lost wits of orlando which the champion of the church had been deprived of for loving a pagan and which had been attracted out of his brains to the neighbouring sphere the moon  accordingly after the new friends had spent two days in discourse and meals had been served up consisting of fruit so exquisite that the paladin could not help thinking our first parents had some excuse for eating it7 the evangelist when the moon arose took him into the car which had borne elijah to heaven and four horses redder than fire conveyed them to the lunar world  the mortal visitant was amazed to see in the moon a world resembling his own full of wood and water and containing even cities and castles though of a different sort from ours it was strange to find a sphere so large which had seemed so petty afar off and no less strange was it to look down on the world he had left and be compelled to knit his brows and look sharply before he could well discern it for it happened at the time to want light8  but his guide did not leave him much time to look about him he conducted him with due speed into a valley that contained in one miraculous collection whatsoever had been lost or wasted on earth i do not speak only says the poet of riches and dominions and such like gratuities of fortune but of things also which fortune can neither grant nor resume much fame is there which time has withdrawninfinite prayers and vows which are made to god almighty by us poor sinners there lie the tears and the sighs of lovers the hours lost in pastimes the leisures of the dull and the intentions of the lazy as to desires they are so numerous that they shadow the whole place astolfo went round among the different heaps asking what they were his eyes were first struck with a huge one of bladders which seemed to contain mighty sounds and the voices of multitudes these he found were the assyrian and persian monarchies together with those of greece and lydia9 one heap was nothing but hooks of silver and gold which were the presents it seems made to patrons and great men in hopes of a return another consisted of snares in the shape of garlands the manufacture of parasites others were verses in praise of great lords all made of crickets which had burst themselves with singing chains of gold he saw there which were pretended and unhappy lovematches and eagles claws which were deputed authorities and pairs of bellows which were princes favours and overturned cities and treasuries being treasons and conspiracies and serpents with female faces that were coiners and thieves and all sorts of broken bottles which were services rendered in miserable courts a great heap of overturned soup10 he found to be alms to the poor which had been delayed till the givers death he then came to a great mount of flowers which once had a sweet smell but now a most rank one this with submission was the present which the emperor constantine made to good pope sylvester11 heaps of twigs he saw next set with birdlime which dear ladies are your charms in short there was no end to what he saw thousands and thousands would not complete the list every thing was there which was to be met with on earth except folly in the raw material for that is never exported12  there he beheld some of his own lost time and deeds and yet if nobody had been with him to make him aware of them never would he have recognised them as his13  they then arrived at something which none of us ever prayed god to bestow for we fancy we possess it in superabundance yet here it was in greater quantities than any thing else in the placei mean sense it was a subtle fluid apt to evaporate if not kept closely and here accordingly it was kept in vials of greater or less size the greatest of them all was inscribed with the following words the sense of orlando others in like manner exhibited the names of the proper possessors and among them the frankhearted paladin beheld the greater portion of his own but what more astonished him was to see multitudes of the vials almost full to the stopper which bore the names of men whom he had supposed to enjoy their senses in perfection some had lost them for love others for glory others for riches others for hopes from great men others for stupid conjurers for jewels for paintings for all sorts of whims there was a heap belonging to sophists and astrologers and a still greater to poets14  astolfo with leave of the writer of the dark apocalypse took possession of his own he had but to uncork it and set it under his nose and the wit shot up to its place at once turpin acknowledges that the paladin for a long time afterwards led the life of a sage man till unfortunately a mistake which he made lost him his brains a second time15  the evangelist now presented him with the vial containing the wits of orlando and the travellers quitted the vale of lost treasure before they returned to earth however the good saint chewed his guest other curiosities and favoured him with many a sage remark particularly on the subject of poets and the neglect of them by courts he shewed him how foolish it was in princes and other great men not to make friends of those who can immortalise them and observed with singular indulgence that crimes themselves might be no hindrance to a good name with posterity if the poet were but feed well enough for spices to embalm the criminal he instanced the cases of homer and virgil  you are not to take for granted said he that Æneas was so pious as fame reports him or achilles and hector so brave thousands and thousands of warriors have excelled them but their descendents bestowed fine houses and estates on great writers and it is from their honoured pages that all the glory has proceeded augustus was no such religious or clement prince as the trumpet of virgil has proclaimed him it was his good taste in poetry that got him pardoned his iniquitous proscription nero himself might have fared as well as augustus had he possessed as much wit heaven and earth might have been his enemies to no purpose had he known how to keep friends with good authors homer makes the greeks victorious the trojans a poor set and penelope undergo a thousand wrongs rather than be unfaithful to her husband and yet if you would have the real truth of the matter the greeks were beaten and the trojans the conquerors and penelope was a  16 see on the other hand what infamy has become the portion of dido she was honest to her hearts core and yet because virgil was no friend of hers she is looked upon as a baggage  be not surprised concluded the good saint if i have expressed myself with warmth on this subject i love writers and look upon their cause as my own for i was a writer myself when i lived among you and i succeeded so well in the vocation that time and death will never prevail against me just therefore is it that i should be thankful to my beloved master who procured me so great a lot i grieve for writers who have fallen on evil timesmen that with pale and hungry faces find the doors of courtesy closed against all their hardships this is the reason there are so few poets now and why nobody cares to study why should he study the very beasts abandon places where there is nothing to feed them  at these words the eyes of the blessed old man grew so inflamed with anger that they sparkled like two fires but he presently suppressed what he felt and turning with a sage and gracious smile to the paladin prepared to accompany him back to earth with his wonted serenity  he accordingly did so in the sacred car and astolfo after receiving his gentle benediction descended on his hippogriff from the mountain and joining the delighted paladins with the vial his wits were restored as you have heard to the noble orlando  the figure which is here cut by st john gives this remarkable satire a most remarkable close his association of himself with the fraternity of authors was thought a little strong by ariostos contemporaries the lesson read to the house of este is obvious and could hardly have been pleasant to men reputed to be such criminals themselves nor can ariosto in this passage be reckoned a very flattering or conscientious pleader for his brotherpoets resentment and a good jest seem to have conspired to make him forget what was due to himself  the original of st johns remarks about augustus and the ancient poets must not be omitted it is exquisite of its kind both in matter and style voltaire has quoted it somewhere with rapture    non fu sì santo nè benigno augusto     come la tuba di virgilio suona   laver avuto in poesia buon gusto     la proscrizion iniqua gli perdona   nessun sapria se neron fosse ingiusto     nè sua fama saria forse men buona   avesse avuto e terra e ciel nimici   se gli scrittor sapea tenersi amici    omero agamennon vittorioso     e fe i trojan parer vili et inerti   e che penelopea fida al suo sposo     da i prochi mille oltraggi avea sofferti   e se tu vuoi che l ver non ti sia ascoso     tutta al contrario listoria converti   che i greci rotti e che troia vittrice   e che penelopea fu meretrice    da laltra parte odi che fama lascia     elissa chebbe il cor tanto pudico   che riputata viene una bagascia     solo perchè maron non le fu amico                                                      canto xxxv st 26                                        footnote 1 see p 192  footnote 2 ariosto is here imitating pulci and bearding dante see vol i p 336  footnote 3 i know of no story of a cruel lydia but the poets own mistress of that name whom i take to be the lady here shadowed forth see life p 114  footnote 4 the story of anaxarete is in ovid lib xiv every body knows that of daphne who made apollo as ariosto says run so much correr tanto theseus and jason are in hell as deserters of ariadne and medea amnon for the atrocity recorded in the bible 2 samuel chap xiii and Æneas for interfering with turnus and lavinia and taking possession of places he had no right to it is delightful to see the great generous poet going upon grounds of reason and justice in the teeth of the trumpedup rights of the pious Æneas that shabby deserter of dido and canting prototype of augustus he turns the tables also with brave candour upon the tyrannical claims of the stronger sex to privileges which they deny the other and says that there are more faithless men in hell than faithless women which if personal infidelity sends people there most undoubtedly is the case beyond all comparison  footnote 5 che di soävità lalma notriva is beautiful but the passage as a whole is not well imitated from the terrestrial paradise of dante it is not bad in itself but it is very inferior to the one that suggested it see vol i p 210 c ariostos terrestrial paradise was at home among the friends who loved him and whom he made happy  footnote 6 this is better and the house made of one jewel thirty miles in circuit is an extravagance that becomes reasonable on reflection affording a just idea of what might be looked for among the endless planetary wonders of nature which confound all our relative ideas of size and splendour the lucid vermilion of a structure so enormous and under a sun so pure presents a gorgeous spectacle to the imagination dante himself if he could have forgiven the poet his animal spirits and views of the moon so different from his own might have stood in admiration before an abode at once so lustrous and so vast  footnote 7    de frutti a lui del paradiso diero     di tal sapor cha suo giudizio sanza   scusa non sono i due primi parenti     se pur quei fur si poco ubbidienti                                                   canto xxxiv st 60  footnote 8 modern astronomers differ very much both with dantes and ariostos moon nor do the argent fields of milton appear better placed in our mysterious satellite with its noatmosphere and nowater and its tremendous precipices it is to be hoped and believed that knowledge will be best for us all in the end for it is not always so by the way it displaces beautiful ignorances  footnote 9 very fine and scornful i think this mighty monarchies reduced to actual bladders which little too as they were contained big sounds  footnote 10 such i suppose as was given at conventgates  footnote 11 the pretended gift of the palace of st john lateran the foundation of the popes temporal sovereignty this famous passage was quoted and translated by milton    di varii fiori ad on gran monte passa   chebbe già buon odore or putia forte   questo era il dono se però dir lece   che constantino al buon silvestro fece                                                        canto xxxiv st 80    the lines were not so bold in the first edition they stood thus    ad un monte di rose e gigli passa   chebbe già buon odore or putia forte   chera corrotto e da giovanni intese   che fu un gran don chun gran signor mal spese  he came to a mount of lilies and roses that once had a sweet smell but now stank with corruption and be understood from john that it was a great gift which a great lord ill expended  the change of these lines to the stronger ones in the third edition as they now stand served to occasion a charge against ariosto of having got his privilege of publication from the court of rome for passages which never existed and which he afterwards basely introduced but as panizzi observes the third edition had a privilege also so that the papacy put its hand as it were to these very lines this is remarkable and doubtless it would not have occurred in some other ages the spanish inquisition for instance erased it though the holy brotherhood found no fault with the story of giocondo    footnote 12 sol la pazzia non vè poca nè assai   che sta quà giù nè se ne parte mai                                                                st 78  footnote 13 part of this very striking passage is well translated by  harrington    he saw some of his own lost time and deeds   and yet he knew them not to be his own   i have heard these lines more than once repeated with touching earnestness by charles lamb  footnote 14 readers need not have the points of this exquisite satire pointed out to them in noticing it i only mean to enjoy it in their companyparticularly the passage about the men accounted wisest and the emphatic i mean sense io dico il senno  footnote 15 admirable lesson to frailty  footnote 16 i do not feel warranted in injuring the strength of the term here made use of by the indignant apostle and yet am withheld from giving it in all its force by the delicacy real or false of the times i must therefore leave it to be supplied by the reader according to the requirements of his own feelings   ariodante and ginevra  argument  the duke of albany pretending to be in love with a damsel in the service of ginevra princess of scotland but desiring to marry the princess herself and not being able to compass his design by reason of her being in love with a gentleman from italy named ariodante persuades the damsel in his revenge to personate ginevra in a balcony at night and so make her lover believe that she is false ariodante deceived disappears from court news is brought of his death and his brother lurcanio publicly denounces ginevra who according to the laws of scotland is sentenced to death for her supposed lawless passion lurcanio then challenges the unknown paramour for the dukes face had not been discerned in the balcony and ariodante who is not dead is fighting him in disguise when the paladin rinaldo comes up discloses the whole affair and slays the deceiver   ariodante and ginevra1  charlemagne had suffered a great defeat at paris and the paladin rinaldo was sent across the channel to ask succours of the king of england but a tempest arose ere he could reach the coast and drove him northwards upon that of scotland where he found himself in the caledonian forest a place famous of old for knightly adventure many a clash of arms had been heard in its shady recessesmany great things had been done there by knights from all quarters particularly the tristans and the launcelots and the gawains and others of the round table of king arthur  rinaldo bidding the ship await him at the town of berwick plunged into the forest with no other companion than his horse bayardo seeking the wildest paths he could find in the hope of some strange adventure2 he put up for the first day at an abbey which was accustomed to entertain the knights and ladies that journeyed that way and after availing himself of its hospitality he inquired of the abbot and his monks if they could direct him where to find what he looked for they said that plenty of adventures were to be met with in the forest but that for the most part they remained in as much obscurity as the spots in which they occurred it would be more becoming his valour they thought to exert itself where it would not be hidden and they concluded with telling him of one of the noblest chances for renown that ever awaited a sword the daughter of their king was in need of a defender against a certain baron of the name of lurcanio who sought to deprive her both of life and reputation he accused her of having been found in the arms of a lover without the license of the priest which by the laws of scotland was a crime only to be expiated at the stake unless a champion could be found to disprove the charge before the end of a month unfortunately the month had nearly expired and no champion yet made his appearance though the king had promised his daughters hand to anybody of noble blood who should establish her innocence and the saddest part of the thing was that she was accounted innocent by all the world and a very pattern of modesty  while this horrible story was being told him the paladin fell into a profound state of thought after remaining silent for a little while at the close of it he looked up and said a lady then it seems is condemned to death for having been too kind to one lover while thousands of our sex are playing the gallant with whomsoever they please and not only go unpunished for it but are admired perish such infamous injustice the man was a madman who made such a law and they are little better who maintain it i hope in god to be able to shew them their error  the good monks agreed that their ancestors were very unwise to make such a law and kings very wrong who could but would not put an end to it so when the morning came they speeded their guest on his noble purpose of fighting in the ladys behalf a guide from the abbey took him a short cut through the forest towards the place where the matter was to be decided but before they arrived they heard cries of distress in a dark quarter of the forest and turning their horses thither to see what it was they observed a damsel between two vagabonds who were standing over her with drawn swords the moment the wretches saw the new comer they fled and rinaldo after reassuring the damsel and requesting to know what had brought her to a pass so dreadful made his guide take her up on his horse behind him in order that they might lose no more time the damsel who was very beautiful could not speak at first for the horror of what she had expected to undergo but on rinaldos repeating his request she at length found words and in a voice of great humility began to relate her story  but before she begins the poet interferes with an impatient remarkof all the creatures in existence cries he whether they be tame or wild whether they are in a state of peace or of war man is the only one that lays violent hands on the female of his species the bear offers no injury to his the lioness is safe by the side of the lion the heifer has no fear of the horns of the bull what pest of abomination what fury from hell has come to disturb in this respect the bosom of human kind husband and wife deafen one another with injurious speeches tear one anothers faces bathe the genial bed with tears nay some times with bloodshed in my eyes the man who can allow himself to give a blow to a woman or to hurt even a hair of her head is a violater of nature and a rebel against god but to poison her to strangle her to take the soul out of her body with a knifehe that can do that never will i believe him to be a man at all but a fiend out of hell with a mans face3  such must have been the two villains who fled at the sight of rinaldo and who had brought the woman into this dark spot to stifle her testimony for ever  but to return to what she was going to say  you are to know sir she began that i have been from my childhood in the service of the kings daughter the princess ginevra i grew up with her i was held in bonour and i led a happy life till it pleased the cruel passion of love to envy me my condition and make me think that there was no being on earth to be compared to the duke of albany he pretended to love me so much that in return i loved him with all my heart unable by degrees to refuse him anything i let him into the palace at night nay into the room which of all others the princess regarded as most exclusively her own for there she kept her jewels and there she was accustomed to sleep during inclement states of the weather it communicated with the other sleepingroom by a covered gallery which looked out to some lonely ruins and nobody ever passed that way day or night  our intercourse continued for several months and finding that i placed all my happiness in obliging him he ventured to disclose to me one day a design he had upon the princesss hand nay did not blush to ask my assistance in furthering it judge how i set his wishes above my own when i confess that i undertook to do so it is true his rank was nearer to the princesss than to mine and he pretended that he sought the alliance merely on that account protesting that he should love me more than ever and that ginevra would be little better than his wife in name but god knows i did it wholly out of the excess of my desire to please him  day and night i exerted all my endeavours to recommend him to the princess heaven is my witness that i did it in real earnest however wrong it was but my labour was to no purpose for she was in love herself she returned in all its warmth the passion of a most accomplished and valiant gentleman who had come into scotland with a younger brother from italy and who had made himself such a favourite with every body my lover included that the king himself had bestowed on him titles and estates and put him on a footing with the greatest lords of the land  unfortunately the princess not only turned a deaf ear to all i said in the dukes favour but grew to dislike him in proportion to my recommendation so that finding there was no likelihood of his success his own love was secretly turned into hate and rage he studied little as i dreamt he could be so base how he could best destroy her prospect of happiness he resorted for this purpose to a most crafty expedient which i poor fool took for nothing but what he feigned it to be he pretended that a whim had come into his head for seeming to prosper in his suit out of a kind of revenge for his not being able to do so in reality and in order to indulge this whim he requested me to dress myself in the identical clothes which the princess put off when she went to bed that night and then to appear in them at my usual post in the balcony and so let down the ladder as though i were her very self and receive him into my arms  i did all that he desired mad fool that i was and out of the part which i played has come all this mischief i have intimated to you that the duke and ariodante for such was the others name had been good friends before ginevra preferred hint to my false lover pretending therefore to be still his friend and entering on the subject of a passion which he said he had long entertained for her he expressed his wonder at finding it interfered with by so noble a gentleman especially as it was returned by the princess with a fervour of which the other if he pleased might have ocular testimony greatly astonished at this news was ariodante he had received all the proofs of his mistresss affection which it was possible for chaste love to bestow and with the greatest scorn refused to believe it but as the duke with the air of a man who could not help the melancholy communication quietly persisted in his story the unhappy lover found himself compelled at any rate to let him afford those proofs of her infidelity which he asserted to be in his power the consequence was that ariodante came with his brother to the ruins i spoke of and there the two were posted on the night when i played my unhappy part in the balcony he brought lurcanio with him that was the brothers name because he suspected that the duke had a design on his life not conceiving what he alleged against ginevra to be possible lurcanio however was not in the secret of his brothers engagement with the princess it had been disclosed hitherto neither to him nor to any one the lady not yet having chosen to divulge it to the king himself ariodante therefore requested his brother to take his station at a little distance out of sight of the palace and not to come to him unless he should call otherwise my dear brother concluded he stir not a step if you love me doubt me not said lurcanio and with these words the latter entrenched himself in his post  ariodante now stood by himself gazing at the balconythe only person visible at that moment in all the place in a few minutes the duke of albany appeared below it making the signal to which i had been accustomed and then i in my horrible folly became visible to the eyes of both and let down the ladder  meantime lurcanio beginning to be very uneasy at the mysterious situation in which he found himself and to have the most alarming fears for his brother had cautiously picked his way after him at a little distance so that he also though still hidden in the shade of the lonely houses perceived all that was going on  i was dressed as i had undertaken to be in the identical clothes which the princess had put off that night and as i was not unlike her in air and figure and wore the golden net with red tassels peculiar to ladies of the royal family and the two brothers besides were at quite sufficient distance to be deceived i was taken by both of them for her very self the duke impatiently mounted the ladder i received him as impatiently in my arms and circumstances though from very different feelings rendered the caresses that passed between us of unusual ardour  you may imagine the grief of ariodante it rose at once to despair he did not call out so that had not his brother followed him still worse would have ensued than did for he drew his sword and was proceeding in distraction to fall upon it when lurcanio rushed in and stopped him miserable brother exclaimed he are you mad would you die for a woman like this you see what a wretch she is i discern all your case at once and thank god have preserved you to turn your sword where it ought to be turned against the defender of such a pattern of infamy  ariodante put up his sword and suffered himself to be led away by his brother he even pretended in a little while to be able to review his condition calmly but not the less had he secretly resolved to perish next day he disappeared nobody knew whither and about eight days afterwards news was secretly brought to ginevra by a pilgrim that he had thrown himself from a headland into the sea  i met him by chance said the pilgrim and we happened to be standing on the top of the headland conversing when he cried out to me relate to the princess what you beheld on parting from me and add that the cause of it was my having seen too much happy had it been for me had i been blind and with these words concluded the pilgrim he leaped into the sea below and was instantly buried beneath it  the princess turned as pale as death at this story and for a while remained stupefied but alas what a scene was it my fate to witness when she found herself in her chamber at night able to give way to her misery she tore her clothes and her very flesh and her beautiful hair and kept repeating the last words of her lover with amazement and despair  the disappearance of ariodante and a rumour which transpired of his having slain himself on account of some hidden anguish surprised and afflicted the whole court but his brother lurcanio evinced more and more his impatience at it and let fall the most terrible words at length he entered the court when the king was holding one of his fullest assemblies and laid open as he thought the whole matter setting forth how his unhappy brother had secretly but honourably loved the princess how she had professed to love him in return and how she had grossly deceived him and played him impudently false before his own eyes he concluded with calling upon her unknown paramour to come forth and shew reasons against him with his sword why she ought not to die  i need not tell you what the king suffered at hearing this strange and terrible recital he lost no time in sharply investigating the truth of the allegation and for this purpose among other proceedings he sent for the ladies of his daughters chamber you may judge sirespecially as i blush to say it i still loved the duke of albanythat i could not await an examination like that i hastened to meet the duke who was as anxious to get me out of the way as i was to go and to this end professing the greatest zeal for my security he commissioned two men to convey me secretly to a fortress he possessed in this forest tis at no great distance from the place where heaven sent you to my deliverance you saw sir how little those wretches intended to take me anywhere except to my grave and by this you may judge of the agonies and shame i have endured in knowing what a dupe i have been to one of the cruelest of men but thus it is that love treats his most faithful servants  the damsel here concluded her story and the paladin rejoicing at having become possessed of all that was required to establish the falsehood of the duke proceeded with her on his road to st andrews where the lists had been set up for the determination of the question the king and his court were anxiously praying at that instant for the arrival of some champion to fight with the dreaded lurcanio for the month as i have stated was nearly expired and this terrible brother appeared to have the business all his own way so that the stake was soon to be looked for at which the hapless ginevra was to die  fast and eagerly the paladin rode for st andrews with his squire and the trembling damsel who was now agitated for new reasons though the knight gave her assurances of his protection they were not far from the city when they found people talking of a champion who had certainly arrived but whose name was unknown and his face constantly concealed by his visor even his own squire it seems did not know him for the man had but lately been taken into his service rinaldo as soon as he entered the city left the damsel in a place of security and then spurred his horse to the scene of action when he found the accuser and the champion in the very midst of the fight the paladin whose horse notwithstanding the noise of the combat had been heard coming like a tempest and whose sudden and heroical appearance turned all eyes towards him rode straight to the royal canopy and begging the king to stop the combat disclosed the whole state of the matter to the enchantment of all present except the duke of albany for the villain himself was on horseback there in state as grand constable and had been feasting his miserable soul with the hope of seeing ginevra condemned the combatants were soon changed instead of lurcanio and the unknown champion whom the new comer had taken care to extol for his generosity it was the paladin and the duke that were opposed and horribly did the latters heart fail him but he had no remedy fight he must rinaldo desirous to make short work of him took his station with fierce delight and at the third sound of the trumpets the duke was forced to couch his spear and meet him at full charge sheer went the paladins ashen staff through the false bosom sending the villain to the earth eight feet beyond the saddle the conqueror dismounted instantly and unlacing the mans helmet enabled the king to hear his dying confession which he had hardly finished when life forsook him rinaldo then took off his own helmet and the king who had seen the great paladin before and who felt more rejoiced at his daughters deliverance than if he had lost and regained his crown lifted up his hands to heaven and thanked god for having honoured her innocence with so illustrious a defender  the other champion who in the mean time had been looking on through the eyelets of his visor was now entreated to disclose his own face he did so with peculiar emotion and king and all recognised with transport the face of the loved and as it was supposed lost ariodante the pilgrim however had told no falsehood the lover had indeed thrown himself into the sea and disappeared from the mans eyes but as oftener happens than people suppose the death which was desired when not present became hated when it was so and ariodante lover as he was rising at a little distance struck out lustily for the shore and reached it4 he felt even a secret contempt for his attempt to kill himself yet putting up at an hermitage became interested in the reports concerning the princess whose sorrow flattered and whose danger though he could not cease to think her guilty afflicted him he grew exasperated with the very brother he loved when he found that lurcanio pursued her thus to the death and on all these accounts he made his appearance at the place of combat to fight him though not to slay his purpose was to seek his own death he concluded that ginevra would then see who it was that had really loved her while his brother would mourn the rashness which made him pursue the destruction of a woman guilty she is thought he but no such guilt can deserve so cruel a punishment besides i could not bear that she should die before me she is still the woman i love still the idol of my thoughts right or wrong i must die in her behalf  with this intention he purchased a suit of black armour and obtained a squire unknown in those parts and so made his appearance in the lists what ensued there i need not repeat but the king was so charmed with the issue of the whole business with the resuscitation of the favourite whom he thought dead and the restoration of the more than life of his beloved daughter that to the joy of all scotland and at the special instance of the great paladin he made the two lovers happy without delay and the bride brought her husband for dowry the title and estates of the man who had wronged him   footnote 1 the main point of this story the personation of ginevra by one of her ladies has been repeated by many writersamong others by shakspeare in much ado about nothing the circumstance is said to have actually occurred in ferrara and in ariostos own time was ariosto himself a party ariodante almost includes his name and it is certain that he was once in love with a lady of the name of ginevra  footnote 2 rinaldo is an ambassador and one upon very urgent business yet he halts by the way in search of adventures this has been said to be in the true taste of knighterrantry and in one respect it is so we may imagine however that the ship is windbound and that he meant to return to it on change of weather the caledonian forest it is to be observed is close at hand  footnote 3 all honour and glory to the manly and loving poet  lavezzuola says panizzi doubts the conjugal concord of beasts more particularly of bears ho letto presso degno autore un orso aver cavato un occhio ad un orsa con la zampa i have read in an author worthy of credit that a bear once deprived a shebear of an eye with a blow of his paw the reader may choose between ariosto and this nameless author which of them is to be believed i of course am for my poetvol i p 84 i am afraid however that lavezzuola is right even turtledoves are said not to be always the models of tenderness they are supposed to be brutes have even devoured their offspring the violence is most probably owing at least in excessive cases to some unnatural condition of circumstances  footnote 4 this is quite in ariostos high and bold taste for truth under all circumstances a less great and unmisgiving poet would have had the lover picked up by a fisherman   suspicion 1  it is impossible to conceive a nobler thing in the world than a just princea thoroughly good man who shuns no part of the burden of his duty though it bend him double who loves and cares for his people as a father does for his children and who is almost incessantly occupied in their welfare very seldom for his own  such a man puts himself in front of dangers and difficulties in order that he may be a shield to others for he is not a mercenary taking care of none but himself when he sees the wolf coming he is the right good shepherd staking his own life in that of his flock and knowing the faces of every one of them just as they do his own  such princes in times of old were saturn hercules jupiter and othersmen who reigned gently yet firmly equal to all chances that came and worthy of the divine honours that awaited them for mankind could not believe that they quitted the world in the same way as other men they thought they must be taken up into heaven to be the lords of demigods  when the prince is good the subjects are good for they always imitate their masters or at least if the subjects cannot attain to this height of virtue they at least are not as bad as they would be otherwise and at all events public decency is observed oh blessed kingdoms that are governed by such hearts and oh most miserable ones that are at the mercy of a man without justicea fellowcreature without feelings  our italy is full of such who will have their reward from the pens of posterity greater wretches never appeared in the shapes of neros and caligulas or any other such monsters let them have been who they might i enter not into particulars for it is always better to speak of the dead than the living but i must say that agrigentum never fared worse under phalaris nor syracuse under dionysius nor thebes in the hand of the bloody tyrant eteocles even though all those wretches were villains by whose orders every day without fault without even charge men were sent by dozens to the scaffold or into hopeless exile  but they are not without torments of their own at the core of their own hearts there stands an inflicter of no less agonies there he stands every day and every momentone who was born of the same mother with wrath and cruelty and rapine and who never ceased tormenting his infant brethren before they saw the light his name is suspicion2  yes suspicionthe cruelest visitation the worst evil spirit and pest that ever haunted with its poisonous whisper the mind of human being this is their tormentor by excellence he does not trouble the poor and lowly he agonises the brain in the proud heads of those whom fortune has put over the heads of their fellowcreatures well may the man hug himself on his freedom who fears nobody because nobody hates him tyrants are in perpetual fear they never cease thinking of the mortal revenge taken upon tormentors of their species openly or in secret the fear which all men feel of the one single wretch makes the single wretch afraid of every soul among them  hear a story of one of these miserables which whatever you may think of it is true to the letter such letter at all events as is written upon the hearts of his race he was one of the first who took to the custom of wearing beards for great as he was he had a fear of the race of barbers he built a tower in his palace guarded by deep ditches and thick walls it had but one drawbridge and one baywindow there was no other opening so that the very light of day had scarcely admittance or the inmates a place to breathe at in this tower he slept and it was his wifes business to put a ladder down for him when he came in a dog kept watch at the drawbridge and except the dog and the wife not a soul was to be discerned about the place yet he had such little trust in her that he always sent spies to look about the room before he withdrew for the night  of what use was it all the woman herself killed him with his own sword and his soul went straight to hell  rhadamanthus the judge there thrust him under the boiling lake but was astonished to find that he betrayed no symptoms of anguish he did not weep and howl as the rest did or cry out i burn i burn he evinced so little suffering that rhadamanthus said i must put this fellow into other quarters accordingly he sent him into the lowest pit where the torments are beyond all others  nevertheless even here he seemed to be under no distress at length they asked him the reason the wretch then candidly acknowledged that hell itself had no torments for him compared with those which suspicion had given him on earth  the sages of hell laid their heads together at this news amelioration of his lot on the part of a sinner was not to be thought of in a place of eternal punishment so they called a parliament together the result of which was an unanimous conclusion that the man should be sent back to earth and consigned to the torments of suspicion for ever  he went and the earthly fiend reentered his being anew with a subtlety so incorporate that their two natures were identified and he became suspicion itself fruits are thus engrafted on wild stocks one colour thus becomes the parent of many when the painter takes a portion of this and of that from his palette in order to imitate flesh  the new being took up his abode on a rock by the seashore a thousand feet high girt all about with mouldering crags which threatened every instant to fall it had a fortress on the top the approach to which was by seven drawbridges and seven gates each locked up more strongly than the other and here now this moment constantly thinking death is upon him suspicion lives in everlasting terror he is alone he is ever watching he cries out from the battlements to see that the guards are awake below and never does he sleep day or night he wears mail upon mail and mail again and feels the less safe the more he puts on and is always altering and strengthening everything on gate and on barricado and on ditch and on wall and do whatever he will he never seems to have done enough                                       great poet and good man ariosto your terrors are better than dantes for they warn as far as warning can do good and they neither afflict humanity nor degrade god  spenser has imitated this sublime piece of pleasantry for by a curious intermixture of all which the mind can experience from such a fiction pleasant it is in the midst of its sublimitylaughable with satirical archness as well as grand and terrible in the climax the transformation in spenser is from a jealous man into jealousy his wife has gone to live with the satyrs and a villain has stolen his money the husband in order to persuade his wife to return steals into the horde of the satyrs by mixing with their flock of goatsas norandino does in a passage imitated from homer by ariosto the wife flatly refuses to do any such thing and the poor wretch is obliged to steal out again    so soon as he the prison door did pass     he ran as fast as both his feet could bear     and never looked who behind him was     nor scarcely who before like as a bear     that creeping close among the hives to rear     an honeycomb the wakeful dogs espy     and him assailing sore his carcass tear     that hardly he away with life does fly   nor stays till safe himself he see from jeopardy      nor stayd he till be came unto the place     where late his treasure he entombèd had     where when he found it not for trompart base     had it purloined for his master bad     with extreme fury he became quite mad     and ran awayran with himself away     that who so strangely had him seen bestad     with upstart hair and staring eyes dismay   from limbolake him late escapèd sure would say      high over hills and over dales he fled     as if the wind him on his wings had borne     nor bank nor bush could stay him when he sped     his nimble feet as treading still on thorn     grief and despite and jealousy and scorn     did all the way him follow hard behind     and he himself himself loathd so forlorn     so shamefully forlorn of womankind   that as a snake still lurkèd in his wounded mind      still fled he forward looking backward still     nor stayd his flight nor fearful agony     till that he came unto a rocky hill     over the sea suspended dreadfully     that living creature it would terrify     to look adown or upward to the height     from thence he threw himself dispiteously     all desperate of his foredamnèd spright   that seemd no help for him was left in living sight      but through long anguish and selfmurdring thought     he was so wasted and forpinèd quite     that all his substance was consumed to nought     and nothing left but like an airy sprite     that on the rocks he fell so flit and light     that he thereby received no hurt at all     but chancèd on a craggy cliff to light     whence he with crooked claws so long did crawl   that at the last he found a cave with entrance small      into the same he creeps and thenceforth there     resolved to build his baleful mansion     in dreary darkness and continual fear     of that rocks fall which ever and anon     threats with huge ruin him to fall upon     that he dare never sleep but that one eye     still ope he keeps for that occasion     nor ever rests he in tranquillity   the roaring billows beat his bower so boisterously      nor ever is he wont on aught to feed     but toads and frogs his pasture poisonous     which in his cold complexion do breed     a filthy blood or humour rancorous     matter of doubt and dread suspicious     that doth with cureless care consume the heart     corrupts the stomach with gall vicious     crosscuts the liver with internal smart   and doth transfix the soul with deaths eternal dart      yet can he never die but dying lives     and doth himself with sorrow new sustain     that death and life at once unto him gives     and painful pleasure turns to pleasing pain     there dwells he ever miserable swain     hateful both to himself and every wight     where he through privy grief and horror vain     is waxen so deformed that he has quite   forgot he was a man and jealousy is hight  spensers picture is more subtly wrought and imaginative than ariostos but it removes the man farther from ourselves except under very special circumstances indeed it might be taken rather for a picture of hypochondria than jealousy and under that aspect is very appalling but nothing under more obvious circumstances comes so dreadfully home to us as ariostos poor wretch feeling himself the less safe the more he puts on and calling out dismally from his tower a thousand feet high to the watchers and warders below to see that all is secure   footnote 1 this daring and grand apologue is not in the furioso but in a poem which ariosto left unfinished and which goes under the name of the five cantos the fragment though bearing marks of want of correction is in some respects a beautiful and altogether a curious one especially as it seems to have been written after the furioso for it touches in a remarkable manner on several points of morals and politics and contains an extravagance wilder than any thing in pulcia whale inhabited by knights it was most likely for these reasons that his friend bembo and others advised him to suppress it was it written in his youth the apologue itself is not one of the least daring attacks on the borgias and such scoundrels who had just then afflicted italy  did ariosto by the way omit macchiavelli in his list of the friends who hailed the close of his great poem from not knowing what to make of his book entitled the prince it has perplexed all the world to this day and is not unlikely to have made a particularly unpleasant impression on a mind at once so candid and humane as ariostos  footnote 2 a tremendous fancy this last    sta for la pena de la qual dicea     che nacque quando la bruttira nacque   la crudeltade e la rapina rea     e quantunque in un ventre con for giacque   di tormentarle mai non rimanea   isabella1  rodomont king of algiers was the fiercest of all the enemies of christendom not out of love for his own faith for he had no piety but out of hatred to those that opposed him he had now quarrelled however with his friends too he had been rejected by a lady in favour of the tartar king mandricardo and mortified by the publicity of the rejection before his own lord paramount agramante the leader of the infidel armies he could not bear the rejection he could not bear the sanction of it by his liege lord he resolved to quit the scene of warfare and return to africa and in the course of his journey thither he had come into the south of france where observing a sequestered spot that suited his humour be changed his mind as to going home and persuaded himself he could live in it for the rest of his life he accordingly took up his abode with his attendants in a chapel which had been deserted by its clergy during the rage of war  this vehement personage was standing one morning at the door of the chapel in a state of unusual thoughtfulness when he beheld coming towards him through a path in the green meadow before it a lady of a lovely aspect accompanied by a bearded monk they were followed by something covered with black which they were bringing along on a great horse  alas the lady was the widow of zerbino the scottish prince who spared the life of medoro and who now himself lay dead under that pall he had expired in her arms from wounds inflicted during a combat with mandricardo and she had been thrown by the loss into such anguish of mind that she would have died on his sword but for the intervention of the hermit now with her who persuaded her to devote the rest of her days to god in a nunnery she had now come into provence with the good man for that purpose and to bury the corpse of her husband in the chapel which they were approaching  though the lady seemed lost in grief and was very pale and had her hair all about the ears and though she did nothing but weep and lament and looked in all respects quite borne down with her misery nevertheless she was still so beautiful that love and grace appeared to be indestructible in her aspect the moment the saracen beheld her he dismissed from his mind all the determinations he had made to hate and detest    the gentle bevy that adorns the world  he was bent solely on obtaining the new angel before him she seemed precisely the sort of person to make him forget the one that had rejected him advancing therefore to meet her without delay he begged in as gentle a manner as he could assume to know the cause of her sorrow  the lady with all the candour of wretchedness explained who she was and how precious a burden she was conveying to its last home and the resolution she had taken to withdraw from a vain world into the service of god the proud pagan who had no belief in a god much less any respect for restraints or fidelities of what kind soever forgot his assumed gravity when he heard this determination and laughed outright at the simplicity of such a proceeding he pronounced it in his peremptory way to be foolish and frivolous compared it with the miser who in burying a treasure does good neither to himself nor any one else and said that lions and serpents might indeed be shut up in cages but not things lovely and innocent  the monk overhearing these observations thought it his duty to interfere he calmly opposed all which the other asserted and then proceeded to set forth a repast of spiritual consolation not at all to the saracens taste the fierce warrior interrupted the preacher several times told him that he had nothing to do with the lady and that the sooner he returned to his cell the better but the hermit nothing daunted went on with his advice till his antagonist lost all patience he laid hands on his sacred person seized him by the beard tore away as much of it as he grasped and at length worked himself up into such a pitch of fury that he griped the good mans throat with all the force of a pair of pincers and swinging him twice or thrice round as one might a dog flung him off the headland into the sea  what became of the poor creature i cannot say reports are various some tell us that he was found on the rocks dashed all to pieces so that you could not distinguish foot from head others that he fell into the sea at the distance of three miles and perished in consequence of not knowing how to swim in spite of the prayers and tears that he addressed to heaven others again affirm that a saint came and assisted him and drew him to shore before peoples eyes i must leave the reader to adopt which of these accounts he looks upon as the most probable  the pagan as soon as he had thus disposed of the garrulous hermit turned towards isabella for that was the ladys name and with a face some what less disturbed began to talk to her in the common language of gallantry protesting that she was his life and soul and that he should not know what to do without her for the sweetness of her appearance mollified even him and indeed with all his violence he would rather have possessed her by fair means than by foul he therefore flattered himself that by a little hypocritical attention he should dispose her to return his inclinations  on the other hand the poor disconsolate creature who in a country unknown to her and a place so remote from help felt like a mouse in the cats claws began casting in her mind by what possible contrivance she could escape from such a wretch with honour she had made up her mind to perish by her own hand rather than be faithless however unwillingly to the dear husband that had died in her arms but the question was how she could protect herself from the pagans violence before she had secured the means of so doing for his manner was becoming very impatient and his speeches every moment less and less civil  at length an expedient occurred to her she told him that if he would promise to respect her virtue she would put him in possession of a secret that would redound far more to his honour and glory than any wrong which he could inflict on the innocent she conjured him not to throw away the satisfaction he would experience all the rest of his life from the consciousness of having done right for the sake of injuring one unhappy creature there were thousands of her sex she observed with cheerful as well as beautiful faces who might rejoice in his affection whereas the secret she spoke of was known to scarcely a soul on earth but herself  she then told him the secret which consisted in the preparation of a certain herb boiled with ivy and rue over a fire of cypresswood and squeezed into a cup by hands that had never done harm the juice thus obtained if applied fresh every month had the virtue of rendering bodies invulnerable isabella said she had seen the herb in the neighbourhood as she came along and that she would not only make the preparation forthwith but let its effects be proved on her own person she only stipulated that the receiver of the gift should swear not to offend her purity in deed or word  the fierce infidel took the oath immediately it delighted him to think that he should be enabled to have his fill of war and slaughter for nothing and the oath was the more easy to him inasmuch as he had no intention of keeping it  the poor isabella went into the fields to look for her miraculous herb still however attended by the saracen who would not let her go out of his sight she soon found it and then going with him into his house passed the rest of the day and the whole night in preparing the mixture with busy solemnityrodomont always remaining with her  the room became so hot and close with the fire of cypresswood that the saracen contrary to his law and indeed to his habits indulged himself in drinking and the consequence was that as soon as it was morning isabella lost no time in proving to him the success of her operations now she said you shall be convinced how much in earnest i have been you shall see all the virtue of this blessed preparation i have only to bathe myself thus over the head and neck and if you then strike me with all your force as though you intended to cut off my headwhich you must do in good earnestyou will see the wonderful result  with a glad and rejoicing countenance the paragon of virtue held forth her neck to the sword and the bestial pagan giving way to his natural violence and heated perhaps beyond all thought of a suspicion with his wine dealt it so fierce a blow that the head leaped from the shoulders  thrice it bounded on the ground where it fell and a clear voice was heard to come out of it calling the name of zerbino doubtless in joy of the rare way which its owner had found of escaping from the saracen  o blessed soul that heldest thy virtue and thy fidelity dearer to thee than life and youth go in peace then soul blessed and beautiful if any words of mine could have force in them sufficient to endure so long hard would i labour to give them all the worthiness that art can bestow so that the world might rejoice in thy name for thousands and thousands of years go in peace and take thy seat in the skies and be an example to womankind of faith beyond all weakness   footnote 1 the ingenious martyrdom in this story which has been told by other writers of fiction is taken from an alleged fact related in barbaros treatise de re uxoriait is said indeed to have been actually resorted to more than once and possibly may have been so even from a knowledge of it for what is more natural with heroical minds than that the like outrages should produce the like virtues but the colouring of ariostos narration is peculiarly his own and his apostrophe at the close beautiful    tasso  critical notice of his life and genius  critical notice  of  tassos life and genius 1  the romantic poetry of italy having risen to its highest and apparently its most lawless pitch in the orlando furioso a reaction took place in the next age in the jerusalem deliveredit did not hurt however the popularity of ariosto it only increased the number of poetic readers and under the auspices or rather the control of a lutherfearing church produced if not as classical a work as it claimed to be or one in the true sense of the word as catholic as its predecessor yet certainly a far more roman catholic and at the same time very delightful fiction the circle of fabulous narrative was thus completed and a link formed though in a very gentle and qualified manner both with dantes theocracy and the obvious regularity of the aeneid the oldest romance of italy  the author of this epic of the crusades was of a family so noble and so widely diffused that under the patronage of the emperors and the italian princes it flourished in a very remarkable manner not only in its own country but in flanders germany and spain there was a tasso once in england ambassador of philip the second another like cervantes distinguished himself at the battle of lepanto and a third gave rise to the sovereign german house of tour and taxis taxus is the latin of tasso the latin word like the italian means both a badger and a yewtree and the family in general appear to have taken it in the former sense the animal is in their coat of arms but the poet or his immediate relatives preferred being more romantically shadowed forth by the yewtree the parent stock of the race was at bergamo in lombardy and here was born the father of tasso himself a poet of celebrity though his fame has been eclipsed by that of his son  bernardo tasso author of many elegant lyrics of some volumes of letters not uninteresting but too florid and of the amadigi an epic romance now little read was a man of small property very honest and goodhearted but restless ambitious and with a turn for expense beyond his means he attached himself to various princes with little ultimate advantage particularly to the unfortunate sanseverino prince of salerno whom he faithfully served for many years the prince had a high sense of his worth and would probably have settled him in the wealth and honours he was qualified to adorn but for those spanish oppressions in the history of naples which ended in the ruin of both master and servant bernardo however had one happy interval of prosperity and during this at the age of fortysix he married porzia di rossi a young lady of a rich and noble family with a claim to a handsome dowry he spent some delightful years with her at sorrento a spot so charming as to have been considered the habitation of the sirens and here in the midst of his orangetrees his verses and the breezes of an aromatic coast he had three children the eldest of whom was a daughter named cornelia and the youngest the author of the jerusalem delivered the other child died young the house distinguished by the poets birth was restored from a dilapidated condition by order of joseph bonaparte when king of naples and is now an hotel  torquato tasso was born march the 11th 1544 nine years after the death of ariosto who was intimate with his father he was very devoutly brought up and grew so tall and became so premature a scholar that at nine he tells us he might have been taken for a boy of twelve at eleven in consequence of the misfortunes of his father who had been exiled with the prince of salerno he was forced to part from his mother who remained at home to look after a dowry which she never received her brothers deprived her of it and in two years time she died bernardo thought by poison twentyfour years afterwards her illustrious son in the midst of his own misfortunes remembered with sighs the tears with which the kisses of his poor mother were bathed when she was forced to let him go2  the little torquato following as he says like another ascanius the footsteps of his wandering father joined bernardo in rome after two years study in that city partly under an old priest who lived with them the vicissitudes of the fathers lot took away the son first to bergamo among his relations and then to pesaro in the duchy of urbino where his education was associated for nearly two years with that of the young prince afterwards duke francesco maria the second della rovere who retained a regard for him through life in 1559 the boy joined his father in venice where the latter had been appointed secretary to the academy but next year he was withdrawn from these pleasing varieties of scene by the parental delusion so common in the history of men of lettersthe study of the law which bernardo intended him to pursue henceforth in the city of padua he accordingly arrived in padua at the age of sixteen and a half and fulfilled his legal destiny by writing the poem of rinaldo which was published in the course of less than two years at venice the goodnatured and poetic father convinced by this specimen of jurisprudence how useless it was to thwart the hereditary passion permitted him to devote himself wholly to literature which he therefore went to study in the university of bologna and there at the early age of nineteen he began his jerusalem delivered that is to say he planned it and wrote three cantos several of the stanzas of which he retained when the poem was matured he quitted bologna however in a fit of indignation at being accused of the authorship of a satire and after visiting some friends at castelvetro and correggio returned to padua on the invitation of his friend scipio gonzaga afterwards cardinal who wished him to become a member of an academy he had instituted called the etereiethereals here he studied his favourite philosopher plato and composed three discourses on heroic poetry dedicated to his friend he now paid a visit to his father in mantua where the unsettled man had become secretary to the duke and here it is said he fell in love with a young lady of a distinguished family whose name was laura peperara but this did not hinder him from returning to his paduan studies in which he spent nearly the whole of the following year he was then informed that the cardinal of este to whom he had dedicated his rinaldo and with whom interest had been made for the purpose had appointed him one of his attendants and that he was expected at ferrara by the 1st of december returning to mantua in order to prepare for this appointment with his father he was seized with a dangerous illness which detained him there nearly a twelvemonth longer on his recovery he hastened to ferrara and arrived in that city on the last day of october 1565 the first of many years of glory and misery  the cardinal of este was the brother of the reigning duke of ferrara alfonso the second grandson of the alfonso of ariosto it is curious to see the two most celebrated romantic poets of italy thrown into unfortunate connexion with two princes of the same house and the same respective ranks tassos cardinal however though the poet lost his favour and though very little is known about him left no such bad reputation behind him as ippolito it was in the service of the duke that the poet experienced his sufferings  this prince who was haughty ostentatious and quarrelsome was at the time of the strangers arrival rehearsing the shows and tournaments intended to welcome his bride the sister of the emperor maximilian the second she was his second wife the first was a daughter of the rival house of tuscany which he detested and the marriage had not been happy the new consort arrived in the course of a few weeks entering the city in great pomp and for a time all went happily with the young poet he was in a state of ecstasy with the beauty and grandeur he beheld around himobtained the favourable notice of the dukes two sisters and the duke himselfwent on with his jerusalem delivered which in spite of the presence of ariostos memory he was resolved to load with praises of the house of este and in this tumult of pride and expectation he beheld the duke like one of the heroes of his poem set out to assist the emperor against the turks at the head of three hundred gentlemen armed at all points and mantled in variouscoloured velvets embroidered with gold  to complete the young poets happiness or commence his disappointments he fell in love notwithstanding the goddess he had left in mantua with the beautiful lucrezia bendidio who does not seem however to have loved in return for she became the wife of a macchiavelli among his rivals was guarini who afterwards emulated him in pastoral poetry and who accused him on this occasion of courting two ladies at once  guarinis accusation has been supposed to refer to the dukes sister leonora whose name has become so romantically mixed up with the poets biography but the latest inquiries render it probable that the allusion was to laura peperara3 the young poet however who had not escaped the influence of the free manners of italy and whose senses and vanity may hitherto have been more interested than his heart rhymed and flattered on all sides of him not of course omitting the charms of princesses in order to win the admiration of the ladies in a body he sustained for three days in public after the fashion of the times fifty amorous conclusions that is to say affirmations on the subject of love doubtless to the equal delight of his fair auditors and himself and the creation of a good deal of jealousy and illwill on the part of such persons of his own sex as had not wit or spirits enough for the display of so much logic and lovemaking  in 1569 the death of his father who had been made governor of ostiglia by the duke of mantua cost the loving son a fit of illness but the continuation of his jerusalem an oration spoken at the opening of the ferrarese academy the marriage of leonoras sister lucrezia with the prince of urbino and the society of leonora herself who led the retired life of a person in delicate health and was fond of the company of men of letters helped to divert him from melancholy recollections and a journey to france at the close of the year following took him into scenes that were not only totally new but otherwise highly interesting to the singer of godfrey of boulogne the occasion of it was a visit of the cardinal his master to the court of his relative charles the ninth it is supposed that his eminence went to confer with the king on matters relative to the disputes which not long afterwards occasioned the detestable massacre of st bartholomew  before his departure tasso put into the hands of one of his friends a document which as it is very curious and serves to illustrate perhaps more than one cause of his misfortunes is here given entire  memorial left by tasso on his departure to france  since life is frail and it may please almighty god to dispose of me otherwise in this my journey to france it is requested of signor ercole rondinelli that he will in that case undertake the management of the following concerns  in the first place with regard to my compositions it is my wish that all my lovesonnets and madrigals should be collected and published but with regard to those whether amatory or otherwise which i have written for any friend my request is that they should be buried with myself save only the one commencing or che laura mia dolce altrove spira i wish the publication of the oration spoken in ferrara at the opening of the academy of the four books on heroic poetry of the six last cantos of the godfrey the jerusalem and of those stanzas of the two first which shall seem least imperfect all these compositions however are to be submitted to the review and consideration of signor scipio gonzaga of signor domenico veniero and of signor battista guarini who i persuade myself will not refuse this trouble when they consider the zealous friendship i have entertained for themselves  let them be informed too that it was my intention that they should cut and hew without mercy whatever should appear to them defective or superfluous with regard to additions or changes i should wish them to proceed more cautiously since after all the poem would remain imperfect as to my other compositions should there be any which to the aforesaid signor rondinelli and the other gentlemen might seem not unworthy of publication let them be disposed of according to their pleasure  in respect to my property i wish that such part of it as i have pledged to abram  for twentyfive lire and seven pieces of arras which are likewise in pledge to signor ascanio for thirteen scudi together with whatever i have in this house should be sold and that the overplus of the proceeds should go to defray the expense of the following epitaph to be inscribed on a monument to my father whose body is in st polo and should any impediment take place in these matters i entreat signor ercole to have recourse to the favour of the most excellent madame leonora whose liberality i confide in for my sake  i torquato tasso have written this ferrara 1570  i shall have occasion to recur to this document by and by i will merely observe for the present that the marks in it both of imprudence in moneymatters and confidence in the goodwill of a princess are very striking abram and signor ascanio were both jews the pieces of arras belonged to his father and probably this was an additional reason why the affectionate son wished the proceeds to defray the expense of the epitaph the epitaph recorded his fathers poetry stateservices and vicissitudes of fortune  tasso was introduced to the french king as the poet of a french hero and of a catholic victory and his reception was so favourable particularly as the wretched charles the victim of his mothers bigotry had himself no mean poetic feeling that with a rash mixture of simplicity and selfreliance respect makes me unwilling to call it selfimportance the poet expressed an impolitic amount of astonishment at the favour shewn at court to the hugonotslittle suspecting the horrible design it covered he shortly afterwards broke with his master the cardinal and it is supposed that this unseasonable escape of zeal was the cause he himself appears to have thought so4 perhaps the cardinal only wanted to get the imprudent poet back to italy for on tassos return to ferrara he was not only received into the service of the duke with a salary of some fifteen golden scudi amonth but told that he was exempted from any particular duty and might attend in peace to his studies balzac affirms that while tasso was at the court of france he was so poor as to beg a crown from a friend and that when he left it he had the same coat on his back that he came in5 the assertions of a professed wit and hyperbolist are not to be taken for granted yet it is difficult to say to what shifts improvidence may not be reduced  the singer of the house of este would now it might have been supposed be happy he had leisure he had money he had the worldly honours that he was fond of he occupied himself in perfecting the jerusalem and he wrote his beautiful pastoral the aminta which was performed before the duke and his court to the delight of the brilliant assembly the dukes sister lucrezia princess of urbino who was a special friend of the poet sent for him to read it to her at pesaro and in the course of the ensuing carnival it was performed with similar applause at the court of her fatherinlaw the poet had been as much enchanted by the spectacle which the audience at ferrara presented to his eyes as the audience with the loves and graces with which he enriched their stage the shepherd thyrsis by whom he meant himself reflected it back upon them in a passage of the performance it is worth while dwelling on this passage a little because it exhibits a brief interval of happiness in the authors life and also chews us what he had already begun to think of courts at the moment he was praising them but he ingeniously contrives to put the praise in his own mouth and the blame in anothers the shepherds friend mopsus by whom tasso is thought to have meant speroni had warned him against going to court    però figlio   va su lavviso c    therefore my son take my advice avoid   the places where thou seest much drapery   colours and gold and plumes and heraldries   and such newfanglements but

gold  in the summer of 1574 the duke of ferrara went to venice to pay his respects to the successor of charles the ninth henry the third then on his way to france from his kingdom of poland tasso went with the duke and is understood to have taken the opportunity of looking for a printer of his jerusalem which was now almost finished writers were anxious to publish in that crafty city because its government would give no security of profit to books printed elsewhere alfonso who was in mourning for henrys brother and to whom mourning itself only suggested a new occasion of pomp and vanity took with him to this interview five hundred ferrarese gentlemen all dressed in long black cloaks who walking about venice says a reporter by twos and threes wonderfully impressed the inhabitants with their gravity and magnificence9 the mourners feasted however and tasso had a quartan fever which delayed the completion of the jerusalem till next year this was at length effected and now once more it might have been thought that the writer would have reposed on his laurels  but tasso had already begun to experience the uneasiness attending superiority and unfortunately the strength of his mind was not equal to that of his genius he was of an ultrasensitive temperament and subject to depressing fits of sickness he could not calmly bear envy sarcasm exasperated and hostile criticism afflicted him the seeds of a suspicious temper were nourished by prosperity itself the author of the armida and the jerusalem began to think the attentions he received unequal to his merits while with a sort of hysterical mixture of demand for applause and provocation of censure he not only condescended to read his poems in manuscript wherever he went but in order to secure the goodwill of the papal licenser he transmitted it for revisal to rome where it was mercilessly criticised for the space of two years by the bigots and hypocrites of a court which luther had rendered a very different one from that in the time of ariosto  this new source of chagrin exasperated the complexional restlessness which now made our author think that he should be more easy any where than in ferrara perhaps more able to communicate with and convince his critics and unfortunately he permitted himself to descend to a weakness the most fatal of all others to a mind naturally exalted and ingenuous perhaps it was one of the main causes of all which he suffered indeed he himself attributed his misfortunes to irresolution what i mean in the present instance was that he did not disdain to adopt underhand measures he skewed a face of satisfaction with alfonso at the moment that he was taking steps to exchange his court for another he wrote for that purpose to his friend scipio gonzaga now a prelate at the court of rome earnestly begging him at the same time not to commit him in their correspondence and scipio who was one of his kindest and most indulgent friends and who doubtless saw that the duke of ferrara and his poet were not of dispositions to accord did all he could to procure him an appointment with one of the family of the medici  most unhappily for this speculation and perhaps even the goodnatured gonzaga took a little more pleasure in it on that account alfonso inherited all the detestation of his house for that lucky race and it is remarkable that the same jealousies which hindered ariostos advancement with the medici were still more fatal to the hopes of tasso for they served to plunge him into the deepest adversity in vain he had warnings given him both friendly and hostile the princess now duchess of urbino who was his particular friend strongly cautioned him against the temptation of going away she said he was watched he himself thought his letters were opened and probably they were they certainly were at a subsequent period tasso however persisted and went to rome scipio gonzaga introduced him to cardinal ferdinand de medici afterwards grand duke of tuscany and ferdinand made him offers of protection so handsome that they excited his suspicion the selftormenting poet thought they savoured more of hatred to the este family than honour to himself10 he did not accept them he did nothing at rome but make friends in order to perplex them listen to his critics in order to worry himself and perform acts of piety in the churches by way of shewing that the lovescenes in the jerusalem were innocent for the bigots had begun to find something very questionable in mixing up so much love with war the bloodshed they had no objection to the love bearded their prejudices and excited their envy  tasso returned to ferrara and endeavoured to solace himself with eulogising two fair strangers who had arrived at alfonsos courteleonora sanvitale who had been newly married to the count of scandiano a tiene not a boiardo whose line was extinct and barbara sanseverino countess of sala her motherinlaw the motherinlaw who was a junolike beauty wore her hair in the form of a crown the still more beautiful daughterinlaw had an under lip such as anacreon or sir john suckling would have admiredpouting and provokingprokaloymenon phileama tasso wrote verses on them both but particularly to the lip and this countess of scandiano is the second out of the three leonoras with whom tasso was said by his friend manso to have been in love the third it is now ascertained never existed and his lovemaking to the new or second leonora goes to shew how little of real passion there was in the praises of the first the princess leonora or probably of any lady at court he even professed love as a forlorn hope to the countesss waitingmaid yet these gallantries of sonnets are exalted into bewilderments of the heart  his restlessness returning the poet now condescended to craft a second time expecting to meet with a refusal and so to be afforded a pretext for quitting ferrara he applied for the vacant office of historiographer it was granted him and he then disgusted the medici by pleading an unlookedfor engagement which he could only reconcile to his applications for their favour by renouncing his claim to be believed if he could have deceived others why might he not have deceived them  all the lurking weakness of the poets temperament began to display itself at this juncture his perplexity excited him to a degree of irritability bordering on delirium and circumstances conspired to increase it he had lent an acquaintance the key of his rooms at court for the purpose he tells us of accommodating some intrigue and he suspected this person of opening cabinets containing his papers remonstrating with him one day in the court of the palace either on that or some other account the man gave him the lie he received in return a blow on the face and is said by tasso to have brought a set of his kinsmen to assassinate him all of whom the heroical poet immediately put to flight at one time he suspected the duke of jealousy respecting the dedication of his poem and at another of a wish to burn it he suspected his servants he became suspicious of the truth of his friend gonzaga he doubted even whether some praises addressed to him by orazio ariosto the nephew of the great poet which one would have thought would have been to him a consummation of bliss were not intended to mystify and hurt him at length he fancied that his persecutors had accused him of heresy to the inquisition and as he had gone through the metaphysical doubts common with most men of reflection respecting points of faith and the mysteries of creation he feared that some indiscreet words had escaped him giving colour to the charge he thus beheld enemies all around him he dreaded stabbing and poison and one day in some paroxysm of rage or horror how occasioned it is not known ran with a knife or dagger at one of the servants of the duchess of urbino in her own chamber  alfonso upon this apparently in the mildest and most reasonable manner directed that he should be confined to his apartments and put into the hands of the physician these unfortunate events took place in the summer of 1577 and in the poets thirtythird year  tasso shewed so much affliction at this treatment and at the same time bore it so patiently that the duke took him to his beautiful country seat of belriguardo where in one of his accounts of the matter the poet says that he treated him as a brother but in another he accuses him of having taken pains to make him criminate himself and confess certain matters real or supposed the nature of which is a puzzle with posterity some are of opinion and this is the prevailing one that he was found guilty of being in love with the princess leonora perhaps of being loved by herself others think the love out of the question and that the duke was concerned at nothing but his endeavouring to transfer his services and his poetic reputation into the hands of the medici others see in the dukes conduct nothing but that of a good master interesting himself in the welfare of an afflicted servant  it is certain that alfonso did all he could to prevent the surreptitious printing of the jerusalem delivered in various towns of italy the dread of which had much afflicted the poet and he also endeavoured though in vain to ease his mind on the subject of the inquisition for these facts are attested by statepapers and other documents not dependent either on the testimony of third persons or the partial representations of the sufferer but tasso felt so uneasy at belriguardo that he requested leave to retire a while into a convent he remained there several days apparently so much to his satisfaction that he wrote to the duke to say that it was his intention to become a friar and yet he had no sooner got into the place than he addressed a letter to the inquisition at rome beseeching it to desire permission for him to come to that city in order to clear himself from the charges of his enemies he also wrote to two other friends requesting them to further his petition and adding that the duke was enraged with him in consequence of the anger of the grand duke of tuscany who it is supposed had accused tasso of having revealed to alfonso some indecent epithet which his highness had applied to him11 these letters were undoubtedly intercepted for they were found among the secret archives of modena the only principality ultimately remaining in the este family so that agreeably to the saying of listeners hearing no good of themselves if alfonso did not know the epithet before he learnt it then the reader may conceive his feelings tasso too at the same time was plaguing him with letters to similar purpose and it is observable that while in those which he sent to rome he speaks of cosmo de medici as grand duke he takes care in the others to call him simply the duke of florence alfonso had been exasperated to the last degree at cosmos having had the epithet grand added by the pope to his ducal title and the reader may imagine the little allowance that would be made by a haughty and angry prince for the rebellious courtesy thus shewn to a detested rival tasso furthermore who had not only an infantine hatred of bitter physic but reasonably thought the fashion of the age for giving it a ridiculous one begged hard in a manner which it is humiliating to witness that he might not be drenched with medicine the duke at length forbade his writing to him any more and tasso whose fears of every kind of ill usage had been wound up to a pitch unbearable watched an opportunity when he was carelessly guarded and fled at once from the convent and ferrara  the unhappy poet selected the loneliest ways he could find and directed his course to the kingdom of naples where his sister lived he was afraid of pursuit he probably had little money and considering his ill health and his dread of the inquisition it is pitiable to think what he may have endured while picking his long way through the back states of the church and over the mountains of abruzzo as far as the gulf of naples for better security he exchanged clothes with a shepherd and as he feared even his sister at first from doubting whether she still loved him his interview with her was in all its circumstances painfully dramatic cornelia tasso now a widow with two sons was still residing at sorrento where the poet casting his eyes around him as he proceeded towards the house must have beheld with singular feelings of wretchedness the lovely spots in which he had been a happy little boy he did not announce himself at once he brought letters he said from the ladys brother and it is affecting to think that whether his sister might or might not have retained otherwise any personal recollection of him since that time for he had not seen her in the interval his disguise was completed by the alterations which sorrow had made in his appearance for at all events she did not know him she saw in him nothing but a haggard stranger who was acquainted with the writer of the letters and to whom they referred for particulars of the risk which her brother ran unless she could afford him her protection these particulars were given by the stranger with all the pathos of the real man and the loving sister fainted away on her recovery the visitor said what he could to reassure her and then by degrees discovered himself cornelia welcomed him in the tenderest manner she did all that he desired and gave out to her friends that the gentleman was a cousin from bergamo who had come to naples on family affairs  for a little while the affection of his sister and the beauty and freshness of sorrento rendered the mind of tasso more easy but his restlessness returned he feared he had mortally offended the duke of ferrara and with his wonted fluctuation of purpose he now wished to be restored to his presence for the very reason he had run away from it he did not know with what vengeance he might be pursued he wrote to the duke but received no answer the duchess of urbino was equally silent leonora alone responded but with no encouragement these appearances only made him the more anxious to dare or to propitiate his doom and he accordingly determined to put himself in the dukes hands his sister entreated him in vain to alter his resolution he quitted her before the autumn was over and proceeding to rome went directly to the house of the dukes agent there who in concert with the ferrarese ambassador gave his master advice of the circumstance gonzaga however and another good friend cardinal albano doubted whether it would be wise in the poet to return to ferrara under any circumstances they counselled him to be satisfied with being pardoned at a distance and with having his papers and other things returned to him and the two friends immediately wrote to the duke requesting as much the duke apparently acquiesced in all that was desired but he said that the illness of his sister the duchess of urbino delayed the procuration of the papers which it seems were chiefly in her hands the upshot was that the papers did not come and tasso with a mixture of rage and fear and perhaps for more reasons than he has told became uncontrollably desirous of retracing the rest of his steps to ferrara  love may have been among these reasonsprobably was though it does not follow that the passion must have been for a princess the poet now therefore petitioned to that effect and alfonso wrote again and said he might come but only on condition of his again undergoing the ducal course of medicine adding that if he did not he was to be finally expelled his highnesss territories  he was graciously receivedtoo graciously it would seem for his equanimity for it gave him such a flow of spirits that the duke appears to have thought it necessary to repress them the unhappy poet at this began to have some of his old suspicions and the unaccountable detention of his papers confirmed them he made an effort to keep the suspicions down but it was by means unfortunately of drowning them in wine and jollity and this gave him such a fit of sickness as had nearly been his death he recovered only to make a fresh stir about his papers and a still greater one about his poems in general which though his jerusalem was yet only known in manuscript and not even his aminta published he believed ought to occupy the attention of mankind people at ferrara therefore not foreseeing the respect that posterity would entertain for the poet and having no great desire perhaps to encourage a man who claimed to be a rival of their countryman ariosto now began to consider their neapolitan guest not merely an ingenious and pitiable but an overweening and tiresome enthusiast the court however still seemed to be interested in its panegyrist though tasso feared that alfonso meant to burn his jerusalem alfonso on the other hand is supposed to have feared that he would burn it himself and the ducal praises with it the papers at all events apparently including the only fair copy of the poem were constantly withheld and tasso in a new fit of despair again quitted ferrara this mystery of the papers is certainly very extraordinary  the poets first steps were to mantua where he met with no such reception as encouraged him to stay he then went to urbino but did not stop long the prince it is true was very gracious and bandages for a cautery were applied by the fair hands of his highnesss sister but though the nurse enchanted the surgery frightened him the hapless poet found himself pursued wherever he went by the tormenting beneficence of medicine he escaped and went to turin he had no passport and presented besides so miserable an appearance that the people at the gates roughly refused him admittance he was well received however at court and as he had begun to acknowledge that he was subject to humours and delusions and wrote to say as much to cardinal albano who returned him a most excellent and affecting letter full of the kindest regard and good counsel his friends entertained a hope that he would become tranquil but he disappointed them he again applied to alfonso for permission to return to ferraraagain received it though on worse than the old conditionsand again found himself in that city in the beginning of the year 1579 delighted at seeing a brilliant assemblage from all quarters of italy on occasion of a new marriage of the dukes with a princess of mantua he made up his mind to think that nothing could be denied him at such a moment by the bridegroom whom he meant to honour and glorify  alas the very circumstance to which he looked for success tended to throw him into the greatest of his calamities alfonso was to be married the day after the poets arrival he was therefore too busy to attend to him the princesses did not attend to him nobody attended to him he again applied in vain for his papers he regretted his return became anxious to be any where else thought himself not only neglected but derided and at length became excited to a pitch of frenzy he broke forth into the most unmeasured invectives against the duke even in public invoked curses on his head and that of his whole race retracted all he had ever said in the praise of any of them prince or otherwise and pronounced him and his whole court a parcel of ingrates rascals and poltroons12 the outbreak was reported to the duke and the consequence was that the poet was sent to the hospital of st anne an establishment for the reception of the poor and lunatic where he remained with the exception of a few unaccountable leavedays upwards of seven years this melancholy event happened in the march of the year 1579  tasso was stunned by this blow as much as if he had never done or suffered any thing to expect it he could at first do nothing but wonder and bewail himself and implore to be set free the duke answered that he must be cured first tasso replied by fresh entreaties the duke returned the same answers the unhappy poet had recourse to every friend prince and great man he could think of to join his entreaties he sought refuge in composition but still entreated he occasionally reproached and even bantered the duke in some of his letters to his friends all of which doubtless were opened but still he entreated flattered adored all to no purpose for seven long years and upwards in time he became subject to maniacal illusions so that if he was not actually mad before he was now considered so he was not only visited with sights and sounds such as many people have experienced whose brains have been overexcited but he fancied himself haunted by a sprite and become the sport of magicians the sprite stole his things and the magicians would not let him get well he had a vision such as benvenuto cellini had of the virgin mary in her glory and his nights were so miserable that he ate too much in order that he might sleep when he was temperate he lay awake sometimes he felt as if a horse had thrown himself on him have pity on me he says to the friend to whom he gives these affecting accounts i am miserable because the world is unjust13  the physicians advised him to leave off wine but he says he could not do that though he was content to use it in moderation in truth he required something to support him against the physicians themselves for they continued to exhaust his strength by their medicines and could not supply the want of it with air and freedom he had ringings in the ears vomits and fluxes of blood it would be ludicrous if it were not deplorably pathetic to hear so great a man in the commonest medical terms now protesting against the eternal drenches of these practitioners now humbly submitting to them and now entreating like a child that they might at least not be so bitter the physicians with the duke at their head were as mad for their rhubarbs and lancets as the quacks in molière and nothing but the very imagination that had nearly sacrificed the poets life to their ignorance could have hindered him from dashing his head against the wall and leaving them to the execrations of posterity it is the only occasion in which the noble profession of medicine has not appeared in wise and beneficent connexion with the sufferings of men of letters why did ferrara possess no brocklesby in those days no garth mead warren or southwood smith  tasso enabled himself to endure his imprisonment with composition he supported it with his poetry and his poem and what alas he had been too proud of during his liberty the praises of his admirers his genius brought him gifts from princes and some money from the booksellers it supported him even against his critics during his confinement the jerusalem delivered was first published though to his grief from a surreptitious and mutilated copy but it was followed by a storm of applause and if this was succeeded by as great a storm of objection and controversy still the healthier part of his faculties were roused and he exasperated his critics and astonished the world by shewing how coolly and learnedly the poor wild imprisoned genius could discuss the most intricate questions of poetry and philosophy the disputes excited by his poem are generally supposed to have done him harm but the conclusion appears to be ill founded they diverted his thoughts and made him conscious of his powers and his fame i doubt whether he would have been better for entire approbation it would have put him in a state of elevation unfit for what he had to endure he had found his pen his great solace and he had never employed it so well it would be incredible what a heap of things he wrote in this complicated torment of imprisonment sickness and physic if habit and mental activity had not been sufficient to account for much greater wonders his letters to his friends and others would make a goodsized volume those to his critics another sonnets and odes a third and his dialogues after the manner of plato two more perhaps a good half of all he wrote was written in this hospital of st anne and he studied as well as composed and had to read all that was written at the time pro and con in the discussions about his jerusalem which in the latest edition of his works amount to three out of six volumes octavo many of the occasions however of his poems as well as letters are most painful to think of their object having been to exchange praise for money and it is distressing in the letters to see his other little wants and the fluctuations and moods of his mind now he is angry about some book not restored or some gift promised and delayed now he is in want of some books to be lent him now of some praise to comfort him now of a little fresh linen he is very thankful for visits for respectful letters for sweetmeats and greatly puzzled to know what to do with the bad sonnets and panegyrics that are sent him they were sometimes too much even for the allowed ultra courtesies of italian acknowledgment his compliments to most people are varied with astonishing grace and ingenuity his accounts of his condition often sufficient to bring the tears into the manliest eyes and his ceaseless and vain efforts to procure his liberation mortifying when we think of himself and exasperating when we think of the petty despot who detained him in so long so degrading and so worse than useless a confinement  tasso could not always conceal his contempt of his imprisoner from the ducal servants alfonso excelled the grandiloquent poet himself in his love of pomp and worship and as he had no particular merits to warrant it his victim bantered his love of titles he says in a letter to the dukes steward if it is the pleasure of the most serene signor duke most clement and most invincible to keep me in prison may i beg that he will have the goodness to return certain little things of mine which his most invincible most clement and most serene highness has so often promised me14  but these were rare ebullitions of gaiety perhaps rather of bitter despair a playful address to a cat to lend him her eyes to write by during some hour in which he happened to be without a light for it does not appear to have been denied him may be taken as more probable evidence of a mind relieved at the moment though the necessity for the relief may have been very sad but the style in which he generally alludes to his situation is far different he continually begs his correspondents to pity him to pray for him to attribute his errors to infirmity he complains of impaired memory and acknowledges that he has become subject to the deliriums formerly attributed to him by the enemies that had helped to produce them petitioning the native city of his ancestors bergamo to intercede for him with the duke he speaks of the writer as this unhappy person and subscribes himself  most illustrious signors your affectionate servant torquato tasso a prisoner and infirm in the hospital of st anne in ferrara  in one of his addresses to alfonso he says most affectingly  i have sometimes attributed much to myself and considered myself as somebody but now seeing in how many ways imagination has imposed on me i suspect that it has also deceived me in this opinion of my own consequence indeed methinks the past has been a dream and hence i am resolved to rely on my imagination no longer  alfonso made no answer  the causes of tassos imprisonment and its long duration are among the puzzles of biography the prevailing opinion notwithstanding the opposition made to it by serassi and black is that the poet made love to the princess leonoraperhaps was beloved by her and that her brother the duke punished him for his arrogance this was the belief of his earliest biographer manso who was intimately acquainted with the poet in his latter days and from manso though he did not profess to receive the information from tasso but only to gather it from his poems it spread over all europe milton took it on trust from him15 and so have our english translators hoole and wiffen the abbé de charnes however declined to do so16 and montaigne who saw the poet in st annes hospital says nothing of the love at all he attributes his condition to poetical excitement hard study and the meeting of the extremes of wisdom and folly the philosopher however speaks of the poets having survived his reason and become unconscious both of himself and his works which the reader knows to be untrue he does not appear to have conversed with tasso the poet was only shewn him probably at a sick moment or by a new and ignorant official17 muratori who was in the service of the este family at modena tells us on the authority of an old acquaintance who knew contemporaries of tasso that the good torquato finding himself one day in company with the duke and his sister and going close to the princess in order to answer some question which she had put to him was so transported by an impulse more than poetical as to give her a kiss upon which the duke who had observed it turned about to his gentlemen and said what a pity to see so great a man distracted and so ordered him to be locked up18 but this writer adds that he does not know what to think of the anecdote he neither denies nor admits it tiraboschi who was also in the service of the este family doubts the truth of the anecdote and believes that the duke shut the poet up solely for fear lest his violence should do harm19 serassi the second biographer of tasso who dedicated his book to an este princess inimical to the poets memory attributes the confinement on his own shewing to the violent words he had uttered against his master20 walker the author of the memoir on italian tragedy says that the life by serassi himself induced him to credit the lovestory21 so does ginguéné22 black forgetting the age and illnesses of hundreds of enamoured ladies and the distraction of lovers at all times derides the notion of passion on either side because he argues tasso was subject to frenzies and leonora fortytwo years of age and not in good health23 what would madame dhoudetot have said to him or mademoiselle lespinasse or mrs inchbald who used to walk up and down sackville street in order that she might see dr warrens light in his window foscolo was a believer in the love24 sismondi admits it25 and rosini the editor of the latest edition of the poets works is passionate for it he wonders how any body can fail to discern it in a number of passages which in truth may mean a variety of other loves and he insists much upon certain loose verses lascivi which the poet among his various accounts of the origin of his imprisonment assigns as the cause or one of the causes of it 26  i confess after a reasonable amount of inquiry into this subject that i can find no proofs whatsoever of tassos having made love to leonora though i think it highly probable i believe the main cause of the dukes proceedings was the poets own violence of behaviour and incontinence of speech i think it very likely that in the course of the poetical lovemaking to various ladies which was almost identical in that age with addressing them in verse torquato whether he was in love or not took more liberties with the princesses than alfonso approved and it is equally probable that one of those liberties consisted in his indulging his imagination too far it is not even impossible that more gallantry may have been going on at court than alfonso could endure to see alluded to especially by an ambitious pen but there is no evidence that such was the case tasso as a gentleman could not have hinted at such a thing on the part of a princess of staid reputation and on the other hand the love he speaks of as entertained by her for him and warranting the application to her for money in case of his death was too plainly worded to mean any thing but love in the sense of friendly regard per amor mio is an idiomatical expression meaning for my sake a strong one no doubt and such as a proud man like alfonso might think a liberty but not at all of necessity an amatory boast if it was its very effrontery and vanity were presumptions of its falsehood the lady whom tasso alludes to in the passage quoted on his first confinement is complained of for her coldness towards him and unless this was itself a gentlemanly blind it might apply to fifty other ladies besides the princess the man who assaulted him in the streets and who is supposed to have been the violator of his papers need not have found any secrets of love in them the servant at whom he aimed the knife or the dagger might be as little connected with such matters and the sonnets which the poet said he wrote for a friend and which he desired to be buried with him might be alike innocent of all reference to leonora whether he wrote them for a friend or not leonoras death took place during the poets confinement and lamented as she was by the versewriters according to custom tasso wrote nothing on the event this silence has been attributed to the depth of his passion but how is the fact proved and why may it not have been occasioned by there having been no passion at all  all that appears certain is that tasso spoke violent and contemptuous words against the duke that he often spoke ill of him in his letters that he endeavoured not with perfect ingenuousness to exchange his service for that of another prince that he asserted his madness to have been pretended in the first instance purely to gratify the dukes whim for thinking it so which was one of the reasons perhaps why alfonso as he complained would not believe a word be said and finally that whether the madness was or was not so pretended it unfortunately became a confirmed though milder form of mania during a long confinement alfonso too proud to forgive the poets contempt continued thus to detain him partly perhaps because he was not sorry to have a pretext for revenge partly because he did not know what to do with him consistently either with his own or the poets safety he had not been generous enough to put tasso above his wants he had not address enough to secure his respect he had not merit enough to overlook his reproaches if tasso had been as great a man as he was a poet alfonso would not have been reduced to these perplexities the poet would have known how to settle quietly down on his small courtincome and wait patiently in the midst of his beautiful visions for what fortune had or had not in store for him but in truth he as well as the duke was weak they made a bad business of it between them and alfonso the second closed the accounts of the este family with the muses by keeping his panegyrist seven years in a madhouse to the astonishment of posterity and the destruction of his own claims to renown  it does not appear that tasso was confined in any such dungeon as they now exhibit in ferrara the conduct of the prior of the hospital is more doubtful his name was agostino mosti and strangely enough he was the person who had raised a monument to ariosto of whom he was an enthusiastic admirer to this predilection has been attributed his alleged cruelty to the stranger from sorrento who dared to emulate the fame of his idolan extraordinary though perhaps not incredible mode of skewing a critics regard for poetry but tasso while he laments his severity wonders at it in a man so well bred and so imbued with literature and thinks it can only have originated in orders27 perhaps there were faults of temper on both sides and mosti not liking his office forgot the allowance to be made for that of a prisoner and sick man his nephew giulio mosti became strongly attached to the poet and was a great comfort to him  at length the time for liberation arrived in the summer of 1586 don vincenzo gonzaga prince of mantua kinsman of the poets friend scipio came to ferrara for the purpose of complimenting alfonsos heir on his nuptials the whole court of mantua with hereditary regard for tasso whose father had been one of their ornaments were desirous of having him among them and the prince extorted alfonsos permission to take him away on condition so hard did he find this late concession to humanity and so fearful was he of losing the dignity of jailor that his deliverer should not allow him to quit mantua without obtaining leave a young and dear friend his most frequent visitor antonio constantini secretary to the tuscan ambassador went to st annes to prepare the captive by degrees for the good news he told him that he really might look for his release in the course of a few days the sensitive poet now a premature old man of fortytwo was thrown into a transport of mingled delight and anxiety he had been disappointed so often that he could scarcely believe his good fortune in a day or two he writes thus to his visitor  your kindness my dear friend has so accustomed me to your precious and frequent visits that i have been all day long at the window expecting your coming to comfort me as you are wont but since you have not yet arrived and in order not to remain altogether without consolation i visit you with this letter it encloses a sonnet to the ambassador written with a trembling hand and in such a manner that he will not perhaps have less difficulty in reading it than i had in writing  two days afterwards the prince himself came again requested of the poet some verses on a given subject expressed his esteem for his genius and virtues and told him that on his return to mantua he should have the pleasure of conducting him to that city tasso lay awake almost all night composing the verses and next day enclosed them with a letter in another to constantini ardently begging him to keep the prince in mind of his promise the prince had not forgotten it and two or three days afterwards the order for the release arrived and tasso quitted his prison he had been confined seven years two months and several days he awaited the princes departure for a week or two in his friends abode paying no visits probably from inability to endure so much novelty neither was he inclined or sent for to pay his respects to the duke two such parties could hardly have been desirous to look on each other the duke must especially have disliked the thought of it though tasso afterwards fancied otherwise and that he was offended at his nonappearance but his letters unfortunately differ with themselves on this point as on most others about the middle of july 1586 the poet quitted ferrara for ever  at mantua tasso was greeted with all the honours and attentions which his love of distinction could desire the good old duke the friend of his father ordered handsome apartments to be provided for him in the palace the prince made him presents of costly attire including perfumed silken hose kindred elegancies to the italian gloves of queen elizabeth the princess and her motherinlaw were declared admirers of his poetry the courtiers caressed the favourite of their masters tasso found literary society he pronounced the very bread and fruit the fish and the flesh excellent the wines were sharp and brisk such as his father was fond of and even the physician was admirable for he ordered confections one might imagine if circumstances had not proved the cordial nature of the gonzaga family and the real respect and admiration entertained for the poets genius by the greatest men of the time in spite of the rebuke it had received from alfonso that there had been a confederacy to mock and mystify him after the fashion of the duke and duchess with don quixote the only blot by the way in the book of cervantes if indeed he did not intend it as a satire on the mystifiers  for a while in short the liberated prisoner thought himself happy he corrected his prose works resumed and finished the tragedy of torrismond which he had begun some years before corresponded with princes and completed and published a narrative poem left unfinished by his father torquato was as loving a son as mozart or montaigne whenever he had a glimpse of felicity he appears to have associated the idea of it with that of his father in the conclusion of his fragment o del grand apennino he affectingly begs pardon of his blessed spirit for troubling him with his earthly griefs28  but alas what had been an indulgence of selfesteem had now become the habit of a disease and in the course of a few months the restless poet began to make his old discovery that he was not sufficiently cared for the prince had no leisure to attend to him the nobility did not yield him the first place or at least he adds they did not allow him to be treated externally as their equal and he candidly confessed that he could not live in a place where such was the custom29 he felt also naturally enough however well it might have been intended that it was not pleasant to be confined to the range of the city of mantua attended by a servant even though he confessed that he was now subject to frenzy he contrived to stay another halfyear by help of a brilliant carnival and of the select society of the princes court who were evidently most kind to him but at the end of the twelvemonth he was in bergamo among his relations the prince gave him leave to go and the cavaliere tasso his kinsman sent his chariot on purpose to fetch him  here again he found himself at a beautiful countryseat which the family of tasso still possesses near that city and here again in the house of his father he proposed to be happy having never desired he says any journey more earnestly than this he left it in the course of a month to return to mantua  and it was only to wander still mantua he quitted in less than two months to go to rome in spite of the advice of his best friends he vindicated the proceeding by a hope of obtaining some permanent settlement from the pope he took loretto by the way to refresh himself with devotion arrived in a transport at rome got nothing from the pope the hardminded sixtus the fifth and in the spring of the next year in the triple hope of again embracing his sister and recovering the dowry of his mother and the confiscated property of his father he proceeded to naples  naples was in its most beautiful vernal condition and the neapolitans welcomed the poet with all honour and glory but his sister alas was dead he got none of his fathers property nor till too late any of his mothers and before the year was out he was again in rome he acquired in naples however another friend as attached to him and as constant in his attentions as his beloved constantini to wit giambattista manso marquis of villa who became his biographer and who was visited and praised for his good offices by milton in the society of this gentleman he seemed for a short while to have become a new man he entered into fieldsports listened to songs and music nay danced says manso with the girls one fancies a poetical dr johnson with the two country damsels on his knees in short good air and freedom and no medicine had conspired with the lessons of disappointment to give him before he died a glimpse of the power to be pleased he had not got rid of all his spiritual illusions even those of a melancholy nature but he took the latter more quietly and had grown so comfortable with the race in general that he encouraged them he was so entirely freed from his fears of the inquisition and of charges of magic that whereas he had formerly been anxious to shew that he meant nothing but a poetical fancy by the spirit which he introduced as communing with him in his dialogue entitled the messenger he now maintained its reality against the arguments of his friend manso and these arguments gave rise to the most poetical scene in his history he told manso that he should have ocular testimony of the spirits existence and accordingly one day while they were sitting together at the marquiss fireside he turned his eyes says manso towards a window and held them a long time so intensely on it that when i called him he did not answer at last behold said he the friendly spirit which has courteously come to talk with me lift up your eyes and see the truth i turned my eyes thither immediately continues the marquis but though i endeavoured to look as keenly as i could i beheld nothing but the rays of the sun which streamed through the panes of the window into the chamber whilst i still looked around without beholding any object torquato began to hold with this unknown something a most lofty converse i heard indeed and saw nothing but himself nevertheless his words at one time questioning at another replying were such as take place between those who reason strictly on some important subject and from what was said by the one the reply of the other might be easily comprehended by the intellect although it was not heard by the ear the discourses were so lofty and marvellous both by the sublimity of their topics and a certain unwonted manner of talking that exalted above myself in a kind of ecstasy i did not dare to interrupt them nor ask tasso about the spirit which he had announced to me but which i did not see in this way while i listened between stupefaction and rapture a considerable time had elapsed till at last the spirit departed as i learned from the words of torquato who turning to me said from this day forward all your doubts will have vanished from your mind nay said i they are rather increased since though i have heard many things worthy of marvel i have seen nothing of what you promised to shew me to dispel them he smiled and said you have seen and heard more of him than perhaps  and here he paused fearful of importuning him with new questions the discourse ended and the only conclusion i can draw is what i before said that it is more likely his visions or frenzies will disorder my own mind than that i shall extirpate his true or imaginary opinion30  did the smile of tasso at the close of this extraordinary scene and the words which he omitted to add signify that his friend had seen and heard more perhaps than the poet would have liked to explain did he mean that he himself alone had been seen and heard and was author of the whole dialogue perhaps he did for credulity itself can imposecan take pleasure in seeing others as credulous as itself on the other hand enough has become known in our days of the phenomena of morbid perception to render tassos actual belief in such visions not at all surprising it is not uncommon for the sanest people of delicate organisation to see faces before them while going to sleep sometimes in fantastical succession a stronger exercise of this disposition in temperaments more delicate will enlarge the face to figure and there can be no question that an imagination so heated as tassos so full of the speculations of the later platonists and accompanied by a state of body so nervous and a will so bent on its fancies might embody whatever he chose to behold the dialogue he could as easily read in the visions looks whether he heard it or not with ears if nicholay the prussian bookseller who saw crowds of spiritual people go through his rooms had been a poet and possessed of as wilful an imagination as tasso he might have gifted them all with speaking countenances as easily as with coats and waistcoats swedenborg founded a religion on this morbid faculty and the catholics worship a hundred stories of the like sort in the lives of the saints many of which are equally true and false false in reality though true in supposition luther himself wrote and studied till he saw the devil only the great reformer retained enough of his naturally sturdy health and judgment to throw an inkstand at satans heada thing that philosophy has been doing ever since  tassos principal residence while at naples had been in the beautiful monastery of mount olivet on which the good monks begged he would write them a poem which he did a cold reception at rome and perhaps the difference of the air brought back his old lamentations but here again a monastery gave him refuge and he set himself down to correct his former works and compose new ones he missed however the comforts of society and amusement which he had experienced at naples nevertheless he did not return thither he persuaded himself that it was necessary to be in rome in order to expedite the receipt of some books and manuscripts from bergamo and other places but his restlessness desired novelty he thus slipped back from the neighbourhood of rome to the city itself and from the city back to the monastery his friends in both places being probably tired of his instability he thought of returning to mantua but a present from the grand duke of tuscany accompanied by an invitation to his court drew him in one of his shortlived transports to florence he returned in spite of the best and most generous reception to rome then left rome for mantua on invitation from his everkind deliverer from prison now the reigning duke tired again even of him returned to rome then once more to naples where the prince of conca grand admiral of the kingdom lodged and treated him like an equal but he grew suspicious of the admiral and went to live with his friend manso quitted manso for rome again was treated with reverence on the way like ariosto by a famous leader of banditti was received at rome into the vatican itself in the apartments of his friend cintio aldobrandino nephew of the new pope clement the eighth where his hopes now seemed to be raised at once to their highest and most reasonable pitch but fell ill and was obliged to go back to naples for the benefit of the air a life so strangely erratic to the last for mortal illness was approaching is perhaps unique in the history of men of letters and might be therefore worth recording even in that of a less man than tasso but when we recollect that this poet in spite of all his weaknesses and notwithstanding the enemies they provoked and the friends they cooled was really almost adored for his genius in his own time and instead of refusing jewels one day and soliciting a ducat the next might have settled down almost any where in quiet and glory if he had but possessed the patience to do so it becomes an association of weakness with power and of adversity with the means of prosperity the absurdity of which admiration itself can only drown in pity  he now took up his abode in another monastery that of san severino where he was comforted by the visits of his friend manso to whom he had lately inscribed a dialogue on friendship for he continued writing to the last he had also the consolation such as it was of having the lawsuit for his mothers dowry settled in his favour though under circumstances that rendered it of little importance and only three months before his death so strangely did fortune seem to take delight in sporting with a man of genius who had thought both too much of her and too little too much for pomps sake and too little in prudence among his new acquaintances were the young marino afterwards the corrupter of italian poetry and the prince of venosa an amateur composer of music the dying poet wrote madrigals for him so much to his satisfaction that being about to marry into the house of este he wished to reconcile him with the duke of ferrara and tasso who to the last moment of his life seems never to have been able to resist the chance of resuming old quarters apparently from the double temptation of renouncing them wrote his old master a letter full of respects and regrets but the duke who himself died in the course of the year was not to be moved from his silence the poet had given him the last possible offence by recasting his jerusalem omitting the glories of the house of este and dedicating it to another patron alfonso who had been extravagantly magnificent though not to poets had so weakened his government that the pope wrested ferrara from the hands of his successor and reduced the este family to the possession of modena which it still holds and dishonours the duke and the poet were thus fading away at the same time they never met again in this world and a new dante would have divided them far enough in the next31  the last glimpse of honour and glory was now opening in a very grand manner on the poetthe last and the greatest as if on purpose to give the climax to his disappointments cardinal cintio requested the pope to give him the honour of a coronation it had been desired by the poet it seems three years before he was disappointed of it at that time and now that it was granted he was disappointed of the ceremony manso says he no longer cared for it and as he felt himself dying this is not improbable nevertheless he went to rome for the purpose and though the severity of the winter there delayed the intention till spring wealth and honours seemed determined to come in floods upon the poor expiring great man in order to take away the breath which they had refused to support the pope assigned him a yearly pension of a hundred scudi and the withholders of his mothers dowry came to an accommodation by which he was to have an annuity of a hundred ducats and a considerable sum in hand his hand was losing strength enough to close upon the money scarcely was the day for the coronation about to dawn when the poet felt his dissolution approaching alfonsos doctors had killed him at last by superinducing a habit of medicinetaking which defeated its purpose he requested leave to return to the monastery of st onofriowrote a farewell letter to constantinireceived the distinguished honour of a plenary indulgence from the popesaid in terms very like what milton might have used had he died a catholic that this was the chariot upon which he hoped to go crowned not with laurel as a poet into the capitol but with glory as a saint to heavenand expired on the 25th of april 1575 and the fiftyfirst year of his age closely embracing the crucifix and imperfectly uttering the sentence beginning into thy hands o lord32  even after death success mocked him for the coronation took place on the senseless dead body the head was wreathed with laurel a magnificent toga delayed for a while the shroud and a procession took place through the city by torchlight all the inhabitants pouring forth to behold it and painters crowding over the bier to gaze on the poets lineaments from which they produced a multitude of portraits the corpse was then buried in the church of st onofrio and magnificent monuments talked of which never appeared manso however obtained leave to set up a modest tablet and eight years afterwards a ferrarese cardinal bevilacqua made what amends he could for his countrymen by erecting the stately memorial which is still to be seen  poor illustrious tasso weak enough to warrant pity from his inferiorsgreat enough to overshadow in death his oncefancied superiors he has been a byword for the misfortunes of genius but genius was not his misfortune it was his only good and might have brought him all happiness it is the want of genius as far as it goes and apart from martyrdoms for conscience sake which produces misfortunes even to genius itselfthe want of as much wit and balance on the common side of things as genius is supposed to confine to the uncommon  manso has left a minute account of his friends person and manners he was tall even among the tall had a pale complexion sunken cheeks lightish brown hair head bald at the top large blue eyes square forehead big nose inclining towards the mouth lips pale and thin white teeth delicate white hands long arms broad chest and shoulders legs rather strong than fleshy and the body altogether better proportioned than in good condition the result nevertheless being an aspect of manly beauty and expression particularly in the countenance the dignity of which marked him for an extraordinary person even to those who did not know him his demeanour was grave and deliberate he laughed seldom and though his tongue was prompt his delivery was slow and he was accustomed to repeat his last words he was expert in all manly exercises but not equally graceful and the same defect attended his otherwise striking eloquence in public assemblies his putting to flight the assassins in ferrara gave him such a reputation for courage that there went about in his honour a popular couplet    colla penna e colla spada   nessun val quanto torquato    for the sword as well as pen   tasso is the man of men  he was a little eater but not averse to wine particularly such as combined piquancy with sweetness and he always dressed in black mansos account is still more particular and yet it does not tell all for tasso himself informs us that he stammered and was nearsighted33 and a neapolitan writer who knew him adds to the nearsightedness some visible defect in the eyes34 i should doubt from what tasso says in his letters whether he was fond of speaking in public notwithstanding his début in that line with the fifty amorous conclusionsnor does he appear to have been remarkable for his conversation manso has left a collection of one hundred of his pithy sayingsa suspicious amount and unfortunately more than warranting the suspicion for almost every one of them is traceable to some other man they come from the greek and latin philosophers and the apothegms of erasmus the two following have the greatest appearance of being genuine  a greek complaining that he had spoken ill of his country and maintaining that all the virtues in the world had issued out of it the poet assented with the addition that they had not left one behind them  a foolish young fellow garnished with a number of golden chains coming into a room where he was and being overheard by him exclaiming is this the great man that was mad tasso said yes but that people had never put on him more than one chain at a time  his character may be gathered but not perhaps entirely from what has been written of his life for some of his earlier letters shew him to have been not quite so grave and refined in his way of talking as readers of the jerusalem might suppose he was probably at that time of life not so scrupulous in his morals as he professed to be during the greater part of it his mother is thought to have died of chagrin and impatience at being separated so long from her husband and not knowing what to do to save her dowry from her brothers and i take her son to have combined his mothers ultrasensitive organisation with his fathers worldly imprudence and unequal spirits the addition of the nervous temperament of one parent to the aspiring nature of the other gave rise to the poets trembling eagerness for distinction and torquatos very love for them both hindered him from seeing what should have been corrected in the infirmities which he inherited falling from the highest hopes of prosperity into the most painful afflictions he thus wanted solid principles of action to support him and was forced to retreat upon an excess of selfesteem which allowed his pride to become a beggar and his naturally kind loving just and heroical disposition to condescend to almost every species of inconsistency the duke of ferrara he complains did not believe a word he said35 and the fact is that partly from disease and partly from a want of courage to look his defects in the face he beheld the same things in so many different lights and according as it suited him at the moment that without intending falsehood his statements are really not to be relied on he degraded even his verses sometimes with panegyrics for interests sake sometimes out of weak wishes to oblige of which he was afterwards ashamed and with the exception of constantini we cannot be sure that any one person praised in them retained his regard in his last days his suspicion made him a kind of rousseau but he was more amiable than the genevese and far from being in the habit of talking against old acquaintances whatever he might have thought of them it is observable not only that he never married but he told manso he had led a life of entire continence ever since he entered the walls of his prison being then in his thirtyfifth year36 was this out of fidelity to some mistress or the consequence of a previous life the reverse of continent or was it from some principle of superstition he had become a devotee apparently out of a dread of disbelief and he remained extremely religious for the rest of his days the two unhappiest of italian poets tasso and dante were the two most superstitious  as for the once formidable question concerning the comparative merits of this poet and ariosto which anticipated the modern quarrels of the classical and romantic schools some idea of the treatment which tasso experienced may be conceived by supposing all that used to be sarcastic and bitter in the periodical partycriticism among ourselves some thirty years back collected into one huge vial of wrath and poured upon the new poets head even the great galileo who was a man of wit bred up in the pure tuscan school of berni and casa and who was an idolator of ariosto wrote when he was young a review of the jerusalem delivered which it is painful to read it is so unjust and contemptuous37 but now that the only final arbiter posterity has accepted both the poets the dispute is surely the easiest thing in the world to settle not indeed with prejudices of creeds or temperaments but before any judges thoroughly sympathising with the two claimants its solution is the principle of the greater including the less for ariosto errs only by having an unbounded circle to move in his sympathies are unlimited and those who think him inferior to tasso only do so in consequence of their own want of sympathy with the vivacities that degrade him in their eyes ariosto can be as grave and exalted as tasso when he pleases and he could do a hundred things which tasso never attempted he is as different in this respect as shakspeare from milton he had far more knowledge of mankind than tasso and he was superior in point of taste but it is painful to make disadvantageous comparisons of one great poet with another let us be thankful for tassos enchanted gardens without being forced to vindicate the universal world of his predecessor suffice it to bear in mind that the grave poet himself agreed with the rest of the italians in calling the ferrarese the divine ariosto a title which has never been popularly given to his rival  the jerusalem delivered is the history of a crusade related with poetic license the infidels are assisted by unlawful arts and the libertinism that brought scandal on the christians is converted into youthful susceptibility led away by enchantment the author proposed to combine the ancient epic poets with ariosto or a simple plot and uniformly dignified style with romantic varieties of adventure and the luxuriance of fairyland he did what he proposed to do but with a judgment inferior to virgils nay in point of the interdependence of the adventures to ariosto and with far less general vigour the mixture of affectation with his dignity is so frequent that whether boileaus famous line about tassos tinsel and virgils gold did or did not mean to imply that the jerusalem was nothing but tinsel and the Æneid all gold it is certain that the tinsel is so interwoven with the gold as to render it more of a rule than an exception and put a provoking distance between tassos epic pretensions and those of the greatest masters of the art people who take for granted the conceits because of the wildness of ariosto and the good taste because of the regularity of tasso just assume the reverse of the fact it is a rare thing to find a conceit in ariosto and where it does exist it is most likely defensible on some shakspearian ground of subtle propriety open tasso in almost any part particularly the lovescenes and it is marvellous if before long you do not see the conceits vexatiously interfering with the beauties    oh maraviglia amor the appena è nato   già grande vola e già trionfa armato canto i st 47    oh miracle love is scarce born when lo   he flies full wingd and lords it with his bow    se l miri fulminar ne larme avvolto   marte lo stimi amor se scopre il volto st 58    mars you would think him when his thundring race   in arms he ran love when he shewd his face  which is as little true to reason as to taste for no god of war could look like a god of love the habit of mind would render it impossible but the poet found the prettiness of the greek anthology irresistible  olindo tied to the stake amidst the flames of martyrdom can say to his mistress    altre fiamme altri nodi amor promise canto ii st 34    other flames other bonds than these love promised  the sentiment is natural but the double use of the flames

long speeches on the least fitting occasions and ladies retaining their rosy cheeks in the midst of fears of deathis to be met with more or less throughout the poem i have no doubt they were the proximate cause of that general corruption of taste which was afterwards completed by marino the acquaintance and ardent admirer of tasso when a boy they have been laid to the charge of petrarch but without entering into the question how far and in what instances conceits may not be natural to lovers haunted as petrarch was with one idea and seeing it in every thing they behold what had the great epic poet to do with the faults of the lyrical and what is to be said for his standing in need of the excuse of bad example homer and milton were in no such want virgil would not have copied the tricks of ovid there is an effeminacy and selfreflection in tasso analogous to his rinaldo in the enchanted garden where the hero wore a lookingglass by his side in which he contemplated his sophisticated self and the meretricious beauty of his enchantress38 agreeably to this tendency to weakness the style of tasso when not supported by great occasions and even the occasion itself sometimes fails him is too apt to fall into tameness and commonplaceto want movement and picture while at the same time with singular defect of enjoyment it does not possess the music which might be expected from a lyrical and voluptuous poet bernardo prophesied of his son that however he might surpass him in other respects he would never equal him in sweetness and he seems to have judged him rightly i have met with a passage in torquatos prose writings but i cannot lay my hands on it in which he expresses a singular predilection for verses full of the same vowel he seems if i remember rightly to have regarded it not merely as a pleasing variety which it is on occasion but as a reigning principle voltaire i think in his treatise on epic poetry has noticed the multitude of os in the exordium of the jerusalemthis apparent negligence seems to have been intentional    cantò larmi pietòse e l capitanò     che l gran sepòlerò liberò di cristò   mòltò egli òprò còl sennò e còn la manò     mòltò sòffri nel glòriòsò acquistò   e invan linfernò a lui sòppòse e invanò     sarmò dasia e di libia il pòpòl mistò   che il ciel gli diè favòre e sòttò ai santi   segni ridusse i suòi còmpagni erranti  the reader will not be surprised to find that he who could thus confound monotony with music and commence his greatest poem with it is too often discordant in the rest of his versification it has been thought that milton might have taken from the italians the grand musical account to which he turns a list of proper names as in his enumerations of realms and deities but i have been surprised to find how little the most musical of languages appears to have suggested to its poets anything of the sort i am not aware of it indeed in any poets but our own all others from homer with his catalogue of leaders and ships down to metastasio himself though he wrote for music appear to have overlooked this opportunity of playing a voluntary of fine sounds where they had no other theme on which to modulate its inventor as far as i am aware is that great poet marlowe39  there are faults of invention as well as style in the jerusalem the talking bird or bird that sings with a human voice canto iv 13 is a piece of inverisimilitude which the author perhaps thought justifiable by the speaking horses of the ancients but the latter were moved supernaturally for the occasion and for a very fine occasion tassos bird is a mere born contradiction to nature and for no necessity the vulgar idea of the devil with horns and a tail though the retention of it argued a genius in tasso very inferior to that of milton is defensible i think on the plea of the german critics that malignity should be made a thing low and deformed but as much cannot be said for the storehouse in heaven where

name and virtues of sueno canto viii st 39 is worthy only of a pantomime and the wizard in robes with beechleaves on his head who walks dryshod on water and superfluously helps the knights on their way to armidas retirement xiv 33 is almost as ludicrous as the burlesque of the rivergod in the voyage of bachaumont and chapelle  but let us not wonder nevertheless at the effect which the jerusalem has had upon the world it could not have had it without great nature and power rinaldo in spite of his aberrations with armida knew the path to renown and so did his poet tassos epic with all its faults is a noble production and justly considered one of the poems of the world each of those poems hit some one great point of universal attraction at least in their respective countries and among the givers of fame in others homers poem is that of action dantes of passion virgils of judgment miltons of religion spensers of poetry itself ariostos of animal spirits i do not mean as respects gaiety only but in strength and readiness of accord with the whole play of nature tasso looked round with an ultrasensitive temperament and an ambition which required encouragement and his poem is that of tenderness every thing inclines to this point in his circle with the tremulousness of the needle love is its all in all even to the design of the religious war which is to rescue the sepulchre of the god of charity from the hands of the unloving his heroes are all in love at least those on the right side his leader godfrey notwithstanding his prudence narrowly escapes the passion and is full of a loving consideration his amazon clorinda inspires the truest passion and dies taking her lovers hand his erminia is all love for an enemy his enchantress armida falls from pretended love into real and forsakes her religion for its sake an old father canto ix loses his five sons in battle and dies on their dead bodies of a wound which he has provoked on purpose tancred cannot achieve the enterprise of the enchanted forest because his dead mistress seems to come out of one of the trees olindo thinks it happiness to be martyred at the same stake with sophronia the reconciliation of rinaldo with his enchantress takes place within a few stanzas of the close of the poem as if contesting its interest with religion the jerusalem delivered in short is the favourite epic of the young all the lovers in europe have loved it the french have forgiven the author his conceits for the sake of his gallantry he is the poet of the gondoliers and spenser the most luxurious of his brethren plundered his bowers of bliss read tassos poem by this gentle light of his genius and you pity him twentyfold and know not what excuse to find for his jailer  the stories translated in the present volume though including war and magic are all lovestories they were not selected on that account they suggested themselves for selection as containing most of the finest things in the poem they are conducted with great art and the characters and affections happily varied the first olindo and sophronia is perhaps unique for the hopelessness of its commencement i mean with regard to the lovers and the perfect and at the same time quite probable felicity of the conclusion there is no reason to believe that the staid and devout sophronia would have loved her adorer at all but for the circumstance that first dooms them both to a shocking death and then sends them with perfect warrant from the stake to the altar clorinda is an amazon the idea of whom as such it is impossible for us to separate from very repulsive and unfeminine images yet under the circumstances of the story we call to mind in her behalf the possibility of a joan of arcs having loved and been beloved and her death is a surprising and most affecting variation upon that of agrican in boiardo tassos enchantress armida is a variation of the angelica of the same poet combined with ariostos alcina but her passionate voluptuousness makes her quite a new character in regard to the one and she is as different from the painted hag of the orlando as youth beauty and patriotic intention can make her she is not very sentimental but all the passion in the world has sympathised with her and it was manly and honest in the poet not to let her paganism and vehemence hinder him from doing justice to her claims as a human being and a deserted woman her fate is left in so pleasing a state of doubt that we gladly avail ourselves of it to suppose her married to rinaldo and becoming the mother of a line of christian princes i wish they had treated her poet half so well as she would infallibly have treated him herself  but the singer of the crusades can be strong as well as gentle you discern in his battles and single combats the poet ambitious of renown and the accomplished swordsman the duel of tancred and argantes in which the latter is slain is as earnest and fiery writing throughout as truth and passion could desire that of tancred and clorinda is also very powerful as well as affecting and the whole siege of jerusalem is admirable for the strength of its interest every body knows the grand verse not however quite original that summons the devils to council chiama gli abitator c and the still grander though less original one describing the desolations of time giace lalta cartago40 the forest filled with supernatural terrors by a magician in order that the christians may not cut wood from it to make their engines of war is one of the happiest pieces of invention in romance it is founded in as true human feeling as those of ariosto and is made an admirable instrument for the aggrandizement of the character of rinaldo godfreys attestation of all time and of the host of heaven when he addresses his army in the first canto is in the highest spirit of epic magnificence so is the appearance of the celestial armies together with that of the souls of the slain christian warriors in the last canto where they issue forth in the air to assist the entrance into the conquered city the classical poets are turned to great and frequent account throughout the poem and yet the work has a strong air of originality partly owing to the subject partly to the abundance of lovescenes and to a certain compactness in the treatment of the main story notwithstanding the luxuriance of the episodes the jerusalem delivered is stately wellordered full of action and character sometimes sublime always elegant and very interestingmore so i think as a whole and in a popular sense than any other story in verse not excepting the odyssey for the exquisite domestic attractiveness of the second homeric poem is injured like the hero himself by too many diversions from the main point there is an interest it is true in that very delay but we become too much used to the disappointment in the epic of tasso the reader constantly desires to learn how the success of the enterprise is to be brought about and he scarcely loses sight of any of the persons but he wishes to see them again even in the lovescenes tender and absorbed as they are we feel that the heroes are fighters or going to fight when you are introduced to armida in the bower of bliss it is by warriors who come to take her lover away to battle  one of the reasons why tasso hurt the style of his poem by a manner too lyrical was that notwithstanding its deficiency in sweetness he was one of the profusest lyrical writers of his nation and always having his feelings turned in upon himself i am not sufficiently acquainted with his odes and sonnets to speak of them in the gross but i may be allowed to express my belief that they possess a great deal of fancy and feeling it has been wondered how he could write so many considering the troubles he went through but the experience was the reason the constant succession of hopes fears wants gratitudes loves and the necessity of employing his imagination accounts for all some of his sonnets such as those on the countess of scandianos lip quel labbro c the one to stigliano concluding with the affecting mention of himself and his lost harp that beginning    io veggio in cielo scintillar le stelle  recur to my mind oftener than any others except dantes tanto gentile and filicaias lament on italy and with the exception of a few of the more famous odes of petrarch and one or two of filicaias and guidis i know of none in italian like several of tassos including his fragment o del grand apennino and the exquisite chorus on the golden age which struck a note in the hearts of the world  his aminta the chief pastoral poem of italy though with the exception of that ode not equal in passages to the faithful shepherdess which is a pan to it compared with a beardless shepherd is elegant interesting and as superior to guarinis more sophisticate yet still beautiful pastor fido as a first thought may be supposed to be to its emulator the objection of its being too elegant for shepherds he anticipated and nullified by making love himself account for it in a charming prologue of which the god is the speaker    queste selve oggi ragionar damore

inequality   as it may please me do i equalise   and tis my crowning glory and great miracle   to make the rural pipe as eloquent   even as the subtlest harp  i ought not to speak of tassos other poetry or of his prose for i have read little of either though as they are not popular with his countrymen a foreigner may be pardoned for thinking his classical tragedy torrismondo not attractivehis sette giornate seven days of the creation still less soand his platonical and critical discourses better filled with authorities than reasons tasso was a lesser kind of milton enchanted by the sirens we discern the weak parts of his character more or less in all his writings but we see also the irrepressible elegance and superiority of the mind which in spite of all weakness was felt to tower above its age and to draw to it the homage as well as the resentment of princes   footnote 1 my authorities for this notice are blacks life of tasso 2 vols 4to 1810 his original serassi vita di torquato tasso do 1790 and the works of the poet in the pisan edition of professor rosini 33 vols 8vo 1332 i have been indebted to nothing in black which i have not ascertained by reference to the italian biographer and quoted nothing stated by tasso himself but from the works blacks life which is a free version of serassis modified by the translators own opinions and criticism is elegant industrious and interesting serassis was the first copious biography of the poet founded on original documents and it deserved to be translated by mr black though servile to the house of este and as might be expected far from being always ingenuous among other instances of this writers want of candour is the fact of his having been the discoverer and suppresser of the manuscript review of tasso by galileo the best summary account of the poets life and writings which i have met with is ginguénés in the fifth volume of his histoire littéraire c it is written with his usual grace vivacity and acuteness and contains a good notice of the tasso controversy as to the pisan edition of the works it is the completest i believe in point of contents ever published comprises all the controversial criticism and is of course very useful but it contains no life except mansos now known to be very inconclusive has got a heap of feeble variorum comments on the jerusalem no notes worth speaking of to the rest of the works and notwithstanding the claim in the titlepage to the merit of a better order has left the correspondence in a deplorable state of irregularity as well as totally without elucidation the learned professor is an agreeable writer and i believe a very pleasant man but he certainly is a provoking editor  footnote 2 in the beautiful fragment beginning o del grandapennino

mangiadore sanvittore natan raban c at the end of the twelfth canto of the paradiso yet in his time poetry was recitatived to music so it was in petrarchs who was a lutenist and who tried his verses

420 and 445   olindo and sophronia  argument  the mahomedan king of jerusalem at the instigation of ismeno a magician deprives a christian church of its image of the virgin and sets it up in a mosque under a spell of enchantment as a palladium against the crusaders the image is stolen in the night and the king unable to discover who has taken it orders a massacre of the christian portion of his subjects which is prevented by sophronias accusing herself of the offence her lover olindo finding her sentenced to the stake in consequence disputes with her the right of martyrdom he is condemned to suffer with her the amazon clorinda who has come to fight on the side of aladin obtains their pardon in acknowledgment of her services and sophronia who had not loved olindo before now returns his passion and goes with him from the stake to the marriagealtar  olindo and sophronia  godfrey of boulogne the leader of the crusaders was now in full march for jerusalem with the christian army and aladin the old infidel king became agitated with wrath and terror he had heard nothing but accounts of the enemys irresistible advance there were many christians within his walls whose insurrection he dreaded and though he had appeared to grow milder with age he now in spite of the frost in his veins felt as hot for cruelty as the snake excited by the fire of summer he longed to stifle his fears of insurrection by a massacre but dreaded the consequence in the event of the citys being taken he therefore contented himself for the present with laying waste the country round about it destroying every possible receptacle of the invaders poisoning the wells and doubly fortifying the only weak point in his fortifications  at this juncture the renegade ismeno stood before hima bad old man who had studied unlawful arts he could bind and loose evil spirits and draw the dead out of their tombs restoring to them breath and perception this man told the king that in the church belonging to his christian subjects there was an altar underground on which stood a veiled image of the woman whom they worshippedthe mother as they called her of their dead and buried god a dazzling light burnt for ever before it and the walls were hung with the offerings of her credulous devotees if this image he said were taken away by the kings own hand and set up in a mosque such a spell of enchantment could be thrown about it as should render the city impregnable so long as the idol was kept safe  aladin proceeded instantly to the christian temple and treating the priests with violence tore the image from its shrine and conveyed it to his own place of worship the necromancer then muttered before it his blasphemous enchantment but the light of morning no sooner appeared in the mosque than the official to whose charge the palladium had been committed missed it from its place and in vain searched every other to find it in truth it never was found again nor is it known to this day how it went some think the christians took it others that heaven interfered in order to save it from profanation and well says the poet does it become a pious humility so to think of a disappearance so wonderful  the king who fell into a paroxysm of rage not doubting that some christian was the offender issued a proclamation setting a price on the head of any one who concealed it but no discovery was made the necromancer resorted to his art with as little effect the king then ordered a general christian massacre his savage wrath hugged itself on the reflection that the criminal would be sure to perish perish else who might  the christians heard the order with an astonishment that took away all their powers of resistance the suddenness of the presence of death stupified them they did not resort even to an entreaty they waited like sheep to be butchered little did they think what kind of saviour was at hand  there was a maiden among them of ripe years grave and beautiful one who took no heed of her beauty but was altogether absorbed in high and holy thoughts if she thought of her beauty ever it was only to subject it to the dignity of virtue the greater her worth the more she concealed it from the world living a close life at home and veiling herself from all eyes  but the rays of such a jewel could not but break through their casket love would not consent to have it so locked up love turned her very retirement into attraction there was a youth who had become enamoured of this hidden treasure his name was olindo sophronia was that of the maiden olindo like herself was a christian and the humbleness of his passion was equal to the worth of her that inspired it he desired much hoped little asked nothing1 he either knew not how to disclose his love or did not dare it and she either despised it or did not or would not see it the poor youth up to this day had got nothing by his devotion not even a look  the maiden who was nevertheless as generous as she was virtuous fell into deep thought how she might save her christian brethren she soon came to her resolve she delayed the execution of it a little only out of a sense of virgin decorum which in its turn made her still more resolute she issued forth by herself in the sight of all not muffling up her beauty nor yet exposing it she withdrew her eyes beneath a veil and attired neither with ostentation nor carelessness passed through the streets with unaffected simplicity admired by all save herself she went straight before the king his angry aspect did not repel her she drew aside the veil and looked him steadily in the face  i am come she said to beg that you will suspend your wrath and withhold the orders given to your people i know and will give up the author of the deed which has offended you on that condition  at the noble confidence thus displayed at the sudden apparition of so much lofty and virtuous beauty the kings countenance was confused and its angry expression abated had his spirit been less stern or the look she gave him less firm in its purpose he would have loved her but haughty beauty and haughty beholder are seldom drawn together glances of pleasure are the baits of love and yet if the ungentle king was not enamoured he was impressed he was bent on gazing at her he felt an emotion of delight  say on he replied i accept the condition  behold then said she the offender the deed was the work of this hand it was i that conveyed away the image i am she whom you look for i am the criminal to be punished  and as she spake she bent her head before him as already yielding it to the executioner  oh noble falsehood when was truth to be compared with thee2  the king was struck dumb he did not fall into his accustomed transports of rage when he recovered from his astonishment he said who advised you to do this who was your accomplice  not a soul replied the maiden i would not have allowed another person to share a particle of my glory i alone knew of the deed i alone counselled it i alone did it  then be the consequence cried he on your own head  tis but just returned sophronia mine was the sole honour mine therefore should be the only punishment  the tyrant at this began to feel the accession of his old wrath where he said have you hidden the image  i did not hide it she replied i burnt it i thought it fit and righteous to do so i knew of no other way to save it from the hands of the unbelieving ask not for what will never again be found be content with the vengeance you have before you  oh chaste heart oh exalted soul oh creature full of nobleness think not to find a forgiving moment return beauty itself is thy shield no longer  the glorious maiden is taken and bound the cruel king has condemned her to the stake her veil and the mantle that concealed her chaste bosom are torn away and her soft arms tied with a hard knot behind her she said nothing she was not terrified but yet she was not unmoved her bosom heaved in spite of its courage her lovely colour was lost in a pure white  the news spread in an instant and the city crowded to the sight christians and all olindo among them he had thought within himself what if it should be sophronia but when he beheld that it was she indeed and not only condemned but already at the stake he made way through the crowd with violence crying out this is not the personthis poor simpleton she never thought of such a thing she had not the courage to do it she had not the strength how was she to carry the sacred image away let her abide by her story if she dare i did it  such was the love of the poor youth for her that loved him not  when he came up to the stake he gave a formal account of what he pretended to have done i climbed in he said at the window of your mosque at night and found a narrow passage round to the image where nobody could expect to meet me i shall not suffer the penalty to be usurped by another i did the deed and i will have the honour of doing it now that it comes to this let our places be changed  sophronia had looked up when she heard the youth call out and she gazed on him with eyes of pity what madness is this exclaimed she what can induce an innocent person to bring destruction on himself for nothing can i not bear the thing by myself is the anger of one man so tremendous that one person cannot sustain it trust me friend you are mistaken i stand in no need of your company  thus spoke sophronia to her lover but not a whit was he disposed to alter his mind oh great and beautiful spectacle love and virtue at strifedeath the prize they contend forruin itself the salvation of the conqueror but the contest irritated the king he felt himself set at nought felt death itself despised as if in despite of the inflictor let them be taken at their words cried be let both have the prize they long for  the youth is seized on the instant and bound like the maiden both are tied to the stake and set back to back they behold not the face of one another the wood is heaped round about them the fire is kindled  the youth broke out into lamentations but only loud enough to be heard by his fellowsufferer is this then said he the bond which i hoped might join us is this the fire which i thought might possibly warm two lovers hearts3 too long is it not so have we been divided and now too cruelly are we united too cruelly i say but not as regards me for since i am not to be partner of thy existence gladly do i share thy death it is thy fate not mine that afflicts me oh too happy were it to me too sweet and fortunate if i could obtain grace enough to be set with thee heart to heart and so breathe out my soul into thy lips perhaps thou wouldst do the like with mine and so give me thy last sigh  thus spoke the youth in tears but the maiden gently reproved him  she said other thoughts my friend and other lamentations befit a time like this why thinkest thou not of thy sins and of the rewards which god has promised to the righteous meet thy sufferings in his name so shall their bitterness be made sweet and thy soul be carried into the realms above cast thine eyes upwards and behold them see how beautiful is the sky how the sun seems to invite thee towards it with its splendour  at words so noble and piteous as these the pagans themselves who stood within hearing began to weep the christians wept too but in voices more lowly even the king felt an emotion of pity but disdaining to give way to it he turned aside and withdrew the maiden alone partook not of the common grief she for whom every body wept wept not for herself  the flames were now beginning to approach the stake when there appeared coming through the crowd a warrior of noble mien habited in the arms of another country the tiger which formed the crest of his helmet drew all eyes to it for it was a cognizance well known the people began to think that it was a heroine instead of a hero which they saw even the famous clorinda nor did they err in the supposition  a despiser of feminine habits had clorinda been from her childhood she disdained to put her hand to the needle and the distaff she renounced every soft indulgence every timid retirement thinking that virtue could be safe wherever it went in its own courageous heart and so she armed her countenance with pride and pleased herself with making it stern but not to the effect she looked for for the sternness itself pleased while yet a child her little right hand would control the bit of the charger and she wielded the sword and spear and hardened her limbs with wrestling and made them supple for the race and then as she grew up she tracked the footsteps of the bear and lion and followed the trumpet to the wars and in those and in the depths of the forest she seemed a wild creature to mankind and a man to the wildest creature she had now come out of persia to wreak her displeasure on the christians who had already felt the sharpness of her sword and as she arrived near this assembled multitude death was the first thing that met her eyes but in a shape so perplexing that she looked narrowly to discern what it was and then spurred her horse towards the scene of action the crowd gave way as she approached and she halted as she entered the circle round the stake and sat gazing on the youth and maiden she wondered to see the male victim lamenting while the female was mute but indeed she saw that he was weeping not out of grief but pity or at least not out of grief for himself and as to the maiden she observed her to be so wrapt up in the contemplation of the heavens at which she was gazing that she appeared to have already taken leave of earth  pity touched the heart of the amazon and the tears came into her eyes she felt sorry for both the victims but chiefly for the one that said nothing she turned to a whiteheaded man beside her and said what is this who are these two persons whom crime or their ill fortune has brought hither  the man answered her briefly but to the purpose and she discerned at once that both must be innocent she therefore determined to save them she dismounted and set the example of putting a stop to the flames and then said to the officers let nobody continue this work till i have spoken to the king rest assured he will hold you guiltless of the delay the officers obeyed being struck with her air of confidence and authority and she went straight towards the king who had heard of her arrival and who was coming to bid her welcome  i am clorinda she said thou knowest me then thou knowest sir one who is desirous to defend the good faith and the king of jerusalem i am ready for any duty that may be assigned me i fear not the greatest nor do i disdain the least open field or walled city no post will come amiss to the kings servant  illustrious maiden answered the king who knoweth not clorinda what region is there so distant from asia or so far away out of the paths of the sun to which the sound of thy achievements has not arrived joined by thee and by thy sword i fear nothing godfrey methinks is too slow to attack me dost thou ask to which post thou shalt be appointed to the greatest none else becomes thee thou art lady and mistress of the war  clorinda gave the king thanks for his courtesy and then resumed strange is it in truth she said to ask my reward before i have earned it but confidence like this reassures me grant me for what i propose to do in the good cause the lives of these two persons i wave the uncertainty of their offence i wave the presumption of innocence afforded by their own behaviour i ask their liberation as a favour and yet it becomes me at the same time to confess that i do not believe the christians to have taken the image out of the mosque it was an impious thing of the magician to put it there an idol has no business in a mussulman temple much less the idols of unbelievers and my opinion is that the miracle was the work of mahomet himself out of scorn and hatred of the contamination let ismeno prefer his craft if he will to the weapons of a man but let him not take upon himself the defence of a nation of warriors  the warlike damsel was silent and the king though he could with difficulty conquer his anger yet did so to please his guest they are free said he i can deny nothing to such a petitioner whether it be justice or not to absolve them absolved they are if they are innocent i pronounce them so if guilty i concede their pardon  at these words the youth and the maiden were set free and blissful indeed was the fortune of olindo for love so proved as his awoke love in the noble bosom of sophronia and so he passed from the stake to the marriagealtar a husband instead of a wretch condemneda lover beloved instead of a hopeless adorer   footnote 1 brama assai poco spera e nulla chiede canto ii st 16 a line justly famous  footnote 2    magnanima menzogna or quando è il vero   sì bello che si possa a te preporre  footnote 3 this conceit is more dwelt upon in the original coupled with the one noticed at p 362   tancred and clorinda  argument  the mussulman amazon clorinda who is beloved by the christian chief tancred goes forth in disguise at night to burn the battering tower of the christian army she effects her purpose but in retreating from its discoverers is accidentally shut out of the gate through which she had left the city she makes her way into the open country trusting to get in at one of the other gates but having been watched by tancred who does not know her in the armour in which she is disguised a combat ensues between them in which she is slain she requests baptism in her last moments and receives it from the hands of her despairing lover  tancred and clorinda  the christians in their siege of jerusalem had brought a huge rolling tower against the walls from which they battered and commanded the city with such deadly effect that the generous amazon clorinda resolved to go forth in disguise and burn it she disclosed her design to the chieftain argantes for the purpose of recommending to him the care of her damsels in case any misfortune should happen to her but the warrior jealous of the glory of such an enterprise insisted on partaking it the old king weeping for gratitude joyfully gave them leave and the soldan of egypt with a generous emulation would fain have joined them argantes was about to give him a disdainful refusal when the king interposed and persuaded the soldan to remain behind lest the city should miss too many of its best defenders at one time adding that the risk of sallying forth should be his in case the burners of the tower were pursued on their return argantes and the amazon then retired to prepare for the exploit and the magician ismeno compounded two balls of sulphur for the work of destruction  clorinda took off her beautiful helmet and her surcoat of cloth of silver and laid aside all her haughty arms and dressed herself hapless omen in black armour without polish the better to conceal herself from the enemy her faithful servant the good old eunuch arsetes who had attended her from infancy and was now following her about as well as he could with his accustomed zeal anxiously noticed what she was doing and guessing it was for some desperate enterprise entreated her by his white hairs and all the love he had shewn her to give it up finding his prayers to no purpose he requested with great emotion that she would give ear to certain matters in her family history which he at length felt it his duty to disclose it would then he said be for herself to judge whether she would persist in the enterprise or renounce it clorinda at this looked at the good man and listened with attention  not long ago said he there reigned in ethiopia and perhaps is still reigning a king named senapus who in common with his people professed the christian religion they are a black though a handsome people and the king and his queen were of the salve colour the king loved her dearly but was unfortunately so jealous that he concealed her from the sight of mankind had it been in his power i think he would have hindered the very eyes of heaven from beholding her the sweet lady however was wise and humble and did every thing she could to please him  i was not a christian myself i was a pagan slave employed among the women about the queen and making one of her special attendants  it happened that the royal bedchamber was painted with the story of a holy knight saving a maiden from a dragon1 and the maiden had a face beautifully fair with blooming cheeks the queen often prayed and wept before this picture and it made so great an impression on her particularly the maidens face that when she bore a child she saw with consternation that the infants skin was of the same fair colour this child was thyself 2  terrified with the thoughts of what her husband would feel at such a sight what a convincing proof he would hold it of a faith on her part the reverse of spotless3 she procured a babe of her own colour by means of a confidant and before thou wert baptised which is a ceremony that takes place in ethiopia later than elsewhere committed thee to my care to be brought up at a distance who shall relate the tears which thy mother poured forth and the sighs and sobs with which they were interrupted how many times when she thought she had given thee the last embrace did she not gather thee to her bosom once more at length raising her eyes to heaven she said o thou that seest into the hearts of mortals and knowest in this matter the spotlessness of mine dark though it be otherwise with frailty and with sin save i pray thee this innocent creature who is denied the milk of its mothers breast vouchsafe that she resemble her hapless parent in nothing but a chaste life and thou celestial warrior that didst deliver the maiden out of the serpents mouth if i have ever lit humble taper on thine altar and set before thee offerings of gold and incense be i implore thee her advocate be her advocate to such purpose that in every turn of fortune she may be enabled to count on thy good help here she ceased torn to her very heartstrings with a face painted of the colour of death and i weeping myself received thee and bore thee away hidden in a sweet covering of flowers and leaves  i journeyed with thee along a forest where a tiger came upon us with fury in its eyes i betook me alas to a tree and left thee lying on the ground such terror was in me and the horrible beast looked down upon thee but it fell to licking thee with its dreadful tongue and thou didst smile to it and put thy little hand to its jaws and lo it gave thee suck being a mother itself and then wonderful to relate it returned into the woods leaving me to venture down from the tree and bear thee onward to my place of refuge there in a little obscure cottage i had thee nursed for more than a year till feeling that i grew old i resolved to avail myself of the riches the queen had given me and go into my own country which was egypt i set out for it accordingly and had to cross a torrent where thieves threatened me on one side and the fierce water on the other i plunged in holding thee above the torrent with one hand till i came to an eddy that tore thee from me i thought thee lost what was my delight and astonishment on reaching the bank to find that the water itself had tossed thee upon it in safety  but i had a dream at night which seemed to shew me the cause of thy good fortune a warrior appeared before me with a threatening countenance holding a sword in my face and saying in an imperious voice obey the commands of the childs mother and of me and baptise it she is favoured of heaven and her lot is in my keeping it was i that put tenderness in the heart of the wild beast and even a will to save her in the water woe to thee if thou believest not this vision it is a message from the skies  the spirit vanished and i awoke and pursued my journey but thinking my own creed the true one and therefore concluding the dream to be false i baptised thee not i bred thee what i was myself a pagan and thou didst grow up and become great and wonderful in arms surpassing the deeds of men and didst acquire riches and lands and what thy life has been since then knowest as well as i ay and thou knowest mine own ways too how i have followed and cautiously waited on thee ever being to thee both as a servant and father  now yesterday morning as i lay heavily asleep in consequence of my troubled mind the same figure of the warrior made its appearance but with a countenance still more threatening and speaking in a louder voice wretch it exclaimed the hour is approaching when clorinda shall end both her life and her belief she is mine in despite of thee misery be thine with these words it darted away as though it flew  consider then delight of my soul what these dreams may portend they threaten thee terrible things for what reason i know not can it be that mine own faith is the wrong one and that of thy parents the right ah take thought at least and repress this daring courage lay aside these arms that frighten me  tears hindered the old man from saying more clorinda grew thoughtful and felt something of dread for she had had a like kind of dream at length however cheerfully looking up she said i must follow the faith i was bred in the faith which thou thyself bredst me in although thy words would now make me doubt it neither can i give up the enterprise that calls me forth such a withdrawal is not to be expected of an honourable soul death may put on the worst face it pleases i shall not retreat  the intrepid maiden however did her best to console her good friend but the time having arrived for the adventure she finally bade him be of good heart and so left him  silently and in the middle of the night argantes and clorinda took their way down the hills of jerusalem and quitting the gates went stealthily towards the site of the tower but its everwatchful guards were alarmed they demanded the watchword and not receiving it cried out to arms to arms the dauntless adventurers plunged forwards with their swords they dashed aside every assailant pitched the balls of sulphur into the machine and in a short time in the midst of a daring conflict had the pleasure of seeing the smoke and the flame arise and the whole tower blazing to its destruction a terrible sight it was to the christians waked up they came crowding to the place and the two companions notwithstanding their skill and audacity were compelled to make a retreat the besieged with the king at their head now arrived also crowding on the walls and the gate was opened to let the adventurers in the soldan issued forth at the same moment to cover the retreat argantes was forced through the gate by clorinda in spite of himself and she but for a luckless antagonist would have followed him but a soldier aiming at her a last blow she rushed back to give the man his death and in the confusion of the moment the warders believing her to have entered shut up the gate and the heroine was left without  behind clorinda was the gatebefore and round about her was a host of foes and surely at that moment she thought that her life was drawing to its end finding however that her dark armour befriended her in the tumult she mingled with the enemy as though she had been one of themselves and so by degrees picked her way through the confusion caused by the fire as the wolf with its bloody mouth seeks covert in the woods even so clorinda got clear out of the multitude into the darkness and the open country  not however so clear alas but that tancred perceived hertancred her foe in creed but her adoring lover whose heart she had conquered in the midst of strife and whose passion for her she knew but now she knew not that he had seen her nor did he poor valiant wretch know that the knight in black armour whom he pursued was a woman and clorinda tancred had seen the warrior strike down the assailant at the gate he had watched him as he picked his way to escape and clorinda now heard the unknown tancred coming swiftly on horseback behind her as she was speeding round towards another gate in hopes of being let in  the heroine at length turned and said how now friendwhat is thy business  death answered the pursuer  thou shalt have it replied the maiden  the knight as his enemy was on foot dismounted in order to render the combat equal and their swords are drawn in fury and the fight begins4  worthy of the brightest daytime was that fightworthy of a theatre full of valiant beholders be not displeased o night that i draw it out of thy bosom and set it in the serene light of renown the splendour will but the more exhibit the great shade of thy darkness  no trial was this of skillno contest of warding and traversing and taking heedno artful interchange of blows now pretended now given in earnest now glancing nighttime and rage flung aside all consideration the swords horribly clashed and hammered on one another not a cut descended in vainnot a thrust was without substance shame and fury aggravated one another every blow became fiercer than the last they closedthey could use their blades no longer they dashed the pummels of their swords at one anothers faces they butted and shouldered with helm and buckler three times the man threw his arms round the woman with other embraces than those of lovethree times they returned to their swords and cut and slashed one anothers bleeding bodies till at length they were obliged to hold back for the purpose of taking breath  tancred and clorinda stood fronting one another in the darkness leaning on their swords for want of strength the last star in the heavens was fading in the tinge of dawn and tancred saw that his enemy had lost more blood than himself and it made him proud and joyful oh foolish mind of us humans elated at every fancy of success poor wretch for what dost thou rejoice how sad will be thy victory what a misery to look back upon thy delight every drop of that blood will be paid for with worlds of tears  dimly thus looking at one another stood the combatants bleeding a while in peace at length tancred who wished to know his antagonist said it hath been no good fortune of ours to be compelled thus to fight where nobody can behold us but we have at least become acquainted with the good swords of one another let me request therefore if to request any thing at such a time be not unbecoming that i may be no stranger to thy name permit me to learn whatever be the result who it is that shall honour my death or my victory  i am not accustomed answered the fierce maiden to disclose who i am nor shall i disclose it now suffice to hear that thou seest before thee one of the burners of the tower  tancred was exasperated at this discovery in an evil moment cried he hast thou said it thy silence and thy speech alike disgust me into the combat again they dash feeble as they were ferocious indeed is the strife in which skill is not thought of and strength itself is dead in which valour rages instead of contends and feebleness becomes hate and fury oh the gates of blood that were set open in wounds upon wounds if life itself did not come pouring forth it was only because scorn withheld it  as in the Ægean sea when the south and north winds have lost the violence of their strength the billows do not subside nevertheless but retain the noise and magnitude of their first motion so the continued impulse of the combatants carried them still against one another hurling them into mutual injury though they had scarcely life in their bodies5  and now the fatal hour has come when clorinda must die the sword of tancred is in her bosom to the very hilt the stomacher under the cuirass which enclosed it is filled with a hot flood  her legs give way beneath her she fallsshe feels that she is departing the conqueror with a still threatening countenance prepares to follow up his victory and treads on her as she lies  but a new spirit had come upon herthe spirit which called the beloved of heaven to itself and speaking in a sorrowing voice she thus uttered her last words  my friend thou hast conqueredi forgive thee forgive thou me not for my bodys sake which fears nothing but for the sake alas of my soul baptise me i beseech thee  there was something in the voice as the dying person spake these words that went he knew not why to the heart of tancred the tears forced themselves into his eyes not far off there was a little stream and the conqueror went to it and filled his helmet and returning prepared for the pious office by unlacing his adversarys helmet his hands trembled when he first beheld the forehead though he did not yet know it but when the vizor was all down and the face disclosed he remained without speech and motion  oh the sight oh the recognition  he did not die he summoned up all the powers within him to support his heart for that moment he resolved to hold up his duty above his misery and give life with the sweet water to her whom he had slain with sword he dipped his fingers in it and marked her forehead with the cross and repeated the words of the sacred office and while he was repeating them the sufferer changed countenance for joy and smiled and seemed to say in the cheerfulness of her departure the heavens are openingi go in peace a paleness and a shade together then came over her countenance as if lilies had been mixed with violets she looked up at heaven and heaven itself might be thought for very tenderness to be looking at her and then she raised a little her hand towards that of the knight for she could not speak and so gave it him in sign of goodwill and with his pressure of it her soul passed away and she seemed asleep  but tancred no sooner beheld her dead than all the strength of mind which he had summoned up to support him fell flat on the instant he would have given way to the most frantic outcries but life and speech seemed to be shut up in one point in his heart despair seized him like death and he fell senseless beside her and surely he would have died indeed had not a party of his countrymen happened to come up they were looking for water and had found it and they discovered the bodies at the same time the leader knew tancred by his arms the beautiful body of clorinda though he deemed her a pagan he would not leave exposed to the wolves so he directed them both to be carried to the pavilion of tancred and there placed in separate chambers  dreadful was the waking of tancrednot for the solemn whispering around himnot for his aching wounds terrible as they werebut for the agony of the recollection that rushed upon him he would have gone staggering out of the pavilion to seek the remains of his clorinda and save them from the wolves but his friends told him they were at hand under the curtain of his own tent a gleam of pleasure shot across his face and be staggered into the chamber but when he beheld the body gored with his own hand and the face calm indeed but calm like a pale night without stars he trembled so that he would have sunk to the ground but for his supporters  o sweet face he exclaimed thou mayst be calm now but what is to calm me o hand that was held up to me in sign of peace and forgiveness to what have i brought thee wretch that i am i do not even weep mine eyes are as cruel as my hands my blood shall be shed instead  and with these words he began tearing off the bandages which the surgeons had put upon him and he thrust his fingers into his wounds and would have slain himself thus outright had not the pain made him faint away  he was then taken back to his own chamber godfrey came in the mean time with the venerable hermit peter and when the sufferer awoke they addressed him in kind words which even his impatience respected but it was not to be calmed till the preacher put on the terrors of religion remonstrating with him as an ingrate to god and threatening him with the doom of a sinner the tears then crept into his eyes and he tried to be patient and in some degree was soonly breaking out ever and anon now into exclamations of horror and now into fond lamentations talking as if with the shade of his beloved  thus lay tancred for days together ever woful till falling asleep one night towards the dawn the shade of clorinda did indeed appear to him more beautiful than ever and clad in light and joy she seemed to stoop and wipe the tears from his eyes and then said behold how happy i am behold me o beloved friend and see how happy and bright and beautiful i am and consider that it is all owing to thyself twas thou that tookst me out of the false path and made me worthy of admission among saints and angels there in heaven i love and rejoice and there i look to see thee in thine appointed time after which we shall both love the great god and one another for ever and ever be faithful and command thyself and look to the end for lo as far as it is permitted to a blessed spirit to love mortality even now i love thee  with these words the eyes of the vision grew bright beyond mortal beauty and then it turned and was hidden in the depth of its radiance and disappeared  tancred slept a quiet sleep and when he awoke he gave himself patiently up to the will of the physician and the remains of clorinda were gathered into a noble tomb6   footnote 1 st george  footnote 2 this fiction of

the christians had now commenced their attack on jerusalem and brought a great rolling tower against the walls built from the wood of a forest in the neigbbourhood when the malignant spirit who has never ceased his war with heaven cast in his mind how he might best defeat their purpose it was necessary to divide their forces to destroy their tower to hinder them from building another and to make one final triumphant effort against the whole progress of their arms  forgetting how the right arm of god could launch its thunderbolts the fiend accordingly seated himself on his throne and ordered his powers to be brought together the tartarean trumpet with its hoarse voice called up the dwellers in everlasting darkness the huge black caverns trembled to their depths and the blind air rebellowed with the thunder the bolt does not break forth so horribly when it comes bursting after the flash out of the heavens nor had the world before ever trembled with such an earthquake1  the gods of the abyss came thronging up on all sides through the gatesterriblelooking beings with unaccountable aspects dispensers of death and horror with their eyessome stamping with hoofs some rolling on enormous spirestheir faces human their hair serpents there were thousands of shameless harpies of pallid gorgons of barking scyllas of chimeras that vomited ashes and of monsters never before heard or thought of with perverse aspects all mixed up in one  the power of evil sat looking down upon them huger than a rock in the sea or an alp with forked summits a certain horrible majesty augmented the terrors of his aspect his eyes reddened his poisonous look hung in the air like a comet the mouth as it opened in the midst of clouds of beard seemed an abyss of darkness and blood and out of it as from a volcano issued fires and vapours and disgust  satan laid forth to his dreadful hearers his old quarrel with heaven and its new threats of an extension of its empire christendom was to be brought into asia their worshippers were to perish souls were to be rescued from their devices and satans kingdom on earth put an end to he exhorted them therefore to issue forth once for all and prevent this fatal consummation by the destruction of the christian forces some of the leaders he bade them do their best to disperse others to slay others to draw into effeminate pleasures into rebellion into the ruin of the whole camp so that not a vestige might remain of its existence  the assembly broke up with the noise of hurricanes they issued forth to look once more upon the stars and to sow seeds every where of destruction to the christians satan himself followed them and entered the heart of hydraotes king of damascus  hydraotes was a wizard as well as a king and held the christians in abhorrence but he was wise enough to respect their valour and with satans help he discerned the likeliest way to counteract it he had a niece who was the greatest beauty of the age he had taught her his art and he concluded that the enchantments of beauty and magic united would prove irresistible he therefore disclosed to her his object he told her that every artifice was lawful when the intention was to serve ones country and ones faith and he conjured her to do her utmost to separate godfrey himself from his army or in the event of that not being possible to bring away as many as she could of his noblest captains  armida for that was her name proud of her beauty and of the unusual arts that she had acquired took her way the same evening alone and by the most sequestered pathsa female in gown and tresses issuing forth to conquer an army2  she had not travelled many days ere she came in sight of the christian camp the outskirts of which she entered immediately the frenchmen all flocked to see her wondering who she was and who could have sent them so lovely a messenger armida passed onwards not with a misgiving air not with an unalluring and yet not with an immodest one her golden tresses she suffered at one moment to escape from under her veil and at another she gathered them again within it her rosy mouth breathed simplicity as well as voluptuousness her bosom was so artfully draped as to let itself be discerned without seeming to intend it and thus she passed along surprising and transporting every body coming at length among the tents of the officers she requested to be shewn that of the leader and eustace eagerly stepped forward to conduct her  eustace was the younger brother of godfrey he had all the ardour of his time of life and the gallantry in every respect of a frenchman after paying her a profusion of compliments and learning that she was a fugitive in distress he promised her every thing which his brothers authority and his own sword could do for her and so led her into godfreys presence  the pretended fugitive made a lowly obeisance and then stood mute and blushing till the general reassured her she then told him that she was the rightful queen of damascus whose throne was usurped by an uncle that her uncle sought her death from which she had been saved by the man who was bribed to inflict it and that although her creed was mahometan she had brought her mind to conclude that so noble an enemy as godfrey would take pity on her condition and permit some of his captains to aid the secret wishes of her people and seat her on the throne ten selected chiefs would overcome she said all opposition and she promised in return to become his grateful and faithful vassal  the leader of the christian army sat a while in deliberation his heart was inclined to befriend the lady but his prudence was afraid of a pagan artifice he thought also that it did not become his piety to turn aside from the enterprise which god had favoured he therefore gave her a gentle refusal but added that should success attend him and jerusalem be taken he would instantly do what she required  armida looked down and wept a mixture of indignation and despair appeared to seize her and exclaiming that she had no longer a wish to live she accused she said not a heart so renowned for generosity as his but heaven itself which had steeled it against her what was she to do she could not remain in his camp virgin modesty forbade that she was not safe out of its bounds her enemies tracked her steps it was fit that she should die by her own hand  an indignant pity took possession of the french officers they wondered how godfrey could resist the prayers of a creature so beautiful and eustace openly though respectfully remonstrated he said that if ten of the best of his captains could not be spared ten others might that it especially became the christians to redress the wrongs of the innocent that the death of a tyrant instead of being a deviation from the service of god was one of the directest means of performing it and that france would never endure to hear that a lady had applied to her knights for assistance and found her suit refused  a murmur of approbation followed the words of eustace his companions pressed nearer to the general and warmly urged his request  godfrey assented to a wish expressed by so many but not with perfect goodwill he bade them remember that the measure was the result of their own opinion not his and concluded by requesting them at all events for his sake to moderate the excess of their confidence the transported warriors had scarcely any answer to make but that of congratulations to the lady she on her side while mischief was rejoicing in her heart first expressed her gratitude to all in words intermixed with smiles and tears and then carried herself towards every one in particular in the manner which she thought most fitted to ensnare she behaved to this person with cordiality to that with comparative reserve to one with phrases only to another with looks besides and intimations of secret preference the ardour of some she repressed but still in a manner to rekindle it to others she was all gaiety and attraction and when others again had their eyes upon her she would fall into fits of absence and shed tears as if in secret and then look up suddenly and laugh and put on a cheerful patience and thus she drew them all into her net  yet none of all these men confessed that passion impelled them every body laid his enthusiasm to the account of honoureustace particularly because he was most in love he was also very jealous especially of the heroical rinaldo prince of este and as the squadron of horse to which they both belongedthe greatest in the armyhad lately been deprived of its chief eustace cast in his mind how he might keep rinaldo from going with armida and at the same time secure his own attendance on her by advancing him to the vacant post he offered his services to rinaldo for the purpose not without such emotion as let the hero into his secret but as the latter had no desire to wait on the lady he smilingly assented agreeing at the same time to assist the wishes of the lover the emissaries of satan however were at work in all quarters if eustace was jealous of rinaldo as a rival in love gernando prince of norway another of the squadron that had lost its chief was no less so of his gallantry in war and of his qualifications for being his commander gernando was a haughty barbarian who thought that every sort of preeminence was confined to princes of blood royal he heard of the proposal of eustace with a disgust that broke into the unworthiest expressions he even vented it in public in the open part of the camp when rinaldo was standing at no great distance and the words coming to the heros ears and breaking down the tranquillity of his contempt the latter darted towards him sword in hand and defied him to single combat gernando beheld death before him but made a show of valour and stood on his defence a thousand swords leaped forth to back him mixed with as many voices and half the camp of godfrey tried to withhold the impetuous youth who was for deciding his quarrel without the generals leave but the heros transport was not to be stopped he dashed through them all forced the norwegian to encounter him and after a storm of blows that dazzled the mans eyes and took away his senses ran his sword thrice through the princes body he then sent the blade into its sheath reeking as it was and taking his way back to his tent reposed in the calmness of his triumph  the victor had scarcely gone when the general arrived on the ground he beheld the slain prince of norway with acute feelings of regret what was to become of his army if the leaders thus quarrelled among themselves and his authority was set at nought the friends of the slain man increased his anger against rinaldo by charging him with all the blame of the catastrophe the heros friend tancred assuaged it somewhat by disclosing the truth and then ventured to ask pardon for the outbreak but the wise commander skewed so many reasons why such an offence could not be overlooked and his countenance expressed such a determination to resent it that the gallant youth hastened secretly to his friend and urged him to quit the camp till his services should be needed rinaldo at first called for his arms and was bent on resisting every body who came to seize him had it been even godfrey himself but tancred shewing him how unjust that would be and how fatal to the christian cause he consented with an ill grace to depart he would take nobody with him but two squires and he went away raging with a sense of ill requital for his achievements but resolving to prove their value by destroying every infidel prince that he could encounter  armida now tried in vain to make an impression on the heart of godfrey he was insensible to all her devices but she succeeded in quitting the camp with her ten champions lots were drawn to determine who should go and all who failed to be in the listeustace among themwere so jealous of the rest that at nighttime after the others had been long on the road they set out to overtake them each by himself and all in violation of their soldierly words the ten opposed them as they came up but to no purpose armida reconciled them all in appearance by feigning to be devoted to each in secret and thus she rode on with them many a mile till she came to a castle on the dead sea where she was accustomed to practise her unfriendliest arts  meanwhile news came to godfrey that his egyptian enemies were at hand with a great fleet and that his caravan of provisions had been taken by the robbers of the desert his army was thus threatened with ruin from desertion starvation and the sword he maintained a calm and even a cheerful countenance but in his thoughts he had great anxiety  part the second  armidas hate and love  the castle to which armida took her prisoners occupied an island close to the shore in the loathsome dead sea they entered it by means of a narrow bridge but if their pity had been great at seeing her forced to take refuge in a spot so desolate and repulsive how pleasingly was it changed into as great a surprise at finding a totally different region within the walls the gardens were extensive and lovely the rivulets and fountains as sweet as the flowery thickets they watered the breezes refreshing the skies of a sapphire blue and the birds were singing round about them in the trees her riches astonished them no less the side of the castle that looked on the gardens was all marble and gold a banquet awaited them beside a water on a shady lawn consisting of the exquisitest viands on the costliest plate and a hundred beautiful maidens attended them while they feasted the enchantress was all smiles and delight and such was her art that although she bestowed no favour on any body beyond his banquet and his hopes every body thought himself the favoured lover  but no sooner was the feast over than the greatest and worst of their astonishments ensued the lady quitted them saying she should return presently she did so with a troubled and unfriendly countenance having a book in one hand and a little wand in the other she read in the book in a low voice and while she was reading shook the little wand and the guests altering in every part of their being and shrinking into minute bodies felt an inclination which they obeyed to plunge into the water beside them they were fish in a little while they were again men looking her in the face with dread and amazement she had restored them to their humanity she regarded them with a severe countenance and said you have tasted my power i can exercise it far more terriblycan put you in dungeons for evercan turn you to roots in the groundto flints within the rock beware of my wrath and please me quit your faiths for mine and fight against the blasphemer godfrey  every christian but one rejected her alternative with abhorrence him she made one of her champions the rest were tied and bound and after being kept a while in a dungeon were sent off as a present to the king of egypt with an escort that came from damascus to fetch them  exulting was left the fair and bigoted magician but she little guessed what a new fortune awaited them on the road the discord with which the powers of evil had seconded her endeavours to weaken the christian camp had turned in this instance against herself it had made rinaldo a wanderer it had brought his wanderings into this very path and he now met the prisoners and bade defiance to the escort a battle ensued in which the hero won his accustomed victory the christians receiving the armour of their foes joyfully took their way back to the camp and one of the escort who escaped the slaughter returned to armida with news of the deliverance of her captives  the mortified enchantress took horse and went in pursuit of rinaldo with wrath and vengeance in her heart she tracked him from place to place till she knew he must arrive on the banks of the orontes and there making a stealthy circuit she cast a spell and lay in wait for him in a little island which divided the stream in two3  rinaldo came up with his squires he beheld on the bank a pillar of white marble and beside it on the water a little boat the pillar presented an inscription inviting travellers to cross to the island and behold a wonder of the world the hero accepted the invitation but as the boat was too small to hold more than one person and the circumstance probably an appeal to his courage he bade his squires wait for him and proceeded by himself  on reaching the island and casting his eyes eagerly round about the adventurer could discern nothing but trees and grottos flowers and grass and water he thought himself trifled with but as the spot was beautiful and refreshing he took off his helmet resolving to stay a little and repose he crossed to the farther side of the island and lay down on the riverside on a sudden he observed the water bubble and gurgle in a manner that was very strange and presently the top of a head arose with beautiful hair then the face of a damsel then the bosom the fair creature stood half out of the stream and warbled a song so luxurious and so lulling that the little wind there was seemed to fall in order to listen and the young warrior was so drowsed with the sweetness that languor crept through all his senses and he slept armida came from out a thicket and looked on him she had resolved that he should perish but when she saw how placidly he breathed and what an intimation of beautiful eyes there was in his very eyelids she hung over him still looking  in a little while she sat down by his side always looking she hung over him as narcissus did over the water and indignation melted out of her heart she cooled his face with her veil she made a fan of it she gave herself up to the worship of those hidden eyes of an enemy she became a lover4  armida gathered trails of roses and lilies from the thickets around her and cast a spell on them and made bands with which she fettered his sleeping limbs and then she called her nymphs and they put him into her ear and she went away with him through the air far off even to one of the fortunate islands in the great ocean where her jealousy assisted by her art would be in dread of no visitors no discovery she bore him to the top of a mountain and cast a spell about the mountain to make the top lovely and the sides inaccessible she put shapes of wild beasts and monsters in the woods of the lowest region and heaps of ice in the second and alluring and betraying shapes and enchantments towards the summit and round the summit she put walls and labyrinths of inextricable error and in the heart of these was a palace by a lake and the loveliest of gardens  mere rinaldo was awaked by love and beauty and here for the present he is left  part the third  the terrors of the enchanted forest  meantime the siege of the holy city had gone on with various success on either side but chiefly to the loss of the christians the machinations of satan were prevailing rinaldo in his absence was thought to have been slain by the contrivance of godfrey which nearly produced a revolt of the forces godfrey was himself wounded in battle by clorinda and now the great wooden tower was burnt and clorinda slain in consequence as you have heard in another place which oppressed the courage of tancred with melancholy  on the other hand the powers of evil were far from being as prosperous as they wished they had lost the soul of clorinda they had seen godfrey healed by a secret messenger from heaven who dropt celestial balsam into his wound they had seen the return of armidas prisoners who had arrived just in time to change the fortune of a battle and drive the pagans back within their walls and worse than all they had again felt the arm of st michael who had threatened them with worse consequences if they reappeared in the contest  the fiends however had colleagues on earth who plotted for them meanwhile the christians had set about making another tower but in this proceeding they were thwarted by the enchanter ismeno who cast his spells to better purpose this time than he had done in the affair of the stolen image the forest in which the christians obtained wood for these engines lay in a solitary valley not far from the camp it was very old dark and intricate and had already an evil fame as the haunt of impure spirits no shepherd ever took his flock there no pagan would cut a bough from it no traveller approached it unless he had lost his way he made a large circuit to avoid it and pointed it out anxiously to his companions  the necessity of the christians compelled them to defy this evil repute of the forest and ismeno hastened to oppose them he drew his line and uttered his incantations and called on the spirits whom st michael had rebuked bidding them come and take charge of the forestevery one of his tree as a soul of its body the spirits delayed at first not only for dread of the great angel but because they resented the biddings of mortality even in their own cause the magician however persisted and his spells becoming too powerful to be withstood presently they came pouring in by myriads occupying the whole place and rendering the very approach to it a task of fear and labour the first party of men that came to cut wood were unable to advance when they beheld the trees but turned like children and became the mockery of the camp godfrey sent them back with a chosen squadron to animate them to the work but the squadron themselves however boldly they affected to proceed lead no sooner approached the spot than they found reason to forgive the fears of the woodcutters the earth shook a great wind began rising with a sound of waters and presently every dreadful noise ever heard by man seemed mingled into one and advancing to meet themroarings of lions hissings of serpents pealings and rolls of thunder the squadron went back to godfrey and plainly confessed that it had not courage enough to enter such a place  a leader of the name of alcasto shook his head at this candour with a contemptuous smile he was a man of the stupider sort of courage without mind enough to conceive danger pretty soldiers exclaimed he to be afraid of noises and sights give the duty to me nothing shall stop alcasto though the place be the mouth of hell  alcasto went and he went farther than the rest and the trembling woodcutters once more prepared their axes but on a sudden there sprang up between them and the trees a wall of fire which girded the whole forest it had glowing battlements and towers and on these there appeared armed spirits with the strangest and most bewildering aspects alcasto retiredslowly indeed but with shame and terror nor had he the courage to reappear before his commander godfrey had him brought but could hardly get a word from his lips the man talked like one in a dream  at last tancred went he would have gone before but he had neither thought the task so difficult nor did he care for any thing that was going forward his mind was occupied with the dead clorinda he had now work that aroused him and he set out in good earnest for the forest not unmoved in his imagination but resolved to defy all appearances  arrived at the wall of fire tancred halted a moment and looked up at the visages on its battlements not without alarm many reflections passed swiftly through his mind some urging him forward others withholding but he concluded with stepping right through the fire it did not resist him he did not feel it  the fire vanished and in its stead there poured down a storm of hail and rain black as midnight this vanished also  tancred stood amazed for an instant and then passed on he was soon in the thick of the wood and for some time made his way with difficulty on a sudden he issued forth into a large open glade like an amphitheatre in which there was nothing but a cypresstree that stood in the middle the cypress was marked with hieroglyphical characters mixed with some words in the syrian tongue which he could read and these words requested the stranger to spare the fated place nor trouble the departed souls who were there shut up in the trees meantime the wind was constantly moaning around it and in the moaning was a sound of human sighs and tears  tancreds heart for a moment was overcome with awe and pity but recollecting himself and resolving to make amends for his credulity he smote with all his might at the cypress the blow wonderful to see produced an effusion of blood which dyed the grass about the root tancreds hair stood on end he smote however again with double violence resolving to see the end of the marvel and then he heard a woful voice issuing as from a tomb  hast thou not hurt me it said tancred enough already hast thou slain the human body which i once joyfully inhabited and now must thou cut and rend me even in this wretched enclosure my name was clorinda every tree which thou beholdest is the habitation of some christian or pagan soul for all come hither that are slain beneath the walls of the city compelled by i know not what power or for what reason every bough in the forest is alive and when thou cuttest down a tree thou slayest a soul  as a sick man in a dream thinks and yet thinks not that he sees some dreadful monster and notwithstanding his doubt wishes to fly from the horrible perplexity so the trembling lover though suspecting what he beheld had so frightful an image before his thoughts of clorinda weeping and wailing after death and bleeding in her very soul that he had not the heart to do more or to remain in the place he returned in bewildered sorrow to godfrey and told him all it is not in my power he said to touch another bough of that forest5  the astonished leader of the christians now made up his mind to go himself and so with prayer and valour united bring this appalling adventure to some conclusion but the hermit peter dissuaded him the holy man in an ecstacy of foreknowledge beheld the coming of the only champion fated to conclude it and godfrey himself the same night had a vision from heaven bidding him grant the petition of those who should sue him next day for the recall of rinaldo from exilerinaldo the right hand of the army as godfrey was its head  the petition was made as soon as daylight appeared and two knights carlo and ubaldo were despatched in search of the fated hero  part the fourth  the loves of rinaldo and armida  the knights with information procured on the road from a good wizard struck off for the seacoast and embarking in a pinnace which miraculously awaited them sailed along the shores of the mediterranean for the retreat of armida they saw the egyptian army assembled at gaza but hoped to return with rinaldo before it could effect anything at jerusalem they passed the mouths of the nile and alexandria and cyrene and ptolemais and the cities of the moors and the dangers of the greater and lesser whirlpools and their pilot showed them the spot where carthage stoodcarthage now a dead city whose grave is scarcely discernible for cities die kingdoms diea little sand and grass covers all that was once lofty in them and glorious and yet man forsooth disdains that he is mortal oh mind of ours inordinate and proud6  after looking towards the site of carthage they passed algiers and oran and tingitana and beheld the opposite coast of spain and then they cleared the narrow sea of gibraltar and came out into the immeasurable ocean leaving all sight of land behind them and so speeding ever onward in the billows they beheld at last a cluster of mountainous and beautiful islands the larger ones inhabited by a simple people the smaller quite wild and desolate so at least they appeared but in one of these smaller islands was the mountain on the top of which in the indulgence of every lawless pleasure lay the champion of the christian faith this the pilot shewed to the two knights and then steered the pinnace into its bay and here after a voyage of four days and nights it dropped its sails without need of anchor so mild and sheltered was the port with natural moles curving towards the entrance and evergreen woods overhead  it was evening with a beautiful sunset the knights took leave of the pilot and setting out instantly on their journey well furnished with all advices how to proceed slept that night at the foot of the mountain for they were not to begin to scale it till sunrise with the first beams of the sun they arose and ascended they had not climbed far when a serpent rushed out upon the path entirely stopping it but fled at the sound of a slender rod which ubaldo whisked as he advanced a lion for all his cavernous jaws did the same nor was greater resistance made by a whole herd of monsters they now mounted with great labour the region of ice and snow but at the top of it emerged from wintertime into summer the air was full of sweet odours yet fresh they sauntered for they could not walk fast over a velvet sward under trees by the side of a shady river and a bewitching pleasure began to invite their senses but they knew the river and bore in mind their duty it was called the river of laughter7 a little way on increasing in beauty as it went it formed a lucid pool in a dell and by the side of this pool was a table spread with every delicacy and in the midst of it two bathing damsels talking and laughing sometimes they sprinkled one another then dived then partly came up without spewing their faces then played a hundred tricks pretending all the while not to see the travellers then they became quiet and sunk gently and as they reappeared one of them rose half into sight sweetly as the morning star when it issues from the water dewy and dropping or as venus herself arose out of the froth of the sea such looked this damsel and so did the crystal moisture go dropping from her tresses then she turned her eyes towards the travellers and feigning to behold them for the first time shrunk within herself she hastened to undo the knot in which her tresses were tied up and shook them round about her and down they fell to the water thick and long enclosing that beautiful sight and yet the enclosure itself was not less beautiful so hid in the pool below and in her tresses above she glanced at the knights through her hair with a blushing gladness she blushed and she laughed at the same time and the blushing was more beautiful for the laughter and the laughter for the blushing and then she said in a voice which would alone have conquered any other hearers you are very happy to be allowed to come to this place nothing but delight is here our queen must have chosen you from a great number but be pleased first to rid you of the dust of your journey and to refresh yourselves at this table  so spake the one and the other accompanied her speech with accordant looks and gestures as the dance accompanies the music  nor was the allurement unfelt  but the companions passed on taking no notice and the bathers went sullenly under the water8  the knights passed through the gates of the park of armida and entered a labyrinth made with contrivance the most intricate here their path would have been lost but for a map traced by one who knew the secret by the help of this they threaded it in safety and issued upon a garden beautiful beyond conception every thing that could be desired in gardens was presented to their eyes in one landscape and yet without contradiction or confusionflowers fruits water sunny hills descending woods retreats into corners and grottos and what put the last loveliness upon the scene was that the art which did it all was no where discernible9 you might have supposed so exquisitely was the wild and the cultivated united that all had somehow happened not been contrived it seemed to be the art of nature herself as though in a fit of playfulness she had imitated her imitator but the temperature of the place if nothing else was plainly the work of magic for blossoms and fruit abounded at the same time the ripe and the budding fig grew on the same bough green apples were clustered upon those with red cheeks the vines in one place had small leaves and hard little grapes and in the next they laid forth their richest tapestry in the sun heavy with bunches full of wine at one time you listened to the warbling of birds and a minute after as if they had stopped on purpose nothing was heard but the whispering of winds and the fall of waters it seemed as if every thing in the place contributed to the harmony and the sweetness the notes of the turtledove were deeper here than any where else the hard oak and the chaste laurel and the whole exuberant family of trees the earth the water every element of creation seemed to have been compounded but for one object and to breathe forth the fulness of its bliss10  the two messengers hardening their souls with all their might against the enchanting impression moved forward silently among the trees till looking through the branches into a little opening which formed a bower they sawor did they but think they sawno they saw indeed the hero and his armida reclining on the grass11 her dress was careless her hair loose in the summerwind his head lay in her bosom a smile trembled on her lips and in her eyes like a sunbeam in water and as she thus looked on him with passionate love he looked up at her face to face and returned it with all his soul  now she kissed his lips now his eyes and then they looked again at one another with their everhungry looks and then she kissed him again and he gave a sigh so deep you would have thought his soul had gone out of him and passed into hers the two warriors from their covert gazed on the loving scene  at the lovers side there hung a strange accoutrement for a warrior namely a crystal mirror he rose a little on his elbow and gave it into armidas hands and in two different objects each beheld but one emotion she hers in the glass and he his own in her eyes but he would not suffer her to look long at any thing but himself and then they spake loving and adoring words and after a while armida bound up her hair and put some flowers into it as jewels might be put upon gold and added a rose or two to the lilies of her bosom and adjusted her veil and never did peacock look so proudly beautiful when he displays the pomp of his eyed plumes nor was ever the rainbow so sweetly coloured when it curves forth its dewy bosom against the light12 but lovely above all was the effect of a magic girdle which the enchantress had made with her whole art and which she never laid aside day or night spirit in it had taken substance the subtlest emotions of the soul a shape and palpability tender disdains were in it and repulses that attracted and levities that endeared and contentments full of joy and smiles and little words and drops of delicious tears and shortcoming sighs and soft kisses all these she had mingled together and made one delight out of many and wound it about her heart and wore it for a charm irresistible13  and now she kissed him once more and begged leave of a little absence for love is courteous ever and so went as usual to her books and her magic arts rinaldo remained where he was for he had no power to wish himself out of the sweet spot only he would stray a while among the trees and amuse himself with the birds and squirrels and so be a loving hermit till she returned and at night they retired under one roof still in the midst of the garden  but no sooner had armida gone than the two warriors issued from their hidingplace and stood before the lover glittering in their noble arms  as a warhorse that has been taken from the wars and become the luxurious husband of the stud wanders among the drove in the meadows in vile enjoyment should by chance a trumpet be heard in the place or a dazzling battleaxe become visible he turns towards it on the instant and neighs and longs to be in the lists and vehemently desires the rider on his back who is to dash and be dashed at in the encountereven so turned the young hero when the light of the armour flashed upon him even so longed for the war even so shook himself up out of his bed of pleasure with all his great qualities awaked and eager  ubaldo saw the movement in his heart and held right in his face the shield of adamant which had been brought for the purpose it was a mirror that shewed to the eyes of every one who looked into it the very man as he was  but when rinaldo beheld himself indeedwhen he read his transformation not in the flattering glass of the enchantress but by the light of this true and simple and severe reflectorhis hair tricked out with flowers and unguents his soft mantle of exquisitest dye and his very sword rendered undistinguishable for what it was by a garlandshame and remorse fell upon him he felt indeed like a dreamer come to himself he looked down he could not speak he wished to hide himself in the bottom of the sea  ubaldo raised his voice and spoke all europe and asia said he are in arms whoever desires fame or is a worshipper of his saviour is a fighter in the land of syria thou only o son of bertoldo remainest out of the high way of renownin luxuryin a little corner thou only unmoved with the movement of the world the champion of a girl what dream what lethargy can have drowned a valour like thine what vileness have had attraction for thee up up and with us the camp the commander himself calls for thee fortune and victory await thee come fated warrior and finish thy work see the false creed which thou hast shaken laid low beneath thy inevitable sword  on hearing these words the noble youth remained for a time without speaking without moving at length shame gave way to a passionate sense of his duty with a new fire in his cheeks he tore away the effeminate ornaments of his servitude and quitted the spot without a word in a few moments he had threaded the labyrinth he was outside the gate ere long he was descending the mountain  but meantime armida had received news of the two visitors and coming to look for them and casting her eyes down the steep she beheldwith his face alas turned no longer towards her ownthe hasty steps of her hero between his companions she wished to cry aloud but was unable she might have resorted to some of her magic devices but her heart forbade her she ran howeverfor what cared she for dignityshe ran down the mountain hoping still by her beauty and her tears to arrest the fugitive but his feet were too strong even for love she did not reach him till he had arrived on the seashore where was her pride now where the scorn she had exhibited to so many suitors where her coquetry and her selfsufficiencyher love of being loved with the power to hate the lover the enchantress was now taught what the passion was in all its despair as well as delight she cried aloud she cared not for the presence of the messengers oh go not rinaldo she cried go not or take me with thee my heart is torn to pieces take me or turn and kill me stop at least and be cruel to me here if thou hast the heart to fly me it will not be hard to thee to stay and be unkind  even the messengers were moved at this or seemed to be moved ubaldo told the fugitive that it would be heroical in him to wait and hear what the lady had to say with gentleness and firmness  his conquest over himself would then be complete  rinaldo stopped and armida came up breathless and in tearslovelier than ever she looked earnestly at him at first without a word he gave her but a glance and looked aside  as a fine singer before he lets loose his tongue in the lofty utterance of his emotion prepares the minds of his hearers with some sweet prelude exquisitely modulating in a lower toneso the enchantress whose anguish had not deprived her of all sense of her art breathed a few sighs to dispose the soul of her idol to listen and then said i do not beg thee to hear me as one that loves me we both loved once but that is over i beg thee to hear even though as one that loves me not it will cost thy disdain nothing to grant me that perhaps thou hast discovered a pleasure in hating me do so i come not to deprive thee of it if it seem just to thee just let it be i too once hated i hated the christianshated even thyself i thought it right to do so i was bred up to think it i pursued thee to do thee mischief i overtook thee i bore thee away and worse than allfor now perhaps thou loathest me for iti loved thee i loved thee for the first time that i loved any one nay i made thee love me in turn and alas i gave myself into thine arms it was wrong i was foolish i was wicked i grant that i have deserved thou shouldst think ill of me that thou shouldst punish me and quit me and hate to have any remembrance of this place which i had filled with delights go pass over the seas make war against my friends and my country destroy us all and the religion we believe in alas we do i say the religion is mine no longero thou the cruel idol of my soul oh let me go with thee if it be but as thy servant thy slave let the conqueror take with him his captive let her be mocked let her be pointed at only let her be with thee i will cut off these tresses which no longer please thee i will clothe myself in other attire and go with thee into the battle i have courage and strength enough to bear thy lance to lead thy sparehorse to be above all thy shieldbearerthy shield nothing shall touch thee but through methrough this bosom rinaldo perhaps mischance may spare thee for its sake not a word not a little word do i dare to boast of what thou hadst once a kind word for though now thou wilt neither look upon me nor speak to me  she could say no more her words were suffocated by a torrent of tears but she sought to take his hand to arrest him by his mantlein vain he could scarcely it is true restrain his tears but he did he looked sorrowful but composed and at length he said armida would i could do as thou wishest but i cannot i would relieve thee instantly of all this tumult of emotion no hate is there in him that must quit thee no such disdain as thou fanciest nothing but the melancholy and impetuous sense of his duty thou hast erred it is trueerred both in love and hate but have i not erred with thee and can i find excuse which is not found for thyself dear and honoured ever wilt thou be with rinaldo whether in joy or sorrow count me if it please thee thy champion still as far as my country and my faith permit but here in this spot must be buried all elseburied not for my sake only but for that of thy beauty thy worthiness thy royal blood consent to disparage thyself no longer peace be with thee i go where i have no permission to take thee with me be happy be wise while rinaldo was speaking in this manner armida changed colour her bosom heaved her eyes took a new kind of fire scorn rose upon her lip when he finished she looked at him with a bitterness that rejected every word he had said and then she exclaimed thou hast no such blood in thine own veins as thou canst fear to degrade thy boasted descent is a fiction base and brutish and insensible was thy stock what being of gentle blood could quit a love like mine without even a teara sigh what but the mockery of a man could call me his and yet leave me vouchsafe me his pardon as if i had offended him excuse my guilt and my tenderness he the sage of virtue and me the wretch o god and these are the men that take upon them to slaughter the innocent and dictate faiths to the world go hard heart with such peace as thou leavest in this bosom begone take thine injustice from my sight for ever my spirit will follow thee not as a help but as a retribution i shall die first and thou wilt die speedily thou wilt perish in the battle thou wilt lie expiring among the dead and bleeding and wilt call on armida in thy last moments and i shall hear ityes i shall hear it i shall look for that  down fell armida on the ground senseless and rinaldo stood over her weeping at last open thine eyes poor wretch and see him alas the heavens deny thee the consolation what will he do will he leave thee lying there betwixt dead and alive or will he gopitying thee but still going he goes he is gone he is in the bark and the wind is in the sail and he looks backever back but still goes the shore begins to be out of sight  armida woke and was alone she raved again but it was for vengeance in a few days she was with the egyptian army a queen at the head of her vassals going against the christians at jerusalem  part the fifth  the disenchantment of the forest and the taking of jerusalem c  rinaldo arrived without loss of time in the christian camp before jerusalem every body rejoiced to see the right hand of the army godfrey gladly pardoned him the hermit peter blessed him he himself retired to beg the forgiveness and favour of heaven and then he went straight to the enchanted forest  it was a beautiful morning and the forest instead of presenting its usual terrors appeared to him singularly tranquil and pleasing on entering it he heard not dreadful thunderclaps but harmonies made up of all sorts of gentle and lovely soundsbrooks whispering winds nightingales organs harps human voices he went slowly and cautiously and soon came to a beautiful river which encircled the heart of the wood a bridge of gold carried him over he had no sooner crossed it than the river higher up suddenly swelled and rushed like a torrent sweeping the bridge away the harmony meanwhile had become silent admiring but nothing daunted the hero went on  every thing as he advanced appeared to start into fresh beauty his steps produced lilies and roses here leaped up a fountain and there came falling a cascade the wood itself seemed to grow young as with sudden spring and he again heard the music and the human voices though he could see no one  passing through the trees he came into a glade in the heart of the wood in the centre of which he beheld a myrtletree the largest and most beautiful ever seen it was taller than a cypress or palm and seemed the queen of the forest looking around him he observed to his astonishment an oak suddenly cleave itself open and out of it there came a nymph a hundred other trees did the same giving birth to as many nymphs they were all habited as we see them in theatres only instead of bows and arrows each held a lute or guitar coming towards the hero with joyful eyes they formed a circle about him and danced and in their dancing they sang and bade him welcome to the haunt of their mistress their loving mistress of whom he was the only hope and joy looking as they spoke towards the myrtle rinaldo looked also and beheld issuing out of itarmida  armida came sweetly towards him with a countenance at once grieving and rejoicing but expressing above all infinite affection and do i indeed see thee again she said and wilt thou not fly me a second time am i visited to be consoled or to be treated again as an enemy is poor armida so formidable that thou must needs close up thine helmet when thou beholdest her thou mightest surely have vouchsafed her once more a sight of thine eyes let us be friends at least if we may be nothing more wilt thou not take her hand  rinaldos answer was to turn away as from a cheat to look towards the myrtletree to draw his sword and proceed with manifest intentions of assailing it she ran before him shrieking and hugged it round nay thou wilt not she said thou wilt not hurt my treenot cut and slay what is bound up with the life of armida thy sword must pass first through her bosom  armida writhed and wailed rinaldo nevertheless raised his sword and it was coming against the tree when her shape like a thing in a dream was metamorphosed as quick as lightning it became a giant a briareus wielding a hundred swords and speaking in a voice of thunder every one of the nymphs at the same instant became a cyclops tempest and earthquake ensued and the air was full of ghastly spectres  rinaldo again raised his arm with a more vehement will he struck and at the same instant every horror disappeared the sky was cloudless the forest was neither terrible nor beautiful but heavy and sombre as of olda natural gloomy wood but no prodigy  rinaldo returned to the camp his aspect that of a conqueror the silver wings of his crest the white eagle glittering in the sun the hermit peter came forward to greet him a shout was sent up by the whole camp godfrey gave him high reception nobody envied him workmen no longer trembling were sent to the forest to cut wood for the machines of war and the tower was rebuilt together with batteringrams and balistas and catapults most of them an addition to what they had before the tower also was now clothed with bullshides as a security against being set on fire and a bridge was added to the tower from which the besiegers could at once step on the citywalls  with these longdesired invigorations of his strength the commander of the army lost no time in making a general assault on jerusalem for a dove supernaturally pursued by a falcon had brought him letters intended for the besieged informing them that if they could only hold out four days longer their egyptian allies would be at hand the pagans beheld with dismay the resuscitated tower and all the new engines coming against them they fought valiantly but rinaldo and godfrey prevailed the former was the first to scale the walls the latter to plant his standard from the bridge the city was entered on all sides and the enemy driven first into solomons temple and then into the citadel or tower of david before the assault godfrey had been vouchsafed a sight of armies of angels in the air accompanied by the souls of those who had fallen before jerusalem the latter still fighting the former rejoicing so that there was no longer doubt of triumph only it still pleased heaven that human virtue should be tried  and now after farther exploits on both sides the last day of the war and the last hope of the infidels arrived at the same time for the egyptian army came up to give battle with the christians and to restore jerusalem if possible to its late owners now cramped up in one corner of itthe citadel the besiegers in their narrow hold raised a shout of joy at the sight and godfrey leaving them to be detained in it by an experienced captain went forth to meet his new opponents crowns of africa and of persia were there and the king of the indies and in the midst of all in a chariot surrounded by her knights and suitors was armida  the battle joined and great was the bravery and the slaughter on both sides it seemed at first all glitter and gaietyits streamers flying its arms flashing drums and trumpets rejoicing and horses rushing with their horsemen as to the tournament horror looked beautiful in the spectacle out of the midst of the dread itself there issued a delight but soon it was a bloody and a turbulent and a raging and a groaning thingpennons down horses and men rolling over foes heaped upon one another bright armour exchanged for blood and dirt flesh trampled and spirit fatigued brave were the pagans but how could they stand against heaven godfrey ordered every thing calmly like a divine mind rinaldo swept down the fiercest multitudes like an arm of god the besieged in the citadel broke forth only to let the conquerors in jerusalem was won before the battle was over king after king fell and yet the vanquished did not fly rinaldo went every where to hasten the rout and still had to fight and slay on armida beheld him coming where she sat in the midst of her knights he saw her and blushed a little she turned as cold as ice then as hot as fire her anger was doubled by the slaughter of her friends and with her womans hand she sent an arrow out of her bow hoping and yet even then hoping not to slay or to hurt him the arrow fell on him like a toy and he turned aside as she thought in disdain yet he disdained not to smite down her champions hope of every kind deserted her resolving to die by herself in some lonely spot she got down from her chariot to horse and fled out of the field rinaldo saw the flight and though one of the knights that remained to her struck him such a blow as made him reel in his saddle he despatched the man with another like a thunderbolt and then galloped after the fugitive  armida was in the act of putting a shaft to her bosom in order to die upon it when her arm was arrested by a mighty grasp and turning round she beheld with a shriek the beloved face of him who had caused the ruin of her and hers she closed her disdainful eyes and fainted away rinaldo supported her he loosened her girdle he bathed her bosom and her eyelids with his tears coming at length to herself still she would not look at him she would fain not have been supported by him she endeavoured with her weak fingers to undo the strong ones that clasped her she wept bitterly and at length spoke but still without meeting his eyes  and may i not she said even die must i be followed and tormented even in my last moments what mockery of a wish to save me is this i will not be watched i believe not a syllable of such pity and i will not be made a sight of and a byword i ask my life of thee no longer i want nothing but death and death itself i would not receive at such hands they would render even that felicity hateful leave me i could not be hindered long from putting an end to my miseries whatever barbarous restraint might be put upon me there are a thousand ways of dying and i will be neither hindered nor deceived nor flatteredoh never more  weeping she spokeweeping always and sobbing and full of wilful words but yet she felt all the time the arm that was round her  armida said rinaldo in a voice full of tenderness be calm and know me for what i amno enemy no conqueror nothing that intends thee shame or dishonour but thy champion thy restorerhe that will preserve thy kingdom for thee and seat thee in house and home look at melook in these eyes and see if they speak false and oh would to heaven thou wouldst indeed be as i am in faith there isnt a queen in all the east should equal thee in glory  his tears fell on her eyelids as he spokescalding tears and she looked at him and her heart reopened to its lord all love and worship and armida said behold thy handmaid dispose of her even as thou wilt  and that same day godfrey of boulogne was lord of jerusalem and paid his vows on the sepulchre of his master   footnote 1    chiama gli abitator de lombre eterne

circumstance which i mention because collins admired it see his ode on the superstitions of the highlands i confess i cannot do so it seems to me quite superfluous and when the reader finds the sword conveniently lying for the hero outside the wood as he returns the effect is childish and pantomimic if the magician wished him not to fight any more why should he give him the sword back and if it

gray it is scarcely more than a cento the commentators call it a beautiful imitation of a passage in sannazzaro and it is but the passage in sannazzaro is also beautiful it contains not only the giace cartago and the appena i segni c but the contrast of the pride with the mortality of man and above all the dying of the cities which is the finest thing in the stanza of its imitator

sbarattata     nè le può dar aiuto che le vaglia   però che orlando tanto stretto il tiene   che star con seco a fronte gli conviene    nel suo segreto fè questo pensiero     trar fuor di schiera quel conte gagliardo   e poi che ucciso labbia in su l sentiero     tornare a la battaglia senza tardo   però che a lui par facile e leggiero     cacciar soletto quel popol codardo   chè tutti insieme e l suo re galafrone   non li stimava quanto un vil bottone    con tal proposto si pone a fuggire     forte correndo sopra la pianura   il conte nulla pensa a quel fallire     anzi crede che l faccia per paura   senz altro dubbio se l pone a seguire     e già son giunti ad una selva scura   appunto in mezzo a quella selva piana   era un bel prato intorno a una fontana    fermossi ivi agricane a quella fonte     e smontò de larcion per riposare   ma non si tolse lelmo da la fronte     nè piastra o scudo si volse levare   e poco dimorò che giunse l conte     e come il vide a la fonte aspettare   dissegli cavalier tu sei fuggito   e sì forte mostravi e tanto ardito    come tanta vergogna puoi soffrire     a dar le spalle ad un sol cavaliero   forse credesti la morte fuggire     or vedi che fallito hai il pensiero   chi morir può onorato dee morire     che spesse volte avviene e di leggiero   che per durar in questa vita trista   morte e vergogna ad un tratto sacquista    agrican prima rimontò in arcione     poi con voce soave rispondia   tu sei per certo il più franco barone     chio mai trovassi ne la vita mia   e però del tuo scampo fia cagione     la tua prodezza e quella cortesia   che oggi sì grande al campo usato mhai   quando soccorso a mia gente donai    però ti voglio la vita lasciare     ma non tornasti più per darmi inciampo   questo la fuga mi fè simulare    nè vebbi altro partito a darti scampo   se pur ti piace meco battagliare     morto ne rimarrai su questo campo   ma siami testimonio il cielo e l sole   che darti morte mi dispiace e duole    il conte gli rispose molto umano     perchè avea preso già di lui pietate   quanto sei disse più franco e soprano     più di te mi rincresce in veritate   che sarai morto e non sei cristiano     ed anderai tra lanime dannate   ma se vuoi il corpo e lanima salvare   piglia battesmo e lascierotti andare    disse agricane e riguardollo in viso     se tu sei cristiano orlando sei   chi mi facesse re del paradiso     con tal ventura non la cangierei   ma sin or ti ricordo e dotti avviso     che non mi parli de fatti de dei   perchè potresti predicar invano   difenda it suo ciascun co l brando in mano    nè più parole ma trasse tranchera     e verso orlando con ardir saffronta   or si comincia la battaglia fiera     con aspri colpi di taglio e di ponta   ciascun è di prodezza una lumiera     e sterno insieme comil libro conta   da mezzo giorno insino a notte scura   sempre più franchi a la battaglia dura    ma poi che l sol avea passato il monte     e cominciossi a far il ciel stellato   prima verso del re parlava it conte     che farem disse the l giorno nè andato   disse agricane con parole pronte     ambi ci poseremo in questo prato   e domattina come il giorno appare   ritorneremo insieme a battagliare    così daccordo il partito si prese     lega il destrier ciascun come gli piace   poi sopra a lerba verde si distese     come fosse tra loro antica pace   luno a laltro vicino era e palese     orlando presso al fonte isteso giace   ed agricane al bosco più vicino   stassi colcato a lombra dun gran pino    e ragionando insieme tutta via     di cose degne e condecenti a loro   guardava il conte il ciel poscia dicia     questo the ora veggiamo è un bel lavoro   che fece la divina monarchia     la luna dargento e le stelle doro   e la luce del giorno e l sol lucente   dio tutto ha fatto per lumana gente    disse agricane io comprendo per certo     che to vuoi de la fede ragionare   io di nulla scienza son esperto     nè mai sendo fanciul volsi imparare   e ruppi il capo al maestro mio per merto     poi non si potè un altro ritrovare   che mi mostrasse libro nè scrittura   tanto ciascun avea di me paura    e così spesi la mia fanciullezza     in caccie in giochi darme e in cavalcare   nè mi par che convenga a gentilezza     star tutto il giorno ne libri a pensare   ma la forza del corpo e la destrezza     conviensi al cavaliero esercitare   dottrina al prete ed al dottor sta bene   io tanto saccio quanto mi conviene    rispose orlando io tiro teco a un seguo     che larmi son deluomo il primo onore   ma non già che l saper faccia un men degno     anzi ladorna com un prato il fiore   ed è simile a un bove a un sasso a un legno     che non pensa a leterno creatore   nè ben si puo pensar senza dottrina   la somma maestade alta e divina    disse agricane egli è gran scortesia     a voler contrastar con avvantaggio   io t ho scoperto la natura mia     e to conosco the sei dotto e saggio   se più parlassi io non risponderia     piacendoti dormir dormiti ad aggio   e se meco parlar hai pur diletto   darme o d amor a ragionar t aspetto    ora ti prego che a quel ch io domando     risponda il vero a fè d uomo pregiato   se in se veramente quell orlando     che vien tanto nel mondo nominato   e perchè qui sei giunto e come e quando     e se mai fosti ancora innamorato   perche ogni cavalier chè senza amore   se in vista è vivo vivo senza core    rispose il conte quell orlando sono     che uccise almonte el suo fratel troiano   amor m ha posto tutto in abbandono     e venir fammi in questo luogo strano   e perchè teco piu largo ragiono     voglio the sappi che l mio cor è in mano   de la figliuola del re galafrone   che ad albracca dimora nel girone    tu fai co l padre guerra a gran furore     per prender suo paese e sua castella   ed io quà son condotto per amore     e per piacer a quella damisella   molte fiate son stato per onore     e per la fede mia sopra la sella   or sol per acquistar la bella dama   faccio battaglia e daltro non ho brama    quando agrican ha nel parlare accolto     che questo è orlando ed angelica amava   fuor di misura si turbò nel volto     ma per la notte non lo dimostrava   piangeva sospirando come un stolto     lanima e l petto e l spirto gli avvampava   e tanto gelosia gli batte il core   che non è vivo e di doglia non more    poi disse a orlando tu debbi pensare     che come il giorno sarà dimostrato   debbiamo insieme la battaglia fare     e luno o laltro rimarrà su l prato   or duna cosa ti voglio pregare     che prima che vegnamo e cotal piato   quella donzella che l tuo cor disia   tu labbandoni e lascila per mia    io non potria patire essendo vivo     che altri con meco amasse il viso adorno   o luno o laltro al tutto sarà privo     del spirto e de la dama al novo giorno   altri mai non saprà che questo rivo     e questo bosco chè quivi dintorno   che labbi rifiutata in cotal loco   e in cotal tempo che sarà sì poco    diceva orlando al re le mie promesse     tutte ho servate quante mai ne fei   ma se quel che or mi chiedi io promettesse     e sio il giurassi io non lattenderei   così poria spiccar mie membra istesse     e levarmi di fronte gli occhi miei   e viver senza spirto e senza core   come lasciar d angelica lamore    il re agrican che ardeva oltre misura     non puote tal risposta comportare   benchè sia l mezzo de la notte scura     prese bajardo e su v ebbe a montare   ed orgoglioso con vista sicura     isgrida al conte ed ebbel a sfidare   dicendo cavalier la dama gaglia   lasciar convienti o far meco battaglia    era già il conte in su l arcion salito     perchè come si mosse il re possente   temendo dal pagan esser tradito     saltò sopra l destrier subitamente   onde rispose con animo ardito     lasciar colei non posso per niente   e sio potess ancora io non vorria   avertela convien per altra via    come in mar la tempesta a gran fortuna     cominciarno l assalto i cavalieri   nel verde prato per la notte bruna

trees   and leave the two companions there alone    one surely dead the other scarcely less   long time medoro lay without a groan     losing his blood in such large quantities   that life would surely have gone out at last   had not a helping hand been coming past    there came by chance a damsel passing there     dressd like a shepherdess in lowly wise   but of a royal presence and an air     noble as handsome with clear maiden eyes   tis so long since i told you news of her     perhaps you know her not in this disguise   this you must know then was angelica   proud daughter of the khan of great cathay    you know the magic ring and her distress     well when she had recoverd this same ring   it so increasd her pride and haughtiness     she seemd too high for any living thing   she goes alone desiring nothing less     than a companion even though a king   she even scorns to recollect the flame   of one orlando or his very name    but above all she hates to recollect     that she had taken to rinaldo so   she thinks it the last want of selfrespect     pure degradation to have lookd so low   such arrogance said cupid must be checkd     the little god betook him with his bow   to where medoro lay and standing by   held the shaft ready with a lurking eye    now when the princess saw the youth all pale     and found him grieving with his bitter wound   not for what one so young might well bewail     but that his king should not be laid in ground   she felt a something strange and gentle steal     into her heart by some new way it found   which touchd its hardness and turnd all to grace   and more so when he told her all his case    and calling to her mind the little arts     of healing which she learnt in india   for twas a study valued in those parts     even by those who were in sovereign sway   and yet so easy too that like the hearts     twas more inherited than learnt they say   she cast about with herbs and balmy juices   to save so fair a life for all its uses    and thinking of an herb that caught her eye     as she was coming in a pleasant plain   whether twas panacea dittany     or some such herb accounted sovereign   for stanching blood quickly and tenderly     and winning out all spasm and bad pain   she found it not far off and gathering some   returned with it to save medoros bloom    in coming back she met upon the way     a shepherd who was riding through the wood   to find a heifer that had gone astray     and been two days about the solitude   she took him with her where medoro lay     still feebler than he was with loss of blood   so much he lost and drew so hard a breath   that he was now fast fading to his death    angelica got off her horse in haste     and made the shepherd get as fast from his   she ground the herbs with stones and then expressd     with her white hands the balmy milkiness   then droppd it in the wound and bathd his breast     his stomach feet and all that was amiss   and of such virtue was it that at length   the blood was stoppd and he lookd round with strength    at last he got upon the shepherds horse     but would not quit the place till he had seen   laid in the ground his lord and masters corse     and cloridan lay with it who had been   smitten so fatally with sweet remorse     he then obeyd the will of the fair queen   and she for very pity of his lot   went and stayd with him at the shepherds cot    nor would she leave him she esteemd him so     till she had seen him well with her own eye   so full of pity did her bosom grow     since first she saw him faint and like to die   seeing his manners now and beauty too     she felt her heart yearn somehow inwardly   she felt her heart yearn somehow till at last   twas all on fire and burning warm and fast    the shepherds home was good enough and neat     a little shady cottage in a dell   the man had just rebuilt it all complete     with room to spare in case more births befell   there with such knowledge did the lady treat     her handsome patient that he soon grew well   but not before she had on her own part   a secret wound much greater in her heart    much greater was the wound and deeper far     which the sweet arrow made in her hearts strings   twas from medoros lovely eyes and hair     twas from the naked archer with the wings   she feels it now she feels and yet can bear     anothers less than her own sufferings   she thinks not of herself she thinks alone   how to cure him by whom she is undone    the more his wound recovers and gets ease     her own grows worse and widens day by day   the youth gets well the lady languishes     now warm now cold as fitful fevers play   his beauty heightens like the flowering trees     she miserable creature melts away   like the weak snow which some warm sun has found   falln out of season on a rising ground    and must she speak at last rather than die     and must she plead without anothers aid   she must she must the vital moments fly     she livesshe dies a passionwasted maid   at length she bursts all ties of modesty     her tongue explains her eyes the words are said   and she asks pity underneath that blow   which he perhaps that gave

  o agrican how hard twould seem to you   whose love was met by nothing but disdain     and vile repulses shocking to go through   o ferragus o thousands who in vain     did all that loving and great hearts could do   how would ye feel to see with all her charms   this thankless creature in a striplings arms    the young medoro had the gathering     of the worlds rose the rose untouchd before

think fit to go     but spent the month and more within the wood   the lady to the stripling seemed to grow     his step her step his eyes her eyes pursued   nor did her love lose any of its zest   though she was always hanging on his breast    in doors and out of doors by night by day     she had the charmer by her side for ever   morning and evening they would stroll away     now by some field

and all this while there was not a smooth tree     that stood by stream or fountain with glad breath   nor stone less hard than stones are apt to be     but they would find a knife to carve it with   and in a thousand places you might see     and on the walls about you and beneath   angelica and medoro tied in one   as many ways as lovers knots can run    and when they thought they had outspent

      no iv  the death of clorinda    tasso    ma ecco omai lora fatale è giunta     che l viver di clorinda al suo fin deve   spinge egli il ferro nel bel sen di punta     che vi simmerge e l sangue avido beve   e la veste che dor vago trapunta     le mammelle stringea tenera e leve   lempie dun caldo fiume ella già sente   morirsi e l piè le manea egro e languente    quel segue la vittoria e la trafitta     vergine minacciando incalza e preme   ella mentre cadea la voce afitta     movendo disse le parole estreme   parole cha lei novo on spirto ditta     spirto di fè di carità di speme   virtù chor dio le infonde e se rubella   in vita fu la vuole in morte ancella    amico hai vinto io ti perdon perdona     tu ancora al corpo no che nulla pave   allalma sì deh per lei prega e dona     battesmo a me chogni mia colpe lave   in queste voci languide risuona     un non so che di flebile e soave   che al cor gli serpe ed ogni sdegno ammorza   e gli occhi a lagrimar gl invoglia e sforza    poco quindi lontan nel sen del monte     scaturía mormorando an picciol rio   egli vaccorse e lelmo empiè nel fonte     e tornò mesto al grande ufficio e pio   tremar sentì la man mentre la fronte     non conosciuta ancor sciolse e scoprio   la vide e la conobbe e restò senza   e voce e moto ahi vista ahi cognoscenza    non morì già che sue virtuti accolse     tutte in quel punto e in guardia al cor le mise   e premendo il suo affanno a dar si volse     vita collacqua a chi col ferro uccise   mentre egli il suon de sacri detti sciolse     colei di gioia trasmutossi e rise   e in atto di morir lieto e vivace   dir parea sapre il cielo io vado in pace    dun bel pallore ha il bianco volto asperso     come a gigli sarian miste viole   e gli occhi al cielo affisa e in lei converso     sembra per la pietate il cielo e l sole   e la man nuda e fredda alzando verso     il cavaliero in vece di parole   gli dà pegno di pace in questa forma   passa la bella donna e par che dorma    come lalma gentile uscita ei vede     rallenta quel vigor chavea raccolto   e limperio di sè libero cede     al duol già fatto impetuoso e stolto   ch al cor si stringe e chiusa in breve sede     la vita empie di morte i sensi e l volto   già simile all estinto il vivo langue   al colore al silenzio agli atti al sangue    e ben la vita sua sdegnosa e schiva     spezzando a sforza il suo ritegno frale   la bellanima sciolta alfin seguiva     che poco innanzi a lei spiegava lale   ma quivi stuol de franchi a caso arriva     cui trae bisogno d acqua o daltro tale   e con la donna il cavalier ne porta   in sè mal vivo e morto in lei chè morta                                       no v  tancred in the enchanted forest  the same    era in prence tancredi intanto sorto     a seppellir la sua diletta amica   e benchè in volto sia languido e smorto     e mal atto a portar elmo e lorica   nulladimen poi che l bisogno ha scorto     ei non ricusa il rischio o la fatica   che l cor vivace il suo vigor trasfonde   al corpo sì che par chesso nabbonde    vassene il valoroso in sè ristretto     e tacito e guardingo al rischio ignoto   e sostien della selva il fero aspetto     e l gran romor del tuono e del tremoto   e nulla sbigottisce e sol nel petto     sente ma tosto il seda un picciol moto   trapassa ed ecco in quel silvestre loco   sorge improvvisa la città del foco    allor s arretra e dubbio alquanto resta     fra sè dicendo or qui che vaglion larmi   nelle fauci de mostri e n gola a questa     divoratrice fiamma andrò a gettarmi   non mai la vita ove cagione onesta     del comun pro la chieda altri risparmi   ma nè prodigo sia d anima grande   uom denso e tale è ben chi qui la spande    pur loste che dirà sindarno io riedo     qual altra selva ha di troncar speranza   nè intentato lasciar vorrà goffredo     mai questo varco or soltre alcun savanza   forse lincendio che qui sorto i vedo     fia deffetto minor che sembianza   ma seguane che puote e in questo dire   dentro saltovvi oh memorando ardire    nè sotto larme già sentir gli parve     caldo o fervor come di foco intenso   ma pur se fosser vere fiamme o larve     mal potè giudicar sì tosto il senso   perchè repente appena tocco sparve     quel simulacro e giunse un nuvol denso   che portò notte e verno e l verno ancora   e lombra dileguossi in picciolora    stupido sì ma intrepido rimane     tancredi e poichè vede il tutto cheto   mette securo il piè nelle profane     soglie e spia della selva ogni secreto   nè più apparenze inusitate e strane     nè trova alcun per via scontro o divieto   se non quanto per sè ritarda il bosco   la vista e i passi inviluppato e fosco    alfine un largo spazio in forma scorge     danfiteatro e non è pianta in esso   salvo che nel suo mezzo altero sorge     quasi eccelsa piramide un cipresso   colà si drizza e nel mirar s accorge     ch era di varj segni il tronco impresso   simil a quei chè in vece usò di scritto   lantico già misterioso egitto    fra i segni ignoti alcune note ha scorte     del sermon di soria chei ben possiede   o tu che dentro ai chiostri della morte     osasti por guerriero audace il piede   deh se non sei crudel quanto sei forte     deh non turbar questa secreta sede   perdona allalme omai di luce prive   non dee guerra co morti aver chi vive    così dicea quel motto egli era intento     delle brevi parole ai segni occulti   fremere intanto udia continuo il vento     tra le frondi del bosco e tra i virgulti   e trarne un suon che flebile concento     par dumani sospiri e di singulti   e un non so che confuso instilla al core   di pietà di spavento e di dolore    pur tragge alfin la spada e con gran forza     percote lalta pianta oh maraviglia   manda fuor sangue la recisa scorza     e fa la terra intorno a sè vermiglia   tutto si raccapriccia e pur rinforza     il colpo e l fin vederne ei si consiglia   allor quasi di tomba uscir ne sente   un indistinto gemito dolente    che poi distinto in voci ahi troppo disse     m hai tu tancredi offesso or tanto basti   tu dal corpo che meco e per me visse     felice albergo gia mi discacciasti   perchè il misero tronco a cui maffisse     il mio duro destino ancor mi guasti   dopo la morte gli avversarj tuoi   crudel ne lor sepolcri offender vuoi    clorinda fui nè sol qui spirto umano     albergo in questa pianta rozza e dura   ma ciascun altro ancor franco o pagano     che lassi i membri a piè dellalte mura   astretto è qui da novo incanto e strano     non so s io dica in corpo o in sepoltura   son di sensi animati i rami e i tronchi   e micidial sei tu se legno tronchi    qual infermo talor chin sogno scorge     drago o cinta di fiamme alta chimera   sebben sospetta o in parte anco saccorge     che simulacro sia non forma vera   pur desia di fuggir tanto gli porge     spavento la sembianza orrida e fera   tale il timido amante appien non crede   ai falsi inganni e pur ne teme e cede    e dentro il cor gli è in modo tal conquiso     da varj affetti che s agghiaccia e trema   e nel moto potente ed improvviso     gli cade il ferro e l manco e in lui la tema   va fuor di sè presente aver gli è avviso     l offesa donna sua che plori e gema   nè può soffrir di rimirar quel sangue   nè quei gemiti udir degro che langue    così quel contra morte audace core     nulla forma turbò d alto spavento   ma lui che solo è fievole in amore     falsa imago deluse e van lamento   il suo caduto ferro instanto fuore     portò del bosco impetuoso vento   sicchè vinto partissi e in sulla strada   ritrovò poscia e ripigliò la spada    pur non tornò né ritentando ardio     spiar di novo le cagioni ascose   e poi che giunto al sommo duce unio     gli spirti alquanto e lanimo compose   incominciò signor nunzio son io     di non credute e non credibil cose   ciò che dicean dello spettacol fero   e del suon paventoso è tutto vero    maraviglioso foco indi mapparse     senza materia in un istante appreso   che sorse e dilatando un muro farse     parve e d armati mostri esser difeso   pur vi passai che ne lincendio m arse     nè dal ferro mi fu landar conteso   vernò in quel punto ed annottò fe il giorno   e la serenità poscia ritorno    di più dirò chagli alberi dà vita     spirito uman che sente e che ragiona   per prova sollo io nho la voce udita     che nel cor flebilmente anco mi suona   stilla sangue de tronchi ogni ferita     quasi di molle carne abbian persona   no no più non potrei vinto mi chiamo   nè corteccia scorzar nè sveller ramo
