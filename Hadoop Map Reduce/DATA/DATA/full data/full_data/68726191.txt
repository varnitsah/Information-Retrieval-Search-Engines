      circumstances be subjected to another state   and i will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by       night between all the states and between any two of them   and i will make a song for the ears of the president full of       weapons with menacing points   and behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces   and a song make i of the one formd out of all   the fangd and

say that the real and permanent grandeur of these states must be       their religion   otherwise there is just no real and permanent grandeur   nor character nor life worthy the name without religion

them long and long    they do not sweat and whine about their condition   they do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins   they do not make me sick discussing their duty to god   not one is dissatisfied not one is demented with the mania of       owning things   not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands of       years ago   not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth    so they show their relations to me and i accept them   they bring me tokens of myself they evince them plainly in their       possession    i wonder where they get those tokens   did i pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them    myself moving forward then and now and forever   gathering and showing more always and with velocity   infinite and omnigenous and the like of

i lay alone in my bed   and again as i walkd the beach under the paling stars of the morning    my ties and ballasts leave me my elbows rest in seagaps   i skirt sierras my palms cover continents   i am afoot with my vision    by the citys quadrangular housesin log huts camping with lumbermen   along the ruts of the turnpike along the dry gulch and rivulet bed   weeding my onionpatch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnips       crossing savannas trailing in forests   prospecting golddigging girdling the trees of a new purchase   scorchd ankledeep by the hot sand hauling my boat down the

otter is feeding on fish   where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou   where the black bear is searching for roots or honey where the       beaver pats the mud with his paddleshaped

green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze   scaling mountains pulling myself cautiously up holding on by low       scragged limbs   walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush   where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheatlot   where the bat flies in the seventhmonth eve where the great       goldbug drops through the dark   where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to       the meadow   where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous       shuddering of their hides   where the cheesecloth hangs in the kitchen where andirons straddle       the hearthslab where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters   where triphammers crash where the press is whirling its cylinders   wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs   where the pearshaped balloon is floating aloft floating in it       myself and looking composedly down   where the lifecar is drawn on the slipnoose where the heat       hatches palegreen eggs in the dented sand   where the shewhale swims with her calf and never forsakes it   where the steamship trails hindways its long pennant of smoke   where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water   where the halfburnd brig is riding on unknown currents   where shells grow to her slimy deck where the dead are corrupting below   where the densestarrd flag is borne at the head of the regiments   approaching manhattan up by the longstretching island   under niagara the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance   upon a doorstep

right and left arms round the sides of two friends and i in the middle   coming home with the silent and darkcheekd bushboy behind me       he rides at the drape of the day   far from the settlements studying the print of animals feet or the       moccasin print   by the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient   nigh the coffind corpse when all is still examining with a candle   voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure   hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any   hot toward one i hate ready in my madness to knife him   solitary at midnight in my back yard my thoughts gone from me a long while   walking the old hills of judaea with the beautiful gentle god by my side   speeding through space speeding through heaven and the stars   speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and the       diameter of eighty thousand miles   speeding with taild meteors throwing fireballs like the rest   carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly   storming enjoying planning loving cautioning   backing and filling appearing and disappearing   i tread day and night such roads    i visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product   and look at quintillions ripend and look at quintillions green    i fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul   my course runs below the soundings of plummets    i help myself to material and immaterial   no guard can shut me off no law prevent me    i anchor my ship for a little while only   my messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me    i go hunting polar furs and the seal leaping chasms with a       pikepointed staff clinging to topples of brittle and blue    i ascend to the foretruck   i take my place late at night in the crowsnest   we sail the arctic sea it is plenty light enough   through the clear atmosphere i stretch around on the wonderful beauty   the enormous masses of ice pass me and i pass them the scenery is       plain in all directions   the whitetopt mountains show in the distance i fling out my       fancies toward them   we are approaching some great battlefield in which we are soon to       be engaged   we pass the colossal outposts of the encampment we pass with still       feet and caution   or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruind city   the blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities       of the globe    i am a free companion i bivouac by invading watchfires   i turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself   i tighten her all night to my thighs and lips    my voice is the wifes voice the screech by the rail of the stairs   they fetch my mans body up dripping and drownd    i understand the large hearts of heroes   the courage of present times and all times   how the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the       steamship and death chasing it up and down the storm   how he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch and was faithful of       days and faithful of nights   and chalkd in large letters on a board be of good cheer we will       not desert you   how he followd with them and tackd with them three days and       would not give it up   how he saved the drifting company at last   how the lank loosegownd women lookd when boated from the       side of their prepared graves   how the silent oldfaced infants and the lifted sick and the       sharplippd unshaved men   all this i swallow it tastes good i like it well it becomes mine   i am the man i sufferd i was there    the disdain and calmness of martyrs   the mother of old condemnd for a witch burnt with dry wood her       children gazing on   the hounded slave that flags in the race leans by the fence       blowing coverd with sweat   the twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck the murderous       buckshot and the bullets   all these i feel or am    i am the hounded slave i wince at the bite of the dogs   hell and despair are upon me crack and again crack the marksmen   i clutch the rails of the fence my gore dribs thinnd with the       ooze of my skin   i fall on the weeds and stones   the riders spur their unwilling horses haul close   taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whipstocks    agonies are one of my changes of garments   i do not ask the wounded person how he feels i myself become the       wounded person   my hurts turn livid upon me as i lean on a cane and observe    i am the mashd fireman with breastbone broken   tumbling walls buried me in their debris   heat and smoke i inspired i heard the yelling shouts of my comrades   i heard the distant click of their picks and shovels   they have cleard the beams away they tenderly lift me forth    i lie in the night air in my red shirt the pervading hush is for my sake   painless after all i lie exhausted but not so unhappy   white and beautiful are the faces around me the heads are bared       of their firecaps   the kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches    distant and dead resuscitate   they show as the dial or move as the hands of me i am the clock myself    i am an old artillerist i tell of my forts bombardment   i am there again    again the long roll of the drummers   again the attacking cannon mortars   again to my listening ears the cannon responsive    i take part i see and hear the whole   the cries curses roar the plaudits for wellaimd shots   the ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip   workmen searching after damages making indispensable repairs   the fall of grenades through the rent roof the

hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies nine times their       number was the price they took in advance   their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone   they treated for an honorable

out in squads and       massacred it was beautiful early summer   the work commenced about five oclock and was over by eight    none obeyd the command to kneel   some made a mad and helpless rush some stood stark and straight   a few fell at once shot in the temple or heart the living and dead       lay together   the maimd and mangled dug in the dirt the newcomers saw them there   some halfkilld attempted to crawl away   these were despatchd with bayonets or batterd with the blunts of muskets   a youth not seventeen years old seizd his assassin till two more       came to release him   the

the masteratarms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterhold       to give them a chance for themselves    the transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels   they see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust    our frigate takes fire   the other asks if we demand quarter   if our colors are struck and the fighting done    now i laugh content for i hear the voice of my little captain   we have not struck he composedly cries we have just begun our part       of the fighting    only three guns are in use   one is directed by the captain himself against the enemys mainmast   two well servd with grape and canister silence his musketry and       clear his decks    the tops alone second the fire of this little battery especially       the maintop   they hold out bravely during the whole of the action    not a moments cease   the leaks gain fast on the pumps the fire eats toward the powdermagazine    one of the pumps has been shot away it is generally thought we are sinking    serene stands the little captain   he is not hurried his voice is neither high nor low   his eyes give more light to us than our battlelanterns    toward twelve there in the

myselflet us stand up    what is known i strip away   i launch all men and women forward with me into the unknown    the clock indicates the momentbut what does eternity indicate    we have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers   there are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them    births have brought us richness and variety   and other births will bring us richness and variety    i do not call one greater and one smaller   that which fills its period and place is equal to any    were mankind murderous or jealous upon you my brother my sister   i am sorry for you they are not murderous or jealous upon me   all has been gentle with me i keep no account with lamentation   what have i to do with lamentation    i am an acme of things accomplishd and i an encloser of things to be    my feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs   on every step bunches of ages and larger bunches between the steps   all below duly traveld and still i mount and mount    rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me   afar down i see the huge first nothing i know i was even there   i waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist   and took my time and took no hurt from the fetid carbon    long i was huggd closelong and long    immense have been the preparations for me   faithful and friendly the arms that have helpd me    cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen   for room to me stars kept aside in their own rings   they sent influences to look after what was to hold me    before i was born out of my mother generations guided me   my embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it    for it the nebula cohered to an orb   the long slow strata piled to rest it on   vast vegetables gave it sustenance   monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it       with care    all forces have been steadily employd to complete and delight me   now on this spot i stand with my robust soul         45   o span of youth everpushd elasticity   o manhood balanced florid and full    my lovers suffocate me   crowding my lips thick in the pores of my skin   jostling me through streets and public halls coming naked to me at night   crying by day ahoy from the rocks of the river swinging and       chirping over my head   calling my name from flowerbeds vines tangled underbrush   lighting on every moment of my life   bussing my body with soft balsamic busses   noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine    old age superbly rising o welcome ineffable grace of dying days    every condition promulges not only itself it promulges what grows       after and out of itself   and the dark hush promulges as much as any    i open my scuttle at night and see the farsprinkled systems   and all i see multiplied as high as i can cipher edge but the rim of       the farther systems    wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding   outward and outward and forever outward    my sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels   he joins with his partners a group of superior circuit   and greater sets follow making specks of the greatest inside them    there is no stoppage and never can be stoppage   if i you and the worlds and all beneath or upon their surfaces       were this moment reduced back to a pallid float it would       not avail the long run   we should surely bring up again where we now stand   and surely go as much farther and then farther and farther    a few quadrillions of eras a few octillions of cubic leagues do       not hazard the span or make it impatient   they are but parts any thing is but a part    see ever so far there is limitless space outside of that   count ever so much there is limitless time around that    my rendezvous is appointed it is certain   the lord will be there and wait till i come on perfect terms   the great camerado the lover true for whom i pine will be there         46   i know i have the best of time and space and was never measured and       never will be measured    i tramp a perpetual journey come listen all   my signs are a rainproof coat good shoes and a staff cut from the woods   no friend of mine takes his ease in my chair   i have no chair no church no philosophy   i lead no man to a dinnertable library exchange   but each man and each woman of you i lead upon a knoll   my left hand hooking you round the waist   my right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road    not i not any one else can travel that road for you   you must travel it for yourself    it is not far it is within reach   perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know   perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land    shoulder your duds dear son and i will mine and let us hasten forth   wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go    if you tire give me both burdens and rest the chuff of your hand       on my hip   and in due time you shall repay the same service to me   for after we start we never lie by again    this day before dawn i ascended a hill and lookd at the crowded heaven   and i said to my spirit when we become the enfolders of those orbs       and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them shall we       be filld and satisfied then   and my spirit said no we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond    you are also asking me questions and i hear you   i answer that i cannot answer you must find out for yourself    sit a while dear son   here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink   but as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes i kiss you       with a goodby kiss and open the gate for your egress hence    long enough have you dreamd contemptible dreams   now i wash the gum from your eyes   you must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every       moment of your life    long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore   now i will you to be a bold swimmer   to jump off in the midst of the sea rise again nod to me shout       and laughingly dash with your hair         47   i am the teacher of athletes   he that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own   he most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher    the boy i love the same becomes a man not through derived power       but in his own right   wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear   fond of his sweetheart relishing well his steak   unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts   firstrate to ride to fight to hit the bulls eye to sail a       skiff to sing a song or play on the banjo   preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with smallpox over       all latherers   and those welltannd to those that keep out of the sun    i teach straying from me yet who can stray from me   i follow you whoever you are from the present hour   my words itch at your ears till you understand them    i do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while       i wait for a boat   it is you talking just as much as myself i act as the tongue of you   tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosend    i swear i will never again mention love or death inside a house   and i swear i will never translate myself at all only to him or her       who privately stays with me in the open air    if you would understand me go to the heights or watershore   the nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or motion of waves key   the maul the oar the handsaw second my words    no shutterd room or school can commune with me   but roughs and little children better than they    the young mechanic is closest to me he knows me well   the woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with       him all day   the farmboy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice   in vessels that sail my words sail i go with fishermen and seamen       and love them    the soldier campd or upon the march is mine   on the night ere the pending battle many seek me and i do not fail them   on that solemn night it may be their last those that know me seek me   my face rubs to the hunters face when he lies down alone in his blanket   the driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon   the young mother and old mother comprehend me   the girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are   they and all would resume what i have told them         48   i have said that the soul is not more than the body   and i have said that the body is not more than the soul   and nothing not god is greater to one than ones self is   and whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own       funeral drest in his shroud   and i or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth   and to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the       learning of all times   and there is no trade or employment but the young man following it       may become a hero   and there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheeld universe   and i say to any man or woman let your soul stand cool and composed       before a million universes    and i say to mankind be not curious about god   for i who am curious about each am not curious about god   no array of terms can say how much i am at peace about god and       about death    i hear and behold god in every object yet understand god not in the least   nor do i understand who there can be more wonderful than myself    why should i wish to see god better than this day   i see something of god each hour of the twentyfour and each moment then   in the faces of men and women i see god and in my own face in the glass   i find letters from god dropt in the street and every one is signd       by gods name   and i leave them where they are for i know that wheresoeer i go   others will punctually come for ever and ever         49   and as to you death and you bitter hug of mortality it is idle to       try to alarm me    to his work without flinching the accoucheur comes   i see the elderhand pressing receiving supporting   i recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors   and mark the outlet and mark the relief and escape    and as to you corpse i think you are good manure but that does not       offend me   i smell the white roses sweetscented and growing   i reach to the leafy lips i reach to the polishd breasts of melons    and as to you life i reckon you are the leavings of many deaths   no doubt i have died myself ten thousand times before    i hear you whispering there o stars of heaven   o sunso grass of graveso perpetual transfers and promotions   if you do not say any thing how can i say any thing    of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest   of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight   toss sparkles of day and dusktoss on the black stems that decay       in the muck   toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs    i ascend from the moon i ascend from the night   i perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected   and debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small         50   there is that in mei do not know what it isbut i know it is in me    wrenchd and sweatycalm and cool then my body becomes   i sleepi sleep long    i do not know itit is without nameit is a word unsaid   it is not in any dictionary utterance symbol    something it swings on more than the earth i swing on   to it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me    perhaps i might tell more outlines i plead for my brothers and sisters    do you see o my brothers and sisters   it is not chaos or deathit is form union planit is eternal       lifeit is happiness         51   the past and present wilti have filld them emptied them   and proceed to fill my next fold of the future    listener up there what have you to confide to me   look in my face while i snuff the sidle of evening   talk honestly no one else hears you and i stay only a minute longer    do i contradict myself   very well then i contradict myself   i am large i contain multitudes    i concentrate toward them that are nigh i wait on the doorslab    who has done his days work who will soonest be through with his supper   who wishes to walk with me    will you speak before i am gone will you

not only in his face   it is in his limbs and joints also it is curiously in the joints of       his hips and wrists   it is in his walk the carriage of his neck the flex of his waist       and knees

swiftly escape as nature escapes   we are nature long have we been absent but now we return   we become plants trunks foliage roots bark   we are bedded in the ground we are rocks   we are oaks we grow in the openings side by side   we browse we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any   we are two fishes swimming in the sea together   we are what locust blossoms are we drop scent around lanes mornings       and evenings   we are also the coarse smut of beasts vegetables minerals   we are two predatory hawks we soar above and look down   we are two resplendent suns we it is who balance ourselves orbic       and stellar we are as two comets   we prowl fangd and fourfooted in the woods we spring on prey   we are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead   we are seas mingling we are two of those cheerful waves rolling       over each other and interwetting each other   we are what the atmosphere is transparent receptive pervious impervious   we are snow rain cold darkness we are each product and influence       of the globe   we have circled and circled till we have arrived home again we two   we have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy     o hymen o hymenee    o hymen o hymenee why do you tantalize me thus   o why sting me for a swift moment only   why can you not continue o why do you now cease   is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would       soon certainly kill me     i am he that aches with love    i am he that aches with amorous love   does the earth gravitate does not all matter aching attract all matter

coarse and rank   today i go consort with natures darlings tonight too   i am for those who believe in loose delights i share the midnight       orgies of young men   i dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers   the echoes ring with our indecent calls i pick out some low person       for my dearest friend   he shall be lawless rude illiterate he shall be one condemnd by       others for deeds done   i will play a part no longer why should i exile myself from my companions   o you shunnd persons i at least do not shun you   i come forthwith in your midst i will be your poet   i will be more to you than to any of the rest     once i passd through a populous city    once i passd through a populous city imprinting my brain for future       use with its shows architecture customs traditions   yet now of all that city i remember only a woman i casually met       there who detaind me for love of me   day by day and night by night we were togetherall else has long       been forgotten by me   i remember i say only that woman who passionately clung to me   again we wander we love we separate again   again she holds me by the hand i must not go   i see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous     i heard you solemnsweet pipes of the organ    i heard you solemnsweet pipes of the organ as last sunday morn i       passd the church   winds of autumn as i walkd the woods at dusk i heard your long       stretchd sighs up above so mournful   i heard the perfect italian tenor singing at the opera i heard the       soprano in the midst of the quartet singing   heart of my love you too i heard murmuring low through one of the       wrists around my head   heard the pulse of you when all was still ringing little bells last       night under my ear     facing west from californias shores    facing west from californias shores   inquiring tireless seeking what is yet unfound   i a child very old over waves towards the house of maternity       the land of migrations look afar   look off the shores of my western sea the circle almost circled   for starting westward from hindustan from the vales of kashmere   from asia from the north from the god the sage and the hero   from the south from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands   long having wanderd since round the earth having wanderd   now i face home again very pleasd and joyous   but where is what i started for so long ago   and why is it yet unfound     as adam early in the morning    as adam early in the morning   walking forth from the bower refreshd with sleep   behold me where i pass hear my voice approach   touch me touch the palm of your hand to my body as i pass   be not afraid of my body     book v  calamus   in paths untrodden    in paths untrodden   in the growth by margins of pondwaters   escaped from the life that exhibits itself   from all the standards hitherto publishd from the pleasures       profits conformities   which too long i was offering to feed my soul   clear to me now standards not yet publishd clear to me that my soul   that the soul of the man i speak for rejoices in comrades   here by myself away from the clank of the world   tallying and talkd to here by tongues aromatic   no longer abashd for in this secluded spot i can respond as i       would not dare elsewhere   strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself yet contains       all the rest   resolvd to sing no songs today but those of manly attachment   projecting them along that substantial life   bequeathing hence types of athletic love   afternoon this delicious ninthmonth in my fortyfirst year   i proceed for all who are or have been young men   to tell the secret my nights and days   to celebrate the need of comrades     scented herbage of my breast    scented herbage of my breast   leaves from you i glean i write to be perused best afterwards   tombleaves bodyleaves growing up above me above death   perennial roots tall leaves o the winter shall not freeze you       delicate leaves   every year shall you bloom again out from where you retired you       shall emerge again   o i do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale       your faint odor but i believe a few will   o slender leaves o blossoms of my blood i permit you to tell in       your own way of the heart that is under you   o i do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves you are       not happiness   you are often more bitter than i can bear you burn and sting me   yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots you make me       think of death   death is beautiful from you what indeed is finally beautiful       except death and love   o i think it is not for life i am chanting here my chant of lovers       i think it must be for death   for how calm how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers   death or life i am then indifferent my soul declines to prefer   i am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most   indeed o death i think now these leaves mean precisely the same as       you mean   grow up taller sweet leaves that i may see grow up out of my breast   spring away from the conceald heart there   do not fold yourself so in your pinktinged roots timid leaves   do not remain down there so ashamed herbage of my breast   come i am determind to unbare this broad breast of mine i have       long enough stifled and choked   emblematic and capricious blades i leave you now you serve me not   i will say what i have to say by itself   i will sound myself and comrades only i will never again utter a       call only their call   i will raise with it immortal reverberations through the states   i will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will       through the states   through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating   give me your tone therefore o death that i may accord with it   give me yourself for i see that you belong to me now above all and       are folded inseparably together you love and death are   nor will i allow you to balk me any more with what i was calling life   for now it is conveyd to me that you are the purports essential   that you hide in these shifting forms of life for reasons and that       they are mainly for you   that you beyond them come forth to remain the real reality   that behind the mask of materials you patiently wait no matter how long   that you will one day perhaps take control of all   that you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance   that maybe you are what it is all for but it does not last so very long   but you will last very long     whoever you are holding me now in hand    whoever you are holding me now in hand   without one thing all will be useless   i give you fair warning before you attempt me further   i am not what you supposed but far different    who is he that would become my follower   who would sign himself a candidate for my affections    the way is suspicious the result uncertain perhaps destructive   you would have to give up all else i alone would expect to be your       sole and exclusive standard   your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting   the whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives       around you would have to be abandond   therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further let       go your hand from my shoulders   put me down and depart on your way    or else by stealth in some wood for trial   or back of a rock in the open air   for in any roofd room of a house i emerge not nor in company   and in libraries i lie as one dumb a gawk or unborn or dead   but just possibly with you on a high hill first watching lest any       person for miles around approach unawares   or possibly with you sailing at sea or on the beach of the sea or       some quiet island   here to put your lips upon mine i permit you   with the comrades longdwelling kiss or the new husbands kiss   for i am the new husband and i am the comrade    or if you will thrusting me beneath your clothing   where i may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip   carry me when you go forth over land or sea   for thus merely touching you is enough is best   and thus touching you would i silently sleep and be carried eternally    but these leaves conning you con at peril   for these leaves and me you will not understand   they will elude you at first and still more afterward i will       certainly elude you   even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me behold   already you see i have escaped from you    for it is not for what i have put into it that i have written this book   nor is it by reading it you will acquire it   nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me   nor will the candidates for my love unless at most a very few       prove victorious   nor will my poems do good only they will do just as much evil       perhaps more   for all is useless without that which you may guess at many times       and not hit that which i hinted at   therefore release me and depart on your way     for you o democracy    come i will make the continent indissoluble   i will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon   i will make divine magnetic lands        with the love of comrades          with the lifelong love of comrades    i will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of america       and along the shores of the great lakes and all over the prairies   i will make inseparable cities with their arms about each others necks        by the love of comrades          by the manly love of comrades    for you these from me o democracy to serve you ma femme   for you for you i am trilling these songs     these i singing in spring    these i singing in spring collect for lovers   for who but i should understand lovers and all their sorrow and joy   and who but i should be the poet of comrades   collecting i traverse the garden the world but soon i pass the gates   now along the pondside now wading in a little fearing not the wet   now by the postandrail fences where the old stones thrown there       pickd from the fields have accumulated   wildflowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and       partly cover them beyond these i pass   far far in the forest or sauntering later in summer before i       think where i go   solitary smelling the earthy smell stopping now and then in the silence   alone i had thought yet soon a troop gathers around me   some walk by my side and some behind and some embrace my arms or neck   they the spirits of dear friends dead or alive thicker they come a       great crowd and i in the middle   collecting dispensing singing there i wander with them   plucking something for tokens tossing toward whoever is near me   here lilac with a branch of pine   here out of my pocket some moss which i pulld off a liveoak in       florida as it hung trailing down   here some pinks and laurel leaves and a handful of sage   and here what i now draw from the water wading in the pondside   o here i last saw him that tenderly loves me and returns again       never to separate from me   and this o this shall henceforth be the token of comrades this       calamusroot shall   interchange it youths with each other let none render it back   and twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut   and stems of currants and plumblows and the aromatic cedar   these i compassd around by a thick cloud of spirits   wandering point to or touch as i pass or throw them loosely from me   indicating to each one what he shall have giving something to each   but what i drew from the water by the pondside that i reserve   i will give of it but only to them that love as i myself am capable       of loving     not heaving from my ribbd breast only    not heaving from my ribbd breast only   not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself   not in those longdrawn illsupprest sighs   not in many an oath and promise broken   not in my wilful and savage souls volition   not in the subtle nourishment of the air   not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists   not in the curious systole and diastole within which will one day cease   not in many a hungry wish told to the skies only   not in cries laughter defiancies thrown from me when alone far in       the wilds   not in husky pantings through clinchd teeth   not in sounded and resounded words chattering words echoes dead words   not in the murmurs of my dreams while i sleep   nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day   nor in the limbs and senses of my body that take you and dismiss you       continuallynot there   not in any or all of them o adhesiveness o pulse of my life   need i that you exist and show yourself any more than in these songs     of the terrible doubt of appearances    of the terrible doubt of appearances   of the uncertainty after all that we may be deluded   that maybe reliance and hope are but speculations after all   that maybe identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only   maybe the things i perceive the animals plants men hills       shining and flowing waters   the skies of day and night colors densities forms maybe these       are as doubtless they are only apparitions and the real       something has yet to be known   how often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me   how often i think neither i know nor any man knows aught of them   maybe seeming to me what they are as doubtless they indeed but seem       as from my present point of view and might prove as of course they       would nought of what they appear or nought anyhow from entirely       changed points of view   to me these and the like of these are curiously answerd by my       lovers my dear friends   when he whom i love travels with me or sits a long while holding me       by the hand   when the subtle air the impalpable the sense that words and reason       hold not surround us and pervade us   then i am charged with untold and untellable wisdom i am silent i       require nothing further   i cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity       beyond the grave   but i walk or sit indifferent i am satisfied   he ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me     the base of all metaphysics    and now gentlemen   a word i give to remain in your memories and minds   as base and finale too for all metaphysics    so to the students the old professor   at the close of his crowded course    having studied the new and antique the greek and germanic systems   kant having studied and stated fichte and schelling and hegel   stated the lore of plato and socrates greater than plato   and greater than socrates sought and stated christ divine having       studied long   i see reminiscent today those greek and germanic systems   see the philosophies all christian churches and tenets see   yet underneath socrates clearly see and underneath christ the divine i see   the dear love of man for his comrade the attraction of friend to friend   of the wellmarried husband and wife of children and parents   of city for city and land for land     recorders ages hence    recorders ages hence   come i will take you down underneath this impassive exterior i       will tell you what to say of me   publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover   the friend the lovers portrait of whom his friend his lover was fondest   who was not proud of his songs but of the measureless ocean of love       within him and freely pourd it forth   who often walkd lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends his lovers   who pensive away from one he lovd often lay sleepless and       dissatisfied at night   who knew too well the sick sick dread lest the one he lovd might       secretly be indifferent to him   whose happiest days were far away through fields in woods on hills       he and another wandering hand in hand they twain apart from other men   who oft as he saunterd the streets curvd with his arm the shoulder       of his friend while the arm of his friend rested upon him also     when i heard at the close of the day    when i heard at the close of the day how my name had been receivd       with plaudits in the capitol still it was not a happy night for       me that followd   and else when i carousd or when my plans were accomplishd still       i was not happy   but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health       refreshd singing inhaling the ripe breath of autumn   when i saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the       morning light   when i wanderd alone over the beach and undressing bathed       laughing with the cool waters and saw the sun rise   and when i thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way       coming o then i was happy   o then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my food       nourishd me more and the beautiful day passd well   and the next came with equal joy and with the next at evening came       my friend   and that night while all was still i heard the waters roll slowly       continually up the shores   i heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me       whispering to congratulate me   for the one i love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in       the cool night   in the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me   and his arm lay lightly around my breastand that night i was happy     are you the new person drawn toward me    are you the new person drawn toward me   to begin with take warning i am surely far different from what you suppose   do you suppose you will find in me your ideal   do you think it so easy to have me become your lover   do you think the friendship of me would be unalloyd satisfaction   do you think i am trusty and faithful   do you see no further than this facade this smooth and tolerant       manner of me   do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man   have you no thought o dreamer that it may be all maya

in return   we observe that salute of american comrades land and sea   we are those two natural and nonchalant persons     i saw in louisiana a liveoak growing    i saw in louisiana a liveoak growing   all alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches   without any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green   and its look rude unbending lusty made me think of myself   but i wonderd how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there       without its friend near for i knew i could not   and i broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and       twined around it a little moss   and brought it away and i have placed it in sight in my room   it is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends   for i believe lately i think of little else than of them   yet it remains to me a curious token it makes me think of manly love   for all that and though the liveoak glistens there in louisiana       solitary in a wide in a wide flat space   uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near   i know very well i could not     to a stranger    passing stranger you do not know how longingly i look upon you   you must be he i was

i am to meet you again   i am to see to it that i do not lose you     this moment yearning and thoughtful    this moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone   it seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtful   it seems to me i can look over and behold them in germany italy       france spain   or far far away in china or in russia or talking other dialects   and it seems to me if i could know those men i should become       attached to them as i do to men in my own lands   o i know we should be brethren and lovers   i know i should be happy with them     i hear it was charged against me    i hear it was charged against me that i sought to destroy institutions   but really i am neither for nor against institutions   what indeed have i in common with them or what with the       destruction of them   only i will establish in the mannahatta and in every city of these       states inland and seaboard   and in the fields and woods and above every keel little

those of inland america     when i peruse the conquerd fame    when i peruse the conquerd fame of heroes and the victories of       mighty generals i do not envy the generals   nor the president in his presidency nor the rich in his great house   but when i hear of the brotherhood of lovers how it was with them   how together through life through dangers odium unchanging long       and long   through youth and through middle and old age how unfaltering how       affectionate and faithful they were   then i am pensivei hastily walk away filld with the bitterest envy     we two boys together

belong among you       inland and along the western sea   for these states tend inland and toward the western sea and i will also     here the frailest leaves of me    here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting   here i shade and hide my thoughts i myself do not expose them   and yet they expose me more than all my other poems     no laborsaving machine    no laborsaving machine   nor discovery have i made   nor will i be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to found       hospital or library   nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for america   nor literary success nor intellect nor book for the bookshelf   but a few carols vibrating through the air i leave   for comrades and lovers     a glimpse    a glimpse through an interstice caught   of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a barroom around the stove       late of a winter night and i unremarkd seated in a corner   of a youth who loves me and whom i love silently approaching and       seating himself near that he may hold me by the hand   a long while amid the noises of coming and going of drinking and       oath and smutty jest   there we two content happy in being together speaking little       perhaps not a word     a leaf for hand in hand    a leaf for hand in hand   you natural persons old and young   you on the mississippi and on all the branches and bayous of       the mississippi   you friendly boatmen and mechanics you roughs   you twain and all processions moving along the streets   i wish to infuse myself among you till i see it common for you to       walk hand in hand     earth my likeness    earth my likeness   though you look so impassive ample and spheric there   i now suspect that is not all   i now suspect there is something fierce in you eligible to burst forth   for an athlete is enamourd of me and i of him   but toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me eligible       to burst forth   i dare not tell it in words not even in these songs     i dreamd in a dream    i dreamd in a dream i saw a city invincible to the attacks of the       whole of the rest of the earth   i dreamd that was the new city of friends   nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love it led the rest   it was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city   and in all their looks and words     what think you i take my pen in hand    what think you i take my pen in hand to record   the battleship perfectmodeld majestic that i saw pass the       offing today under full sail   the splendors of the past day or the splendor of the night that       envelops me   or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me no   but merely of two simple men i saw today on the pier in the midst       of the crowd parting the parting of dear friends   the one to remain hung on the others neck and passionately kissd him   while the one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in his arms     to the east and to the west    to the east and to the west   to the man of the seaside state and of pennsylvania   to the kanadian of the north to the southerner i love   these with perfect trust to depict you as myself the germs are in all men   i believe the main purport of these states is to found a superb       friendship exalte previously unknown   because i perceive it waits and has been always waiting latent in all men     sometimes with one i love    sometimes with one i love i fill myself with rage for fear i effuse       unreturnd love   but now i think there is no unreturnd love the pay is certain one       way or another   i loved a certain person ardently and my love was not returnd   yet out of that i have written these songs     to a western boy    many things to absorb i teach to help you become eleve of mine   yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins   if you be not silently selected by lovers and do not silently select lovers   of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine     fast anchord eternal o love    fastanchord eternal o love o woman i love   o bride o wife more resistless than i can tell the thought of you   then separate as disembodied or another born   ethereal the last

i often and silently come where you are that i may be with you   as i walk by your side or sit near or remain in the same room with you   little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is       playing within me     that shadow my likeness    that shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a livelihood       chattering chaffering   how often i find myself standing and looking at it where it flits   how often i question and doubt whether that is really me   but among my lovers and caroling these songs   o i never doubt whether that is really me     full of life now    full of

what with some driver as i ride on the seat by his side   what with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as i walk by       and pause   what gives me to be free to a womans and mans goodwill what       gives them to be free to mine         8   the efflux of the soul is happiness here is happiness   i think it pervades the open air waiting at all times   now it flows unto us we are rightly charged    here rises the fluid and attaching character   the fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of       man and woman   the herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day       out of the roots of themselves than it sprouts fresh and sweet       continually out of itself    toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the       love of

viii   crossing brooklyn ferry         1   floodtide below me i see you face to face   clouds of the westsun there half an hour highi see you also face       to face    crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes how curious       you are to me   on the ferryboats the hundreds and hundreds that cross returning       home are more curious to me than you suppose   and you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more       to me and more in my meditations than you might suppose         2   the impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day   the simple compact welljoind scheme myself disintegrated every       one disintegrated yet part of the scheme   the similitudes of the past and those of the future   the glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings on       the walk in the street and the passage over the river   the current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away   the others that are to follow me the ties between me and them   the certainty of others the life love sight hearing of others    others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore   others will watch the run of the floodtide   others will see the shipping of manhattan north and west and the       heights of brooklyn to the south and east   others will see the islands large and small   fifty years hence others will see them as they cross the sun half       an hour high   a hundred years hence or ever so many hundred years hence others       will see them   will enjoy the sunset the pouringin of the floodtide the       fallingback to the sea of the ebbtide         3   it avails not time nor placedistance avails not   i am with you you men and women of a generation or ever so many       generations hence   just as you feel when you look on the river and sky so i felt   just as any of you is one of a living crowd i was one of a crowd   just as you are refreshd by the gladness of the river and the       bright flow i was refreshd   just as you stand and lean on the rail yet hurry with the swift       current i stood yet was hurried   just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the       thickstemmd pipes of steamboats i lookd    i too many and many a time crossd the river of old   watched the twelfthmonth seagulls saw them high in the air       floating with motionless wings oscillating their bodies   saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left       the rest in strong shadow   saw the slowwheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south   saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water   had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams   lookd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my       head in the sunlit water   lookd on the haze on the hills southward and southwestward   lookd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet   lookd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving   saw their approach saw aboard those that were near me   saw the white sails of schooners and sloops saw the ships at anchor   the sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars   the round masts the swinging motion of the hulls the slender       serpentine pennants   the large and small steamers in motion the pilots in their pilothouses   the white wake left by the passage the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels   the flags of all nations the falling of them at sunset   the scallopedged waves in the twilight the ladled cups the       frolicsome crests and glistening   the stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer the gray walls of the       granite storehouses by the docks   on the river the shadowy group the big steamtug closely flankd on       each side by the barges the hayboat the belated lighter   on the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning       high and glaringly into the night   casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow       light over the tops of houses and down into the clefts of streets         4   these and all else were to me the same as they are to you   i loved well those cities loved well the stately and rapid river   the men and women i saw were all near to me   others the sameothers who look back on me because i lookd forward       to them   the time will come though i stop here today and tonight         5   what is it then between us   what is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us    whatever it is it avails notdistance avails not and place avails not   i too lived brooklyn of ample hills was mine   i too walkd the streets of manhattan island and bathed in the       waters around it   i too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me   in the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me   in my walks home late at night or as i lay in my bed they came upon me   i too had been struck from the float forever held in solution   i too had receivd identity by my body   that i was i knew was of my body and what i should be i knew i       should be of my body         6   it is not upon you alone the dark patches fall   the dark threw its patches down upon me also   the best i had done seemd to me blank and suspicious   my great thoughts as i supposed them were they not in reality meagre   nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil   i am he who knew what it was to be evil   i too knitted the old knot of contrariety   blabbd blushd resented lied stole grudgd   had guile anger lust hot wishes i dared not speak   was wayward vain greedy shallow sly cowardly malignant   the wolf the snake the hog not wanting in me   the cheating look the frivolous word the adulterous wish not wanting    refusals hates postponements meanness laziness none of these wanting   was one with the rest the days and haps of the rest   was calld by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as       they saw me approaching or passing   felt their arms on my neck as i stood or the negligent leaning of       their flesh against me as i sat   saw many i loved in the street or ferryboat or public assembly yet       never told them a word   lived the same life with the rest the same old laughing gnawing sleeping   playd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress   the same old role the role that is what we make it as great as we like   or as small as we like or both great and small         7   closer yet i approach you   what thought you have of me now i had as much of youi laid in my       stores in advance   i considerd long and

for all you cannot see me         8   ah what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than       masthemmd manhattan   river and sunset and scallopedgd waves of floodtide   the seagulls oscillating their bodies the hayboat in the       twilight and the belated lighter   what gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand and with voices i       love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach   what is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that       looks in my face   which fuses me into you now and pours my meaning into you    we understand then

true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty   the greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers       and fathers   the words of true poems are the tuft and

year and place   a harsh discordant natal scream outsounding to touch the mothers       heart closer than any yet    i walkd the shores of my eastern sea   heard over the waves the little voice   saw the divine infant where she woke mournfully wailing amid the       roar of cannon curses shouts crash of falling buildings   was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running nor from the single       corpses nor those in heaps nor those borne away in the tumbrils   was not so desperate at the battues of deathwas not so shockd at       the repeated fusillades of the guns    pale silent stern

heard wailing and wait with       perfect trust no matter how long   and from today sad and cogent i maintain the bequeathd cause as       for all lands   and i send these words to paris with my love

you turn aside all your life will you grub and chatter all       your life   and who are you blabbing by rote years pages languages reminiscences   unwitting today that you do not know how to speak properly a single word    let others finish specimens i never finish specimens   i start them by exhaustless laws as nature does fresh and modern       continually    i give nothing as duties   what others give as duties i give as living impulses   shall i give the hearts action as a duty    let others dispose of questions i dispose of nothing i arouse       unanswerable questions   who are they i see and touch and what about them   what about these likes of myself that draw me so close by tender       directions and indirections    i call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends

thencearousd words   from the word stronger and more delicious than any   from such as now they start the scene revisiting   as a flock twittering rising or overhead passing   borne hither ere all eludes me hurriedly   a man yet by these tears a little boy again   throwing myself on the sand confronting the waves   i chanter of pains and joys uniter of here and hereafter   taking all hints to use them but swiftly leaping beyond them   a reminiscence sing    once paumanok   when the lilacscent was in the air and fifthmonth grass was growing   up this seashore in some briers   two featherd guests from alabama two together   and their nest and four lightgreen eggs spotted with brown   and every day the hebird to and fro near at hand   and every day the shebird crouchd on her nest silent with bright eyes   and every day i a curious boy never too close never disturbing   them   cautiously peering absorbing translating    shine shine shine   pour down your warmth great sun   while we bask we two together    two together   winds blow south or winds blow north   day come white or night come black   home or rivers and mountains from home   singing all time minding no time   while we two keep together    till of a sudden   maybe killd unknown to her mate   one forenoon the shebird crouchd not on the nest   nor returnd that afternoon nor the next   nor ever appeard again    and thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea   and at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather   over the hoarse surging of the sea   or flitting from brier to brier by day   i saw i heard at intervals the remaining one the hebird   the solitary guest from alabama    blow blow blow   blow up seawinds along paumanoks shore   i wait and i wait till you blow my mate to me    yes when the stars glistend   all night long on the prong of a mossscallopd stake   down almost amid the slapping waves   sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears    he calld on his mate   he pourd forth the meanings which i of all men know    yes my brother i know   the rest might not but i have treasurd every note   for more than once dimly down to the beach gliding   silent avoiding the moonbeams blending myself with the shadows   recalling now the obscure shapes the echoes the sounds and sights       after their sorts   the white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing   i with bare feet a child the wind wafting my hair   listend long and long    listend to keep to sing now translating the notes   following you my brother    soothe soothe soothe   close on its wave soothes the wave behind   and again another behind embracing and lapping every one close   but my love soothes not me not me    low hangs the moon it rose late   it is laggingo i think it is heavy with love with love    o madly the sea pushes upon the land   with love with love    o night do i not see my love fluttering out among the breakers   what is that little black thing i see there in the white    loud loud loud   loud i call to you my love   high and clear i shoot my voice over the waves   surely you must know who is here is here   you must know who i am my love    lowhanging moon   what is that dusky spot in your brown yellow   o it is the shape the shape of my mate   o moon do not keep her from me any longer    land land o land   whichever way i turn o i think you could give me my mate back again       if you only would   for i am almost sure i see her dimly whichever way i look    o rising stars   perhaps the one i want so much will rise will rise with some of you    o throat o trembling throat   sound clearer through the atmosphere   pierce the woods the earth   somewhere listening to catch you must be the one i want    shake out carols   solitary here the nights carols   carols of lonesome love deaths carols   carols under that lagging yellow waning moon   o under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea   o reckless despairing carols    but soft sink low   soft let me just murmur   and do you wait a moment you huskynoisd sea   for somewhere i believe i heard my mate responding to me   so faint i must be still be still to listen   but not altogether still for then she might not come immediately to me    hither my love   here i am here   with this justsustaind note i announce myself to you   this gentle call is for you my love for you    do not be decoyd elsewhere   that is the whistle of the wind it is not my voice   that is the fluttering the fluttering of the spray   those are the shadows of leaves    o darkness o in vain   o i am very sick and sorrowful    o brown halo in the sky near the moon drooping upon the sea   o troubled reflection in the sea   o throat o throbbing heart   and i singing uselessly uselessly all the night    o past o happy life o songs of joy   in the air in the woods over fields   loved loved loved loved loved   but my mate no more no more with me   we two together no more    the aria sinking   all else continuing the stars shining   the winds blowing the notes of the bird continuous echoing   with angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning   on the sands of paumanoks shore gray and rustling   the yellow halfmoon enlarged sagging down drooping the face of       the sea almost touching   the boy ecstatic with his bare feet the waves with his hair the       atmosphere dallying   the love in the heart long pent now loose now at last tumultuously       bursting   the arias meaning the ears the soul swiftly depositing   the strange tears down the cheeks coursing   the colloquy there the trio each uttering   the undertone the savage old mother incessantly crying   to the boys souls questions sullenly timing some drownd secret hissing   to the outsetting bard    demon or bird said the boys soul   is it indeed toward your mate you sing or is it really to me   for i that was a child my tongues use sleeping now i have heard you   now in a moment i know what i am for i awake   and already a thousand singers a thousand songs clearer louder       and more sorrowful than yours   a thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me never to die    o you singer solitary singing by yourself projecting me   o solitary me listening never more shall i cease perpetuating you   never more shall i escape never more the reverberations   never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me   never again leave me to be the peaceful child i was before what       there in the night   by the sea under the yellow and sagging moon   the messenger there arousd the fire the sweet hell within   the unknown want the destiny of me    o give me the clue it lurks in the night here somewhere   o if i am to have so much let me have more    a word then for i will conquer it   the word final superior to all   subtle sent upwhat is iti listen   are you whispering it and have been all the time you seawaves   is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands    whereto answering the sea   delaying not hurrying not   whisperd me through the night and very plainly before daybreak   lispd to me the low and delicious word death   and again death death death death   hissing melodious neither like the bird nor like my arousd childs heart   but edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet   creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over   death death death death death    which i do not forget   but fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother   that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanoks gray beach   with the thousand responsive songs at random   my own songs awaked from that hour   and with them the key the word up from the waves   the word of the sweetest song and all songs   that strong and delicious word which creeping to my feet   or like some old crone rocking the cradle swathed in sweet       garments bending aside   the sea whisperd me     as i ebbd with the ocean of life         1   as i ebbd with the ocean of life   as i wended the shores i know   as i walkd where the ripples continually wash you paumanok   where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant   where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways   i musing late in the autumn day gazing off southward   held by this electric self out of the pride of which i utter poems   was seizd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot   the rim the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land       of the globe    fascinated my eyes reverting from the south dropt to follow those       slender windrows   chaff straw splinters of wood

the old thought of likenesses   these you presented to me you fishshaped island   as i wended the shores i know   as i walkd with that electric self seeking types         2   as i wend to the shores i know not   as i list to the dirge the voices of men and women wreckd   as i inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me   as the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer   i too but

myself that i have dared to open my mouth   aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me i have       not once had the least idea who or what i am   but that before all my arrogant poems the real me stands yet       untouchd untold altogether unreachd   withdrawn far mocking me with mockcongratulatory signs and bows   with peals of distant ironical laughter at every word i have written   pointing in silence to these songs and then to the sand beneath    i perceive i have not really understood any thing not a single       object and that no man ever can   nature here in sight

listen and tell         the centenarian   when i clutchd your hand it was not with terror   but suddenly pouring about me here on every side   and below there where the boys were drilling and up the slopes they ran   and where tents are pitchd and wherever you see south and south       east and southwest   over hills across lowlands and in the skirts of woods   and along the shores in mire now filld over came again and       suddenly raged   as eightyfive years agone no mere parade receivd with applause of friends   but a battle which i took part in myselfaye long ago as it is i       took part in it   walking then this hilltop this same ground    aye this is the ground   my blind eyes even as i speak behold it repeopled from graves   the years recede pavements and stately houses disappear   rude forts appear again the old hoopd guns are mounted   i see the lines of raisd earth stretching from river to bay   i mark the vista of waters i mark the uplands and slopes   here we lay encampd it was this time in summer also    as i talk i remember all i remember the declaration   it was read here the whole army paraded it was read to us here   by his staff surrounded the general stood in the middle he held up       his unsheathd sword   it glitterd in the sun in full sight of the army    twas a bold act thenthe english warships had just arrived   we could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor   and the transports swarming with soldiers    a few days more and they landed and then the battle    twenty thousand were brought against us   a veteran force furnishd with good artillery    i tell not now the whole of the battle   but one brigade early in the forenoon orderd forward to engage the       redcoats   of that brigade i tell and how steadily it marchd   and how long and well it stood confronting death    who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death   it was the brigade of the youngest men two thousand strong   raisd in virginia and maryland and most of them known personally       to the general    jauntily forward they went with quick step toward gowanus waters   till of a sudden unlookd for by defiles through the woods gaind at night   the british advancing rounding in from the east fiercely playing       their guns   that brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemys mercy    the general watchd them from this hill   they made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment   then drew close together very compact their flag flying in the middle   but o from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them    it sickens me yet that slaughter   i saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the general   i saw how he wrung his hands in anguish    meanwhile the british manoeuvrd to draw us out for a pitchd battle   but we dared not trust the chances of a pitchd battle    we fought the fight in detachments   sallying forth we fought at several points but in each the luck was       against us   our foe advancing steadily getting the best of it pushd us back       to the works on this hill   till we turnd menacing here and then he left us    that was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men two thousand       strong   few returnd nearly all remain in brooklyn    that and here my generals first battle   no women looking on nor sunshine to bask in it did not conclude       with applause   nobody clappd hands here then    but in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain   wearied that night we lay foild and sullen   while scornfully laughd many an arrogant lord off against us encampd   quite within hearing feasting clinking wineglasses together over       their victory    so dull and damp and another day   but the night of that mist lifting rain ceasing   silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him my       general retreated    i saw him at the riverside   down by the ferry lit by torches hastening the embarcation   my general waited till the soldiers and wounded were all passd over   and then it was just ere sunrise these eyes rested on him for       the last time    every one else seemd filld with gloom   many no doubt thought of capitulation    but when my general passd me   as he stood in his boat and lookd toward the coming sun   i saw something different from capitulation         terminus   enough the centenarians story ends   the two the past and present have interchanged   i myself as connecter as chansonnier of a great future am now speaking    and is this the ground washington trod   and these waters i listlessly daily cross are these the waters he crossd   as resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs    i must copy the story and send it eastward and westward   i must preserve that look as it beamd on you rivers of brooklyn    seeas the annual round returns the phantoms return   it is the 27th of august and the british have landed   the battle begins and goes against us behold through the smoke       washingtons face   the brigade of virginia and maryland have marchd forth to intercept       the enemy   they are cut off murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them   rank after rank falls while over them silently droops the flag   baptized that day in many a young mans bloody wounds   in death defeat and sisters mothers tears    ah hills and slopes of brooklyn i perceive you are more valuable       than your owners supposed   in the midst of you stands an encampment very old   stands forever the camp of that dead brigade     cavalry crossing a ford    a line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands   they take a serpentine course their arms flash in the sunhark to       the musical clank   behold the silvery river in it the splashing horses loitering stop       to drink   behold the brownfaced men each group each person a picture the       negligent rest on the saddles   some emerge on the opposite bank others are just entering the fordwhile   scarlet and blue and snowy white   the guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind     bivouac on a mountain side    i see before me now a traveling army halting   below a fertile valley spread with barns and the orchards of summer   behind the terraced sides of a mountain abrupt in places rising high   broken with rocks with clinging cedars with tall shapes dingily seen   the numerous campfires scatterd near and far some away up on the       mountain   the shadowy forms of men and horses looming largesized flickering   and over all the skythe sky far far out of reach studded       breaking out the eternal stars     an army corps on the march    with its cloud of skirmishers in advance   with now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip and now an       irregular volley   the swarming ranks press on and on the dense brigades press on   glittering dimly toiling under the sunthe dustcoverd men   in columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground   with artillery interspersdthe wheels rumble the horses sweat   as the army corps advances     by the bivouacs fitful flame    by the bivouacs fitful flame   a procession winding around me solemn and sweet and slowbut       first i note   the tents of the sleeping army the fields and woods dim outline   the darkness lit by spots of kindled fire the silence   like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving   the shrubs and trees as i lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily       watching me   while wind in procession thoughts o tender and wondrous thoughts   of life and death of home and the past and loved and of those that       are far away   a solemn and slow procession there as i sit on the ground   by the bivouacs fitful flame     come up from the fields father    come up from the fields father heres a letter from our pete   and come to the front door mother heres a letter from thy dear son    lo tis autumn   lo where the trees deeper green yellower and redder   cool and sweeten ohios villages with leaves fluttering in the       moderate wind   where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellisd vines   smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines   smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing    above all lo the sky so calm so transparent after the rain and       with wondrous clouds   below too all calm all vital and beautiful and the farm prospers well    down in the fields all prospers well   but now from the fields come father come at the daughters call   and come to the entry mother to the front door come right away    fast as she can she hurries something ominous her steps trembling   she does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap    open the envelope quickly   o this is not our sons writing yet his name is signd   o a strange hand writes for our dear son o stricken mothers soul   all swims before her eyes flashes with black she catches the main       words only   sentences broken gunshot wound in the breast cavalry skirmish       taken to hospital   at present low but will soon be better    ah now the single figure to me   amid all teeming and wealthy ohio with all its cities and farms   sickly white in the face and dull in the head very faint   by the jamb of a door leans    grieve not so dear mother the justgrown daughter speaks through       her sobs   the little sisters huddle around speechless and dismayd   see dearest mother the letter says pete will soon be better    alas poor boy he will never be better nor maybe needs to be       better that brave and simple soul   while they stand at home at the door he is dead already   the only son is dead    but the mother needs to be better   she with thin form presently drest in black   by day her meals untouchd then at night fitfully sleeping often waking   in the midnight waking weeping longing with one deep longing   o that she might withdraw unnoticed silent from life escape and withdraw   to follow to seek to be with her dear dead son     vigil strange i kept on the field one night    vigil strange i kept on the field one night   when you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day   one look i but gave which your dear eyes returnd with a look i       shall never forget   one touch of your hand to mine o boy reachd up as you lay on the ground   then onward i sped in the battle the evencontested battle   till late in the night relievd to the place at last again i made my way   found you in death so cold dear comrade found your body son of       responding kisses never again on earth responding   bared your face in the starlight curious the scene cool blew the       moderate nightwind   long there and then in vigil i stood dimly around me the       battlefield spreading   vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night   but not a tear fell not even a longdrawn sigh long long i gazed   then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my       chin in my hands   passing sweet hours immortal and mystic hours with you dearest       comradenot a tear not a word   vigil of silence love and death vigil for you my son and my soldier   as onward silently stars aloft eastward new ones upward stole   vigil final for you brave boy i could not save you swift was your death   i faithfully loved you and cared for you living i think we shall       surely meet again   till at latest lingering of the night indeed just as the dawn appeard   my comrade i wrapt in his blanket envelopd well his form   folded the blanket well tucking it carefully over head and       carefully under feet   and there and then and bathed by the rising sun my son in his       grave in his rudedug grave i deposited   ending my vigil strange with that vigil of night and battlefield dim   vigil for boy of responding kisses never again on earth responding   vigil for comrade swiftly slain vigil i never forget how as day       brightend   i rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket   and buried him where he fell     a march in the ranks hardprest and the road unknown    a march in the ranks hardprest and the road unknown   a route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness   our army foild with loss severe and the sullen remnant retreating   till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dimlighted building   we come to an open space in the woods and halt by the dimlighted building   tis a large old church at the crossing roads now an impromptu hospital   entering but for a minute i see a sight beyond all the pictures and       poems ever made   shadows of deepest deepest black just lit by moving candles and lamps   and by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and       clouds of smoke   by these crowds groups of forms vaguely i see on the floor some       in the pews laid down   at my feet more distinctly a soldier a mere lad in danger of       bleeding to death he is shot in the abdomen   i stanch the blood temporarily the youngsters face is white as a lily   then before i depart i sweep my eyes oer the scene fain to absorb it all   faces varieties postures beyond description most in obscurity       some of them dead   surgeons operating attendants holding lights the smell of ether       odor of blood   the crowd o the crowd of the bloody forms the yard outside also filld   some on the bare ground some on planks or stretchers some in the       deathspasm sweating   an occasional scream or cry the doctors shouted orders or calls   the glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of       the torches   these i resume as i chant i see again the forms i smell the odor   then hear outside the orders given fall in my men fall in   but first i bend to the dying lad his eyes open a halfsmile gives he me   then the eyes close calmly close and i speed forth to the darkness   resuming marching ever in darkness marching on in the ranks   the unknown road still marching     a sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim    a sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim   as from my tent i emerge so early sleepless   as slow i walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent   three forms i see on stretchers lying brought out there untended lying   over each the blanket spread ample brownish woolen blanket   gray and heavy blanket folding covering all    curious i halt and silent stand   then with light fingers i from the face of the nearest the first       just lift the blanket   who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim with wellgrayd hair       and flesh all sunken about the eyes   who are you my dear comrade   then to the second i stepand who are you my child and darling   who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming   then to the thirda face nor child nor old very calm as of       beautiful yellowwhite ivory   young man i think i know youi think this face is the face of the       christ himself   dead and divine and brother of all and here again he lies     as toilsome i wanderd virginias woods    as toilsome i wanderd virginias woods   to the music of rustling leaves kickd by my feet for twas autumn   i markd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier   mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat easily all could       understand   the halt of a midday hour when up no time to loseyet this sign left   on a tablet scrawld and naild on the tree by the grave   bold cautious true and my loving comrade    long long i muse then on my way go wandering   many a changeful season to follow and many a scene of life   yet at times through changeful season and scene abrupt alone or       in the crowded street   comes before me the unknown soldiers grave comes the inscription       rude in virginias woods   bold cautious true and my loving comrade     not the pilot    not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port       though beaten back and many times baffled   not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long   by deserts parchd snows chilld rivers wet perseveres till he       reaches his destination   more than i have charged myself heeded or unheeded to compose       march for these states   for a battlecall rousing to arms if need be years centuries hence     year that trembled and reeld beneath me    year that trembled and reeld beneath me   your summer wind was warm enough yet the air i breathed froze me   a thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darkend me   must i change my triumphant songs said i to myself   must i indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled   and sullen hymns of defeat     the wounddresser         1   an old man bending i come among new faces   years looking backward resuming in answer to children   come tell us old man as from young men and maidens that love me   arousd and angry id thought to beat the alarum and urge relentless war   but soon my fingers faild me my face droopd and i resignd myself   to sit by the wounded and soothe them or silently watch the dead   years hence of these scenes of these furious passions these chances   of unsurpassd heroes was one side so brave the other was equally brave   now be witness again paint the mightiest armies of earth   of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us   what stays with you latest and deepest of curious panics   of hardfought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains         2   o maidens and young men i love and that love me   what you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls   soldier alert i arrive after a long march coverd with sweat and dust   in the nick of time i come plunge in the fight loudly shout in the       rush of successful charge   enter the capturd worksyet lo like a swiftrunning river they fade   pass and are gone they fadei dwell not on soldiers perils or       soldiers joys   both i remember wellmany the hardships few the joys yet i was content    but in silence in dreams projections   while the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on   so soon what is over forgotten and waves wash the imprints off the sand   with hinged knees returning i enter the doors while for you up there   whoever you are follow without noise and be of strong heart    bearing the bandages water and sponge   straight and swift to my wounded i go   where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in   where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground   or to the rows of the hospital tent or under the roofd hospital   to the long rows of cots up and down each side i return   to each and all one after another i draw near not one do i miss   an attendant follows holding a tray he carries a refuse pail   soon to be filld with clotted rags and blood emptied and filld again    i onward go i stop   with hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds   i am firm with each the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable   one turns to me his appealing eyespoor boy i never knew you   yet i think i could not refuse this moment to die for you if that       would save you         3   on on i go open doors of time open hospital doors   the crushd head i dress poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away   the neck of the cavalryman with the bullet through and through examine   hard the breathing rattles quite glazed already the eye yet life       struggles hard   come sweet death be persuaded o beautiful death   in mercy come quickly    from the stump of the arm the amputated hand   i undo the clotted lint remove the slough wash off the matter and blood   back on his pillow the soldier bends with curvd neck and side falling head   his eyes are closed his face is pale he dares not look on the       bloody stump   and has not yet lookd on it    i dress a wound in the side deep deep   but a day or two more for see the frame all wasted and sinking   and the yellowblue countenance see    i dress the perforated shoulder the foot with the bulletwound   cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene so sickening       so offensive   while the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail    i am faithful i do not give out   the fracturd thigh the knee the wound in the abdomen   these and more i dress with impassive hand yet deep in my breast       a fire a burning flame         4   thus in silence in dreams projections   returning resuming i thread my way through the hospitals   the hurt and wounded i pacify with soothing hand   i sit by the restless all the dark night some are so young   some suffer so much i recall the experience sweet and sad   many a soldiers loving arms about this neck have crossd and rested   many a soldiers kiss dwells on these bearded lips     long too long america    long too long america

works   he calld for volunteers to run the enemys lines a desperate emergency   i saw a hundred and more step forth from the ranks but two or three       were selected   i saw them receive their orders aside they listend with care the       adjutant was very grave   i saw them depart with cheerfulness freely risking their lives     the artillerymans vision    while my wife at my side lies slumbering and the wars are over long   and my head on the pillow rests at home and the vacant midnight passes   and through the stillness through the dark i hear just hear the       breath of my infant   there in the room as i wake from sleep this vision presses upon me   the engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal   the skirmishers begin they crawl cautiously ahead i hear the       irregular snap snap   i hear the sounds of the different missiles the short tht tht       of the rifleballs   i see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds i hear the       great shells shrieking as they pass   the grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees       tumultuous now the contest rages   all the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again   the crashing and smoking the pride of the men in their pieces   the chiefgunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of       the right time   after firing i see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the effect   elsewhere i hear the cry of a regiment charging the young colonel       leads himself this time with brandishd sword   i see the gaps cut by the enemys volleys quickly filld up no delay   i breathe the suffocating smoke then the flat clouds hover low       concealing all   now a strange lull for a few seconds not a shot fired on either side   then resumed the chaos louder than ever with eager calls and       orders of officers   while from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears       a shout of applause some special success   and ever the sound of the cannon far or near rousing even in       dreams a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the       depths of my soul   and ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions batteries       cavalry moving hither and thither   the falling dying i heed not the wounded dripping and red       heed not some to the rear are hobbling   grime heat rush aidedecamps galloping by or on a full run

sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed   as to long panoramas of visions    and i saw askant the armies   i saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battleflags   borne through the smoke of the battles and piercd with missiles i saw them   and carried hither and yon through the smoke and torn and bloody   and at last but a few shreds left on the staffs and all in silence   and the staffs all splinterd and broken    i saw battlecorpses myriads of them   and the white skeletons of young men i saw them   i saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war   but i saw they were

persons have arrived at sinks away from them       except as it results to their bodies and souls   so that often to me they appear gaunt and naked   and often to me each one mocks the others and mocks himself or herself   and of each one the core of life namely happiness is full of the       rotten excrement of maggots   and often to me those men and women pass unwittingly the true       realities of life and go toward false realities   and often to me they are alive after what custom has served them       but nothing more   and often to me they are sad hasty unwaked sonnambules

toward the sky   or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water   or stand under trees in the woods   or talk by day with any one i love or sleep in the bed at night       with any one i love   or sit at table at dinner with the rest   or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car   or watch honeybees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon   or animals feeding in the fields   or birds or the wonderfulness of insects in the air   or the wonderfulness of the sundown or of stars shining so quiet       and bright   or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring   these with the rest one and all are to me miracles   the whole referring yet each distinct and in its place    to me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle   every cubic inch of space is a miracle   every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same   every foot of the interior swarms with the same   to me the sea is a continual miracle   the fishes that

feet swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping   bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers   wandering and confused lost to myself illassorted contradictory   pausing gazing bending and stopping    how solemn they look there stretchd and still   how quiet they breathe the little children in their cradles    the wretched features of ennuyes the white features of corpses the       livid faces of drunkards the sickgray faces of onanists   the gashd bodies on battlefields the insane in their       strongdoord rooms the sacred idiots the newborn emerging       from gates and the dying emerging from gates   the night pervades them and infolds them    the married couple sleep calmly in their bed he with his palm on       the hip of the wife and she with her palm on the hip of the husband   the sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed   the men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs   and the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt    the blind sleep and the deaf and dumb sleep   the prisoner sleeps well in the prison the runaway son sleeps   the murderer that is to be hung next day how does he sleep   and the murderd person how does he sleep    the female that loves unrequited sleeps   and the male that loves unrequited sleeps   the head of the moneymaker that plotted all day sleeps   and the enraged and treacherous dispositions all all sleep    i stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worstsuffering and       the most restless   i pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them   the restless sink in their beds they fitfully sleep    now i pierce the darkness new beings appear   the earth recedes from me into the night   i saw that it was beautiful and i see that what is not the earth is       beautiful    i go from bedside to bedside i sleep close with the other sleepers       each in turn   i dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers   and i become the other dreamers    i am a danceplay up there the fit is whirling me fast    i am the everlaughingit is new moon and twilight   i see the hiding of douceurs i see nimble ghosts whichever way look   cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea and where it is       neither ground nor sea    well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine   only from me can they hide nothing and would not if they could   i reckon i am their boss and they make me a pet besides   and surround me and lead me and run ahead when i walk   to lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretchd arms and       resume the way   onward we move a gay gang of blackguards with mirthshouting       music and wildflapping pennants of joy    i am the actor the actress the voter the politician   the emigrant and the exile the criminal that stood in the box   he who has been famous and he who shall be famous after today   the stammerer the wellformd person the wasted or feeble person    i am she who adornd herself and folded her hair expectantly   my truant lover has come and it is dark    double yourself and receive me darkness   receive me and my lover too he will not let me go without him    i roll myself upon you as upon a bed i resign myself to the dusk    he whom i call answers me and takes the place of my lover   he rises with me silently from the bed    darkness you are gentler than my lover his flesh was sweaty and panting   i feel the hot moisture yet that he left me    my hands are spread forth i pass them in all directions   i would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying    be careful darkness already what was it touchd me   i thought my lover had gone else darkness and he are one   i hear the heartbeat i follow i fade away         2   i descend my western course my sinews are flaccid   perfume and youth course through me and i am their wake    it is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old womans   i sit low in a strawbottom chair and carefully darn my grandsons       stockings    it is i too the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight   i see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth    a shroud i see and i am the shroud i wrap a body and lie in the coffin   it is dark here under ground it is not evil or pain here it is       blank here for reasons    it seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy   whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough         3   i see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies       of the sea   his brown hair lies close and even to his head he strikes out with       courageous arms he urges himself with his legs   i see his white body i see his undaunted eyes   i hate the swiftrunning eddies that would dash him headforemost on       the rocks    what are you doing you ruffianly redtrickled waves   will you kill the courageous giant will you kill him in the prime       of his middle age    steady and long he struggles   he is baffled bangd bruisd he holds out while his strength       holds out   the slapping eddies are spotted with his blood they bear him away       they roll him swing him turn him   his beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies it is       continually bruisd on rocks   swiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse         4   i turn but do not extricate myself   confused a pastreading another but with darkness yet    the beach is cut by the razory icewind the wreckguns sound   the tempest lulls the moon comes floundering through the drifts    i look where the ship helplessly heads end on i hear the burst as       she strikes i hear the howls of dismay they grow fainter and fainter    i cannot aid with my wringing fingers   i can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me    i search with the crowd not one of the company is washd to us alive   in the morning i help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn         5   now of the older wardays the defeat at brooklyn   washington stands inside the lines he stands on the intrenchd       hills amid a crowd of officers   his face is cold and damp he cannot repress the weeping drops   he lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes the color is blanchd       from his cheeks   he sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by       their parents    the same at last and at last when peace is declared   he stands in the room of the old tavern the wellbelovd soldiers       all pass through   the officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns   the chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek   he kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another he shakes hands       and bids goodby to the army         6   now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner

rushes for rushbottoming chairs   her hair straight shiny coarse black profuse halfenvelopd       her face   her step was free and elastic and her voice sounded exquisitely as       she spoke    my mother lookd in delight and amazement at the stranger   she lookd at the freshness of her tallborne face and full and       pliant limbs   the more she lookd upon her she loved her   never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity   she made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace she cookd       food for her   she had no work to give her but she gave her remembrance and fondness    the red squaw staid all the forenoon and toward the middle of the       afternoon she went away   o my mother was loth to have her go away   all the week she thought of her she watchd for her many a month   she rememberd her many a winter and many a summer   but the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again         7   a show of the summer softnessa contact of something

thought i was not alone walking here by the shore   but the one i thought was with me as now i walk by the shore the       one i loved that caressd me   as i lean and look through the glimmering light that one has       utterly disappeard   and those appear that are hateful to me and mock me     assurances    i need no assurances i am a man who is preoccupied of his own soul   i do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and       face i am cognizant of are now looking faces i am not cognizant       of calm and actual faces   i do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in       any iota of the world   i do not doubt i am limitless and that the universes are limitless       in vain i try to think how limitless   i do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their       swift sports through the air on purpose and that i shall one day       be eligible to do as much as they and more than they   i do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of years   i do not doubt interiors have their interiors and exteriors have       their exteriors and that the eyesight has another eyesight and       the hearing another hearing and the voice another voice   i do not doubt that the passionatelywept deaths of young men are       provided for and that the deaths of young women and the       deaths of little children are provided for   did you think life was so well provided for and death the purport       of all life is not well provided for   i do not doubt that wrecks at sea no matter what the horrors of       them no matter whose wife child husband father lover has       gone down are provided for to the minutest points   i do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any       time is provided

music always round me unceasing unbeginning yet long       untaught i did not hear   but now the chorus i hear and am elated   a tenor strong ascending with power and health with glad notes of       daybreak i hear   a soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves   a transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe   the triumphant tutti the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and       violins all these i fill myself with   i hear not the volumes of sound merely i am moved by the exquisite       meanings   i listen to the different voices winding in and out striving       contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion   i do not think the performers know themselvesbut now i think       begin to know them     what ship puzzled

surrounded detached in measureless oceans of space   ceaselessly musing venturing throwing seeking the spheres to       connect them   till the bridge you will need be formd till the ductile anchor hold   till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere o my soul     o living always always dying    o living always always dying   o the burials of me past and present   o me while i stride ahead material visible imperious as ever   o me what i was for years now dead i lament not i am content   o to disengage myself from those corpses of me which i turn and       look at where i cast them   to pass on o living always living and leave the corpses behind     to one shortly to die    from all the rest i single out you having a message for you   you are to dielet others tell you what they

envelop it   i sit quietly by i remain faithful   i am more than nurse more than parent or neighbor   i absolve you from all except yourself spiritual bodily that is       eternal you yourself will surely escape   the corpse you will leave will be but excrementitious    the sun bursts through in unlookedfor directions   strong thoughts fill you and confidence you smile   you forget you are sick

same old man and soulthe same old aspirations and the same content    i was thinking the day most splendid till i saw what the notday exhibited   i was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so noiseless       around me myriads of other globes    now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me i will       measure myself by them   and now touchd with the lives of other globes arrived as far along       as those of the earth   or waiting to arrive or passd on farther than those of the earth   i henceforth no more ignore them than i ignore my own life   or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine or waiting to arrive    o i see now that life cannot exhibit all to me as the day cannot   i see that i am to wait for what will be exhibited by death     thought    as i

truth   discovering today there is no lie or form of lie and can be none       but grows as inevitably upon itself as the truth does upon itself   or as any law of the earth or any natural production of the earth does    this is curious and may not be realized immediately but it must be       realized   i feel in myself that i represent falsehoods equally with the rest   and that the universe does    where has faild a perfect return indifferent of lies or the truth   is it upon the ground or in water or fire or in the spirit of man       or in the meat and blood    meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself i see       that there are really no liars or lies after all   and that nothing fails its perfect return and that what are called       lies are perfect returns   and that each thing exactly represents itself and what has preceded it   and that the truth includes all and is compact just as much as       space is compact   and that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truthbut       that all is truth without exception   and henceforth i will go celebrate any thing i see or am   and sing and laugh and deny nothing     a riddle song    that which eludes

silently gather round me    now sound no note o trumpeters   not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses   with sabres drawn and glistening and carbines by their thighs ah       my brave horsemen   my handsome tanfaced horsemen what life what joy and pride   with all the perils were yours    nor you drummers neither at reveille at dawn   nor the long roll alarming the camp nor even the muffled beat for burial   nothing from you this time o drummers bearing my warlike drums    but aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade   admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless   the slain elate and alive again the dust and debris alive   i chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers    faces so pale with

of these years i sing   how they pass and have passd through convulsd pains as through       parturitions   how america illustrates birth muscular youth the promise the sure       fulfilment the absolute success despite of peopleillustrates       evil as well as good   the vehement struggle so fierce for unity in onesself   how many hold despairingly yet to the models departed caste myths       obedience compulsion and to infidelity   how few see the arrived models the athletes the western states or       see freedom or spirituality or hold any faith in results   but i see the athletes and i see the results of the war glorious       and inevitable and they again leading to other results    how the great cities appearhow the democratic masses turbulent       willful as i love them   how the whirl the contest the wrestle of evil with good the       sounding and resounding keep on and on   how society waits unformd and is for a while between things ended       and things begun   how america is the continent of glories and of the triumph of       freedom and of the democracies and of the fruits of society and       of all that is begun   and how the states are complete in themselvesand how all triumphs       and glories are complete in themselves to lead onward   and how these of mine and of the states will in their turn be       convulsd and serve other parturitions and transitions   and how all people sights combinations the democratic masses too       serveand how every fact and war itself with all its horrors       serves   and how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death         2   of seeds dropping into the ground of births   of the steady concentration of america inland upward to       impregnable and swarming places   of what indiana kentucky arkansas and the rest are to be   of what a few years will show there in nebraska colorado nevada       and the rest   or afar mounting the northern pacific to sitka or aliaska

of camps and soldiers with my love   i bind together and bequeath in this bundle of songs     pensive on her dead gazing    pensive on her dead gazing i heard the mother of all   desperate on the torn bodies on the forms covering the battlefields gazing   as the last gun ceased but the scent of the powdersmoke lingerd   as she calld to her earth with mournful voice while she stalkd   absorb them
