 reddy fox sprang up as if some one had stuck a pin into him    my my my such a rumpus as there was right away in that       hollow tree    what do you mean exclaimed the others all together    he just ate and ate and ate until he couldnt eat another one    there all the way from farmer browns henhouse was a broad trail       in the smooth white snow    yo tell unc billy possum that ah don care if he never comes back      i  unc billy possum is caught   the green meadows were thrown into great excitement late one afternoon just as the black shadows came creeping down from the purple hills reddy fox brought the news and when he told it he grinned as if he enjoyed it and was glad of it  old billy possum is dead i know it because i saw farmer browns boy carrying him home by the tail said reddy so you see he wasnt so smart as you thought he was he added maliciously  no one really believed reddy fox for every one knows that he seldom tells the truth but when jimmy skunk came mournfully down the crooked little path and said that it was true they had to believe it then everybody began to talk about unc billy and say nice things about him and tell how much they had enjoyed having him live in the green forest since he came up from ol virginny that is everybody but reddy fox said so reddy said that it served unc billy right because he was of no account anyway then everybody began to hoot and hiss at reddy until he was glad enough to slink away  and while they were all saying such nice things about him unc billy possum was having an exciting adventure for once he had been too bold he had gone up to farmer browns henhouse before dark jimmy skunk had tried to stop him but he had heeded jimmy skunk not at all he had said that he was hungry and wanted an egg and he couldnt wait till dark to get it so off he had started for unc billy possum is very headstrong and obstinate  he had reached the henhouse and slipped inside without being seen the nests were full of eggs and soon unc billy was enjoying his feast so that he forgot to keep watch suddenly the door opened and in stepped farmer browns boy to get some eggs for supper there was no time to run unc billy just dropped right down in his tracks as if he were dead  when farmer browns boy saw him he didnt know what to make of him for he had never seen unc billy before  well well i wonder what happened to this fellow said farmer browns boy turning unc billy over with the toe of one foot he certainly is dead enough whatever killed him i wonder what he was doing in here  then he saw some egg on unc billys lips ho ho shouted farmer browns boy so you are the thief who has been getting my eggs and picking up unc billy by the tail he started with him for the house  as they passed the woodpile he tossed unc billy on the choppingblock while he gathered an armful of kindlings to take to the house when he turned to pick up unc billy again unc billy wasnt there  farmer browns boy dropped his wood and hunted everywhere but not a trace of unc billy could he find     ii  reddy fox thinks he sees a ghost   reddy fox came down the lone little path through the green forest on his way to the green meadows he had brushed his red coat until it shone his white waistcoat was spotless and he carried his big tail high in the air that it might not become soiled reddy was feeling as fine as he looked he would have liked to sing but every time he tried his voice cracked and he was afraid that some one would hear him and laugh at him if there is one thing that reddy fox dislikes more than another it is being laughed at  reddy chuckled at his thoughts and what do you think he was thinking about why about how he had seen farmer browns boy carrying off unc billy possum by the tail the afternoon before he knew how farmer browns boy had caught unc billy in the henhouse and with his own eyes he had seen unc billy carried off of course unc billy was dead there could be no doubt about it and reddy was glad of it yes sir reddy was glad of it unc billy possum had made altogether too many friends in the green forest and on the green meadows and he had made reddy the laughingstock of them all by the way he had dared reddy to meet bowser the hound and actually had waited for bowser while reddy ran away  reddy remembered that unc billys hollow tree was not far away he would go over that way just to have another look at it so over he went there stood the old hollow tree and half way up was the door out of which unc billy used to look down on him and grin it was reddys turn to grin now presently he sat down with his back against the foot of the tree crossed his legs looked this way and that way to make sure that no one was about and then in a dreadfully cracked voice he began to sing     ol bill possum hes gone before     ol bill possum he is no more           bill was a scamp sir           bill was a thief           bill stole an egg sir           bill came to grief     ol bill possum it served him right     and he is no more for he died last night  very good sah very good ah certnly am obliged to yoall for yo serenade said a voice that seemed to come out of the tree at reddys back  reddy fox sprang up as if some one had stuck a pin into him every hair stood on end as he looked up at unc billys doorway then his teeth began to chatter with fright looking out of unc billys doorway and grinning down at him was something that looked for all the world like unc billy himself  it must be his ghost said reddy and tucking his tail between his legs he started up the crooked little path as fast as his legs could take him  reddy never once looked back if he had he might have seen unc billy possum climb down from the hollow tree and shake hands with jimmy skunk who had just come along  how did ah do it why ah just pretended ah was daid when farmer browns boy caught me explained unc billy of course he wouldnt kill a daid possum so when he tossed me down on the choppingblock and turned his back ah just naturally came to life again and here ah am  unc billy possum grinned broader than ever and jimmy skunk grinned too     iii  unc billy possum sends for his family   the news that unc billy possum wasnt dead at all but was back in his hollow tree in the green forest soon spread through all the green forest and over the green meadows everybody hastened to pay their respects that is everybody but reddy fox unc billy and his partner jimmy skunk told every one who called how reddy fox had thought that unc billy was a ghost and had been frightened almost to death so that he ran away as fast as his legs could take him unc billy grinned as he told how reddy had sat under the hollow tree and tried to sing because he was so glad that unc billy was dead and all the little people of the green forest and the green meadows laughed until their sides ached when in a funny cracked voice unc billy sang the song for them  thereafter whenever one of them caught sight of reddy fox at a safe distance he would shout     ol bill possum hes gone before     ol bill possum he is no more  it got so that reddy never came down on the green meadows in the daytime and at night he avoided meeting any one if possible even his old friend bobby coon and of course reddy fox hated unc billy possum more than ever  but unc billy didnt care not he he knew that all the rest of the little people of the green forest and the green meadows thought him the smartest of them all because of the way in which he had fooled bowser the hound and farmer browns boy he liked his neighbors he liked the green forest and so he made up his mind that this was the place for him to stay  but in spite of all his friends unc billy was lonesome the longer he stayed the more lonesome he grew unc billy wanted his family whom he had left way down in ol virginny finally he told jimmy skunk all about it and for once unc billy had forgotten how to grin yes sir unc billy had forgotten how to grin instead he just wept wept great big tears of lonesomeness  ah reckon ahll have to go back to ol virginny ah certnly do said unc billy possum  jimmy skunk grew very thoughtful since he and unc billy possum had been in partnership jimmy had had more eggs to eat than ever before in his whole life now unc billy was talking about going away jimmy thought very hard then he had a bright idea  why not send for your family to come here and live in the green forest uncle billy he asked  unc billy stopped crying his two little eyes looked up sharply how do yoall reckon ah can send word he asked  jimmy scratched his head theres mr skimmer the swallow hes fixing to go south perhaps hell take the message to your family said he  the very thing cried unc billy possum wiping his eyes ah thanks yo sah ah does indeed ahll see mistah skimmer at once  and without another word unc billy possum started down the crooked little path for the green meadows to look for skimmer the swallow     iv  bobby coon enters the wrong house   after unc billy possum had arranged with skimmer the swallow who was going south to take a message to his family in ol virginny telling them to come and join him in the green forest he at once began to make preparations to receive them unc billy isnt any too fond of work he had a lot rather that some one else should do the work for him and he is smart enough to fix it so that usually some one else does  but getting ready to receive his family was different no one else could arrange things to suit him this was unc billys own job and he tended right to it every minute of the day first of all he had to clean house he had been keeping bachelors hall so long in the big hollow tree that things were not very tidy so unc billy cleaned house and while he worked he whistled and sang peter rabbit passing that way overheard unc billy singing     mah ol woman is away down souf             come along come along     aint nothin sharper than the tongue in her mouf             come along come along     she once was pretty but she aint no mo     but she cooks mah meals an she sweeps mah flo     she darns mah stockings an she mends mah coat     an she knows jes how

along come along  every little while unc billy possum would sit down to rest for he wasnt used to so much real work but finally he got his house clean and made as comfortable as possible and about that time be began to think how good an egg would taste the more he thought about it the more he wanted that egg  its no use talking ah just naturally has to have that egg said unc billy to himself and off he started for farmer browns  now unc billy was hardly out of sight when along came bobby coon bobby coon was absentminded or else he was so sleepy that he didnt know what he was doing for bobby coon had been out all night anyway when he reached unc billy possums hollow tree he began to climb up it just as if it were his own he looked in at unc billys door there was the most comfortable bed that he had seen for a long time he looked this way and he looked that way nobody was in sight then he looked in at unc billys door once more that bed certainly did look soft and comfortable bobby coon chuckled to himself  i believe ill just see if that bed is as comfortable as it looks said he  and two minutes later bobby coon was curled up fast asleep in unc billy possums bed     v  bobby coon is waked up      deys acoming deys acoming deys acoming mighty soon     but dey cant come soon enuff fo me     deys acoming deys acoming at de turning ob de moon     whar ah waits in mah ol holler tree  unc billy possum was singing to himself as he slowly trudged home from farmer browns henhouse he was feeling very good very good indeed was unc billy possum no one appreciates strictly fresh eggs more than unc billy does and he had found more than he could eat waiting for him in farmer browns henhouse now his stomach was full his house had been cleaned and put to rights ready for his family when they should arrive from ol virginny and he had nothing to do but wait for them so he trudged along and sang in a funny cracked voice  presently he came to his big hollow tree and started to climb up to the door of his house half way up he broke off short in the middle of his song and sat down on a convenient branch he put one ear against the trunk of the tree and listened then he put the other ear against the tree and listened there certainly was a funny noise and it seemed to come from right inside his hollow tree unc billy turned and looked up at his doorway scratching his head thoughtfully with one hand  mah goodness said unc billy it certnly sounds like there was somebody in mah house  then very softly unc billy crept up to his doorway and peeped in it was dark inside so that unc billy could see little else than that his nice freshly made comfortable bed was all mussed up but if he couldnt see he could hear oh yes indeed unc billy could hear perfectly well and what he heard was a snore there was some one in unc billys house and more than that they were fast asleep in unc billys bed  mah goodness mah goodness exclaimed unc billy possum and his two sharp little eyes began to snap then he stuck his head in at the door and shouted  hi yoall what yo doing in mah house  the only answer was another snore unc billy waited a minute then he put his head in once more  yo better come out of mah house mr whoeveryoare before ah comes in and puts yo out shouted unc billy  the only answer was a snore louder than before then unc billy quite lost his temper some one who had no business there was in his house he didnt know who it was and he didnt care they were going to come out or he would know why not unc billy gritted his teeth and in he went  my my my such a rumpus as there was right away in that hollow tree peter rabbit happened to be coming along that way and heard it peter stopped and gazed at the hollow tree with eyes and mouth wide open such a snarling and growling then out of the doorway began to fly leaves and moss they were part of unc billys bed then peter saw a big ringed tail hanging out of the doorway peter recognized it right away no one possessed a tail like that but bobby coon  in a minute bobby followed his tail hastily backing down the tree then unc billys sharp little old face appeared at the doorway unc billy looked down at peter rabbit and grinned  ah guess mistah coon done make a mistake when he went to bed in mah house said he  and bobby coon sheepishly admitted that he did     vi  sammy jay learns peter rabbits secret      im mr jaybird teeheehee     im mr jaybird you watch me     youve got to rise fore break of day     if you want to fool old mr jay   over and over sammy jay hummed this as he brushed his handsome blue and white coat then he laughed as he remarked to no one in particular for no one was near enough to hear peter rabbits got a secret when peter goes about whispering its a sure sign that hes got a secret he thinks that he can keep it from me but he cant oh my no i never knew of a secret that could be kept by more than two people and already ive seen peter whisper to five ill just see what reddy fox knows about it  with a flirt of his tail sammy jay started for the green meadows where reddy fox was busy hunting for his breakfast  its a fine morning reddy fox said sammy jay  it would be finer if i could fill my stomach faster replied reddy  thats a pretty good secret of peter rabbits isnt it asked sammy pretending to look very wise  reddy pricked up his sharp little ears  what secret he demanded  if you dont know im not going to tell retorted sammy jay just as if he knew all about it and off he flew to hunt up his cousin blacky the crow blacky knew nothing about peter rabbits secret nor did shadow the weasel whom he met by the way but sammy jay was not in the least bit discouraged  ill try johnny chuck hell know said sammy to himself  he found johnny sitting on his doorstep watching the world go by  good morning johnny chuck said sammy with a low bow  good morning replied johnny chuck who always is polite  isnt that a fine secret of peter rabbits exclaimed sammy just as if he knew all about it  johnny chuck raised his eyebrows and put on the most surprised look  do tell me what it is he begged  oh if you dont know i wont tell for that wouldnt be fair replied sammy and tried to look very honest and innocent and then he flew over to the green forest and as he flew he said to himself johnny chuck cant fool me he does know peter rabbits secret  over in the green forest he found drummer the woodpecker making a great racket on the hollow limb of an old chestnut sammy sat down near by and listened my thats fine i wish i could do that you must be practising said sammy at the end of a long ratatattat  drummer the woodpecker felt very much flattered i am said he im practising for peter rabbits party  i thought so replied sammy jay of course he hadnt thought anything of the kind  wont unc billy possum be surprised remarked drummer the woodpecker as he sat down to rest  he surely will replied sammy jay and then he flattered and flattered drummer the woodpecker until finally drummer told all about peters plan for a surprise party for unc billy possum  by and by as he flew home sammy jay chuckled and said     youve got to rise fore break of day     if you want to fool old mr jay     vii  four little scamps plan mischief     some folks think theyre mighty smart           oh la me oh la me     like the knave who stole the tart           oh la me oh la me     some folks will waken up some day     and find they cant fool mr jay   sammy jay was mightily pleased with himself he had found out all about peter rabbits plan to give unc billy possum a surprise party when his family came up from ol virginny he had found out that all the little forest and meadow people but himself and his cousin blacky the crow and reddy fox and shadow the weasel had been invited and that each was to bring something good to eat sammy jay smacked his lips as he thought of this then he looked up at jolly round red mr sun and winked  now on all the green meadows and in all the green forest there live no greater scamps than sammy jay and blacky the crow and reddy fox and shadow the weasel the worst of it is they are not honest they steal whenever they get a chance and always they try to get others into trouble that was why peter rabbit had left them out when he planned his surprise party for unc billy possum  sammy jay called the three others together under the lone pine and told them all about peter rabbits plan and how they had been left out of course blacky the crow and reddy fox and shadow the weasel were angry very angry indeed for no one likes to be left out of a good time the more sammy jay told them the angrier they grew and the angrier they grew the more sammy jay chuckled way down inside sammy had a plan and the angrier the others grew the more likely were they to help him  you wait till i catch peter rabbit said reddy fox and showed all his teeth he quite forgot that despite all his smartness he never yet had caught peter rabbit  blacky the crow scratched his head thoughtfully we can spoil his surprise by telling unc billy possum all about it beforehand said he  sammy jay winked at each of the others he cleared his throat and looked all around to make sure that no one else was near then he leaned forward and whispered lets invite ourselves to the party  what do you mean exclaimed the others all together  just what i say replied sammy well be the real surprise before the party begins you will hide close to where it is to be when everybody has got there and brought all the good things to eat ill come flying along and scream here comes bowser the hound of course every one will run away and well have all the good things to eat  haw haw haw the very thing well all be there cried blacky the crow  the four little scamps shook hands and separated as they went across the green meadows sammy jays voice floated back to the lone pine he was singing although he has a very poor voice for singing and this was his song  illustration what do you mean exclaimed the others all together     some folks think theyre mighty smart           oh la me oh la me     like the knave who stole the tart           oh la me oh la me     some folks will waken up some day     and find they cant fool mr jay  is that so really now i want to know said old mr toad crawling from under the very piece of bark on which sammy jay had sat when he told his plan then old mr toad winked slowly and solemnly at jolly round red mr sun and started off to find peter rabbit     viii  peter rabbit sends out word   it was a beautiful morning everybody said so and what everybody says is usually so peter rabbit wore the broadest kind of a smile he hopped and skipped all the way down the lone little path on to the green meadows and was waiting there when old mother west wind came down from the purple hills and turning her big bag upside down tumbled out all her children the merry little breezes to play peter stopped them before they had a chance to run away he whispered to each and each in turn started to dance across the green meadows to carry the news that this was the day of peter rabbits surprise party for unc billy possum whose family would arrive that very morning from way down in ol virginny  sammy jay had risen very early that morning almost at once his sharp eyes had seen peter rabbit sending out the merry little breezes sammys wits are as sharp as his eyes and you know it is very hard to really fool sharp wits right away sammy had guessed what the merry little breezes were hurrying so for but he sat and waited and listened pretty soon he heard drummer the woodpecker start a long ratatattat over by unc billy possums hollow tree then sammy was sure that this was the day of peter rabbits party sammy grinned as he hurried off to find blacky the crow and reddy fox and shadow the weasel  reddy was not yet out of bed but when he heard sammy jay at his door he tumbled out in a hurry he didnt stop to get any breakfast because he had planned to get all he could eat at the party so he hurried over to where the party was to be very cautiously he crept up and when he was quite sure that no one was about he crawled into a hollow log which was open at one end there he stretched himself out and made himself as comfortable as he could  pretty soon shadow the weasel joined reddy fox in the hollow log and they whispered and chuckled while they waited they knew that blacky the crow was safely hidden in the top of a tall pine where he could see all that went on and that sammy jay was flying about over the green meadows and through the green forest pretending that he was attending wholly to his own business but really watching all the preparations for peter rabbits party at the foot of a tree in the top of which prickly porky the porcupine was eating his breakfast sat old mr toad nodding sleepily sammy jay saw him there but smart as sammy is he didnt once suspect innocentlooking old mr toad you see he didnt know that old mr toad had overheard all of his plans     ix  mr toad and prickly porky put their heads together   slowly prickly porky the porcupine climbed down from the top of the tall poplar tree where he had been getting his breakfast of tender young bark he grunted as he worked his way down for he had with him a bundle of bark to take over to peter rabbits surprise party when he reached the ground prickly porky shook himself until he rattled the thousand little spears hidden in his long coat  teeheehee  who dares to laugh at me demanded pricky porky shaking himself until all the little spears rattled again and some of them began to peep out of his long coat  no one is laughing at you replied a voice right behind him  prickly porky turned around there sat old mr toad his big mouth was stretched wide open and he was laughing all to himself something was tickling old mr toad mightily  prickly porky scowled and a few more little spears peeped out of his long coat you know no one likes to be laughed at and it certainly did look as if old mr toad was laughing at him  mr toad stopped laughing and hopped a step nearer its a joke said he and slowly winked one eye  i dont see any joke said prickly porky and his voice was very fretful  mr toad hopped a step nearer are you going to peter rabbits party  of course i am what a foolish question replied prickly porky  to be sure a very foolish question a very foolish question indeed assented mr toad do you know that sammy jay and blacky the crow and reddy fox and shadow the weasel who have not been invited are planning to break up the party and then gobble up all the good things to eat he continued  prickly porky laid down his bundle of tender young bark and stared at old mr toad how do you know he demanded  old mr toad chuckled deep down in his throat i was underneath a piece of bark on which sammy jay was sitting when the plan was made of course he didnt know i was there and of course i didnt tell him  of course not interrupted prickly porky beginning to grin  of course not continued mr toad grinning too then he told prickly porky all about the plan he had overheard how reddy fox and shadow the weasel and blacky the crow were to hide near unc billy possums hollow tree and how sammy jay was to frighten away everybody else by pretending that bowser the hound was coming  have you told peter rabbit asked prickly porky  not yet but im going to by and by replied old mr toad but first i want you to help me fool sammy jay and blacky the crow and reddy fox and shadow the weasel will you  of course i will if i can but how can i answered prickly porky promptly  old mr toad hopped up and stretching up on tiptoe whispered in one of prickly porkys ears prickly porky began to smile then he began to chuckle finally he laughed until he had to hold his sides  will you do it asked mr toad  prickly porky reached for his bundle of tender young bark of course i will said he still chuckling come on mr toad its time we were going     x  the runaway cabbage   reddy fox hiding with shadow the weasel in a hollow log near unc billy possums home nudged shadow with his elbow  i hear some one coming he whispered  shadow peeped out its old mr toad and prickly porky he whispered back  something that sounded very much like a growl sounded way down deep in the throat of reddy fox for reddy has no love for prickly porky  and there comes jimmy skunk with a biggoose egg under each arm continued shadow smacking his lips reddy fox wriggled up where he could peep out too  my goodness whats that coming down the lone little path whispered reddy  shadow looked then he began to laugh and reddy began to laugh too but it was laughter that made no sound for reddy and shadow didnt want any one to know that they were hiding there it was a funny sight they were peeping out at it certainly was a funny sight down the lone little path came peter rabbit and his cousin juniper the hare rolling a huge cabbage  right at the top of a little hill the cabbage got away from them down it started rolling and bounding along with peter rabbit and jumper the hare frantically trying to catch it just ahead was johnny chuck with a big bundle of sweet clover which he was bringing to peter rabbits party he didnt see the big cabbage coming it knocked his feet from under him and down he went with a thump flat on his back right on top of him fell jumper the hare who was close behind the runaway cabbage and had no time to turn aside over the two of them fell peter rabbit such a mixup  and the big cabbage kept right on running away jimmy skunk who never hurries heard the noise behind him and turned to see what it all meant but he didnt have time to more than blink his eyes before the runaway cabbage hit him full in the stomach down went jimmy skunk with a grunt one big egg flew over against a tree and broke jimmy landed on the other and this broke too  such a sight as jimmy skunk was egg dripped from every part of his handsome black and white coat it was in his eyes and all over his face and dripped from his whiskers shadow the weasel and reddy fox hiding in the hollow log laughed until the tears rolled down their cheeks though down in the heart of shadow was bitter disappointment for he had planned to steal those very eggs  just a little way beyond jimmy skunk the runaway cabbage brought up with a thump against a stump on which sat striped chipmunk with the pockets in his cheeks filled full of yellow corn the sudden bump of the big cabbage made striped chipmunk lose his balance and off he tumbled right down on to old mr toad who had just sat down behind the stump for a few minutes of rest it knocked all the wind out of mr toad and of course striped chipmunk spilled all his corn  prickly porky the porcupine heard the noise he looked up to see a strange thing bounding down the lone little path prickly porky didnt wait to see what it was he did just what he always does when he thinks there may be danger he rolled himself up with his face hidden in his waistcoat and when he did that the thousand little spears hidden in his coat stood out until he looked like a giant chestnut burr  the runaway cabbage bounced off the stump and hit prickly porky then it stopped where it had touched prickly porky the sharp little spears had stuck into it so that when peter rabbit and jumper the hare hurried up there lay the runaway cabbage looking for all the world like a great green pincushion     xi  reddy fox goes hungry   like a great green pincushion lay the runaway cabbage of peter rabbit and jumper the hare every one thought it was the very best joke ever jimmy skunk had gone off to take a bath and get two more eggs for peter rabbits party reddy fox and shadow the weasel peeping out from the hollow log where they were hiding could see jimmy on his way back with a big goose egg under each arm shadow smacked his lips he meant to have those eggs himself  pretty soon all the little forest and meadow people whom peter rabbit had invited were gathered around the foot of unc billy possums hollow tree and each had brought something good to eat my such a feast as was spread out there now they were waiting for unc billy possum who had gone to meet his family coming up from ol virginny  over in the top of a tall pine tree blacky the crow was hiding and chuckling to himself as he watched reddy fox was getting impatient he was hungry he had had no breakfast and as he lay hiding in the hollow log he could peep out and see all the good things and he could smell them too it seemed as if his stomach would just give him no peace at all he wished that sammy jay would bring the false message that bowser the hound was coming so as to frighten all the rest away  im nearly starved whispered reddy fox i hope sammy jay will hurry up  just then they noticed that peter rabbit was very busy he hopped from guest to guest and whispered in the ear of each  now i wonder what peter rabbit is whispering about said reddy  suddenly the light at the end of the hollow log disappeared there was a queer rattling sound that sent shivers up and down reddys backbone prickly porky the porcupine had sat down with his back against the end of the hollow log and the queer rattling sound was made by the thousand little spears in his long coat reddy fox and shadow the weasel were in a prison you see there was no other opening to the hollow log  never mind whispered shadow the weasel hell go away when sammy jay shouts that bowser the hound is coming  blacky the crow hidden in the top of the tall pine was also wondering what peter was whispering his sharp eyes watched peter and every time that peter whispered in the ear of one of the little meadow or forest people they would laugh  now sammy jay knew nothing about all this by and by when he thought that every one was there sammy came flying through the green forest just as if he knew nothing about peter rabbits party now sammy with all his faults is one of the best watchmen in the green forest if there is any danger which his sharp eyes discover he always screams at the top of his lungs so though he steals and plays tricks and makes life very uncomfortable for the others they always stop to listen when sammy sounds a warning because sammy knew this he felt sure of breaking up this party  as soon as he came in sight of all the little meadow and forest people he began to shriek at the top of his lungs  run run run here comes bowser the hound he shouted  no one moved and this puzzled sammy so that he hardly knew what to do but he kept right on shrieking just as if bowser was right close at hand still no one moved sammy stopped on a tall pine and pretended to be terribly excited  you had better run before bowser gets here he shouted  what do you think happened then why everybody set up a great shout ha ha ha laughed peter rabbit  ho ho ho shouted johnny chuck  hee hee hee giggled danny meadow mouse  what time will bowser get here asked bobby coon gravely  tell bowser that we are all waiting for him added jimmy skunk  is bowser quite out of breath inquired jerry muskrat  i would like nothing better than to run a race with bowser the hound said jumper the hare sitting up very straight  sammy jay didnt know what to do or what to say he was just the most disgusted looking jay that ever flew through the green forest and all the time he wondered and wondered and wondered how it could be that peter rabbit and his friends knew that bowser the hound was not in the green forest at all you see old mr toad had told peter all about sammys plan and this is what peter had been whispering to the others     xii  prickly porky makes himself at home   peter rabbits party promised to be a great success when old mr toad who had overheard sammy jays plan had told peter rabbit all about it he had also told peter that reddy fox and shadow the weasel were hiding in an old hollow log close by  peter had whispered the news in the ear of each of the little forest and meadow people and had told them how prickly porky was even then sitting with his back against the opening in the hollow log  every one had thought this the best joke ever for of course they all knew that reddy fox and shadow the weasel could not get out past the thousand little spears hidden in the long coat of prickly porky  prickly porky settled himself very comfortably and began to tell stories about his home way up in the north woods every few minutes he would rattle the thousand little spears in his coat and though no one could see reddy fox and shadow the weasel inside the hollow log every one could guess just how little shivers were running up and down the backbones of the two little scamps held prisoners there  prickly porky told how in the cold cold winter the snow piled up and piled up in his far northern home until nearly all the forest folk who lived there had to make a long journey into the south or else went into warm snug hollows in the trees or caves in the rocks and slept the long winter through just as johnny chuck does he told how the indians came through the great forest on big webbed shoes that kept them from sinking into the snow and hunted for lightfoot the deer and how they never bothered prickly porky but always treated him with the greatest respect he told so many many interesting things about the great north woods that all the little meadow people and forest folk gathered close around to listen but every few minutes while he was talking he would shake his thousand little spears and then every one would smile  inside the hollow log reddy fox was getting stiff and sore because you know he didnt have room enough to even turn over worse still he was so hungry that he could cry you see he had crept in there very early in the morning without any breakfast because he had planned that when sammy jay should break up peter rabbits party he would steal all the good things he wanted now he could smell them and hear the others talking about the feast they were going to have and he knew that not so much as a tiny tiny crumb would be left for him when prickly porky should choose to let him out  shadow the weasel felt just as uncomfortable as reddy fox and shadow is very shorttempered every time reddy moved and squeezed shadow shadow would snap at him now of course they could hear everything that was said outside and the things that were said were not pleasant to listen to bobby coon and billy mink and johnny chuck and little joe otter and jimmy skunk told about all the mean things and all the sharp tricks that reddy fox and shadow had done it made the two little prisoners so angry that they ground their teeth but every time they made the least little movement prickly porky would shake his thousand little spears and settle himself still more firmly against the opening in the hollow log he certainly was enjoying himself it tickled him almost to pieces to think how easily he had trapped smart reddy fox the boaster  so they waited all the long day for the coming of unc billy possums family and when at last they did arrive there was the merriest surprise party ever seen only sammy jay blacky the crow reddy fox and shadow the weasel were unhappy and of course no one cared for that     xiii  unc billy possum grows hungry   unc billy possum spent the very coldest days of winter curled up in his warm snug home in the big hollow tree in the green forest unc billy didnt like the cold weather sometimes he would stick his head out of his doorway and then as he heard rough brother north wind whooping through the green forest he would turn right around and go back to his bed for another nap and all the time he would be saying     way down souf de sun am shinin         yas sah dat am so     fo dat lan mah heart am pinin         yas sah dat am so      de mockingbird he sings all day     de alligators am at play     de flowers dey am bloomin fair     and mah heart aches to be down there         yas sah dat am so  now unc billy had prepared for the winter by getting just as fat as he knew how he was so fat that he could hardly waddle when jack frost first came to the green forest you see he knew that if he was very very fat he wouldnt have to worry about getting anything to eat not for a long time anyway so when the ice and snow came and unc billy decided that it was more comfortable indoors than outdoors he was almost as fat as johnny chuck was when he went to sleep for the long winter  now johnny chuck just slept and slept and slept without waking once the whole winter long but unc billy possum couldnt sleep like that he had to stick his head out every little while to see how the world was getting along without him when the sun was bright and the air was not too cold unc billy would sometimes climb down from his hollow tree and walk about a little on the snow but he didnt enjoy it much it made his feet cold and then he didnt like the tracks he made he scowled at them for he knew well enough that if farmer browns boy should happen along he would know right away who had made those tracks and then he would hunt for unc billys home in the hollow tree so unc billy didnt go out very much and very seldom indeed when the snow was soft  it seemed to unc billy possum as if the winter never never would go he was beginning to grow thin now and of course he was getting hungry he began to think about it and the more he thought about it the hungrier he grew one morning he stuck his head out of his doorway and whom should he see trotting along below but jimmy skunk jimmy looked fat and comfortable and as if he did not mind the cold weather at all  good moning jimmy skunk said unc billy  jimmy skunk looked up hello unc billy he exclaimed i havent seen you for a long time  whar yo been jimmy skunk asked unc billy  jimmy winked one eye getting my breakfast of nice fresh eggs he replied  unc billy possums mouth began to water did yo leave any he anxiously inquired  jimmy skunk allowed that he did and unc billy gave a long sigh as he watched jimmy skunk amble off up the lone little path unc billy couldnt sleep any more now no sir he couldnt sleep a wink all he could do was to think how hungry he was he would shut his eyes and then it seemed as if he could see right into farmer browns henhouse and there were eggs eggs eggs everywhere finally unc billy made up his mind  ahm going up there the very first dark night said he     xiv  old mrs possum grows worried   old mrs possum counted her babies to be sure that they all were tucked snug and warm in their bed in the old hollow tree in the green forest one two three four five six seven eight they were all there mrs possum looked at them with a great deal of pride and sighed as she thought of how soon they would be leaving the old hollow tree to see the great world and make homes for themselves just as soon as the beautiful spring came they would one by one slip away mrs possum sighed again she didnt like winter no sir she didnt like winter one bit but when she thought of how her babies would leave her she almost wished that spring never would come  sure that her babies were warm and comfortable old mrs possum went to the door and looked out it was plain to be seen that mrs possum was worried that was the tenth time she had looked out in half an hour her sharp little old face looked sharper than ever it always looks sharper when she is worried just as the tongues of some people always grow sharper when they are worried  ah don see what can be keepin mah ol man ahm plumb worried to death muttered old mrs possum  right that very minute she heard a noise outside that made her hurry to the door and thrust her head out once more it was sammy jay shrieking  thief thief thief at the top of his lungs  hes a thief himself and just a lowdown mischiefmaker for all his smart cloes but he knows a powerful lot about what is going on in the green forest and perhaps he has seen mah ol man said old mrs possum as she tried to make her sharp face as pleasant as possible she looked over at sammy jay who was in the next tree and smiled and when she smiled she showed all her sharp teeth  good moning brer jay said she  hello exclaimed sammy jay not at all politely wheres uncle billy possum  old mrs possum shook her head and the worried look came back into her face although she tried hard oh so hard not to let it  he done go out fo a walk replied old mrs possum ah reckons yoall just got up or yo would have met up with him somewhere  old mrs possum said this just to try to make sammy jay talk for sammy is very quicktempered and quicktempered people often say a lot more than they mean to you see mrs possum was quite sure that if sammy jay knew how worried she was over unc billy possum he would refuse to tell her whether or not he had seen unc billy for sammy jay is mean and loves to torment others  sammys temper flared up right away ive been up ever since sunup he sputtered your old man isnt anywhere in the green forest unless hes gone to sleep in some other hollow tree and i wouldnt blame him a bit if he had no sir i wouldnt blame him the least bit     keep your temper brer jay     keep your temper do oh pray  said old mrs possum grinning in the most aggravating way as she turned back to her babies she had found out what she wanted to knowsammy jay had seen nothing of unc billy possum old mrs possum sat down with her head in her hands she was more worried than ever     xv  the foolishness of unc billy possum   if unc billy possum hadnt happened to look out of his doorway in the big hollow tree in the green forest or if jimmy skunk hadnt happened to come along just that very minute or if unc billy hadnt asked jimmy where he had been or if jimmy hadnt mentioned nice fresh eggs unc billy wouldnt have been foolish and old mrs possum wouldnt have been worried but all those things did happen  after jimmy skunk had mentioned his fine breakfast of fresh eggs unc billy possum couldnt think of anything else he knew well enough where jimmy had found those eggs yes indeed unc billy knew all about it he could shut his eyes and just see the inside of farmer browns henhouse with the rows of hens and roosters sitting on the roosts at one end their heads tucked under their wings he could see the rows of nests and the beautiful brown eggs in them jimmy skunk couldnt climb and so he could have gotten only the eggs in the lower nests now if he unc billy had been there he could have climbed to the very topmost nest andbut what was the use of thinking about it he hadnt been there and he couldnt go now because it was daylight  all the rest of the day unc billy tried to sleep but when he did sleep he dreamed about eggs nice fresh delicious eggs and when he was awake he though about eggs it made him more and more uneasy and fidgety old mrs possum couldnt stand it  what all am the matter with yo she snapped ah do wish yo would keep still a minute  unc billy muttered something but all that mrs possum could hear was eggs  now dont yoall get to thinking of such foolishness as eggs she commanded it isnt safe to be snooping around farmer browns henhouse when theres snow on the ground yo just foget all about eggs do yo hear what ah say  unc billy nodded that he did but just the same he couldnt think of anything else he knew that old mrs possum was right and that it wasnt safe to go fooling around farmer browns henhouse and leaving his tracks for everybody who came along to see just the same unc billy felt that he had got to have a nice fresh egg he had got to have it that is all there was about it  as soon as jolly round red mr sun had gone to bed behind the purple hills that night unc billy crept out of his home in the hollow tree  where are yo going demanded mrs possum  just to stretch the kinks out of mah legs replied unc billy  old mrs possum looked after him suspiciously dont yo go fo to do any foolishness she called  unc billy didnt answer he was on his way to farmer browns henhouse     xvi  why unc billy possum didnt go home   unc billy possum had a very good reason for not going home a very good reason indeed even old mrs possum would have thought it was a good reason could she have known it but she didnt know it and so she sat in the home in the big hollow tree in the green forest and worried herself almost sick because unc billy didnt come home and she didnt know what might have happened to him  sometimes unc billy wished that he was back in the old hollow tree and sometimes he was glad that he was right where he was sometimes he felt little shivers of fear run all over him as he thought of what might become of him if he should be found sometimes a little tickly feeling of pleasure ran all over him as he bit a hole in the end of a freshly laid egg and sucked the egg out of the shell  now unc billy was very very crafty he had found jimmy skunks tracks boldly leading up to the henhouse so unc billy had stepped as carefully as he knew how in the footprints of jimmy skunk in order that farmer browns boy might think that jimmy skunk was the only visitor to the henhouse but with all his craft there was one thing that unc billy forgot yes sir there was one thing unc billy forgot all about he forgot to keep his tail up he was trying so hard to step in the footprints of jimmy skunk that he forgot all about that little smooth handy old tail of his and he let it drag along the snow  illustration he just ate and ate until he couldnt eat another one  when unc billy was safely in the henhouse he hurried from one nest to another there were eggs plenty of them it seemed to him that nothing he had ever seen before had looked half so good as those eggs he just ate and ate and ate until he couldnt eat another one now a full stomach is very apt to make a sleepy head unc billy knew that the thing for him to do was to hurry home as fast as he could go but he didnt no sir he didnt do it the henhouse was warm and here were some of the nicest nests of hay he was tired after his long walk from the green forest for unc billy had done so little walking this winter that he was rather out of practice why not take a teeny weeny nap before he started back home  unc billy climbed to the very last nest in the topmost row way up in a dark corner it hadnt been used for a long time but it was full of nice soft hay unc billy curled himself up in it and with a great sigh of contentment closed his eyes for that teeny weeny nap he didnt open them again until he heard an angry voice right close to him he peeped out it was broad daylight and there just below him was farmer browns boy looking at the empty eggshells left by unc billy farmer browns boy was angry yes indeed he was very very angry unc billy shivered as he listened then he snuggled down out of sight under the hay of the nest     xvii  unc billy possum lies low   farmer browns boy was angry yes sir he was angry there was no doubt about that he had found the empty shells of the eggs which unc billy had eaten in the night and unc billy knew by the sound of his voice that farmer browns boy meant to find the thief  it was a terrible position to be in right there in the henhouse with no chance to run unc billy wished with all his might that he had never thought of eggs and that he was safe back home in the dear old hollow tree in the green forest oh dear oh dear why hadnt he gone right straight back there after eating those eggs instead of taking a nap but he hadnt he had taken a nap and overslept and here he was right in the henhouse in broad daylight  it must have been a skunk said farmer browns boy and if it was he must have left some tracks in the snow outside ill just look around a bit  unc billy almost chuckled as he heard farmer browns boy go out  hell find jimmy skunks tracks but he wont find mine thought unc billy isnt it lucky that i thought to step right in jimmy skunks tracks when i came here  he lay still and listened to farmer browns boy poking around outside he heard him exclaim ah i thought so and knew that he had found the tracks jimmy skunk had made in the snow unc billy almost chuckled again as he thought what a smart fellow he had been to step in jimmy skunks tracks and right then he heard something that put an end to all his fine thoughts about his own smartness and sent little cold shivers up and down his backbone  hello said the voice of farmer browns boy these are queer tracks that skunk must have had a queer tail for here are the marks of it in the snow and they look as if they might have been made by the tail of a very big rat  unc billy remembered then for the first time that when he had thought he was so smart he had forgotten to hold his tail up he had dragged it in the snow and of course it had left a mark  i guess that there was more than one visitor here last night continued the voice of farmer browns boy here are the tracks of the skunk going away from the henhouse but i dont see any of those other queer tracks going away whoever made them must be right around here now  back into the henhouse came farmer browns boy and began to poke around in all the corners he moved all the boxes and looked in the grain bin then he began to look in the nests unc billy could hear him coming nearer and nearer he was looking in the very next nest to the one in which unc billy was finally he looked into that very nest unc billy possum held his breath  now the nest in which unc billy was hiding was on the topmost row in the darkest corner of the henhouse and unc billy had crawled down underneath the hay perhaps it was because that corner was so dark or perhaps it was because that nest was so high up that farmer browns boy really didnt expect to find anything there anyway all he saw was the hay and he didnt take the trouble to put his hand in and feel for anything under the hay  its queer said farmer browns boy its very queer i guess i shall have to set some traps  and all the time unc billy possum held his breath and lay low     xviii  unc billy possum is a prisoner      mah home is in a holler tree       its a long way home     ah wish ahs there but here ah be       its a long way home     if ah had only been content     instead of out on mischief bent     ahd have no reason to repent       its a long way home   unc billy possum lay curled up under the hay in the highest nest in the darkest corner in farmer browns henhouse unc billy didnt dare go to sleep because he was afraid that farmer browns boy might find him and anyway he wanted to see just what farmer browns boy was doing so peeping out he watched farmer browns boy who seemed to be very busy indeed what do you think he was doing unc billy knew yes sir unc billy knew just what farmer browns boy was doing he was setting traps  unc billys eyes twinkled as he watched farmer browns boy for unc billy knew that those traps were being set for him and now that he knew just where each one was of course he wasnt a bit afraid it seemed to unc billy that it was just the greatest kind of a joke to be watching farmer browns boy set those traps while all the time farmer browns boy thought he was hiding them so cleverly that the only way they would be found would be by some one stepping into one and getting caught  there said farmer browns boy as he set the last trap id like to see anything get into this henhouse now without getting caught  unc billy almost chuckled aloud yes sir he almost chuckled aloud it was such a funny idea that farmer browns boy should have taken all the trouble to set those traps to catch unc billy trying to get into the henhouse when all the time he was already in there  unc billy laughed under his breath as farmer browns boy closed the door of the henhouse and went off whistling ho ho ho ha ha ha hee hee unc billy broke off short right in the very middle of his laugh he had just thought of something and it wasnt funny at all with all those traps set at every opening to the henhouse no one could get in without getting caught and of course no one who was in could get out without getting caught  the joke wasnt on farmer browns boy after all it was on unc billy possum but unc billy couldnt see that it was any joke at all unc billy was a prisoner a prisoner in farmer browns henhouse and he didnt know how ever he was going to get out of there  its a long way home said unc billy mournfully as he peeped out of a crack toward the green forest     xix  what the snow did   unc billy possum did a lot of thinking he was a prisoner just as much a prisoner as if he were in a cage now unc billy possum wouldnt have minded being a prisoner in the henhouse but for two things he was dreadfully afraid that his old friend and partner jimmy skunk would get hungry for eggs and would get caught in the traps and he was still more afraid that farmer browns boy would think to put his hand down under the hay in the last nest of the top row in the darkest corner so unc billy spent most of his time studying and thinking of some way to get out and if he couldnt do that of some way to warn jimmy skunk to keep away from farmer browns henhouse  if it hadnt been for those two worries unc billy would have been willing to stay there the rest of the winter it was delightfully warm and cosy he knew which nest mrs speckles always used and which one mrs feathertoes liked best and he knew that of all the eggs laid in farmer browns henhouse those laid by mrs speckles and mrs feathertoes were the best having all the eggs he could eat unc billy had grown very particular nothing but the best the very best would do for him so he would lie curled up in the last nest of the top row in the darkest corner and wait until he heard the highpitched voice of mrs speckles proudly crying  cut cut cut cut cut cutaacut i lay the finest eggs in the world  then unc billy would chuckle to himself and wait a few minutes longer for the voice of mrs feathertoes saying cut cut cut cut cutaacut cut cut cut no one lays such splendid eggs as i do then while mrs speckles and mrs feathertoes were disputing as to which laid the best eggs unc billy would slip out and breakfast on both those newly laid eggs  so for almost a week unc billy lived in farmer browns henhouse and ate the eggs of mrs speckles and mrs feathertoes and hid in the last nest of the top row in the darkest corner and shivered as he heard farmer browns boy tell what would happen if he caught the one who was stealing those eggs sometimes the door was left open during the day and unc billy would peep out and wish that he dared to run but he didnt for bowser the hound was always prowling around and then again he was almost sure to be seen by some one  at last one day it began to snow it snowed all day and it snowed all night rough brother north wind piled it up in great drifts in front of the henhouse door and all along one side of the henhouse it covered the traps so deep that they couldnt possibly catch any one as soon as the snow stopped falling unc billy began to dig his way up to the top from the very hole by which he had entered the henhouse he didnt like it for he doesnt like snow but now was his chance to get away and he meant to make the most of it     xx  unc billy possum wishes he had snowshoes   unc billy possum didnt know whether he liked the snow more than he hated it or hated it more than he liked it just now usually he dislikes the snow very much and doesnt go out in it any more than he has to but this time the snow had done unc billy a good turn a very good turn indeed once out of the henhouse unc billy lost no time in starting for the green forest but it was slow hard work you see the snow was newly fallen and very soft of course unc billy sank into it almost up to his middle at every step he huffed and he puffed and he grunted and groaned you see unc billy had slept so much through the winter that he was not at all used to hard work of any kind and he wasnt half way to the green forest before he was so tired it seemed to him that he could hardly move and so out of breath that he could only gasp it was then that he was sure that he hated the snow more than he liked it even if it had set him free from the henhouse of farmer brown  now it never does to let ones wits go to sleep some folks call it forgetting but forgetting is nothing but sleepy wits and sleepy wits get more people into trouble than anything else in the world unc billy possums wits were asleep when he left farmer browns henhouse if they hadnt been he would have remembered this little saying      the wits that live within my head       must never never go to sleep     for if they should i might forget       and trouble on me swiftly leap  but unc billys wits certainly were asleep he was so tickled over the idea that he could get out of the henhouse that he couldnt think of anything else and so he forgot yes sir unc billy forgot what did he forget why he forgot that that nice soft snow which so kindly buried the dreadful traps so that they could do no harm couldnt be waded through without leaving tracks unc billy forgot all about that until he was half way to the green forest and then as he sat down to rest and get his breath he remembered  illustration there all the way from farmer browns henhouse was a broad trail in the smooth white snow  unc billy looked behind him and he turned pale yes sir unc billy possum turned pale there all the way from farmer browns henhouse was a broad trail in the smooth white snow where he had plowed his way through if farmer browns boy should come out to look at his traps he would see that track at once and all he would have to do would be to follow it until it led him to unc billy  oh dear oh dear whatever did ah leave the henhouse for wailed unc billy  his wits were all wide awake now it wouldnt do to go back farmer browns boy would see that he had gone back and then he would hunt that henhouse through until he found unc billy no there was nothing to do but to go on and trust that farmer browns boy was so snowed in and would be kept so busy shovelling out paths that he would forget all about looking at his traps unc billy drew a long breath and began to wade ahead toward the green forest  if ah only had snowshoes he panted if ah only had snowshoes like mrs grouse     xxi  farmer browns boy chops down a tree      there was an old possum lived up in a tree           hi ho see the chips fly     the sliest old thief that you ever did see           hi ho see the chips fly     he ate and he ate in the dark of the night     and when the day came not an egg was in sight     but now that i know where hes making his bed     ill do without eggs and will eat him instead           hi ho see the chips fly  farmer browns boy sang as he swung his keen axe and the chips did fly they flew out on the white snow in all directions and the louder farmer browns boy sang the faster the chips flew farmer browns boy had come to the green forest bright and early that morning and he had made up his mind that he would take home a fat possum for dinner he didnt have the least doubt about it and that is why he sang as he made the chips fly he had tracked that possum right up to that tree and there were no tracks going away from it right up near the top he could see a hollow just such a hollow as a possum likes all he had to do was to cut the tree down and split it open and mr possum would be his  so farmer browns boy swung his axe chop chop chop and the chips flew out on the white snow and farmer browns boy sang never once thinking of how the possum he was after might feel of course it was unc billy possum whose tracks he had followed he had seen them outside of the henhouse just as unc billy had been afraid that he would he couldnt very well have helped it those tracks were so very plain to be seen  that had been a long hard anxious journey for unc billy from farmer browns henhouse to the green forest the snow was so deep that he could hardly wade through it when he reached that hollow tree he was so tired that it was all he could do to climb it of course it wasnt his own hollow tree where old mrs possum and the eight little possums lived he knew better than to go there leaving a plain track for farmer browns boy to follow so he had been very thankful to climb up this hollow tree and just as he had feared there was farmer browns boy  chop chop chop the snow was covered with chips now chop chop chop the tree began to shiver and then to shake craack with a great crash over it went  bowser the hound barked excitedly and with farmer browns boy rushed to the hollow near the top to catch mr possum if he should run out but he didnt run out farmer browns boy rapped on the tree with the handle of his axe but no one ran out  i guess hes playing dead said farmer browns boy and began to split open the tree so as to get into the hollow and as he chopped he began to sing again pretty soon he had split the tree wide open in the bottom of the hollow was an old nest of chatterer the red squirrel and that was all farmer browns boy rubbed his eyes and stared and stared and stared there were unc billys tracks leading straight up to that tree and none leading away did that possum have wings     xxii  where unc billy possum was   where was unc billy possum that is what farmer browns boy wanted to know that is what bowser the hound wanted to know where was unc billy possum he was in another hollow tree all the time and laughing till his sides ached as he peeped out and saw how hard farmer browns boy worked  ah done fool him that time said unc billy as he watched farmer browns boy wading off home through the snow with bowser the hound at his heels  you certainly did unc billy how did you do it asked a voice right over unc billys head  unc billy looked up in surprise there was tommy tit the chickadee unc billy grinned  ah just naturally expected ah was gwine to have visitors and so ah prepared a little surprise yes sah ah done prepare a little surprise yo see mah tracks in the snow was powerful plain yes sah they sholy was when ah had climbed up that tree and looked down and saw all those tracks what ah done made ah began to get powerful anxious yes sah ah done get so anxious ah just couldnt get any rest in mah mind ah knew farmer browns boy was gwine to find those tracks and when he did he was gwine to follow em right smart quick sho enough just before sundown here he comes he followed mah tracks right up to the foot of the tree whar ah was hiding in the hollow and ah heard him say  so this is whar yo live is it mistah possum ah reckon bowser and ahll make yo a call tomorrow  when i heard him say that ah felt right bad yes sah ah sholy did feel right smart bad ah studied and ah studied how ah was gwine to fool farmer browns boy and bowser the hound if ah climbed down and went somewhere else ah would have to leave tracks and that boy done bound to find me just the same ah done wish ah had wings like yo and brer buzzard  so po ol unc billy sat studying and studying and getting mo and mo troubled in his mind by and by ah noticed that a branch from that holler tree rubbed against a branch of another tree and a branch of that tree rubbed against a branch of another tree and if ah made a right smart jump from that ah could get into this tree which had a holler just made fo me ah didnt waste no mo time studying no sah ah just moved right away and here ah am  and you didnt leave any tracks and you didnt have any wings said tommy tit the chickadee  no said unc billy but ah done find that yo can most always find a way out if yo look hard enough just now ah am looking right smart hard fo a way to get home but ah reckon mah eyesight am failing ah don see any yet  dee dee dee laughed tommy tit merrily be patient unc billy and perhaps you will     xxiii  happy jack squirrel makes an unexpected call   happy jack squirrel likes the snow he always has liked the snow it makes him feel frisky he likes to run and jump in it and dig little holes in it after nuts which he hid under the leaves before the snow fell when his feet get cold all he has to do is to scamper up a tree and warm them in his own fur coat so the big snowstorm which made so much trouble for unc billy possum just suited happy jack squirrel and he had a whole lot of fun making his funny little tracks all through that part of the green forest in which he lives  happy jack didnt know anything about unc billy possums troubles he supposed that unc billy was safe at home in his own big hollow tree fast asleep as he had been most of the winter happy jack couldnt understand how anybody could want to sleep such fine weather but that was their own business and happy jack had learned a long time ago not to worry about other peoples business  after frisking about he would stop to rest then he would sit up very straight and fold his hands across his breast where they would get nice and warm in the fur of his coat his beautiful great gray tail would be arched up over his back his bright eyes would snap and twinkle and then he would shout just for joy and every time he shouted he jerked his big tail farmer browns boy called it barking but it was happy jacks way of shouting     i love to romp i love to play     im happy happy all the day     i love the snow so soft and white     i love the sun that shines so bright     i love the whole world for you see     the world is very good to me  by and by happy jack came to the hollow tree that farmer browns boy had cut down because he thought that unc billy possum was inside of it  hello exclaimed happy jack thats one of the old storehouses of my cousin chatterer the red squirrel ive got an old storehouse near here and i guess ill see if i have left any nuts in it  he scampered over to another hollow tree standing near he scampered up the tree as only happy jack can and whisked in at the open doorway of the hollow now happy jack had been in that hollow tree so often that he didnt once think of looking to see where he was going and he landed plump on something that was soft and warm happy jack was so surprised that he didnt know what to do for a second and then all in a flash that something soft and warm was full of sharp claws and sharper teeth and an angry growling tilled the hollow tree  happy jack was so frightened that he scrambled out as fast as he could when he was safely outside he grew very angry to think that any one should be in his storehouse even if it was an old one he could hear a very angry voice inside and in a minute who should appear at the doorway but unc billy possum  unc billy had been waked out of a sound sleep and that was enough to make any one cross besides he had been badly frightened and that made him crosser still  what do yo mean by trying to frighten honest people snapped unc billy when he caught sight of happy jack  what do you mean by stealing into other folks houses demanded happy jack just as angrily     xxiv  happy jack squirrel helps unc billy possum   it is very startling very startling indeed to rush into your own storehouse which you had supposed was empty and run right into some one sleeping there as if he owned it it is enough to make any one lose his temper happy jack squirrel lost his  and it is very startling very startling indeed to be wakened out of pleasant dreams of warm summer days by having some one suddenly jump on you it is enough to make any one lose his temper unc billy possum lost his  so happy jack sat outside on a branch of the hollow tree where his old storehouse was and scolded and called unc billy possum names and jerked his tail angrily with every word he said and unc billy possum sat in the doorway of the hollow tree and showed his teeth to happy jack and said unpleasant things it really was very dreadful the way those two did talk  but unc billy possum is really very goodnatured and when he had gotten over the fright happy jack had given him and began to understand that he was in one of happy jacks storehouses all his temper vanished and presently he began to grin and then to laugh now it always takes two to make a quarrel and one of the hardest things in the world is to keep cross when the one you are cross with wont keep cross too happy jack tried hard to stay angry but every time he looked at unc billy possums twinkling eyes and broad grin happy jack lost a little of his own temper pretty soon he was laughing just as hard as unc billy possum  ho ho ho ha ha ha they laughed together finally they had to stop for breath  what are you doing in my storehouse unc billy asked happy jack when he could stop laughing  then unc billy told him all about how he had climbed there from another tree so as to leave no tracks in the snow for farmer browns boy to follow  but now ah want to go to mah own home in the big hollow tree way down in the green forest but ah cant on account of mah tracks in the snow concluded unc billy mournfully  happy jack put his head on one side and thought very hard why dont you stay right here until the snow goes unc billy he asked  because ah spects that mah ol woman am worried most to death said unc billy in a mournful voice besides he added ah just done found out that this right nice lil house belongs to one of mah neighbors there was a twinkle in unc billys eyes  happy jack laughed youre welcome to stay as long as you like unc billy he said you better stay right where you are and ill go tell old mrs possum where you are  thank yo thank yo that is very kind of yo brer squirrel that will be a great help fo it will lift a great load off mah mind said unc billy  dont mention it unc billy replied happy jack and started off with the message to old mrs possum and as he scampered through the snow he said     to get yourself in trouble is a very easy thing     i notice that to others it will always worries bring     but getting out of troubles always quite the other way     the more you try to wriggle out the longer you must stay     xxv  happy jack squirrels bright idea   happy jack squirrel frisked along through the snow on his way to unc billy possums house in the big hollow tree in the green forest to tell old mrs possum that unc billy was safe in another hollow tree on the edge of the green forest but that he didnt dare to come home because he would leave tracks in the snow he found old mrs possum very much worried and very much out of sorts you see unc billy had been gone a long time for him and she didnt know what had become of him  now of course old mrs possum was very much relieved when she heard that unc billy was safe for she had been afraid that something dreadful had happened to him but just as soon as she knew that he was safe she forgot all about how worried she had been all she thought of was how unc billy had gone to get some fresh eggs to put in his own stomach and left her to take care of herself and eight baby possums  yo tell unc billy possum that ah don care if he never comes back ah done got other things to bother about moren a worthless nocount possum what don take care of his famly she said crossly and hurried into the house to see that the eight little possums were properly tucked in bed for it was a cold day and the eight little possums had to stay in bed to keep warm  happy jack chuckled as he started back to tell unc billy possum he knew perfectly well that old mrs possum didnt mean what she said he knew that unc billy would know that she didnt mean it but he knew and he knew that unc billy knew that when he did get home he would get a great scolding then all of a sudden happy jack thought of a way for unc billy to get home without waiting until the snow melted away that might be a very long time for there was a great deal of snow on the ground  what do you suppose gave happy jack his idea why a tiny little snowflake that hit happy jack right on the end of his nose yes sir it was that tiny little snowflake that gave happy jack squirrel his bright idea  he hurried back to the hollow tree where unc billy was hiding and scrambled up to the doorway  hello unc billy you can go home tonight he shouted  unc billy possum stuck his head out of the doorway whats that yo say brer squirrel he said ah don see as the snow has gone away and your tracks are powerful plain to see and ah makes bigger tracks than yo brer squirrel  just look up in the sky unc billy said happy jack  unc billy looked the sky was full of dancing snowflakes they got in his eyes and clung to his whiskers unc billy shook his head in disgust  ah don see anything but mo snow and yo know ah don like snow he said what yo driving at brer squirrel  happy jack laughed why its just as simple as can be unc billy he cried just as soon as its dark you start for home its going to snow all night and in the morning there wont be any tracks the snowflakes will have covered them all up  unc billy grinned ah believe yo are right brer squirrel ah believe yo are right said unc billy  and happy jack was right for unc billy got safely home that very night and the next morning when farmer browns boy visited the green forest there wasnt a footprint to be seen anywhere  so unc billy possum learned how easy it is to get into trouble and how hard to get out of it but he isnt the only one who has found this out just ask unc billys particular friend mistah mocker the mocking bird he will tell you the very same thing he and unc billy have been in
