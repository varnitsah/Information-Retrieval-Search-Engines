sons absence in india we thank the earl of lytton cordially for his kindness in sending them to us very soon after his return we also offer our sincere thanks to sir austen h layard and to the senders of many other letters which we now publish for the first time  with a view to making our selection as complete as possible we have collected together the letters from charles dickens which have already been published in various biographies and have chosen and placed in chronological order among our new letters those which we consider to be of the greatest interest  as our narrative was

depreciatory of the opera but like all inveterate critiques against braham so well done that i cannot help laughing at it for the life and soul of me i have seen the sunday times the dispatch and the satirist all of which blow their critic trumpets against unhappy me most lustily either i must have grievously awakened the ire of all the adapters and their friends or the drama must be decidedly bad i havent made up my mind yet which of the two is the fact  i have not seen the john bull or any of the sunday papers except the spectator if you have any of them bring em with you on tuesday i am afraid that for dirty cummins allusion to hogarth i shall be reduced to the necessity of being valorous the next time i meet him                                      believe me most faithfully yours   sidenote the same                   furnivals inn monday afternoon 7 oclock 1836  my dear hullah  mr hogarth has just been here with news which i think you will be glad to hear he was with braham yesterday who was far more full of the opera1 than he was speaking highly of my works and fame  and expressing an earnest desire to be the first to introduce me to the public as a dramatic writer he said that he intended opening at michaelmas and added unasked that it was his intention to produce the opera within one month of his first night he wants a low comedy part introducedwithout singingthinking it will take with the audience but he is desirous of explaining to me what he means and who he intends to play it i am to see him on sunday morning full particulars of the interview shall be duly announced  perhaps i shall see you meanwhile i have only time to add that i am                                                  most faithfully yours   sidenote the same                                     petersham monday evening 1836  dear hullah  since i called on you this morning i have not had time to look over the words of the child and the old man it occurs to me as i shall see you on wednesday morning that the best plan will be for you to bring the music if you possibly can without the words and we can put them in then of course this observation applies only to that particular song  braham having sent to me about the farce i called on him this morning harley wrote when he had read the whole of the opera saying its a sure cardnothing wrong there bet you ten pound it runs fifty nights come dont be afraid youll be the gainer by it and you mustnt mind betting its a capital custom they tell the story with infinite relish i saw the fair manageress2 who is fully of harleys opinion so is braham the only difference is that they are far more enthusiastic than harleyfar more enthusiastic than ourselves even that is a bold word isnt it it is a true one nevertheless  depend upon it sir said braham to hogarth yesterday when he went there to say i should be in town today depend upon it sir that there has been no such music since the days of sheil and no such piece since the duenna everybody is delighted with it he added to me today i played it to stansbury who is by no means an excitable person and he was charmed this was said with great emphasis but i have forgotten the grand point it was not i played it to stansbury but i sang itall through  i begged him as the choruses are to be put into rehearsal directly the company get together to let us have through mrs braham the necessary passports to the stage which will be forwarded he leaves town on the 8th of september he will be absent a month and the first rehearsal will take place immediately on his return previous to it i mean the first rehearsalnot the return i am to read the piece his only remaining suggestion is that miss rainforth will want another song when the piece is in rehearsala bravurasomething in the soldier tired way we must have a confab about this on wednesday morning  harley called in furnivals inn to express his high delight and gratification but unfortunately we had left town i shall be at headquarters by 12 wednesday noon                                   believe me dear hullah                                                 most faithfully yours  pstell me on

hogarth          313 furnivals inn tuesday evening january 20th 1837  my dear sir  as you have begged me to write an original sketch for the first number of the new evening paper and as i trust to your kindness to refer my application to the proper quarter should i be unreasonably or improperly trespassing upon you i beg to ask whether it is probable that if i commenced a series of articles written under some attractive title for the evening chronicle its conductors would think i had any claim to some additional remuneration of course of no great amount for doing so  let me beg of you not to misunderstand my meaning whatever the reply may be i promised you an article and shall supply it with the utmost readiness and with an anxious desire to do my best which i honestly assure you would be the feeling with which i should always receive any request coming personally from yourself i merely wish to put it to the proprietors first whether a continuation of light papers in the style of my street sketches would be considered of use to the new paper and secondly if so whether they do not think it fair and reasonable that taking my share of the ordinary reporting business of the chronicle besides i should receive something for the papers beyond my ordinary salary as a reporter  begging you to excuse my troubling you and taking this opportunity of acknowledging the numerous kindnesses i have already received at your hands since i have had the pleasure of acting under you                                i am my dear sir very sincerely yours   sidenote mrs hogarth                   doughty street thursday night october 26th 1837  my dear mrs hogarth  i need not thank you for your present4 of yesterday for you know the sorrowful pleasure i shall take in wearing it and the care with which i shall prize it untilso far as relates to this lifei am like her  i have never had her ring off my finger by day or night except for an instant at a time to wash my hands since she died i have never had her sweetness and excellence absent from my mind so long i can solemnly say that waking or sleeping i have never lost the recollection of our hard trial and sorrow and i feel that i never shall  it will be a great relief to my heart when i find you sufficiently calm upon this sad subject to claim the promise i made you when she lay dead in this house never to shrink from speaking of her as if her memory must be avoided but rather to take a melancholy pleasure in recalling the times when we were all so happyso happy that increase of fame and prosperity has only widened the gap in my affections by causing me to think how she would have shared and enhanced all our joys and how proud i should have been as god knows i always was to possess the affections of the gentlest and purest creature that ever shed a light on earth i wish you could know how i weary now for the three rooms in furnivals inn and how i miss that pleasant smile and those sweet words which bestowed upon our evenings work in our merry banterings round the fire were more precious to me than the applause of a whole world would be i can recall everything she said and did in those happy days and could show you every passage and line we read together  i see now how you are capable of making great efforts even against the afflictions you have to deplore and i hope that soon our words may be where our thoughts are and that we may call up those old memories not as shadows of the bitter past but as lights upon a happier future                      believe me my dear mrs hogarth                                   ever truly and affectionately yours  footnotes  1 the village coquettes  2 mrs braham  3 printed in forty years recollections of life literature and public affairs by charles

1st 1838  a sad new years day in one respect for at the opening of last year poor mary was with us very many things to be grateful for since then however increased reputation and meansgood health and prospects we never know the full value of blessings till we lose them we were not ignorant of this one when we had it i hope but if she were with us now the same winning happy amiable companion sympathising with all my thoughts and feelings more than anyone i knew ever did or will i think i should have nothing to wish for but a continuance of such happiness but she is gone and pray god i may one day through his mercy rejoin her i wrote to mrs hogarth yesterday taking advantage of the opportunity afforded me by her sending as a new years token a penwiper of poor marys imploring her as strongly as i could to think of the many remaining claims upon her affection and exertions and not to give way to unavailing grief her answer came tonight and she seems hurt at my doing soprotesting that in all useful respects she is the same as ever meant it for the best and still hope i did right                                           saturday january 6th 1838  our boys birthdayone year old

didnt like to ask the price i took her out to brompton at night as we had no place for her to sleep in the two mothers being with us she came back again next day to keep house for me and stopped

seemed disposed to think i work too much made forster and pickthorn my doctor the referencesand after an interesting interview with the board and the boards doctor came away to work again

           sunday january 14th 1838  to church in the morning and when i came home i wrote the preceding portion of this diary which henceforth i make a steadfast resolution not to neglect or paint i have not done it yet nor will i but say what rises to my lipsmy mental lips at leastwithout reserve no other eyes will see it while mine are open in life and although i daresay i shall be ashamed of a good deal in it i should like to look over it at the years end  in scotts diary which i have been looking at this morning there are thoughts which have been mine by day and by night in good spirits and bad since mary died  another day and a bright one to the external world again opens on us the air soft and the flowers smiling and the leaves glittering they cannot refresh her to whom mild weather was a natural enjoyment cerements of lead and of wood already hold her cold earth must have her soon but it is not    she who will be laid among the ruins    she is sentient and conscious of my emotions somewherewhere we cannot tell how we cannot tell yet would i not at this moment renounce the mysterious yet certain hope that i shall see her in a better world for all that this world can give me                                       i have seen her there is the same symmetry of form though those limbs are rigid which were once so gracefully elastic but that yellow masque with pinched features which seems to mock life rather than emulate it can it be the face that was once so full of lively expression i will not look upon it again  i know but too well how true all this is                                            monday january 15th 1838  here ends this brief attempt at a diary i grow sad over this checking off of days and cant do it                                        sidenote mr w l sammins                       48 doughty street london january 31st 1839  sir  circumstances have enabled me to relinquish my old connection with the miscellany7 at an earlier period than i had expected i am no longer its editor but i have referred your paper to my successor and marked it as one requiring attention i have no doubt it will receive it  with reference to your letter bearing date on the 8th of last october let me assure you that i have delayed answering itnot because a constant stream of similar epistles has rendered me callous to the anxieties of a beginner in those doubtful paths in which i walk myselfbut because you ask me to do that which i would scarce do of my own unsupported opinion for my own child supposing i had one old enough to require such a service to suppose that i could gravely take upon myself the responsibility of withdrawing you from pursuits you have already undertaken or urging you on in a most uncertain and hazardous course of life is really a compliment to my judgment and inflexibility which i cannot recognize and do not deserve or desire i hoped that a little reflection would show you how impossible it is that i could be expected to enter upon a task of so much delicacy but as you have written to me since and called unfortunately at a period when i am obliged to seclude myself from all comers i am compelled at last to tell you that i can do nothing of the kind  if it be any satisfaction to you to know that i have read what you sent me and read it with great pleasure though as you treat of local matters i am necessarily in the dark here and there i can give you the assurance very sincerely with this and many thanks to you for your obliging expressions towards myself                                    i am

firstfloor and say boldly that you come to sign mr charles dickenss bondwhich is already signed by mr sergeant talfourd i suppose i should formally acquaint you that i have paid the fees and that the responsibility you incur is a very slight oneextending very little beyond my good behaviour and honourable intentions to pay for all wineglasses tumblers or other dinnerfurniture that i may break or damage  i wish you would do me another service and that is to choose at the place you told me of a reasonable copy of the beauties of england and wales you can choose it quite as well as i can or

           thursday april 8th 1841  dear sir  i am much obliged to you for your interesting letter nor am i the less pleased to receive it by reason that i cannot find it in my conscience to agree in many important respects with the body to which you belong  in the love of virtue and hatred of vice in the detestation of cruelty and encouragement of gentleness and mercy all men who endeavour to be acceptable to their creator in any way may freely agree there are more roads to heaven i am inclined to think than any sect believes but there can be none which have not these flowers garnishing the way  i feel it a great tribute therefore to receive your letter it is most welcome and acceptable to me i thank you for it heartily and am proud of the approval of one who suffered in his youth even more than my poor child  while you teach in your walk of life the lessons of tenderness you have learnt in sorrow trust me that in mine i will pursue cruelty and oppression the enemies of all gods

read crabbed manuscripts with the palms of their hands and newspapers with their ankles and so forth and who are so to speak literary all over i begin to understand what a bluestocking means and have

know how earnestly i write this you would be glad to read itas i hope you will be faintly guessing at the warmth of the hand i autobiographically hold out to you over the broad atlantic  i wish i could find in your welcome letter some hint of an intention to visit england i cant i have held it at arms length and taken a birdseye view of it after reading it a great many times but there is no greater encouragement in it this way than on a microscopic inspection i should love to go with youas i have gone god knows how ofteninto little britain and eastcheap and green arbour court and westminster abbey i should like to travel with you outside the last of the coaches down to bracebridge hall it would make my heart glad to compare notes with you about that shabby gentleman in the oilcloth hat and red nose who sat in the ninecornered backparlour of the masons arms and about robert preston and the tallowchandlers widow whose sittingroom is second nature to me and about all those delightful places and people that i used to walk about and dream of in the daytime when a very small and not overparticularlytakencareof boy i have a good deal to say too about that dashing alonzo de ojeda that you cant help being fonder of than you ought to be and much to hear concerning moorish legend and poor unhappy boabdil diedrich knickerbocker i have worn to death in my pocket and yet i should show you his mutilated carcass with a joy past all expression  i have been so accustomed to associate you with my pleasantest and happiest thoughts and with my leisure hours that i rush at once into full confidence with you and fall as it were naturally and by the very laws of gravity into your open arms questions come thronging to my pen as to the lips of people who meet after long hoping to do so i dont know what to say first or what to leave unsaid and am constantly disposed to break off and tell you again how glad i am this moment has arrived  my dear washington irving i cannot thank you enough for your cordial and generous praise or tell you what deep and lasting gratification it has given me i hope to have many letters from you and to exchange a frequent correspondence i send this to say so after the first two or three i shall settle down into a connected style and become gradually rational  you know what the feeling is after having written a letter sealed it and sent it off i shall picture your reading this and answering it before it has lain one night in the postoffice ten to one that before the fastest packet could reach new york i shall be writing again  do you

missed you terribly in new york you carried away with you more than half the delight and pleasure of my new world and i heartily wish you could bring it back again  there are very interesting men in this placehighly interesting of coursebut its not a comfortable place is it if spittle could wait at table we should be nobly attended but as that property has not been imparted to it in the present state of mechanical science we are rather lonely and orphanlike in respect of being looked arter a blithe black was introduced on our arrival as our peculiar and especial attendant he is the only gentleman in the town who has a peculiar delicacy in intruding upon my valuable time it usually takes seven rings and a threatening message from  to produce him and when he comes he goes to fetch something and forgetting it by the way comes back no more  we have been in great distress really in distress at the nonarrival of the caledonia you may conceive what our joy was when while we were dining out yesterday h arrived with the joyful intelligence of her safety the very news of her having really arrived seemed to diminish the distance between ourselves and home by one half at least  and this morning though we have not yet received our heap of despatches for which we are looking eagerly forward to this nights mailthis morning there reached us unexpectedly through the government bag heaven knows how they came there two of our many and longlookedfor letters wherein was a circumstantial account of the whole conduct and behaviour of our pets with marvellous narrations of charleys precocity at a twelfth night juvenile party at macreadys and tremendous predictions of the governess dimly suggesting his having got out of pothooks and hangers and darkly insinuating the possibility of his writing us a letter before long and many other workings of the same prophetic spirit in reference to him and his sisters very gladdening to their mothers heart and not at all depressing to their fathers there was also the doctors report which was a clean bill and the nurses report which was perfectly electrifying showing as it did how master walter had been weaned and had cut a double tooth and done many other extraordinary things quite worthy of his high descent in short we were made very happy and grateful and felt as if the prodigal father and mother had got home again  what do you think of this incendiary card being left at my door last night general g sends compliments to mr dickens and called with two literary ladies as the two l ls are ambitious of the honour of a personal introduction to mr d general g requests the honour of an appointment for tomorrow i draw a veil over my sufferings they are sacred we shall be in buffalo please heaven on the 30th of april if i dont find a letter from you in the care of the postmaster at that place ill never write to you from england  but if i do find one my right hand shall forget its cunning before i forget to be your truthful and constant correspondent not dear felton because i promised it nor because i have a natural tendency to correspond which is far from being the case nor because i am truly grateful to you for and have been made truly proud by that affectionate and elegant tribute which  sent me but because you are a man after my own heart and i love you well and for the love i bear you and the pleasure with which i shall always think of you and the glow i shall feel when i see your handwriting in my own home i hereby enter into a solemn league and covenant to write as many letters to you as you write to me at least amen  come to england come to england our oysters are small i know they are said by americans to be coppery but our hearts are of the largest size we are thought to excel in shrimps to be far from despicable in point of lobsters and in periwinkles are considered to challenge the universe our oysters small though they be are not devoid of the refreshing influence which that species of fish is supposed to exercise in these latitudes try them and compare                                                   affectionately yours   sidenote mr washington irving

say goodbye again and felt more than i can tell you when we shook hands last wednesday  you will not be at baltimore i fear i thought at the time that you only said you might be there to make our parting the gayer  wherever you go god bless you what pleasure i have had in seeing and talking with you i will not attempt to say i shall never forget it as long as i live what would i give if we could have but a quiet week together spain is a lazy place and its climate an indolent one but if you have ever leisure under its sunny skies to think of a man who loves you and holds communion with your spirit oftener perhaps than any other person aliveleisure from listlessness i meanand will write to me in london you will give me an inexpressible amount of pleasure

and was well pleased with its contents i anticipated objection to carlyles18 letter i called particular attention to it for three reasons firstly because he boldly said what all the others think and therefore deserved to be manfully supported secondly because it is my deliberate opinion that i have been assailed on this subject in a manner in which no man with any pretensions to public respect or with the remotest right to express an opinion on a subject of universal literary interest would be assailed in any other country     i really cannot sufficiently thank you dear felton for your warm and hearty interest in these proceedings but it would be idle to pursue that theme so let it pass  the wig and whiskers are in a state of the highest preservation the play comes off next wednesday night the 25th what would i give to see you in the front row of the centre box your spectacles gleaming not unlike those of my dear friend pickwick your face radiant with as broad a grin as a staid professor may indulge in and your very coat waistcoat and shoulders expressive of what we should take together when the performance was over i would give something not so much but still a good round sum if you could only stumble into that very dark and dusty theatre in the daytime at any minute between twelve and three and see me with my coat off the stage manager and universal director urging impracticable ladies and impossible gentlemen on to the very confines of insanity shouting and driving about in my own person to an extent which would justify any philanthropic stranger in clapping me into a straitwaistcoat without further inquiry endeavouring to goad h into some dim and faint understanding of a prompters duties and struggling in such a vortex of noise dirt bustle confusion and inextricable entanglement of speech and action as you would grow giddy in contemplating we perform a roland for an oliver a good nights rest and deaf as a post this kind of voluntary hard labour used to be my great delight the furor has come strong upon me again and i begin to be once more of opinion that nature intended me for the lessee of a national theatre and that pen ink and paper have spoiled a manager  oh how i look forward across that rolling water to home and its small tenantry how i busy myself in thinking how my books look and where the tables are and in what positions the chairs stand relatively to the other furniture and whether we shall get there in the night or in the morning or in the afternoon and whether we shall be able to surprise them or whether they will be too sharply looking out for us and what our pets will say and how theyll look and who will be the first to come and shake hands and so forth if i could but tell you how i have set my heart on rushing into forsters study he is my great friend and writes at the bottom of all his letters my love to felton and into maclises paintingroom and into macreadys managerial ditto without a moments warning and how i picture every little trait and circumstance of our arrival to myself down to the very colour of the bow on the cooks cap you would almost think i had changed places with my eldest son and was still in pantaloons of the thinnest texture i left all these thingsgod only knows what a love i have for themas coolly and calmly as any animated cucumber but when i come upon them again i shall have lost all power of selfrestraint and shall as certainly make a fool of myself in the popular meaning of that expression as ever grimaldi did in his way or george the third in his  and not the less so dear felton for having found some warm hearts and left some instalments of earnest and sincere affection behind me on this continent and whenever i turn my mental telescope hitherward trust me that one of the first figures it will descry will wear spectacles so like yours that the maker couldnt tell the difference and shall address a greek class in such an exact imitation of your voice that the very students hearing it should cry thats he three cheers hoorayayayayay  about those joints of yours i think you are mistaken they cant be stiff at the worst they merely want the air of new york which being impregnated with the flavour of last years oysters has a surprising effect in rendering the human frame supple and flexible in all cases of rust  a terrible idea occurred to me as i wrote those words the oystercellarswhat do they do when oysters are not in season is pickled salmon vended there do they sell crabs shrimps winkles herrings the oysteropenerswhat do they do do they commit suicide in despair or wrench open tight drawers and cupboards and hermeticallysealed bottles for practice perhaps they are dentists out of the oyster season who knows

all the monstrous and incalculable amount of occupation that ever beset one unfortunate man mine has been the most stupendous since i came home the dinners i have had to eat the places i have had to go to the letters i have had to answer the sea of business and of pleasure in which i have been plunged not even the genius of an  or the pen of a  could describe  wherefore i indite a monstrously short and wildly uninteresting epistle to the american dando but perhaps you dont know who dando was he was an oystereater my dear felton he used to go into oystershops without a farthing of money and stand at the counter eating natives until the man who opened them grew pale cast down his knife staggered backward struck his white forehead with his open hand and cried you are dando he has been known to eat twenty dozen at one sitting and would have eaten forty if the truth had not flashed upon the shopkeeper for these offences he was constantly committed to the house of correction during his last imprisonment he was taken ill got worse and worse and at last began knocking violent double knocks at deaths door the doctor stood beside his bed with his fingers on his pulse he is going says the doctor i see it in his eye there is only one thing that would keep life in him for another hour and that isoysters they were immediately brought dando swallowed eight and feebly took a ninth he held it in his mouth and looked round the bed strangely not a bad one is it says the doctor the patient shook his head rubbed his trembling hand upon his stomach bolted the oyster and fell backdead they buried him in the prisonyard and paved his grave with oystershells  we are all well and hearty and have already begun to wonder what time next year you and mrs felton and dr howe will come across the briny sea together tomorrow we go to the seaside for two months i am looking out for news of longfellow and shall be delighted when i know that he is on his way to london and this house  i am bent upon striking at the piratical newspapers with the sharpest edge i can put upon my small axe and hope in the next session of parliament to stop their entrance into canada for the first time within the memory of man the professors of english literature seem disposed to act together on this question it is a good thing to aggravate a scoundrel if one can do nothing else and i think we can make them smart a little in this way     i wish you had been at greenwich the other day where a party of friends gave me a private dinner public ones i have refused c was perfectly wild at the reunion and after singing all manner of marine songs wound up the entertainment by coming home six miles in a little open phaeton of mine on his head to the mingled delight and indignation of the metropolitan police we were very jovial indeed and i assure you that i drank your health with fearful vigour and energy  on board that ship coming home i established a club called the united vagabonds to the large amusement of the rest of the passengers this holy brotherhood committed all kinds of absurdities and dined always with a variety of solemn forms at one end of the table below the mast away from all the rest the captain being ill when we were three or four days out i produced my medicinechest and recovered him we had a few more sick men after that and i went round the wards every day in great state accompanied by two vagabonds habited as ben allen and bob sawyer bearing enormous rolls of plaster and huge pairs of scissors we were really very merry all the way breakfasted in one party at liverpool shook hands and parted most cordially                                       affectionately your faithful friend  psi have looked over my journal and have decided to produce my american trip

which i have just finished and swears loudly by it it is true and honourable i know and i shall hope to send it you complete by the first steamer in november  your description of the porter and the

the more snug from being the only undismantled one in the house plates are warming for forster and maclise whose knock i am momentarily expecting that groom i told you of who never comes into the house except when we are all out of town is walking about in his shirtsleeves without the smallest consciousness of impropriety a great mound of proofs are waiting to be read aloud after dinner with what a shout i would clap you down into the easiest chair my genial felton if you could but appear and order you a pair of slippers instantly  since i have written this the aforesaid grooma very small

he adds as he stirs the fire as if he were thinking out loud wot a mystery it is wot a go is natur with which scrap of philosophy he gradually gets nearer to the door and so fades out of the room  this same man asked me one day soon after i came home what sir john wilson was this is a friend of mine who took our house and servants and everything as it stood during our absence in america i told him an officer a wot sir an officer and then for fear he should think i meant a policeofficer i added an officer in the army i beg your pardon sir he said touching his hat but the club as i always drove him to wos the united servants  the real name of this club is the united service but i have no doubt he thought it was a highlifebelowstairs kind of resort and that this gentleman was a retired butler or superannuated footman  theres the knock and the great western sails or steams rather tomorrow write soon again dear felton and ever believe me

and as many happy meetings between them and our children and between you and us as the kind fates in their utmost kindness shall favourably decree  the american book to begin with that has been a most complete and thoroughgoing success four large editions have now been sold and paid for and it has won golden opinions from all sorts of men except our friend in f who is a miserable creature a disappointed man in great poverty to whom i have ever been most kind and considerate i need scarcely say that and another friend in b no less a person than an illustrious gentleman named  who wrote a story called  they have done no harm and have fallen short of their mark which of course was to annoy me now i am perfectly free from any diseased curiosity in such respects and whenever i hear of a

particularly commend my dear felton one mr pecksniff and his daughters to your tender regards i have a kind of liking for them myself  blessed star of morning such a trip as we had into cornwall just after longfellow went away the we means forster maclise stanfield the renowned marine painter and the inimitable boz we went down into devonshire by the railroad and there we hired an open carriage from an innkeeper patriotic in all pickwick matters and went on with posthorses sometimes we travelled all night sometimes all day sometimes both i kept the jointstock purse ordered all the dinners paid all the turnpikes conducted facetious conversations with the postboys and regulated the pace at which we travelled stanfield an old sailor consulted an enormous map on all disputed points of wayfaring and referred moreover to a pocketcompass and other scientific instruments the luggage was in forsters department and maclise having nothing particular to do sang songs heavens if you could have seen the necks of bottlesdistracting in their immense varieties of shapepeering out of the carriage pockets if you could have witnessed the deep devotion of the postboys the wild attachment of the hostlers the maniac glee of the waiters if you could have followed us into the earthy old churches we visited and into the strange caverns on the gloomy seashore and down into the depths of mines and up to the tops of giddy heights where the unspeakably green water was roaring i dont know how many hundred feet below if you could have seen but one gleam of the bright fires by which we sat in the big rooms of ancient inns at night until long after the small hours had come and gone or smelt but one steam of the hot punch not white dear felton like that amazing compound i sent you a taste of but a rich genial glowing brown which came in every evening in a huge broad china bowl i never laughed in my life as i did on this journey it would have done you good to hear me i was choking and gasping and bursting the buckle off the back of my stock all the way and stanfield who is very much of your figure and temperament but fifteen years older got into such apoplectic entanglements that we were often obliged to beat him on the back with portmanteaus before we could recover him seriously i do believe there never was such a trip and they made such sketches those two men in the most romantic of our haltingplaces that you would have sworn we had the spirit of beauty with us as well as the spirit of fun but stop till you come to englandi say no more  the actuary of the national debt couldnt calculate the number of children who are coming here on twelfth night in honour of charleys birthday for which occasion i have provided a magic lantern and divers other tremendous engines of that nature but the best of it is that forster and i have purchased between us the entire stockintrade of a conjurer the practice and display whereof is intrusted to me and o my dear eyes felton if you could see me conjuring the companys watches into impossible teacaddies and causing pieces of money to fly and burning pockethandkerchiefs without hurting em and practising in my own room without anybody to admire you would never forget it as long as you live in those tricks which require a confederate i am assisted by reason of his imperturbable good humour by stanfield who always does his part exactly the wrong way to the unspeakable delight of all beholders we come out on a small scale tonight at forsters where we see the old year out and the new one in particulars shall be forwarded in my next  i have quite made up my mind that f really believes he does know you personally and has all his life he talks to me about you with such gravity that i am afraid to grin and feel it necessary to look quite serious sometimes he tells me things about you doesnt ask me you know so that i am occasionally perplexed beyond all telling and begin to think it was he and not i who went to america its the queerest thing in the world  the book i was to have given longfellow for you is not worth sending by itself being only a barnaby but i will look up some manuscript for you i think i have that of the american notes complete and will try to make the parcel better worth its long conveyance with regard to maclises pictures you certainly are quite right in your impression of them but he is such a discursive devil as he says about himself and flies off at such odd tangents that i feel it difficult to convey to you any general notion of his purpose i will try to do so when i write again i want very much to know about  and that charming girl    give me full particulars will you remember me cordially to sumner and say i thank him for his welcome letter the like to hillard with many regards to himself and his wife with whom i had one night a little conversation which i shall not readily forget the like to washington allston and all friends who care for me and have outlived

sir  let me hasten to say in the fullest and most explicit manner that you have acted a most honourable open fair and manly part in the matter of my complaint20 for which i beg you to accept my best thanks and the assurance of my friendship and regard i would on no account publish the letter you have sent me for that purpose as i conceive that by doing so i should not reciprocate the spirit in which you have written to me privately but if you should upon consideration think it not inexpedient to set the review right in regard to this point of fact by a note in the next number i should be glad to see it there  in reference to the article itself it did by repeating this statement hurt my feelings excessively and is in this respect i still conceive most unworthy of its author i am at a loss to divine who its author is i know he read in some cutthroat american paper this and other monstrous statements which i could at any time have converted into sickening praise by the payment of some fifty dollars i know that he is perfectly aware that his statement in the review in corroboration of these lies would be disseminated through the whole of the united states and that my contradiction will never be heard of and though i care very little for the opinion of any person who will set the statement of an american editor almost invariably an atrocious scoundrel against my character and conduct such as they may be still my sense of justice does revolt from this most cavalier and careless exhibition of me to a whole people as a traveller under false pretences and a disappointed intriguer the better the acquaintance with america the more defenceless and more inexcusable such conduct is for i solemnly declare and appeal to any man but the writer of this paper who has travelled in that country for confirmation of my statement that the source from which he drew the information so recklessly put forth again in england is infinitely more obscene disgusting and brutal than the very worst sunday newspaper that has ever been printed in great britain conceive the edinburgh review quoting the satirist or the man about town as an authority against a man with one grain of honour or featherweight of reputation  with regard to yourself let me say again that i thank you with all sincerity and heartiness and fully acquit you of anything but kind and generous intentions towards me in proof of which i do assure you that i am even more desirous than before to write for the review and to find some topic which would at once please me and you

1843  my dear felton  i dont know where to begin but plunge headlong with a terrible splash into this letter on the chance of turning up somewhere  hurrah up like a cork again with the north american review in my hand like you my dear  and i can say no more in praise of it though i go on to the end of the sheet you cannot think how much notice it has attracted here brougham called the other day with the number thinking i might not have seen it and i being out at the time he left a note speaking of it and of the writer in terms that warmed my heart lord ashburton one of whose people wrote a notice in the edinburgh which they have since publicly contradicted also wrote to me about it in just the same strain and many others have done the like  i am in great health and spirits and powdering away at chuzzlewit with all manner of facetiousness rising up before me as i go on as to news i have really none saving that  who never took any exercise in his life has been laid up with rheumatism for weeks past but is now i hope getting better my little captain as i call himhe who took me out i mean and with whom i had that adventure of the cork soleshas been in london too and seeing all the lions under my escort good heavens i wish you could have seen certain other mahoganyfaced men also captains who used to call here for him in the morning and bear him off to docks and rivers and all sorts of queer places whence he always returned late at night with rumandwater teardrops in his eyes and a complication of punchy smells in his mouth he was better than a comedy to us having marvellous ways of tying his pockethandkerchief round his neck at dinnertime in a kind of jolly embarrassment and then forgetting what he had done with it also of singing songs to wrong tunes and calling land objects by sea names and never knowing what oclock it was but taking midnight for seven in the evening with many other sailor oddities all full of honesty manliness and good temper we took him to drury lane theatre to see much ado about nothing but i never could find out what he meant by turning round after he had watched the first two scenes with great attention and inquiring whether it was a polish piece     on the 4th of april i am going to preside at a public dinner for the benefit of the printers and if you were a guest at that table wouldnt i smite you on the shoulder harder than ever i rapped the wellbeloved back of washington irving at the city hotel in new york  you were asking mei love to say asking as if we could talk togetherabout maclise he is such a discursive fellow and so eccentric in his might that on a mental review of his pictures i can hardly tell you of them as leading to any one strong purpose but the annual exhibition of the royal academy comes off in may and then i will endeavour to give you some notion of him he is a tremendous creature and might do anything but like all tremendous creatures he takes his own way and flies off at unexpected breaches in the conventional wall  you know hs book i daresay ah i saw a scene of mingled comicality and seriousness at his funeral some weeks ago which has choked me at dinnertime ever since c and i went as mourners and as he lived poor fellow five miles out of town i drove c down it was such a day as i hope for the credit of nature is seldom seen in any parts but thesemuddy foggy wet dark cold and unutterably wretched in every possible respect now c has enormous whiskers which straggle all down his throat in such weather and stick out in front of him like a partially unravelled birdsnest so that he looks queer enough at the best but when he is very wet and in a state between jollity he is always very jolly with me and the deepest gravity going to a funeral you know it is utterly impossible to resist him especially as he makes the strangest remarks the mind of man can conceive without any intention of being funny but rather meaning to be philosophical i really cried with an irresistible sense of his comicality all the way but when he was dressed out in a black cloak and a very long black hatband by an undertaker who as he whispered me with tears in his eyesfor he had known h many yearswas a character and he would like to sketch him i thought i should have been obliged to go away however we went into a little parlour where the funeral party was and god knows it was miserable enough for the widow and children were crying bitterly in one corner and the other mournersmere people of ceremony who cared no more for the dead man than the hearse didwere talking quite coolly and carelessly together in another and the contrast was as painful and distressing as anything i ever saw there was an independent clergyman present with his bands on and a bible under his arm who as soon as we were seated addressed  thus in a loud emphatic voice mr c have you seen a paragraph respecting our departed friend which has gone the round of the morning papers yes sir says c i have looking very hard at me the while for he had told me with some pride coming down that it was his composition oh said the clergyman then you will agree with me mr c that it is not only an insult to me who am the servant of the almighty but an insult to the almighty whose servant i am how is that sir said c it is stated mr c in that paragraph says the minister that when mr h failed in business as a bookseller he was persuaded by me to try the pulpit which is false incorrect unchristian in a manner blasphemous and in all respects contemptible let us pray with which my dear felton and in the same breath i give you my word he knelt down as we all did and began a very miserable jumble of an extemporary prayer i was really penetrated with sorrow for the family but when c upon his knees and sobbing for the loss of an old friend whispered me that if that wasnt a clergyman and it wasnt a funeral hed have punched his head i felt as if nothing but convulsions could possibly relieve me                                         faithfully always my dear felton   sidenote mrs hogarth                                    devonshire terrace 8th may 1843  my dear mrs hogarth  i was dressing to go to church yesterday morningthinking very sadly of that time six yearswhen your kind note and its accompanying packet were brought to me the best portrait that was ever painted would be of little value to you and me in comparison with that unfading picture we have within us and of the worst which s really is i can only say that it has no interest in my eyes beyond being something which she sat near in its progress full of life and beauty in that light i set some store by the copy you have sent me and as a mark of your affection i need not say i value it very much as any record of that dear face it is utterly worthless  i trace in many respects a strong resemblance between her mental features and georginasso strange a one at times that when she and kate and i are sitting together i seem to think that what has happened is a melancholy dream from which i am just awakening the perfect like of what she was will never be again but so much of her spirit shines out in this sister that the old time comes back again at some seasons and i can hardly separate it from the present  after she died i dreamed of her every night for many monthsi think for the better part of a yearsometimes as a spirit sometimes as a living creature never with any of the bitterness of my real sorrow but always with a kind of quiet happiness which became so pleasant to me that i never lay down at night without a hope of the vision coming back in one shape or other and so it did i went down into yorkshire and finding it still present to me in a strange scene and a strange bed i could not help mentioning the circumstance in a note i wrote home to kate from that moment i have never dreamed of her once though she is so much in my thoughts at all times especially when i am successful and have prospered in anything that the recollection of her is an essential part of my being and is as inseparable from my existence as the beating of my heart is                                                  always affectionately   sidenote professor felton                               broadstairs kent september 1st 1843  my dear felton  if i thought it in the nature of things that you and i could ever agree on paper touching a certain chuzzlewitian question whereupon f tells me you have remarks to make i should immediately walk into the same tooth and nail but as i dont i wont contenting myself with this prediction that one of these years and days you will write or say to me my dear dickens you were right though rough and did a world of good though you got most thoroughly hated for it to which i shall reply my dear felton i looked a long way off and not immediately under my nose    at which sentiment you will laugh and i shall laugh and then for i foresee this will all happen in my land we shall call for another pot of porter and two or three dozen of oysters  now dont you in your own heart and soul quarrel with me for this long silence not half so much as i quarrel with myself i know but if you could read half the letters i write to you in imagination you would swear by me for the best of correspondents the truth is that when i have done my mornings work down goes my pen and from that minute i feel it a positive impossibility to take it up again until imaginary butchers and bakers wave me to my desk i walk about brimful of letters facetious descriptions touching morsels and pathetic friendships but cant for the soul of me uncork myself the postoffice is my rock ahead my average number of letters that must be written every day is at the least a dozen and you could no more know what i was writing to you spiritually from the perusal of the bodily thirteenth than you could tell from my hat what was going on in my head or could read my heart on the surface of my flannel waistcoat  this is a little fishingplace intensely quiet built on a cliff whereonin the centre of a tiny semicircular bayour house stands the sea rolling and dashing under the windows seven miles out are the goodwin sands youve heard of the goodwin sands whence floating lights perpetually wink after dark as if they were carrying on intrigues with the servants also there is a big lighthouse called the north foreland on a hill behind the village a severe parsonic light which reproves the young and giddy floaters and stares grimly out upon the sea under the cliff are rare good sands where all the children assemble every morning and throw up impossible fortifications which the sea throws down again at high water old gentlemen and ancient ladies flirt after their own manner in two readingrooms and on a great many scattered seats in the open air other old gentlemen look all day through telescopes and never see anything in a baywindow in a onepair sits from nine oclock to one a gentleman with rather long hair and no neckcloth who writes and grins as if he thought he were very funny indeed his name is boz at one he disappears and presently emerges from a bathingmachine and may be seena kind of salmoncoloured porpoisesplashing about in the ocean after that he may be seen in another baywindow on the groundfloor eating a strong lunch after that walking a dozen miles or so or lying on his back in the sand reading a book nobody bothers him unless they know he is disposed to be talked to and i am told he is very comfortable indeed hes as brown as a berry and they do say is a small fortune to the innkeeper who sells beer and cold punch but this is mere rumour sometimes he goes up to london eighty miles or so away and then im told there is a sound in lincolns inn fields at night as of men laughing together with a clinking of knives and forks and wineglasses  i never shall have been so near you since we parted aboard the george washington as next tuesday forster maclise and i and perhaps stanfield are then going aboard the cunard steamer at liverpool to bid macready goodbye and bring his wife away it will be a very hard parting you will see and know him of course we gave him a splendid dinner last saturday at richmond whereat i presided with my accustomed grace he is one of the noblest fellows in the world and i would give a great deal that you and i should sit beside each other to see him play virginius lear or werner which i take to be every way the greatest piece of exquisite perfection that his lofty art is capable of attaining his macbeth especially the last act is a tremendous reality but so indeed is almost everything he does you recollect perhaps that he was the guardian of our children while we were away i love him dearly     you asked me long ago about maclise he is such a wayward fellow in his subjects that it would be next to impossible to write such an article as you were thinking of about him i wish you could form an idea of his genius one of these days a book will come out moores irish melodies entirely illustrated by him on every page when it comes ill send it to you you will have some notion of him then he is in great favour with the queen and paints secret pictures for her to put upon her husbands table on the morning of his birthday and the like but if he has a care he will leave his mark on more enduring things than palace walls  and so l is married i remember her well and could draw her portrait in words to the life a very beautiful and gentle creature and a proper love for a poet my cordial remembrances and congratulations do they live in the house where we breakfasted     i very often dream i am in america again but strange to say i never dream of you i am always endeavouring to get home in disguise and have a dreary sense of the distance À propos of dreams is it not a strange thing if writers of fiction never dream of their own creations recollecting i suppose even in their dreams that they have no real existence i never dreamed of any of my own characters and i feel it so impossible that i would wager scott never did of his real as they are i had a good piece of absurdity in my head a night or two ago i dreamed that somebody was dead i dont know who but its not to the purpose it was a private gentleman and a particular friend and i was greatly overcome when the news was broken to me very delicately by a gentleman in a cocked hat top boots and a sheet nothing else good god i said is he dead he is as dead sir rejoined the gentleman as a doornail but we must all die mr dickens sooner or later my dear sir ah i said yes to be sure very true but what did he die of the gentleman burst into a flood of tears and said in a voice broken by emotion he christened his youngest child sir with a toastingfork i never in my life was so affected as at his having fallen a victim to this complaint it carried a conviction to my mind that he never could have recovered i knew that it was the most interesting and fatal malady in the world and i wrung the gentlemans hand in a convulsion of respectful admiration for i felt that this explanation did equal honour to his head and heart  what do you think of mrs gamp and how do you like the undertaker i have a fancy that they are in your way oh heaven such green woods as i was rambling among down in yorkshire when i was getting that done last july for days and weeks we never saw the sky but through green boughs and all day long i cantered over such soft moss and turf that the horses feet scarcely made a sound upon it we have some friends in that part of the country close to castle howard where lord morpeths father dwells in state in his park indeed who are the jolliest of the jolly keeping a big old country house with an ale cellar something larger than a reasonable church and everything like goldsmiths bear dances in a concatenation accordingly just the place for you felton we performed some madnesses there in the way of forfeits picnics rustic games inspections of ancient monasteries at midnight when the moon was shining that would have gone to your heart and as mr weller says come out on the other side     write soon my dear felton and if i write to you less often than i would believe that my affectionate heart is with you always loves and regards to all friends from yours ever and ever                                                  very faithfully yours   sidenote mr macvey napier                                    broadstairs september 16th 1843  my dear sir  i hinted in a letter of introduction i gave mr hood to you that i had been thinking of a subject for the edinburgh would it meet the purposes of the review to come out strongly against any system of education based exclusively on the principles of the established church if it would i should like to show why such a thing as the church catechism is wholly inapplicable to the state of ignorance that now prevails and why no system but one so general in great religious principles as to include all creeds can meet the wants and understandings of the dangerous classes of society this is the only broad ground i could hold consistently with what i feel and think on such a subject but i could give in taking it a description of certain voluntary places of instruction called the ragged schools now existing in london and of the schools in jails and of the ignorance presented in such places which would make a very striking paper especially if they were put in strong comparison with the effort making by subscription to maintain exclusive church instruction i could show these people in a state so miserable and so neglected that their very nature rebels against the simplest religion and that to convey to them the faintest outlines of any system of distinction between right and wrong is in itself a giants task before which mysteries and squabbles for forms must give way would this be too much for the review                                                       faithfully yours  footnotes  19 this and all other letters addressed to mr macvey napier were printed in selection from the correspondence of the late macvey napier esq editor of the edinburgh review edited by his son macvey napier  20 his complaint was that the reviewer of his american notes in the number for january 1843 had represented him as having gone to america as a missionary in the cause of international copyrightan allegation which charles dickens repudiated and which was rectified in the way he himself suggested     1844   sidenote professor felton                        devonshire terrace london january 2nd 1844  my very dear felton  you are a prophet and had best retire from business straightway yesterday morning new years day when i walked into my little workroom after breakfast and was looking out of window at the snow in the gardennot seeing it particularly well in consequence of some staggering suggestions of last night whereby i was besetthe postman came to the door with a knock for which i denounced him from my heart seeing your hand upon the cover of a letter which he brought i immediately blessed him presented him with a glass of whisky inquired after his family they are all well and opened the despatch with a moist and oystery twinkle in my eye and on the very day from which the new year dates i read your new year congratulations as punctually as if you lived in the next house why dont you  now if instantly on the receipt of this you will send a free and independent citizen down to the cunard wharf at boston you will find that captain hewett of the britannia steamship my ship has a small parcel for professor felton of cambridge and in that parcel you will find a christmas carol in prose being a short story of christmas by charles dickens over which christmas carol charles dickens wept and laughed and wept again and excited himself in a most extraordinary manner in the composition and thinking whereof he walked about the black streets of london fifteen and twenty miles many a night when all the sober folks had gone to bed    its success is most prodigious and by every post all manner of strangers write all manner of letters to him about their homes and hearths and how this same carol is read aloud there and kept on a little shelf by itself indeed it is the greatest success as i am told that this ruffian and rascal has ever achieved  forster is out again and if he dont go in again after the manner in which we have been keeping christmas he must be very strong indeed such dinings such dancings such conjurings such blindmansbuffings such theatregoings such kissingsout of old years and kissingsin of new ones never took place in these parts before to keep the chuzzlewit going and do this little book the carol in the odd times between two parts of it was as you may suppose pretty tight work but when it was done i broke out like a madman and if you could have seen me at a childrens party at macreadys the other night going down a country dance with mrs m you would have thought i was a country gentleman of independent property residing on a tiptop farm with the wind blowing straight in my face every day     your friend mr p dined with us one day i dont know whether i told you this before and pleased us very much mr c has dined here once and spent an evening here i have not seen him lately though he has called twice or thrice for k being unwell and i busy we have not been visible at our accustomed seasons i wonder whether h has fallen in your way poor h he was a good fellow and has the most grateful heart i ever met with our journeyings seem to be a dream now talking of dreams strange thoughts of italy and france and maybe germany are springing up within me as the chuzzlewit clears off its a secret i have hardly breathed to anyone but i think of leaving england for a year next midsummer bag and baggage little ones and allthen coming out with such a story felton all at once no parts sledgehammer blow  i send you a manchester paper as you desire the report is not exactly done but very well done notwithstanding it was a very splendid sight i assure you and an awfullooking audience i am going to preside at a similar meeting at liverpool on the 26th of next month and on my way home i may be obliged to preside at another at birmingham i will send you papers if the reports be at all like the real thing  i wrote to prescott about his book with which i was perfectly charmed i think his descriptions masterly his style brilliant his purpose manly and gallant always the introductory account of aztec civilisation impressed me exactly as it impressed you from beginning to end the whole history is enchanting and full of genius i only wonder that having such an opportunity of illustrating the doctrine of visible judgments he never remarks when cortes and his men tumble the idols down the temple steps and call upon the people to take notice that their gods are powerless to help themselves that possibly if some intelligent native had tumbled down the image of the virgin or patron saint after them nothing very remarkable might have ensued in consequence  of course you like macready your names felton i wish you could see him play lear it is stupendously terrible but i suppose he would be slow to act it with the boston company  hearty remembrances to sumner longfellow prescott and all whom you know i love to remember countless happy years to you and yours my dear felton and some instalment of them however slight in england in the loving company of                                 the proscribed one                                              oh breathe not his name   sidenote sir edward lytton bulwer                     athenÆum thursday afternoon 25th january 1844  my dear sir edward  i received your kind cheque yesterday in behalf of the elton family and am much indebted to you on their behalf  pray do not believe that the least intentional neglect has prevented me from calling on you or that i am not sincerely desirous to avail myself of any opportunity of cultivating your friendship i venture to say this to you in an unaffected and earnest spirit and i hope it will not be displeasing to you  at the time when you called and for many weeks afterwards i was so closely occupied with my little carol the idea of which had just occurred to me that i never left home before the owls went out and led quite a solitary life when i began to have a little time and to go abroad again i knew that you were in affliction and i then thought it better to wait even before i left a card at your door until the pressure of your distress had past  i fancy a reproachful spirit in your note possibly because i knew that i may appear to deserve it but do let me say to you that it would give me real pain to retain the idea that there was any coldness between us and that it would give me heartfelt satisfaction to know the reverse  i shall make a personal descent upon you before sunday in the hope of telling you this myself but i cannot rest easy without writing it also and if this should lead to a better knowledge in each of us of the other believe me that i shall always look upon it as something i have long wished for

intrusion at the town hallbrought me backand left me to my quiet supper now on the table as they had left me to my quiet dinner  i wish you had come it was really a splendid sight the town hall was crammed to the roof by i suppose two thousand persons the ladies were in full dress and immense numbers and when dick showed himself the whole assembly stood up rustling like the leaves of a wood dick with the heart of a lion dashed in bravely he introduced that about the genie in the casket with marvellous effect and was applauded to the echo which did applaud again he was horribly nervous when he arrived at birmingham22 but when he stood upon the platform i dont believe his pulse increased ten degrees a better and quicker audience never listened to man  the ladies had hung the hall do you know what an immense place it is with artificial flowers all round and on the front of the great gallery immediately fronting this young gentleman were the words in artificial flowers youll observe welcome boz in letters about six feet high behind his head and about the great organ were immense transparencies representing several fames crowning a corresponding number of dicks at which victoria taking out a poetic licence was highly delighted                                       i am going to bed the landlady is not literary and calls me mr digzon in other respects it is a good house

benefit of your kind advice i do not doubt that you can tell me whether this same nice be a healthy place the year through whether it be reasonably cheap pleasant to look at and to live in and the

mortar which is exposed to view on the removal of a stove or are acquainted with the suffocating properties of a kind of accidental snuff which flies out of the same cavernous region in great abundance it is very distressing i have been walking about the house after the manner of the dove before the waters subsided for some days and have no pens or ink or paper hence this gap in our

acknowledging the receipt of your kind present of your poems24 but i do know that i have often thought of writing to you and have very often reproached myself for not carrying that thought into execution  i have not been neglectful of the poems themselves i assure you but have read them with very great pleasure they struck me at the first glance as being remarkably nervous picturesque imaginative and original i have frequently recurred to them since and never with the slightest abatement of that impression i am much flattered and gratified by your recollection of me i beg you to believe in my unaffected sympathy with and appreciation of your powers and i entreat you to accept my best wishes and genuine though tardy thanks                                             dear sir

obliged to postpone our little dinnerparty on saturday by reason of having no house to dine in we have not been burnt out but a desirable widow as a tenant i mean proposed only last saturday to take our own house for the whole term of our intended absence abroad on condition that she had possession of it today we fled and were driven into this place which has no convenience for the production of any other banquet than a cold collation of plate and linen the only comforts we have not left behind us  my consolation lies in knowing what sort of dinner you would have had if you had come here and in looking forward to claiming the fulfilment of your kind promise when we are again at home                       always believe me my dear sir faithfully yours   sidenote countess of blessington                                milan wednesday november 20th 1844  my dear lady blessington  appearances are against me dont believe them i have written you in intention fifty letters and i can claim no credit for anyone of them though they were the best letters you ever read for they all originated in my desire to live in your memory and regard since i heard from count dorsay i have been beset in i dont know how many ways first of all i went to marseilles and came back to genoa then i moved to the peschiere then some people who had been present at the scientific congress here made a sudden inroad on that establishment and overran it then they went away and i shut myself up for a month close and tight over my little christmas book the chimes all my affections and passions got twined and knotted up in it and i became as haggard as a murderer long before i wrote the end when i had done that like the man of thessaly who having scratched his eyes out in a quickset hedge plunged into a bramblebush to scratch them in again i fled to venice to recover the composure i had disturbed from thence i went to verona and to mantua and now i am herejust come up from underground and earthy all over from seeing that extraordinary tomb in which the dead saint lies in an alabaster case with sparkling jewels all about him to mock his dusty eyes not to mention the twentyfranc pieces which devout votaries were ringing down upon a sort of skylight in the cathedral pavement above as if it were the counter of his heavenly shop you know verona you know everything in italy i know the roman amphitheatre there delighted me beyond expression i never saw anything so full of solemn ancient interest there are the fourandforty rows of seats as fresh and perfect as if their occupants had vacated them but yesterdaythe entrances passages dens rooms corridors the numbers over some of the arches an equestrian troop had been there some days before and had scooped out a little ring at one end of the arena and had their performances in that spot i should like to have seen it of all things for its very dreariness fancy a handful of people sprinkled over one corner of the great place the whole population of verona wouldnt fill it now and a spangled cavalier bowing to the echoes and the grassgrown walls i climbed to the topmost seat and looked away at the beautiful view for some minutes when i turned round and looked down into the theatre again it had exactly the appearance of an immense straw hat to which the helmet in the castle of otranto was a baby the rows of seats representing the different plaits of straw and the arena the inside of the crown i had great expectations of venice but they fell immeasurably short of the wonderful reality the short time i passed there went by me in a dream i hardly think it possible to exaggerate its beauties its sources of interest its uncommon novelty and freshness a thousand and one realisations of the thousand and one nights could scarcely captivate and enchant me more than venice  your old house at albaroil paradisois spoken of as yours to this day what a gallant place it is i dont know the present inmate but i hear that he bought and furnished it not long since with great splendour in the french style and that he wishes to sell it i wish i were rich and could buy it there is a thirdrate wine shop below byrons house and the place looks dull and miserable and ruinous enough old  is a trifle uglier than when i first arrived he has periodical parties at which there are a great many flowerpots and a few icesno other refreshments he goes about constantly charged with extemporaneous poetry and is always ready like tavern dinners on the shortest notice and the most reasonable terms he keeps a gigantic harp in his bedroom together with pen ink and paper for fixing his ideas as they flow a kind of profane king david but truly goodnatured and very harmless  pray say to count dorsay everything that is cordial and loving from me the travelling purse he gave me has been of immense service it has been constantly opened all italy seems to yearn to put its hand in it i think of hanging it when i come back to england on a nail as a trophy and of gashing the brim like the blade of an old sword and saying to my son and heir as they do upon the stage you see this notch boy five hundred francs were laid low on that day for posthorses where this gap is a waiter charged your father treble the correct amountand got it this end worn into teeth like the rasped edge of an old file is sacred to the custom houses boy the passports and the shabby soldiers at towngates who put an open hand and a dirty coatcuff into the coach windows of all forestieri take it boy thy father has nothing else to give

bear the thought of going away without some sort of reference to the happy day you gave me on monday and the pleasure and delight i had in your earnest greeting i shall never forget it believe me it

immense number of different restingplaces for it since i went away i write you my last italian letter for this bout designing to leave here please god on the ninth of next month and to be in london again by the end of june i am looking forward with great delight to the pleasure of seeing you once more and mean to come to gore house with such a swoop as shall astonish the poodle if after being accustomed to his own size and sense he retain the power of being astonished at anything in the wide world you know where i have been and every mile of ground i have travelled over and every object i have seen it is next to impossible surely to exaggerate the interest of rome though i think it is very possible to find the main source of interest in the wrong things naples disappointed me greatly the weather was bad during a great part of my stay there but if i had not had mud i should have had dust and though i had had sun i must still have had the lazzaroni and they are so ragged so dirty so abject so full of degradation so sunken and steeped in the hopelessness of better things that they would make heaven uncomfortable if they could ever get there i didnt expect to see a handsome city but i expected something better than that long dull line of squalid houses which stretches from the chiaja to the quarter of the porta capuana and while i was quite prepared for a miserable populace i had some dim belief that there were bright rays among them and dancing legs and shining sunbrowned faces whereas the honest truth is that connected with naples itself i have not one solitary recollection the country round it charmed me i need not say who can forget herculaneum and pompeii  as to vesuvius it burns away in my thoughts beside the roaring waters of niagara and not a splash of the water extinguishes a spark of the fire but there they go on tumbling and flaming night and day each in its fullest glory  i have seen so many wonders and each of them has such a voice of its own that i sit all day long listening to the roar they make as if it were in a seashell and have fallen into an idleness so complete that i cant rouse myself sufficiently to go to pisa on the twentyfifth when the triennial illumination of the cathedral and leaning tower and bridges and what not takes place but i have already been there and it cannot beat st peters i suppose so i dont think i shall pluck myself up by the roots and go aboard a steamer for leghorn let me thank you heartily for the keepsake and the book of beauty they reached me a week or two ago i have been very much struck by two papers in themone landors conversations among the most charming profound and delicate productions i have ever read the other your lines on byrons room at venice i am as sure that you wrote them from your heart as i am that they found their way immediately to mine  it delights me to receive such accounts of maclises fresco if he will only give his magnificent genius fair play there is not enough cant and dulness even in the criticism of art from which sterne prayed kind heaven to defend him as the worst of all the cants continually canted in this canting worldto keep the giant down an hour

to bear reference to business i will make it as short and plain as i can i think i could write a pretty good and a welltimed article on the punishment of death and sympathy with great criminals instancing the gross and depraved curiosity that exists in reference to them by some of the outrageous things that were written done and said in recent cases but as i am not sure that my views would be yours and as their statement would be quite inseparable from such a paper i will briefly set down their purport that you may decide for yourself  society having arrived at that state in which it spares bodily torture to the worst criminals and having agreed if criminals be put to death at all to kill them in the speediest way i consider the question with reference to society and not at all with reference to the criminal holding that in a case of cruel and deliberate murder he is already mercifully and sparingly treated but as a question for the deliberate consideration of all reflective persons i put this view of the case with such very repulsive and odious details before us may it not be well to inquire whether the punishment of death be beneficial to society i believe it to have a horrible fascination for many of those persons who render themselves liable to it impelling them onward to the acquisition of a frightful notoriety and setting aside the strong confirmation of this idea afforded in individual instances i presume this to be the case in very badly regulated minds when i observe the strange fascination which everything connected with this punishment or the object of it possesses for tens of thousands of decent virtuous wellconducted people who are quite unable to resist the published portraits letters anecdotes smilings snufftakings of the bloodiest and most unnatural scoundrel with the gallows before him i observe that this strange interest does not prevail to anything like the same degree where death is not the penalty therefore i connect it with the dread and mystery surrounding death in any shape but especially in this avenging form and am disposed to come to the conclusion that it produces crime in the criminally disposed and engenders a diseased sympathymorbid and bad but natural and often irresistibleamong the wellconducted and gentle regarding it as doing harm to both these classes it may even then be right to inquire whether it has any salutary influence on those small knots and specks of people mere bubbles in the living ocean who actually behold its infliction with their proper eyes on this head it is scarcely possible to entertain a doubt for we know that robbery and obscenity and callous indifference are of no commoner occurrence anywhere than at the foot of the scaffold furthermore we know that all exhibitions of agony and death have a tendency to brutalise and harden the feelings of men and have always been the most rife among the fiercest people again it is a great question whether ignorant and dissolute persons ever the great body of spectators as few others will attend seeing that murder done and not having seen the other will not almost of necessity sympathise with the man who dies before them especially as he is shown a martyr to their fancy tied and bound alone among scores with every kind of odds against him  i should take all these threads up at the end by a vivid little sketch of the origin and progress of such a crime as hookers stating a somewhat parallel case but an imaginary one pursuing its hero to his death and showing what enormous harm he does after the crime for which he suffers i should state none of these positions in a positive sledgehammer way but tempt and lure the reader into the discussion of them in his own mind and so we come to this at lastwhether it be for the benefit of society to elevate even this crime to the awful dignity and notoriety of death and whether it would not be much more to its advantage to substitute a mean and shameful punishment degrading the deed and the committer of the deed and leaving the general compassion to expend itself upon the only theme at present quite forgotten in the history that is to say the murdered person  i do not give you this as an outline of the paper which i think i could make attractive it is merely an exposition of the inferences to which its whole philosophy must tend

bitterly regret the being obliged to disappoint and inconvenience you as i fear i shall do but i find it will be impossible for me to write the paper on capital punishment for your next number the

in due course on the friday evening we had a pleasant and prosperous journey having rather cold weather in switzerland and on the borders thereof and a slight detention of three hours and a half at the frontier custom house atop of a mountain in a hard frost and a dense fog we came into this house last thursday it has a pretty drawingroom approached through four most extraordinary chambers it is the most ridiculous and preposterous house in the world i should think it belongs to a marquis castellane but was fitted so paul pry poole said who dined here yesterday by  in a fit of temporary insanity i have no doubt the diningroom is mere midsummer madness and is designed to represent a bosky grove  at this present writing snow is falling in the street and the weather is very cold but not so cold as it was yesterday i dined with lord normanby on sunday last everything seems to be queer and uncomfortable in the diplomatic way and he is rather bothered and worried to my thinking i found young sheridan mrs nortons brother the attaché i know him very well and he is a good man for my sightseeing purposes there are to be no theatricals unless the times should so adjust themselves as to admit of their being french to which the markis seems to incline as a bit of conciliation and a popular move  lumley of italian opera notoriety also dined here yesterday and seems hugely afeard of the opposition opera at covent garden who have already spirited away grisi and mario which he affects to consider a great comfort and relief i gave him some uncompromising information on the subject of his pit and told him that if he didnt conciliate the middle classes he might depend on being damaged very decidedly the danger of the covent garden enterprise seems to me to be that they are going in for ballet too and i really dont think the house is large enough to repay the double expense  forster writes me that mac has come out with tremendous vigour in the christmas book and took off his coat at it with a burst of such alarming energy that he has done four subjects stanfield has done three keeleys are making that change30 i was so hot upon at lausanne and seem ready to spend money with

perseverance and determination it has been in existence some years but it is only two years since they began to dine at their first festival i presided at their second macready they very naturally

versailles now in the prisons now at the opera now at the hospitals now at the conservatoire and now at the morgue with a dreadful insatiability i begin to doubt whether i had anything to do with a book called dombey or ever sat over number five not finished a fortnight yet day after day until i half began like the monk in poor wilkies story to think it the only reality in life and to mistake all the realities for shortlived shadows  among the multitude of sights we saw our pleasant little bud of a friend rose chéri play clarissa harlowe the other night i believe she does it in london just now and perhaps you may have seen it a most charming intelligent modest affecting piece of acting it is with a death superior to anything i ever saw on the stage except macreadys lear the theatres are admirable just now we saw gentil bernard at the variétés last night acted in a manner that was absolutely perfect it was a little picture of watteau animated and talking from beginning to end at the cirque there is a new showpiece called the french revolution in which there is a representation of the national convention and a series of battles fought by some five hundred people who look like five thousand that are wonderful in their extraordinary vigour and truth guncotton gives its name to the general annual jocose review at the palais royal which is dull enough saving for the introduction of alexandre dumas sitting in his study beside a pile of quarto volumes about five feet high which he says is the first tableau of the first act of the first piece to be played on the first night of his new theatre the revival of molières don juan at the français has drawn money it is excellently played and it is curious to observe how different their don juan and valet are from our english ideas of the master and man they are playing lucretia borgia again at the porte st martin but it is poorly performed and hangs fire drearily though a very remarkable and striking play we were at victor hugos house last sunday week a most extraordinary place looking like an old curiosity shop or the propertyroom of some gloomy vast old theatre i was much struck by hugo himself who looks like a genius as he is every inch of him and is very interesting and satisfactory from head to foot his wife is a handsome woman with flashing black eyes there is also a charming ditto daughter of fifteen or sixteen with ditto eyes sitting among old armour and old tapestry and old coffers and grim old chairs and tables and old canopies of state from old palaces and old golden lions going to play at skittles with

me the opportunity if you should see no objection to telling the young lady herself this much pray do so as it is sincere praise  your criticism of coombes pamphlet is as justly felt as it is earnestly and strongly written i undergo more astonishment and disgust in connection with that question of education almost every day of my life than is awakened in me by any other member of the whole magazine of social monsters that are walking about in these times  you were in my thoughts when your letter arrived this morning for we have a halfformed idea of reviving our old amateur theatrical company for a special purpose and even of bringing it bodily to manchester and liverpool on which your opinion would be very valuable if we should decide on monday when we meet to pursue our idea in this warm weather i will explain it to you in detail and ask counsel of you in regard of a performance at liverpool meantime it is mentioned to no one  your interest in dombey gives me unaffected pleasure i hope you will find no reason to think worse of it as it proceeds there is a great deal to doone or two things among the rest that society will not be the worse i hope for thinking about a

reference to a scheme to which you may perhaps already have seen some allusion in the london athenæum of today  the party of amateurs connected with literature and art who acted in london two years ago have resolved to play again at one of the large theatres here for the benefit of leigh hunt and to make a great appeal to all classes of society in behalf of a writer who should have received long ago but has not yet some enduring return from his country for all he has undergone and all the good he has done it is believed that such a demonstration by literature on behalf of literature and such a mark of sympathy by authors and artists for one who has written so well would be of more service present and prospective to hunt than almost any other means of help that could be devised and we know from himself that it would be most gratifying to his own feelings  the arrangements are as yet in an imperfect state for the date of their being carried out depends on our being able to get one of the large theatres before the close of the present london season in the event of our succeeding we purpose acting in london on wednesday the 14th of july and on monday the 19th on the first occasion we shall play every man in his humour and a farce on the second the merry wives of windsor and a farce  but we do not intend to stop here believing that leigh hunt has done more to instruct the young men of england and to lend a helping hand to those who educate themselves than any writer in england we are resolved to come down in a body to liverpool and manchester and to act one night at each place and the object of my letter is to ask you as the representative of the great educational establishment of liverpool whether we can count on your active assistance whether you will form a committee to advance our object and whether if we send you our circulars and addresses you will endeavour to secure us a full theatre and to enlist the general sympathy and interest in behalf of the cause we have at heart  i address by this post a letter which is almost the counterpart of the present to the honorary secretaries of the manchester athenæum if we find in both towns such a response as we confidently expect i would propose on behalf of my friends that the liverpool and manchester institutions should decide for us at which town we shall first appear and which play we shall act in each place  i forbear entering into any more details however until i am favoured with your reply                            always believe me my dear sir

by dr hodgson of liverpool i take the liberty of addressing you in this form  i hear from that friend of ours that you are greatly interested in all that relates to mr leigh hunt and that you will be happy to promote our design in reference to him allow me to assure you of the gratification with which i have received this intelligence and of the importance we shall all attach to your valuable cooperation  i have received a letter from mr langley of the athenæum informing me that a committee is in course of formation composed of directors of that institution acting as private gentlemen and others may i hope to find that you are one of this body and that i may soon hear of its proceedings and be in communication with it  allow me to thank you beforehand for your interest in the cause and to look forward to the pleasure of doing so in person when i come to manchester                                        dear sir very faithfully yours   sidenote the same                     athenÆum

act in manchester and liverpool i have set forth the plain state of the case in a letter to mr robinson by this post a counterpart of which i have addressed to liverpool and to which in the midst of a most laborious correspondence on the subject i beg to refer you  it will be a great satisfaction to us to believe that we shall still be successful in manchester there is great and urgent need why we should be so i assure you  if you can help to bring the matter speedily into a practical and plain shape you will render hunt the greatest service  i fear in respect to your kind invitation that neither jerrold nor i will feel at liberty to accept it there was a pathetic proposal among us that we should keep together and as president of the society i am bound i fear to stand by the brotherhood with particular constancy nor do i think that we shall have more than one very short evening in manchester  i write in great haste the sooner i can know at broadstairs in kent the

in a certain genuine simple air i had looked for in the first part but there is great promise in it and i shall be earnest to know how it proceeds  now to leave these pleasant matters and resume my managerial character which i shall be heartily glad between ourselves to lay down again though i have none but pleasant correspondents and the most easily governable company of actors on earth  i have written to mr robinson by this post that i wish these words from our original london circular to stand at top of the bills after for the benefit of mr leigh hunt  it is proposed to devote a portion of the proceeds of this benefit to the assistance of another celebrated writer whose literary career is at an end and who has no provision for the decline of his life  i have also told him that there is no objection to its being known that this is mr poole the author of paul pry and little pedlington and many comic pieces of great merit and whose farce of turning the tables we mean to finish with in manchester beyond what he will get from these benefits he has no resource in this wide world i know there are reasons which make it desirable to get this fact abroad and if you see no objection to paragraphing it at your office sending the paragraph round if you should please to the other manchester papers i should be much obliged to you  you may like to know as a means of engendering a more complete individual interest in our actors who they are jerrold and myself you have heard of mr george cruikshank and mr leech the best caricaturists of any time perhaps need no introduction mr frank

their aim but i will carefully consider blackwoods letter when i get it and will call upon you and tell you what occurs to me in reference to it before i communicate with that northern light  i have been going to write to you for many a day past to thank you for your kindness to the general theatrical fund people and for your note to me but i have waited until i should hear of your being stationary somewhere what you said of the battle of life gave me great pleasure i was thoroughly wretched at having to use the idea for so short a story i did not see its full capacity until it was too late to think of another subject and i have always felt that i might have done a great deal better if i had taken it for the groundwork of a more extended book but for an insuperable aversion i have to trying back in such a case i should certainly forge that bit of metal again as you suggestone of these days perhaps  i have not been special constable myself todaythinking there was rather an epidemic in that wise abroad i walked over and looked at the preparations without any baggage of staff warrant or affidavit                                                  very faithfully yours

evening that you had really considered the subject and desired to play but i am very glad to understand it now and i am sure there will be a universal sense among us of the grace and appropriateness of such a proceeding falstaff who depends very much on mrs quickly may have in his modesty some timidity about acting with an amateur actress but i have no question as you have studied the part and long wished to play it that you will put him completely at his ease on the first night of your rehearsal will you towards that end receive this as a solemn call to rehearsal of the merry wives at miss kellys theatre tomorrow saturday week at seven in the evening  and will you let me suggest another point for your consideration on the night when the merry wives will not be played and when every man in his humour will be kennys farce of love law and physic will be acted in that farce there is a very good character one mrs hilary which i have seen mrs orger i think act to admiration that would have been played by mrs c jones if she had acted dame quickly as we at first intended if you find yourself quite comfortable and at ease among us in mrs quickly would you like to take this other part too it is an excellent farce and is safe i hope to be very well done  we do not play to purchase the house37 which may be positively considered as paid for but towards endowing a perpetual curatorship of it for some eminent literary veteran and i think you will recognise in this even a higher and more gracious object than the securing even of the debt incurred for the house itself

company of amateurs have lately been playing with a great reputation in london here the object is the endowment of a perpetual curatorship of shakespeares house to be always held by some one distinguished in literature and more especially in dramatic literature and we have already a pledge from the shakespeare house committee that sheridan knowles shall be recommended to the government as the first curator this pledge which is in the form of a minute we intend to advertise in our country bills  now on monday the 5th of june we are going to play at liverpool where we are assured of a warm reception and where an active committee for the issuing of tickets is already formed do you think the manchester people would be equally glad to see us again and that the house could be filled as before at our old prices if yes would you and our other friends go at once to work in the cause the only night on which we could play in manchester would be saturday the 3rd of june it is possible that the depression of the times may render a performance in manchester unwise in that case i would immediately abandon the idea but what i want to know by return of post is is it safe or unsafe if the former here is the bill as it stood in london with the addition on the back of a paragraph i would insert in manchester of which immediate use can be made if the latter my reason for wishing to settle the point immediately is that we may make another use of that saturday night  assured of your generous feeling i make no apology for troubling you a sum of money got together by these means will insure to literature i will take good care of that a proper expression of itself in the bestowal of an essentially literary appointment not only now but henceforth much is to be done time presses

 sidenote mr joseph c king43                     devonshire terrace saturday december 1st 1849  my dear sir  i hasten to let you know what took place at eton today i found that i did stand in some sort committed to mr evans though not so much so but that i could with perfect ease have declined to place charley in his house if i had desired to do so i must say however that after seeing mr cookesley a most excellent man in his way and seeing mr evans and mr evanss house i think i should under any circumstances have given the latter the preference as to the domestic part of charleys life i would certainly prefer to try it i therefore thought it best to propose to have mr cookesley for his tutor and to place him as a boarder with mr evans both gentlemen seemed satisfied with this arrangement and dr hawtrey expressed his approval of it also  mr cookesley wishing to know what charley could do asked me if i would object to leaving him there for halfanhour or so as charley appeared not at all afraid of this proposal i left him then and there on my return mr cookesley said in high and unqualified terms that he had been thoroughly well grounded and well taughtthat he had examined him in virgil and herodotus and that he not only knew what he was about perfectly well but showed an intelligence in reference to those authors which did his tutor great credit he really appeared most interested and pleased and filled me with a grateful feeling towards you to whom charley owes so much  he said there were certain verses in imitation of horace i really forget what sort of verses to which charley was unaccustomed and which were a little matter enough in themselves but were made a great point of at eton and could be got up well in a month from an old etonian for this purpose he would desire charley to be sent every day to a certain mr hardisty in store street bedford square to whom he had already in my absence prepared a note between ourselves i must not hesitate to tell you plainly that this appeared to me to be a conventional way of bestowing a little patronage but of course i had nothing for it but to say it should be done upon which mr cookesley added that he was then certain that charley on coming after the christmas holidays would be placed at once in the remove which seemed to surprise mr evans when i afterwards told him of it as a high station  i will take him to this gentleman on monday and arrange for his going there every day but if you will not object i should still like him to remain with you and to have the advantage of preparing these annoying verses under your eye until the holidays that mr cookesley may have his own way thoroughly i will send charley to mr hardisty daily until the school at eton recommences  let me impress upon you in the strongest manner not only that i was inexpressibly delighted myself by the readiness with which charley went through this ordeal with a stranger but that i also saw you would have been well pleased and much gratified if you could have seen mr cookesley afterwards he had evidently not expected such a result and took it as not at all an ordinary one                              my dear sir

offended by my saying that in common with many other men i think our london correspondent one of the greatest nuisances of this kind inasmuch as our london correspondent seldom knowing anything feels bound to know everything and becomes in consequence a very reckless gentleman in respect of the truthfulness of his intelligence  in your paper sent to me this morning i see the correspondent mentions one  and records how i was wont to feast in the house of the said  as i never was in the mans house in my life or within five miles of it that i know of i beg you will do me the favour to contradict this  you will be the less surprised by my begging you to set this right when i tell you that hearing of his book and knowing his history i wrote to new york denouncing him as a forger and a thief that he thereupon put the gentleman who published my letter into prison and that having but one day before the sailing of the last steamer to collect the proofs printed in the accompanying sheet which are but a small part of the villains life i got them together in short time and sent them out to justify the character i gave him it is not agreeable to me to be supposed to have sat at this amiable

and immeasurably better than a great many i have seen on it i have acted with her in a country house in northamptonshire and am going to do so again next november if you know her i think she would be more than pleased to play and by giving her something good in a farce we could get her to do mrs kitely in that case my little sisterinlaw would go on for the second lady and you could do without actresses besides giving the thing a particular grace and interest  if we could get mary boyle we would do used up which is a delightful piece as the farce but maybe you know nothing about the said

bulwer  i am so sorry to have missed you i had gone down to forster comedy in hand  i think it most admirable44 full of character strong in interest rich in capital situations and certain to go nobly you know how highly i thought of money but i sincerely think these three acts finer i did not think of the slight suggestions you make but i said en passant that perhaps the drunken scene might do better on the stage a little concentrated i dont believe it would require even that with the leadingup which you propose i cannot say too much of the comedy to express what i think and feel concerning it and i look at it too remember with the yellow eye of an actor i should have taken to it need i say so con amore in any case but i should have been jealous of your reputation exactly as i appreciate your generosity if i had a misgiving of ten lines i should have scrupulously mentioned it  stone will take the duke capitally and i will answer for his being got into doing it very well looking down the perspective of a few winter evenings here i am confident about him forster will be thoroughly sound and real lemon is so surprisingly sensible and trustworthy on the stage that i dont think any actor could touch his part as he will and i hope you will have opportunities of testing the accuracy of this prediction egg ought to do the author to absolute perfection as to jerroldthere he stands in the play i would propose leech well made up for easy he is a good name and i see nothing else for him  this brings me to my own part if we had anyone or could get anyone for wilmot i could do i think something so near your meaning in sir gilbert that i let him go with a pang assumption has charms for mei hardly know for how many wild reasonsso delightful that i feel a loss of oh i cant say what exquisite foolery when i lose a chance of being someone in voice etc not at all like myself buti speak quite freely knowing you will not mistake mei know from experience that we could find nobody to hold the play together in wilmot if i didnt do it i think i could touch the gallant generous careless pretence with the real man at the bottom of it so as to take the audience with him from the first scene i am quite sure i understand your meaning and i am absolutely certain that as jerrold forster and stone came in i could as a mere little bit of mechanics present them better by doing that part and paying as much attention to their points as my own than another amateur actor could therefore i throw up my cap for wilmot and hereby devote myself to him heart and head  i ought to tell you that in a play we once rehearsed and never played but rehearsed several times and very carefully i saw lemon do a piece of reality with a rugged pathos in it which i felt as i stood on the stage with him to be extraordinarily good in the serious part of sir gilbert he will surprise you and he has an intuitive discrimination in such things which will just keep the suspicious part from being too droll at the outsetwhich will just show a glimpse of something in the depths of it  the moment i come back to town within a fortnight please god i will ascertain from forster where you are then i will propose to you that we call our company together agree upon one general plan of action and that you and i immediately begin to see and book our vicepresidents etc further i think we ought to see about the queen i would suggest our playing first about three weeks before the opening of the exhibition in order that it may be the town talk before the country people and foreigners come macready thinks with me that a very large sum of money may be got in london  i propose for cheapness and many other considerations to make a theatre expressly for the purpose which we can put up and take downsay in the hanover square roomsand move into the country as watson wanted something of a theatre made for his forthcoming little go i have made it a sort of model of what i mean and shall be able to test its working powers before i see you many things that for portability were to be avoided in mr hewitts theatre i have replaced with less expensive and weighty contrivances  now my dear bulwer i have come to the small hours and am writing alone here as if i were writing something to do what your comedy will at such a time the temptation is strong upon me to say a great deal more but i will only say thisin mercy to youthat i do devoutly believe that this plan carried will entirely change the status of the literary man in england and make a revolution in his position which no government no power on earth but his own could ever effect i have implicit confidence in the schemeso splendidly begunif we carry it out with a steadfast energy i have a strong conviction that we hold in our hands the

heavens sake dont be persuaded to endanger that  even at the risk of your falling into the pit with despair at beholding anything of the comedy in its present state if you can by any possibility come down to covent garden theatre tonight do i hope you will see in lemon the germ of a very fine presentation of sir geoffrey i think topham too will do easy admirably  we really did wonders last night

malvern 29th march 1851  my dear mrs cowden clarke  ah those were days indeed when we were so fatigued at dinner that we couldnt speak and so revived at supper that we couldnt go to bed when wild in inns the noble savage ran and all the world was a stage gaslighted in a double senseby the young gas and the old one when emmeline montague now compton and the mother of two children came to rehearse in our new comedy45 the other night i nearly fainted the gush of recollection was so overpowering that i couldnt bear it  i use the portfolio46 for managerial papers still thats something  but all this does not thank you for your book47 i have not got it yet being here with mrs dickens who has been very unwell but i shall be in town early in the week and shall bring it down to read quietly on these hills where the wind blows as freshly as if there were no popes and no cardinals whatsoevernothing the matter anywhere i thank you a thousand times beforehand for the pleasure you are going to give me i am full of faith your sister emma she is doing work of some sort on the ps side of the boxes in some dark theatre i know but where i wonder w48 has not proposed to her yet has he i understood he was going to offer his hand and heart and lay his leg49 at her feet                                                  ever faithfully yours   sidenote mr mitton                                 devonshire terrace 19th april 1851  my dear mitton  i have been in trouble or i should have written to you sooner my wife has been and is far from well my poor fathers death caused me much distress i came to london last monday to preside at a public dinnerplayed with little dora my youngest child before i wentand was told when i left the chair that she had died in a moment i am quite happy again but i have undergone a good deal  i am not going back to malvern but have let this house until september and taken the fort at broadstairs                                                       faithfully yours   sidenote sir edward bulwer lytton                         devonshire terrace monday 28th april 1851  my dear bulwer  i see you are so anxious that i shall endeavour to send you this letter by a special messenger i think i can relieve your mind completely  the duke has read the play he asked for it a week ago and had it he has been at brighton since he called here before eleven on saturday morning but i was out on the play business so i went to him at devonshire house yesterday he almost knows the play by heart he is supremely delighted with it and critically understands it in proof of the latter part of this sentence i may mention that he had made two or three memoranda of trivial doubtful points every one of which had attracted our attention in rehearsal as i found when he showed them to me he thoroughly understands and appreciates the comedy of the dukethrew himself back in his chair and laughed as i say of walpole till i thought hed have choked about his first duchess who was a percy he suggested that he shouldnt say you know how to speak to the heart of a noble because it was not likely that he would call himself a noble he thought we might close up the porter and softhead a little more already done and was so charmed and delighted to recall the comedy that he was more pleased than any boy you ever saw when i repeated two or three of the speeches in my part for him he is coming to the rehearsal today we rehearse now at devonshire house three days aweek all day long and since he read the play has conceived a most magnificent and noble improvement in the devonshire house plan by which i daresay we shall get another thousand or fifteen hundred pounds there is not a grain of distrust or doubt in him i am perfectly certain that he would confide to me and does confide to me his whole mind on the subject  more than this the duke comes out the best man in the play i am happy to report to you that stone does the honourable manly side of that pride inexpressibly better than i should have supposed possible in him the scene where he makes that reparation to the slandered woman is certain to be an effect he is not a jest upon the order of dukes but a great tribute to them i have sat looking at the play as you may suppose pretty often and carefully weighing every syllable of it i see in the duke the most estimable character in the piece i am as sure that i represent the audience in this as i am that i hear the words when they are spoken before me the first time that scene with hardman was seriously done it made an effect on the company that quite surprised and delighted me and whenever and wherever it is done but most of all at devonshire house the result will be the same  everyone is greatly improved i wrote an earnest note to forster a few days ago on the subject of his being too loud and violent he has since subdued himself with the most admirable pains and improved the part a thousand per cent all the points are gradually being worked and smoothed out with the utmost neatness all through the play they are all most heartily anxious and earnest and upon the least hitch will do the same thing twenty times over the scenery furniture etc are rapidly advancing towards completion and will be beautiful the dresses are a perfect blaze of colour and there is not a pocketflap or a scrap of lace that has not been made according to eggs drawings to the quarter of an inch every wig has been made from an old print or picture from the dukes snuffbox to wills coffeehouse you will find everything in perfect truth and keeping i have resolved that whenever we come to a weak place in the acting it must somehow or other be made a strong one the places that i used to be most afraid of are among the best points now  will you come to the dress rehearsal on the tuesday evening before the queens night there will be no one present but the duke  i write in the greatest haste for the rehearsal time is close at hand and i have the master carpenter and gasman to see before we begin  miss coutts is one of the most sensible of women and if i had not seen the duke yesterday i would have shown her the play directly but there cant be any room for anxiety on the head that has troubled you so much you may clear it from your mind as completely as gunpowder plot                                         in great haste ever

wrecked on the goodwinon which occasion bythebye the coming in at night of our salvage luggers laden with dead cattle which where hoisted up upon the pier where they lay in heaps was a most picturesque and striking sight the sea since wednesday has been very rough blowing in straight upon the land yesterday the shore was strewn with hundreds of oxen sheep and pigs and with bushels upon bushels of apples in every state and stage of decayburst open rent asunder lying with their stiff hoofs in the air or with their great ribs yawning like the wrecks of shipstumbled and beaten out of shape and yet with a horrible sort of humanity about them hovering among these carcases was every kind of waterside plunderer pulling the horns out getting the hides off chopping the hoofs with poleaxes etc etc attended by no end of donkey carts and spectral horses with scraggy necks galloping wildly up and down as if there were something maddening in the stench i never beheld such a

them last night to the unbounded gratification of broadstairs they came in from the wreck very wet and tired and very much disconcerted by the nature of their prizewhich i suppose after all will have to be recommitted to the sea when the hides and tallow are secured one leanfaced boatman murmured when they were all ruminative over the bodies as they lay on the pier couldnt sassages be made on it but retired in confusion shortly afterwards overwhelmed by the execrations of the bystanders                                                    ever affectionately  pssometimes i think s bill will be

obliging note cordially it is a very curious little volume deeply interesting and written if i may be allowed to say so with as much power of knowledge and plainness of purpose as modesty

four oclock this morning and am so blinded by excitement gas and waving hats and handkerchiefs that i can hardly see to write but i cannot go to bed without telling you what a triumph we have had allowing for the necessarily heavy expenses of all kinds i believe we can hardly fund less than a thousand pounds out of this trip alone and more than that the extraordinary interest taken in the idea of the guild by this grand people of england down in these vast hives and the enthusiastic welcome they give it assure me that we may do what we will if we will only be true and faithful to our design there is a social recognition of it which i cannot give you the least idea of i sincerely believe that we have the ball at our feet and may throw it up to the very heaven of heavens and i dont speak for myself alone but for all our people and not least of all for forster who has been absolutely stunned by the tremendous earnestness of these great places  to tell you especially after your affectionate letter what i would have given to have had you there would be idle but i can most seriously say that all the sights of the earth turned pale in my eyes before the sight of three thousand people with one heart among them and no capacity in them in spite of all their efforts of sufficiently testifying to you how they believe you to be right and feel that they cannot do enough to cheer you on they understood the play far better acted by this time than ever you have seen it as well as you do they allowed nothing to escape them they rose up when it was over with a perfect fury of delight and the manchester people sent a requisition after us to liverpool to say that if we will go back there in may when we act at birmingham as of course we shall they will joyfully undertake to fill the free trade hall again among the tories of liverpool the reception was equally enthusiastic we played two nights running to a hall crowded to the roofmore like the opera at genoa or milan than anything else i can compare it to we dined at the town hall magnificently and it made no difference in the response i said what we were quietly determined to do when the guild was given as the toast of the night and really they were so noble and generous in their encouragement that i should have been more ashamed of myself than i hope i ever shall be if i could have felt conscious of having ever for a moment faltered in the work  i will answer for birminghamfor any great working town to which we chose to go we have won a position for the idea which years upon years of labour could not have given it i believe its worldly fortunes have been advanced in this last week fifty years at least i feebly express to you what forster who couldnt be at liverpool and has not those shouts ringing in his ears has felt from the moment he set foot in manchester believe me we may carry a perfect fiery cross through the north of england and over the border in this cause if need benot only to the enrichment of the cause but to the lasting enlistment of the peoples sympathy  i have been so happy in all this that i could have cried on the shortest notice any time since tuesday and i do believe that our whole body would have gone to the north pole with me if i had shown them good reason for it  i hope i am not so tired but that you may be able to read this i have been at it almost incessantly day and night for a week and i am afraid my handwriting suffers but in all other respects i am only a giant refreshed  we meet next saturday you recollect until then and ever afterwards

26th march 1852  dear sir  i beg to thank you for your interesting pamphlet and to add that i shall be very happy to accept an article from you on the subject54 for household words i should already have suggested to you that i should have great pleasure in receiving contributions from one so well and peculiarly qualified to treat of many interesting subjects but that i felt a delicacy in encroaching on your other occupations will you excuse my remarking that to make an article on this particular subject useful it is essential to address the employed as well as the employers in the case of the sheffield grinders the difficulty was for many years not with the masters but the men painters who use white lead are with the greatest difficulty persuaded to be particular in washing their hands and i daresay that i need not remind you that one could not generally induce domestic servants to attend to the commonest sanitary principles in their work without absolutely forcing them to experience their comfort and convenience                                        dear sir very faithfully yours  footnotes  53 the medical aspects of death and the medical aspects of the human mind

mysterious name must come out the paper really is like the celebrated ambassadorial appointment too bad  a doctor of morals impossible of insertion as it stands a mere puff with all the difficult facts of the question blinked and many statements utterly at variance with what i am known to have written it is exactly because the great bulk of offences in a great number of places are committed by professed thieves that it will not do to have pet prisoning advocated without grave remonstrance and great care that class of prisoner is not to be reformed we must begin at the beginning and prevent

that the treadmills didnt grind the air because the state or the magistracy objected to the competition of prisonlabour with freelabour but because the work could not be got  i never can have any kind of prisondiscipline disquisition in h w that does not start with the first great principle i have laid down and that does not protest against prisons being considered per se whatever chance is given to a man in a prison must be given to a man in a refuge for distress  the article in itself is very good but it must have these points in it otherwise i am not only compromising opinions i am known to

for montigny by the tête noire at 6 tomorrow morning next morning early we mean to try the simplon  after breakfast today we ascended to the mer de glacewonderfully different at this time of the year from when we saw ita great portion of the ascent being covered with snow and the climbing very difficult regardless of my mule i walked up and walked down again to the great admiration of the guides who pronounced me an intrepid the little house at the top being closed for the winter and edward having forgotten to carry any brandy we had nothing to drink at the topwhich was a considerable disappointment to the inimitable who was streaming with perspiration from head to foot but we made a fire in the snow with some sticks and after a not too comfortable rest came down again it took a long timefrom 10 to 3  the appearance of chamounix at this time of year is very remarkable the travellers are over for the season the inns are generally shut up all the people who can afford it are moving off to geneva the snow is low on the mountains and the general desolation and grandeur extraordinarily fine i wanted to pass by the col de balme but the snow lies too deep upon it  you would have been quite delighted if you could have seen the warmth of our old lausanne friends and the heartiness with which they crowded down on a fearfully bad morning to see us off we passed the night at the ecu de genève in the rooms once our old roomsat that time the day before yesterday occupied by the queen of the french ex i mean and prince joinville and his family  tell sydney that all the way here from geneva and up to the sea of ice this morning i wore his knitting which was very comfortable indeed i mean to wear it on the long mule journey to martigny tomorrow  we get on extremely well edward continues as before he had never been here and i took him up to the mer de glace this morning and had a mule for him  i shall leave this open as usual to add a word or two on our arrival at martigny we have had an amusingly absurd incident this afternoon when we came here i saw added to the hotelour old hotel and i am now writing in the room where we once dined at the table dhôtesome baths cold and hot down on the margin of the torrent below this induced us to order three hot baths thereupon the keys of the bathrooms were found with immense difficulty women ran backwards and forwards across the bridge men bore in great quantities of wood a horrible furnace was lighted and a smoke was raised which filled the whole valley this began at halfpast three and we congratulated each other on the distinction we should probably acquire by being the cause of the conflagration of the whole village we sat by the fire until halfpast five dinnertime and still no baths then edward came up to say that the water was as yet only tippit which we suppose to be tepid but that by halfpast eight it would be in a noble state ever since the smoke has poured forth in enormous volume and the furnace has blazed and the women have gone and come over the bridge and piles of wood have been carried in but we observe a general avoidance of us by the establishment which still looks like failure we have had a capital dinner the dessert whereof is now on the table when we arrived at nearly seven last night all the linen in the house newly washed was piled in the sittingroom all the curtains were taken down and all the chairs piled bottom upwards they cleared away as much as they could directly and had even got the curtains up at breakfast this morning  i am looking forward to letters at genoa though i doubt if we shall get there supposing all things right at the simplon before monday night or tuesday morning i found there last night what f would call mr smiths story of mont blanc and took it to bed to read it is extremely well and unaffectedly done you would be interested in it                              martigny friday afternoon october 21st  safely arrived here after a most delightful day without a cloud i walked the whole way the scenery most beautifully presented we are in the hotel where our old st bernard party assembled  i should like to see you all

road from chamounix here takes so much more time than i supposed for i travelled it day and night and my companions dont at all understand the idea of never going to bed that we only reached milan last night though we had been travelling twelve and fifteen hours a day we crossed the simplon on sunday when there was not as there is not now a particle of cloud in the whole sky and when the pass was as nobly grand and beautiful as it possibly can be there was a good deal of snow upon the top but not across the road which had been cleared we crossed the austrian frontier yesterday and both there and at the gate of milan received all possible consideration and politeness  i have not seen bairr yet he has removed from the old hotel to a larger one at a few hours distance the headwaiter remembered me very well last night after i had talked to him a little while and was greatly interested in hearing about all the family and about poor roche the boy we used to have at lausanne is now seventeenandahalfvery tall he says the elder girl fifteen very like her mother but taller and more beautiful he described poor mrs bairrs death i am speaking of the headwaiter before mentioned in most vivacious italian it was all over in ten minutes he said she put her hands to her head one day down in the courtyard and cried out that she heard little bells ringing violently in her ears they sent off for bairr who was close by when she saw him she stretched out her arms said in english adieu my dear and fell dead he has not married again and he never will she was a good woman my friend went on excellent woman full of charity loved the poor but un poco furiosathat was nothing  the new hotel is just like the old one admirably kept excellently furnished and a model of comfort i hope to be at genoa on thursday morning and to find your letter there we have agreed to drop sicily and to return home by way of marseilles our projected time for reaching london is the 10th of december  as this house is full i daresay we shall meet some one we know at the table dhôte today it is extraordinary that the only travellers we have encountered since we left paris have been one horribly vapid englishman and wife whom we dropped at basle one boring englishman whom we found and thank god left at geneva and two english maiden ladies whom we found sitting on a rock with parasols the day before yesterday in the most magnificent part of the gorge of gondo the most awful portion of the simplonthere awaiting their travelling chariot in which with their money their parasols and a perfect shop of baskets they were carefully locked up by an english servant in sky blue and silver buttons we have been in the most extraordinary vehicleslike swings like boats like noahs arks like barges and enormous bedsteads after dark last night a landlord where we changed horses discovered that the luggage would certainly be stolen from questo porco duno carrothis pig of a carthis complimentary description of our carriage unless cords were attached to each of the trunks which cords were to hang down so that we might hold them in our hands all the way and feel any tug that might be made at our treasures you will imagine the absurdity of our jolting along some twenty miles in this way exactly as if we were in three showerbaths and were afraid to pull the string  we are going to the scala tonight having got the old box belonging to the hotel the old key of which is lying beside me on the table there seem to be no singers of note here now and it appears for the time to have fallen off

milan being most horribly slow i received your welcome letter only this morning i write this before going to bed that i may be sure of not being taken by any engagement off the post time tomorrow  we came in last night between seven and eight the railroad to turin is finished and opened to within twenty miles of genoa its effect upon the whole town and especially upon that part of it lying down beyond the lighthouse and away by san pietro darena is quite wonderful i only knew the place by the lighthouse so numerous were the new buildings so wide the streets so busy the people and so thriving and busy the many signs of commerce today i have seen  the  the  and the  the latter of whom live at nervi fourteen or fifteen miles off towards porto fino first of the  they are just the same except that mrs s face is larger and fuller and her hair rather gray as i rang at their bell she came out walking and stared at me what you dont know me said i upon which she recognised me very warmly and then said in her old quiet way i expected to find a ruin we heard you had been so ill and i find you younger and betterlooking than ever but its so strange to see you without a bright waistcoat why havent you got a bright waistcoat on i apologised for my black one and was sent upstairs when  presently appeared in a hideous and demoniacal nightdress having turned out of bed to greet his distinguished countryman after a long talk in the course of which i arranged to dine there on sunday early before starting by the steamer for naples and in which they told me every possible and impossible particular about their minutest affairs and especially about s marriage i set off for  at  i had found letters from him here and he had been here over and over again and had driven out no end of times to the gate to leave messages for me and really is in his strange uncouth way crying glad to see me i found him and his wife in a little comfortable country house overlooking the sea sitting in a small summerhouse on wheels exactly like a bathing machine i found her rather pretty extraordinarily cold and composed a mere piece of furniture talking broken english through eight months in the year they live in this country place she never reads never works never talks never gives an order or directs anything has only a taste for going to the theatre where she never speaks either and buying clothes they sit in the garden all day dine at four smoke their cigars go in at eight sit about till ten and then go to bed the greater part of this i had from  himself in a particularly unintelligible confidence in the garden the only portion of which that i could clearly understand were the words and one thing and another repeated one hundred thousand times he described himself as being perfectly happy and seemed very fond of his wife but that said  to me this morning looking like the figurehead of a ship with a nutmeggrater for a face that he ought to be and must be and is bound to behe couldnt help it  then i went on to the s and found them living in a beautiful situation in a ruinous albarolike palace coming upon them unawares i found  with a pointed beard smoking a great german pipe in a pair of slippers the two little girls very pale and faint from the climate in a singularly untidy stateone heaven knows why without stockings and both with their little short hair cropped in a manner never before beheld and a little bright bow stuck on the top of it  said she had invented this headgear as a picturesque thing adding that perhaps it wasand perhaps it was not she was greatly flushed and agitated but looked very well and seems to be greatly liked here we had disturbed her at her painting in oils and i rather received an impression that what with that and what with music the household affairs went a little to the wall  was teaching the two little girls the multiplication table in a disorderly old billiardroom with all manner of maps in it  having obtained a gracious permission from the lady of the school i am going to show my companions the sala of the peschiere this morning it is raining intensely hard in the regular genoa manner so that i can hardly hope for genoas making as fine an impression as i could desire our boat for naples is a large french mail boat and we hope to get there on tuesday or wednesday if the day after you receive this you write to the poste restante rome it will be the safest course fridays letter write poste restante florence you refer to a letter you suppose me to have received from forsterto whom my love no letter from him has come to hand  i will resume my report of this place in my next in the meantime i will not fail to drink dear kateys health today edward has just come in with mention of an english boat on tuesday morning superior to french boat tomorrow and faster i shall inquire at  and take the best when i next write i will give you our route in detail  i am pleased to hear of mr robsons success in a serious part as i hope he will now be a fine actor i hope you will enjoy yourself at macreadys though i fear it must be sometimes but a melancholy visit  goodbye my dear and believe me ever most affectionately                                                  sunday 30th october  we leave for naples tomorrow morning by the peninsular and oriental companys steamer the valletta i send a sketch of our movements that i have at last been able to make  mrs  quite came out yesterday so did mrs  in a different manner by violently attacking mrs  for painting ill in oils when she might be playing well on the piano it rained hard all yesterday but is finer this morning we went over the peschiere in the wet afternoon the garden is sorely neglected now and the rooms are all full of boardingschool beds and most of the fireplaces are closed up but the old beauty and grandeur of the place were in it still  this will find you i suppose at sherborne my heartiest love to dear macready and to miss macready and to all the house i hope my godson has not forgotten me  i will think of charley from whom i have heard here and soon write to him definitely at present i think he had better join me at boulogne i shall not bring the little boys over as if we keep our time it would be too long before christmas day  with love to georgy ever most affectionately yours

intended time under circumstances which i reserve for georginas letter by way of varietyin what forster used to call good health and spppirits we have a charming apartment opposite the sea a little lower down than the victoriain the direction of the san carlo theatreand the windows are now wide open as on an english summer night the first persons we found on board at genoa were emerson tennent lady tennent their son and daughter they are all here too in an apartment over ours and we have all been constantly together in a very friendly way ever since our meeting we dine at the table dhôtemade a league together on boardand have been mutually agreeable they have no servant with them and have profited by edward he goes on perfectly well is always cheerful and ready has been sleeping on board upside down i believe in a corner with his head in the wet and his heels against the side of the paddleboxbut has been perpetually gay and fresh  as soon as we got our luggage from the custom house we packed complete changes in a bag set off in a carriage for some warm baths and had a most refreshing cleansing after our long journey there was an odd neapolitan attendanta steady old manwho bringing the linen into my bath proposed to soap me upon which i called out to the other two that i intended to have everything done to me that could be done and gave him directions accordingly i was frothed all over with naples soap rubbed all down scrubbed with a brush had my nails cut and all manner of extraordinary operations performed he was as much disappointed apparently as surprised not to find me dirty and kept on ejaculating under his breath oh heaven how clean this englishman is he also remarked that the englishman is as fair as a beautiful woman some relations of lord john russells going to malta were aboardship and we were very pleasant likewise there was a mr young aboardan agreeable fellow not very unlike forster in personwho introduced himself as the brother of the miss youngs whom we knew at boulogne he was musical and had much goodfellowship in him and we were very agreeable together also on the whole i became decidedly popular and was embraced on all hands when i came over the side this morning we are going up vesuvius of course and to herculaneum and pompeii and the usual places the tennents will be our companions in most of our excursions but we shall leave them here behind us naples looks just the same as when we left it except that the weather is much better and brighter  on the day before we left genoa we had another dinner with  at his country place he was the soul of hospitality and really seems to love me you would have been quite touched if you could have seen the honest warmth of his affection on the occasion of this second banquet egg made a brilliant mistake that perfectly convulsed us all i had introduced all the games with great success and we were playing at the what advice would you have given that person game the advice was not to bully his fellowcreatures upon which egg triumphantly and with the greatest glee screamed mr  utterly forgetting s relationship which i had elaborately impressed upon him the effect was perfectly irresistible and uncontrollable and the little womans way of humouring the joke was in the best taste and the best sense while i am upon genoa i may add that when we left the croce the landlord in hoping that i was satisfied told me that as i was an old inhabitant he had charged the prices as to a genoese they certainly were very reasonable  mr and mrs sartoris have lately been staying in this house but are just gone it is kept by an english waitingmaid who married an italian courier and is extremely comfortable and clean i am getting impatient to hear from you with all home news and shall be heartily glad to get to rome and find my best welcome and interest at the postoffice there  that ridiculous  and her mother were at the hotel at leghorn the day before yesterday where the mother poor old lady was so ill from the fright and anxiety consequent on her daughters efforts at martyrdom that it is even doubtful whether she will recover i learnt from a lady friend of  that all this nonsense originated at nice where she was stirred up by free kirk parsonsitinerantany one of whom i take her to be ready to make a semicelestial marriage with the dear being who told me all about her was a noble specimensingle forty in a clinging flounced black silk dress which wouldnt drape or bustle or fall or do anything of that sortand with a leghorn hat on her head at least i am serious six feet round the consequence of its immense size was that whereas it had an insinuating blue decoration in the form of a bow in front it was so out of her knowledge behind that it was all battered and bent in that directionand viewed from that quarter she looked drunk  my best love to mamey and katey and sydney the king of the nursery and harry and the dear little plornishghenter i kiss almost all the children i encounter in remembrance of their sweet faces and talk to all the mothers who carry them i hope to hear nothing but good news from you and to find nothing but good spirits in your expected letter when i come to rome i already begin to look homeward being now at the remotest part of the journey and to anticipate the pleasure of return

to get over the disagreeable part of my letter in the beginning i have great doubts of the possibility of publishing your story in portions  but i think it possesses very great merit my doubts arise partly from the nature of the interest which i fear requires presentation as a whole and partly on your manner of relating the tale the people do not sufficiently work out their own purposes in dialogue and dramatic action you are too much their exponent what you do for them they ought to do for themselves with reference to publication in detached portions or indeed with a reference to the force of the story in any form that long stoppage and going back to possess the reader with the antecedents of the clergymans biography are rather crippling i may mention that i think the boy the child of the second marriage a little too slangy i know the kind of boyish slang which belongs to such a character in these times but considering his part in the story i regard it as the authors function to elevate such a characteristic and soften it into something more expressive of the ardour and flush of youth and its romance it seems to me too that the dialogues between the lady and the italian maid are conventional but not natural this observation i regard as particularly applying to the maid and to the scene preceding the murder supposing the main objection surmountable i would venture then to suggest to you the means of improvement in this respect  the paper is so full of good touches of character passion and natural emotion that i very much wish for a little time to reconsider it and to try whether condensation here and there would enable us to get it say into four parts i am not sanguine of this for i observed the difficulties as i read it the night before last but i am very unwilling i assure you to decline what has so much merit  i am going to paris on sunday morning for ten days or so i purpose being back again within a fortnight if you will let me think of this matter in the meanwhile i shall at least have done all i can to satisfy my own appreciation of your work  but if in the meantime you should desire to have it back with any prospect of publishing it through other means a letterthe shortest in the worldfrom you to mr wills at the household words office will immediately produce it i repeat with perfect sincerity that i am much impressed by its merits and that if i had read it as the production of an entire stranger i think it would have made exactly this effect upon me                                        my dear miss

carefully over your story again and quite agree with you that the episode of the clergyman could be told in a very few lines startling as i know it will appear to you i am bound to say that i think the purpose of the whole tale would be immensely strengthened by great compression i doubt if it could not be told more forcibly in half the space  it is certainly too long for household words and i fear my idea of it is too short for you i am if possible more unwilling than i was at first to decline it but the more i have considered it the longer it has seemed to grow nor can i ask you to try to present it free from that objection because i already perceive the difficulty and pain of such an effort  to the best of my knowledge you are wrong about the lady at last and to the best of my observation you do not express what you explain yourself to mean in the case of the italian attendant i have met with such talk in the romances of maturins timecertainly never in italian life  these however are slight points easily to be compromised in an hour the great obstacle i must leave wholly to your own judgment in looking over the tale again                               believe me always very faithfully yours   sidenote mr w m thackeray                    tavistock house friday evening 23rd march 1855  my dear thackeray57  i have read in the times today an account of your last nights lecture and cannot refrain from assuring you in all truth and earnestness that i am profoundly touched by your generous reference to me i do not know how to tell you what a glow it spread over my heart out of its fulness i do entreat you to believe that i shall never forget your words of commendation if you could wholly know at once how you have moved me and how you have animated me you would be the happier i am very certain                                                  faithfully yours ever   sidenote mr forster                            tavistock house friday 29th march 1855  my dear forster  i have hope of mr morley58 whom one cannot see without knowing to be a straightforward earnest man i also think higgins59 will materially help them60 generally i quite agree with you that they hardly know what to be at but it is an immensely difficult subject to start and they must have every allowance at any rate it is not by leaving them alone and giving them no help that they can be urged on to success travers too i think a man of the anticornlawleague order  higgins told me after the meeting on monday night that on the previous evening he had been closeted with  whose letter in that days paper he had put right for the times he had never spoken to  before he said and found him a rather muddleheaded scotchman as to his powers of conveying his ideas he higgins had gone over his documents judicially and with the greatest attention and not only was  wrong in every particular except one very unimportant circumstance but in reading documents to the house had stopped short in sentences where no stop was and by so doing had utterly perverted their meaning  this is to come out of course when said  gets the matter on i thought the case so changed before i knew this by his letter and that of the other shipowners that i told morley when i went down to the theatre that i felt myself called upon to relieve him from the condition i had imposed  for the rest i am quite calmly confident that i only do justice to the strength of my opinions and use the power which circumstances have given me conscientiously and moderately with a right object and towards the prevention of nameless miseries i should be now reproaching myself if i had not gone to the meeting and having been i am very glad  a good illustration of a government office  very kindly wrote to me to suggest that houses of parliament illustration after i had dined on wednesday and was going to jog slowly down to drury lane it suddenly came into my head that perhaps his details were wrong i had just time to turn to the annual register and not one of them was correct  this is of course in close confidence                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mrs winter

sunday or yesterday than a man can dispense with food or a horse can help himself from being driven i hold my inventive capacity on the stern condition that it must master my whole life often have complete possession of me make its own demands upon me and sometimes for months together put everything else away from me if i had not known long ago that my place could never be held unless i were at any moment ready to devote myself to it entirely i should have dropped out of it very soon all this i can hardly expect you to understandor the restlessness and waywardness of an authors mind you have never seen it before you or lived with it or had occasion to think or care about it and you cannot have the necessary consideration for it it is only halfanhourit is only an afternoonit is only an evening people say to me over and over again but they dont know that it is impossible to command ones self sometimes to any stipulated and set disposal of five minutesor that the mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole day these are the penalties paid for writing books whoever is devoted to an art must be content to deliver himself wholly up to it and to find his recompense in it i am grieved if you suspect me of not wanting to see you but i cant help it i must go my way whether or no  i thought you would understand that in sending the card for the box i sent an assurance that there was nothing amiss i am pleased to find that you were all so interested with the play my ladies say that the first part is too painful and wants relief i have been going to see it

her godfather on the condition that she had five hundred gallons of open air at any rate every day of her life and you would soon see a rose or two in the face of my other little friend ella if you opened all your doors and windows throughout the whole of all fine weather from morning to night  i am going off i dont know where or how far to ponder about i dont know what sometimes i am half in the mood to set off for france sometimes i think i will go and walk about on the seashore for three or four months sometimes i look towards the pyrenees sometimes switzerland i made a compact with a great spanish authority last week and vowed i would go to spain two days afterwards layard and i agreed to go to constantinople when parliament rises tomorrow i shall probably discuss with somebody else the idea of going to greenland or the north pole the end of all this most likely will be that i shall shut myself up in some outoftheway place i have not yet thought of and go desperately to work

baby but if you be not even already so reconciled to the parting from that innocent child for a little while as to bear it gently and with a softened sorrow i know that that not unhappy state of mind must soon arise the death of infants is a release from so much chance and changefrom so many casualties and distressesand is a thing so beautiful in its serenity and peacethat it should not be a bitterness even in a mothers heart the simplest and most affecting passage in all the noble history of our great master is his consideration for little children and in reference to yours as many millions of bereaved mothers poor and rich will do in reference to theirs until the end of time you may take the comfort of the generous words and he took a child and set it in the midst of them  in a

never was old wan tearful withered this is always one of the sources of consolation in the deaths of children with no effort of the fancy with nothing to undo you will always be able to think of the pretty creature you have lost as a child in heaven  a poor little baby of mine lies in highgate cemeteryand i laid her just as you think of laying yours in the catacombs there until i made a restingplace for all of us in the free air  it is better that i should not come to see you i feel quite sure of that and will think of you instead  god bless and comfort you mrs dickens and her sister

altogether correct but it strongly occurred to me that webster was going to decline the play and that he really has worried himself into a fear of playing aaron  now when i got this into my headwhich was during the rehearsali considered two thingsfirstly how we could best put about the success of the piece more widely and extensively even than it has yet reached and secondly how you could be best assisted against a bad production of it hereafter or no production of it i thought i saw immediately that the point would be to have this representation noticed in the newspapers so i waited until the

wifes story has come under my own perusal within these last three or four days i recognise in it such great merit and unusual promise and i think it displays so much power and knowledge of the human heart that i feel a strong interest in you as its writer  i have begged the gentleman who is in my confidence as to the transaction of the business of household words to return the ms to you by the post which as i hope will convey this note to you my object is this i particularly entreat you to consider the catastrophe you write to be read of course the close of the story is unnecessarily painfulwill throw off numbers of persons who would otherwise read it and who as it stands will be deterred by hearsay from so doing and is so tremendous a piece of severity that it will defeat your purpose all my knowledge and experience such as they are lead me straight to the recommendation that you will do well to spare the life of the husband and of one of the children let her suppose the former dead from seeing him brought in wounded and insensiblelose nothing of the progress of her mental suffering afterwards when that doctor is in attendance upon herbut bring her round at last to the blessed surprise that her husband is still living and that a repentance which can be worked out in the way of atonement for the misery she has occasioned to the man whom she so ill repaid for his love and made so miserable lies before her so will you soften the reader whom you now as it were harden and so you will bring tears from many eyes which can only have their spring in affectionately and gently touched hearts i am perfectly certain that with this change all the previous part of your tale will tell for twenty times as much as it can in its present condition and it is because i believe you have a great fame before you if you do justice to the remarkable ability you possess that i venture to offer you this advice in what i suppose to be the beginning of your career  i observe some parts of the story which would be strengthened even in their psychological interest by condensation here and there if you will leave that to me i will perform the task as conscientiously and carefully as if it were my own but the suggestion i offer for your acceptance no one but yourself can act upon  let me conclude this hasty note with the plain assurance that i have never been so much surprised and struck by any manuscript i have read as i have been by yours                                                  your faithful servant   sidenote the same                        3 albion villas folkestone july 21st 1855  dear madam  i did not enter in detail on the spirit of the alteration i propose in your story because i thought it right that you should think out that for yourself if you applied yourself to the change i can now assure you that you describe it exactly as i had conceived it and if i had wanted anything to confirm me in my conviction of its being right our both seeing it so precisely from the same point of view would be ample assurance to me  i would leave her new and altered life to be inferred it does not appear to me either necessary or practicable within such limits to do more than that do not be uneasy if you find the alteration demanding time i shall quite understand that and my interest will keep when you finish the story send it to mr wills besides being in daily communication with him i am at the office once a week and i will go over it in print before the proof is sent to you                                                  very faithfully yours                                                                185563  sidenote captain morgan  dear friend64  i am always delighted to hear from you your genial earnestness does me good to think of and every day of my life i feel more and more that to be thoroughly in earnest is everything and to be anything short of it is nothing you see what we have been doing to our valiant soldiers65 you see what miserable humbugs we are and because we have got involved in meshes of aristocratic red tape to our unspeakable confusion loss and sorrow the gentlemen who have been so kind as to ruin us are going to give us a day of humiliation and fasting the day after tomorrow i am sick and sour to think of such things at this age of the world    i am in the first stage of a new book which consists in going round and round the idea as you see a bird in his cage go about and about his sugar before he touches it                                            always most cordially yours

tavistock house monday 19th may 1856  gentlemen  i have received a letter signed by you which i assume to be written mainly on behalf of what are called workingmen and their families inviting me to attend a meeting in our parish vestry hall this evening on the subject of the stoppage of the sunday bands in the parks  i thoroughly agree with you that those bands have afforded an innocent and healthful enjoyment on the sunday afternoon to which the people have a right but i think it essential that the working people should of themselves and by themselves assert that right they have been informed on the high authority of their first minister lately rather in want of house of commons votes i am told that they are almost indifferent to it the correction of that mistake if official omniscience can be mistaken lies with themselves in case it should be considered by the meeting which i prefer for this reason not to attend expedient to unite with other metropolitan parishes in forming a fund for the payment of such expenses as may be incurred in peaceably and numerously representing to the governing powers that the harmless recreation they have taken away is very much

tavistock house london july 5th 1856  my dear irving  if you knew how often i write to you individually and personally in my books you would be no more surprised in seeing this note than you were in seeing me do my duty by that flowery julep in what i dreamily apprehend to have been a former state of existence at baltimore  will you let me present to you a cousin of mine mr b who is associated with a merchants house in new york of course he wants to see you and know you how can i wonder at that how can anybody  i had a long talk with leslie at the last academy dinner having previously been with him in paris and he told me that you were flourishing i suppose you know that he wears a moustacheso do i for the matter of that and a beard tooand that he looks like a portrait of don quixote

rogers is all i will sully it with you know i daresay that for a year or so before his death he wandered and lost himself like one of the children in the wood grown up there and grown down again he had mrs procter and mrs carlyle to breakfast with him one morningonly those two both excessively talkative very quick and clever and bent on entertaining him when mrs carlyle had flashed and shone before him for about threequarters of an hour on one subject he turned his poor old eyes on mrs procter and pointing to the brilliant discourser with his poor old finger said indignantly who is she upon this mrs procter cutting in delivered it is her own story a neat oration on the life and writings of carlyle and enlightened him in her happiest and airiest manner all of which he heard staring in the dreariest silence and then said indignantly as before and who are you                          ever my dear irving                                   most affectionately and truly yours

farce66 not a difficult one to learn as you never say anything but yes and no you are called in the dramatis personæ an ablebodied british seaman and you are never seen by mortal eye to do anything except inopportunely producing a mop but stand about the deck of the boat in everybodys way with your hair immensely touzled one brace on your hands in your pockets and the bottoms of your trousers tucked up yet you are inextricably connected with the plot and are the man whom everybody is inquiring after i think it is a very whimsical idea and extremely droll it made me laugh heartily when i jotted it all down yesterday  loves from all my house to all yours                                                    ever affectionately  footnote  66 the farce alluded to however was never written

bulwer  i thought wills had told you as to the guild for i begged him to that he can do absolutely nothing until our charter is seven years old it is the stringent and express prohibition of the act of parliamentfor which things you members thank god are responsible and not i when i observed this clause which was just as we were going to grant a pension if we could agree on a good subject i caused our counsels opinion to be taken on it and there is not a doubt about it i immediately recommended that there should be no expensesthat the interest on the capital should be all invested as it accruedthat the chambers should be given up and the clerk dischargedand that the guild should have the use of the household words office rent free and the services of wills on the same terms all of which was done  a letter is now copying to be sent round to all the members explaining with the new year the whole state of the thing you will receive this it appears to me that it looks wholesome enough but if a strong idiot comes and binds your hands or mine or both for seven years what is to be done against him  as to greater matters than this howeveras to all matters on this teeming earthit appears to me that the house of commons and parliament altogether is just the dreariest failure and nuisance that has bothered this muchbothered world                                                             ever yours   sidenote miss emily jolly                                    gravesend kent 10th april 1857  dear madam  as i am away from london for a few days your letter has been forwarded to me  i can honestly encourage and assure you that i believe the depression and want of confidence under which you describe yourself as labouring to have no sufficient foundation  first as to mr arle i have constantly heard it spoken of with great approval and i think it a book of considerable merit if i were to tell you that i see no evidence of inexperience in it that would not be true i think a little more stir and action to be desired also but i am surprised by your being despondent about it for i assure you that i had supposed it always remembering that it is your first novel to have met with a very good reception  i can bring to my memoryhere with no means of reference at handonly two papers of yours that have been unsuccessful at household words i think the first was called the brook it appeared to me to break down upon a confusion that pervaded it between a coroners inquest and a trial i have a general recollection of the mingling of the two as to facts and forms that should have been kept apart in some inextricable manner that was beyond my powers of disentanglement the second was about a wifes writing a novel and keeping the secret from her husband until it was done i did not think the incident of sufficient force to justify the length of the narrative but there is nothing fatal in either of these mischances  mr wills told me when i spoke to him of the latter paper that you had it in contemplation to offer a longer story to household words if you should do so i assure you i shall be happy to read it myself and that i shall have a sincere desire to accept it if possible  i can give you no better counsel than to look into the life about you and to strive for what is noblest and true as to further encouragement i do not i can most strongly add believe that you have any reason to be downhearted                                                  very faithfully yours   sidenote the same                    tavistock house saturday morning 30th may 1857  dear madam  i read your story with all possible attention last night i cannot tell you with what reluctance i write to you respecting it for my opinion of it is not favourable although i perceive your heart in it and great strength  pray understand that i claim no infallibility i merely express my own honest opinion formed against my earnest desire i do not lay it down as law for others though of course i believe that many others would come to the same conclusion it appears to me that the story is one that cannot possibly be told within the compass to which you have limited yourself the three principal people are every one of them in the wrong with the reader and you cannot put any of them right without making the story extend over a longer space of time and without anatomising the souls of the actors more slowly and carefully nothing would justify the departure of alice but her having some strong reason to believe that in taking that step she saved her lover in your intentions as to that lovers transfer of his affections to eleanor i descry a striking truth but i think it confusedly wrought out and all but certain to fail in expressing itself eleanor i regard as forced and overstrained the natural result is that she carries a train of anticlimax after her i particularly notice this at the point when she thinks she is going to be drowned  the whole idea of the story is sufficiently difficult to require the most exact truth and the greatest knowledge and skill in the colouring throughout in this respect i have no doubt of its being extremely defective the people do not talk as such people would and the little subtle touches of description which by making the country house and the general scene real would give an air of reality to the people much to be desired are altogether wanting the more you set yourself to the illustration of your heroines passionate nature the more indispensable this attendant atmosphere of truth becomes it would in a manner oblige the reader to believe in her whereas for ever exploding like a great firework without any background she glares and wheels and hisses and goes out and has lighted nothing  lastly i fear she is too convulsive from beginning to end pray reconsider from this point of view her brow and her eyes and her drawing herself up to her full height and her being a perfumed presence and her floating into rooms also her asking people how they dare and the like on small provocation when she hears her music being played i think she is particularly objectionable  i have a strong belief that if you keep this story by you three or four years you will form an opinion of it not greatly differing from mine there is so much good in it so much reflection so much passion and earnestness that if my judgment be right i feel sure you will come over to it on the other hand i do not think that its publication as it stands would do you service or be agreeable to you hereafter  i have no means of knowing whether you are patient in the pursuit of this art but i am inclined to think that you are not and that you do not discipline yourself enough when one is impelled to write this or that one has still to consider how much of this will tell for what i mean how much of it is my own wild emotion and superfluous energyhow much remains that is truly belonging to this ideal character and these ideal circumstances it is in the laborious struggle to make this distinction and in the determination to try for it that the road to the correction of faults lies perhaps i may remark in support of the sincerity with which i write this that i am an impatient and impulsive person myself but that it has been for many years the constant effort of my life to practise at my desk what i preach to you  i should not have written so much or so plainly but for your last letter to me it seems to demand that i should be strictly true with you and i am so in this letter without any reservation either way                                                  very faithfully yours     1858   sidenote mr albert smith            tavistock house tavistock square london wc

think roccabella a very remarkable book indeed apartquite apartfrom my interest in you i am certain that if i had taken it up under any ordinarily favourable circumstances as a book of which i knew nothing whatever i should notcould nothave relinquished it until i had read it through i had turned but a few pages and come to the shadow on the bright sofa at the foot of the bed when i knew myself to be in the hands of an artist that rare and delightful recognition i never lost for a moment until i closed the second volume at the end i am a good audience when i have reason to be and my girls would testify to you if there were need that i cried over it heartily your story seems to me remarkably ingenious i had not the least idea of the purport of the sealed paper until you chose to enlighten me and then i felt it to be quite natural quite easy thoroughly in keeping with the character and presentation of the liverpool man the position of the bell family in the story has a special air of nature and truth is quite new to me and is so dexterously and delicately done that i find the deaf daughter no less real and distinct than the clergymans wife the turn of the story round that damnable princess i pursued with a pleasure with which i could pursue nothing but a true interest and i declare to you that if i were put upon finding anything better than the scene of roccabellas death i should stare round my bookshelves very much at a loss for a long time similarly your characters have really surprised me from the lawyer to the princess i swear to them as true and in your fathoming of rosamond altogether there is a profound wise knowledge that i admire and respect with a heartiness not easily overstated in words  i am not quite with you as to the italians your knowledge of the italian character seems to me surprisingly subtle and penetrating but i think we owe it to those most unhappy men and their political wretchedness to ask ourselves mercifully whether their faults are not essentially the faults of a people long oppressed and priestriddenwhether their tendency to slink and conspire is not a tendency that spies in every dress from the triple crown to a lousy head have engendered in their ancestors through generations again like you i shudder at the distresses that come of these unavailing risings my blood runs hotter as yours does at the thought of the leaders safe and the instruments perishing by hundreds yet what is to be done their wrongs are so great that they will rise from time to time somehow it would be to doubt the eternal providence of god to doubt that they will rise successfully at last unavailing struggles against a dominant tyranny precede all successful turning against it and is it not a little hard in us englishman whose forefathers have risen so often and striven against so much to look on in our own security through microscopes and detect the motes in the brains of men driven mad think if you and i were italians and had grown from boyhood to our present time menaced in every day through all these years by that infernal confessional dungeons and soldiers could we be better than these men should we be so good i should not i am afraid if i know myself such things would make of me a moody bloodthirsty implacable man who would do anything for revenge and if i compromised the truthput it at the worst habituallywhere should i ever have had it before me in the old jesuits college at genoa on the chiaja at naples in the churches of rome at the university of padua on the piazzo san marco at venice where and the government is in all these places and in all italian places i have seen something of these men i have known mazzini and gallenga manin was tutor to my daughters in paris i have had long talks about scores of them with poor ary scheffer who was their best friend i have gone back to italy after ten years and found the best men i had known there exiled or in jail i believe they have the faults you ascribe to them nationally not individually but i could not find it in my heart remembering their miseries to exhibit those faults without referring them back to their causes you will forgive my writing this because i write it exactly as i write my cordial little tribute to the high merits of your book if it were not a living reality to me i should care nothing about this point of disagreement but you are far too earnest a man and far too able a man to be left unremonstrated with by an admiring reader you cannot write so well without influencing many people if you could tell me that your book had but twenty readers i would reply that so good a book will influence more peoples opinions through those twenty than a worthless book would through twenty thousand and i express this with the perfect confidence of one in whose mind the book has taken for good and all a separate and distinct place  accept my thanks for the pleasure you have given me the poor acknowledgment of testifying to that pleasure wherever i go will be my pleasure in return and so my dear chorley good night and god bless you                                                  ever faithfully yours

 secondly i must tell you that i was greatly vexed with the chatham people for not giving me early notice of your lecture in that case i should of course have presided as president of the institution and i should have asked you to honour my falstaff house here but when they made your kind intention known to me i had made some important business engagements at the all the year round office for that evening which i could not possibly forego i charged them to tell you so and was going to write to you when i found your kind letter  thanks for your paper which i have sent to the printers with much pleasure  we heard of your accident here and of your making nothing of it i said that you didnt make much of disasters and that you took poison from natives as quite a matter of course in the way of

tuesday 4th december 1860  my dear layard  i know you will readily believe that i would come if i could and that i am heartily sorry i cannot  a new story of my writing nine months long is just begun in all the year round a certain allotment of my time when i have that storydemand upon me has all through my author life been an essential condition of my health and success i have just returned here

that you know it helps me out through this note you are a man of so much mark to me that i even regret your going into the house of commonsfor which assembly i have but a scant respect but i would not mention it to the southwark electors if i could come tomorrow though i should venture to tell them and even that your friends would consider very impolitic that i think them very much honoured by

consider myself quite well and although my doctor almost admits the fact when i indignantly tax him with it i am not discharged his treatment renders him very fearful that i should take cold in going

can honestly assure you that i never have been so pleased at heart in all my literary life as i am in the proud thought of standing side by side with you before this great audience  in regard of the story72 i have perfect faith in such a masterhand as yours and i know that what such an artist feels to be terrible and original is unquestionably so you whet my interest by what you write of it to

at work to follow you the publication has made a very great success with great expectations and could not present a finer time for you  the question of length may be easily adjusted  of the misgiving you entertain i cannot of course judge until you give me leave to rush to the perusal i swear that i never thought i had half so much selfdenial as i have shown in this case i think i shall come out at exeter hall as a choice vessel on the strength of it in the meanwhile i have quickened the printer and told him to get on fast  you cannot think how happy you make me by what you write of great expectations there is nothing like the pride of making such an effect on such a writer as you                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote the same

to knebworth to see you with his sister mrs benzon is a particular friend of mine for whom i have a very high and warm regard although he will sufficiently enlist your sympathy on his own behalf i am sure that you will not be the less interested in him because i am                                                  ever faithfully yours   sidenote the same                           3 hanover terrace sunday 12th may 1861  my dear bulwer lytton  i received your revised proofs only yesterday and i sat down to read them last night and before i say anything further i may tell you that i could not lay them aside but was obliged to go on with them in my bedroom until i got into a very ghostly state indeed this morning i have taken them again and have gone through them with the utmost attention  of the beauty and power of the writing i say not a word or of its originality and boldness or of its quite extraordinary constructive skill i confine myself solely to your misgiving and to the question whether there is any sufficient foundation for it  on the last head i say without the faintest hesitation most decidedly there is not sufficient foundation for it i do not share it in the least i believe that the readers who have here given their minds or perhaps had any to give to those strange psychological mysteries in ourselves of which we are all more or less conscious will accept your wonders as curious weapons in the armoury of fiction and will submit themselves to the art with which said weapons are used even to that class of intelligence the marvellous addresses itself from a very strong position and that class of intelligence is not accustomed to find the marvellous in such very powerful hands as yours on more imaginative readers the tale will fall or i am greatly mistaken like a spell by readers who combine some imagination some scepticism and some knowledge and learning i hope it will be regarded as full of strange fancy and curious study startling reflections of their own thoughts and speculations at odd times and wonder which a master has a right to evoke in the last point lies to my thinking the whole case if you were the magicians servant instead of the magician these potent spirits would get the better of you but you are the magician and they dont and you make them serve your purpose  occasionally in the dialogue i see an expression here and there which mightalways solely with a reference to your misgivingbe better away and i think that the vision to use the word for want of a betterin the museum should be made a little less abstruse i should not say that if the sale of the journal was below the sale of the times newspaper but as it is probably several thousands higher i do i would also suggest that after the title we put the two wordsa romance it is an absurdly easy device for getting over your misgiving with the blockheads but i think it would be an effective one i dont on looking at it like the title here are a few that have occurred to me  the steel casket  the lost manuscript  derval court  perpetual youth  maggie  dr fenwick  life and death  the four last i think the best there is an objection to dr fenwick because there has been dr antonio and there is a book of dumas which repeats the objection i dont think fenwick startling enough it appears to me that a more startling title would take the john bull by the horns and would be a serviceable concession to your misgiving as suggesting a story off the stones of the gaslighted brentford road  the title is the first thing to be settled and cannot be settled too soon  for the purposes of the weekly publication the divisions of the story will often have to be greatly changed though afterwards in the complete book you can of course divide it into chapters free from that reference for example i would end the first chapter on the third slip at and through the ghostly streets under the ghostly moon went back to my solitary room the rest of what is now your first chapter might be made chapter ii and would end the first weekly part  i think i have become by dint of necessity and practice rather cunning in this regard and perhaps you would not mind my looking closely to such points from week to week it so happens that if you had written the opening of this story expressly for the occasion its striking incidents could not possibly have followed one another better one other merely mechanical change i suggest now i would not have an initial letter for the town but would state in the beginning that i gave the town a fictitious name i suppose a blank or a dash rather fends a good many people offbecause it always has that effect upon me  be sure that i am perfectly frank and open in all i have said in this note and that i have not a grain of reservation in my mind i think the story a very fine one one that no other man could write and that there is no strength in your misgiving for the two reasons firstly that the work is professedly a work of fancy and fiction in which the reader is not required against his will to take everything for fact secondly that it is written by the man who can write it the magicians servant does not know what to do with the ghost and has consequently no business with him the magician does know what to do with him and has all the business with him that he can transact  i am quite at ease on the points that you have expressed yourself as not at ease upon quite i cannot too often say that if they were carried on weak shoulders they would break the bearer down but in your mastering of them lies the mastery over the reader  this will reach you at knebworth i hope tomorrow afternoon pray give your doubts to the winds of that high spot and believe that if i had them i would swarm up the flagstaff quite as nimbly as margrave and nail the fenwick colours to the top                                              ever affectionately yours   sidenote the same                       3

work that day and thought it best that the ms should come back to you rather than that i should detain it of course i can read it whenever it suits you as to isabels dying and fenwicks growing old i would say that beyond question whatever the meaning of the story tends to is the proper end  all the alterations you mention in your last are excellent  as to title margrave a tale of mystery would be sufficiently striking i prefer wonder to mystery because i think it suggests something higher and more apart from ordinary complications of plot or the like which mystery might seem to mean will you kindly remark that the title presses and that it will be a great relief to have it as soon as possible the last two months of my story are our best time for announcement and preparation of course it is most desirable that your story should have the full benefit of them                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote lady olliffe                           lord

congratulate you on your eldest daughters approaching marriage up to the moment when mary told me of it i had foolishly thought of her always as the pretty little girl with the frank loving face whom i saw last on the sands at broadstairs i rubbed my eyes and woke at the words going to be married and found i had been walking in my sleep some years  i want to thank you also for thinking of me on the occasion but i feel that i am better away from it i should really have a misgiving that i was a sort of shadow on a young marriage and you will understand me when i say so and no more  but i shall be with you in the best part of myself in the warmth of sympathy and friendshipand i send my love to the dear girl and devoutly hope and believe that she will be happy the face that i remember with perfect accuracy and could draw here if i could draw at all was made to be happy and to make a husband so  i wonder whether you ever travel by railroad in these times i wish mary could tempt you to come by any road to this little place          with kind regard to milner gibson believe me ever                                   affectionately and faithfully yours   sidenote sir edward bulwer

with the addition to the length of the storydelighted with your account of it and your interest in itand even more than delighted by what you say of our working in company  not one dissentient voice has reached me respecting it through the dullest time of the year we held our circulation most gallantly and it could not have taken a better hold i saw forster on friday newly returned from thousands of provincial lunatics and he really was more impressed than i can tell you by what he had seen of it just what you say you think it will turn out to be he was saying almost in the same words  i am burning to get at the whole storyand you inflame me in the maddest manner by your references to what i dont know the exquisite art with which you have changed it and have overcome the difficulties of

can all the business connected with them and without whom i fear they will be dreary and weary to me but this is not to the purpose of your letter  i desire to be useful to the institution of the

heartily sorry for this and shall miss my usual place at your table quite as much to say the least as my place can possibly miss me you may be sure that i shall drink to my dear old friend in a bumper

19 and 20 i have not the least doubt of the introduced matter whether considered for its policy its beauty or its wise bearing on the story it is decidedly a great improvement it is at once very suggestive and very new to have these various points of view presented to the readers mind  that the audience is good enough for anything that is well presented to it i am quite sure  when you can avoid notes however and get their substance into the text it is highly desirable in the case of so large an audience simply because as so large an audience necessarily reads the story in small portions it is of the greater importance that they should retain as much of its argument as possible whereas the difficulty of getting numbers of people to read notes which they invariably regard as interruptions of the text not as strengtheners or elucidators of it is wonderful                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote the same                          all

press upon me meaning to write in detail in a day or two  but i have read at all events though not written and i say most masterly and most admirable it is impossible to lay the sheets down without finishing them i showed them to georgina and mary and they read and read and never stirred until they had read all there cannot be a doubt of the beauty power and artistic excellence of the whole  i counsel you most strongly not to append the proposed dialogue between fenwick and faber and not to enter upon any explanation beyond the titlepage and the motto unless it be in some very brief preface decidedly i would not help the reader if it were only for the reason that that anticipates his being in need of help and his feeling objections and difficulties that require solution let the book explain itself it speaks for itself with a noble eloquence                                                    ever affectionately  footnote  72 a strange story     1862   sidenote the same          gads hill place higham by rochester kent                                 friday twentyfourth january 1862  my dear bulwer lytton  i have considered your questions and here follow my replies  1 i think you undoubtedly have the right to forbid the turning of your play into an opera  2 i do not think the production of such an opera in the slightest degree likely to injure the play or to render it a less valuable property than it is now if it could have any effect on so standard and popular a work as the lady of lyons the effect would in my judgment be beneficial but i believe the play to be high above any such influence  3 assuming you do consent to the adaptation in a desire to oblige oxenford i would not recommend your asking any pecuniary compensation this for two reasons firstly because the compensation could only be small at the best secondly because your taking it would associate you unreasonably but not the less assuredly with the opera  the only objection i descry is purely one of feeling pauline trotting about in front of the float invoking the orchestra with a limp pockethandkerchief is a notion that makes gooseflesh of my back also a yelping tenor going away to the wars in a scene a halfanhour long is painful to contemplate damas too as a bass with a grizzled bald head blatently bellowing about          years long ago           when the sound of the drum         first made his blood glow           with a rum ti tum tum  rather sticks in my throat but there really seems to me to be no other objection if you can get over this                                                    ever affectionately   sidenote mr baylis          gads hill place higham by rochester kent                                      saturday first february 1862  my dear mr baylis  i have just come home finding your note i write to you at once or you might do me the wrong of supposing me unmindful of it and you  i agree with you about smith himself and i dont think it necessary to pursue the painful subject such things are at an end i think for the time beingfell to the ground with the poor man at cremorne if they should be resumed then they must be attacked but i hope the fashion far too much encouraged in its blondinbeginning by those who should know much better is over  it always appears to me that the common people have an excuse in their patronage of such exhibitions which people above them in condition have not their lives are full of physical difficulties and they like to see such difficulties overcome they go to see them overcome if i am in danger of falling off a scaffold or a ladder any day the man who claims that he cant fall from anything is a very wonderful and agreeable person to me

your lecture73 this afternoon and i hope i may venture to tell you that i was extremely pleased and interested both the matter of the materials and the manner of their arrangement were quite admirable and a modesty and complete absence of any kind of affectation pervaded the whole discourse which was quite an example to the many whom it concerns if you could be a very little louder and would never let a sentence go for the thousandth part of an instant until the last word is out you would find the audience more responsive  a spoken sentence will never run alone in all its life and is never to be trusted to itself in its most insignificant member see it well outwith the voiceand the part of the audience is made surprisingly easier in that excellent description of the spanish mendicant and his guitar as well as the very happy touches about the dance and the castanets the people were really desirous to express very hearty appreciation but by giving them rather too much to do in watching and listening for latter words you stopped them i take the liberty of making the remark as one who has fought with beasts oratorically in divers arenas for the rest nothing could be better knowledge ingenuity neatness condensation good sense and good taste in delightful combination                                                  affectionately always   sidenote mrs austin                  paris

your improved account of yourself is very cheering and hopeful through determined occupation and action lies the way be sure of it  i came over to france before georgina and mary and went to boulogne to meet them coming in by the steamer on the great sundaythe day of the storm i stood holding on with both hands on the pier at boulogne five hours the submarine telegraph had telegraphed their boat as having come out of folkestonethough the companion boat from boulogne didnt try itand at nine oclock at night she being due at six there were no signs of her my principal dread was that she would try to get into boulogne which she could not possibly have done without carrying away everything on deck the tide at nine oclock being too low for any such desperate attempt i thought it likely that they had run for the downs and would knock about there all night so i went to the inn to dry my peajacket and get some dinner anxiously enough when at about ten came a telegram from them at calais to say they had run in there to calais i went post next morning expecting to find them halfdead of course they had arrived halfdrowned but i found them elaborately got up to come on to paris by the next train and the most wonderful thing of all was that they hardly seem to have been frightened of course they had discovered at the end of the voyage that a young bride and her husband the only other passengers on deck and with whom they had been talking all the time were an officer from chatham whom they knew very well when dry just married and going to india so they all set up housekeeping together at dessins at calais where i am well known and looked as if they had been passing a mild summer there  we have a pretty apartment here but houserent is awful to mention mrs bouncer muzzled by the parisian police is also here and is a wonderful spectacle to behold in the streets restrained like a raging lion  i learn from an embassy here that the emperor has just made an earnest proposal to our government to unite with france and russia if russia will in an appeal to america to stop the brutal war our governments answer is not yet received but i think i clearly perceive that the proposal will be declined on the ground that the time has not yet come                                                    ever affectionately  footnote  73 the first of the series on national music     1863

prettiest and best carriage of the class ever made but you know that i value it for higher reasons than these it will always be dear to mefar dearer than anything on wheels could ever be for its own sakeas a proof of your ever generous friendship and appreciation and a memorial of a happy intercourse and a perfect confidence that have never had a break and that surely never can have any break now

knebworth on a visit at this time firstly because i am tied by the leg to my book secondly because my married daughter and her husband are with us thirdly because my two boys are at home for their holidays  but if you would come out of that murky electioneering atmosphere and come to us you dont know how delighted we should be you should have your own way as completely as though you were at home you should have a cheery room and you should have a swiss châlet all to yourself to write in smoking regarded as a personal favour to the family georgina is so insupportably vain on account of being a favourite of yours that you might find her a drawback but nothing else would turn out in that way i hope  wont you manage it do think of it if for instance you would come back with us on that guild saturday i have turned the house upside down and inside out since you were here and have carved new rooms out of places then nonexistent pray do think of it and do manage it i should be heartily pleased  i hope you will find the purpose and the plot of my book very plain when you see it as a whole piece i am looking forward to sending you the proofs complete about the end of next month it is all sketched out and i am working hard on it giving it all the pains possible to be bestowed on a labour of love your critical opinion two months in advance of the public will be invaluable to me for you know what store i set by it and how i think over a hint from you  i notice the latest piece of poisoning ingenuity in pritchards case when he had made his medical student boarders sick by poisoning the family food he then quietly walked out took an emetic and made himself sick this with a view to ask them in examination on a possible trial whether he did not present symptoms at the time like the resta question naturally asked for him and answered in the affirmative from which i get at the fact  if your constituency dont bring you in they deserve to lose you and may the gods continue to confound them i shudder at the thought of such public life as political life would there not seem to be something horribly rotten in the system of it when one stands amazed how any mannot forced into it by position as you arecan bear to live it  but the private life here is my point and again i urge upon you do think of it and do come  i want to tell you how i have been impressed by the boatman it haunts me as only a beautiful and profound thing can the lines are always running in my head as the river runs with me                                                    ever

these changes from muggy weather to slight sharp frost and back again touch weak places as i find by my own foot but the touch goes by may it prove so with you  yesterday captain  captain  and captain  dined at gads they are all three naval officers of the highest reputation  is supposed to be the best sailor in our service i said i had been remarking at home à propos of the london that i knew of no shipwreck of a large strong ship not carrying weight of guns in the open sea and that i could find none such in the shipwreck books they all agreed that the unfortunate captain martin must have been unacquainted with the truth as to what can and what can not be done with a steamship having rigging and canvas and that no sailor would dream of turning a ships stern to such a galeunless his vessel could run faster than the sea  said and the other two confirmed that the london was the better for everything that she lost aloft in such a gale and that with her head kept to the wind by means of a storm topsailwhich is hoisted from the deck and requires no man to be sent aloft and can be set under the worst circumstancesthe disaster could not have occurred if he had no such sail he could have improvised it even of hammocks and the like they said that under a board of enquiry into the wreck any efficient witness must of necessity state this as the fact and could not possibly avoid the conclusion that the seamanship was utterly bad and as to the force of the wind for which i suggested allowance they all had been in west indian hurricanes and in typhoons and had put the heads of their ships to the wind under the most adverse circumstances  i thought you might be interested in this as you have no doubt been interested in the case they had a great respect for the unfortunate captains character and for his behaviour when the case was hopeless but they had not the faintest doubt that he lost the ship and those two hundred and odd lives

should prove true but i give warning that in that case i shall exact a promise from you to come to st jamess hall one evening in april or may and hear david copperfield my own particular favourite

what is suitable to the requirements of my own journalfor instanceis a person i am heartily glad to discover and do not very often find and i believe this to be no rare case in periodical literature i cannot undertake to advise you in the abstract as i number my unknown correspondents by the hundred but if you offer anything to me for insertion in all the year round you may be sure that it will be honestly read and that it will be judged by no test but its own merits and adaptability to those pages  but i am bound to add that i do not regard successful fiction as a thing to be achieved in

really painful to me if i had seen you and yours at a reading of mine in right of any other credentials than my own your appreciation has given me higher and purer gratification than your modesty can readily believe when i first entered on this interpretation of myself then quite strange in the public ear i was sustained by the hope that i could drop into some hearts some new expression of the meaning of my books that would touch them in a new way to this hour that purpose is so strong in me and so real are my fictions to myself that after hundreds of nights i come with a feeling of perfect freshness to that little red table and laugh and cry with my hearers as if i had never stood there before you will know from this what a delight it is to be delicately understood and why your earnest words cannot fail to move me  we are delighted to be remembered by your charming wife and i am entrusted with more messages from this house to her than you would care to give or withhold so i suppress

16th april 1867  my dear mr phillips83  although i think the scheme has many good points i have this doubt would boys so maintained at any one of our great public schools stand at a decided disadvantage towards boys not so maintained foundation scholars in many cases win their way into public schools and so enforce respect and even assert superiority in many other cases their patron is a remote and misty person or institution sanctioned by time and custom but the proposed position would be a very different one for a student to hold and boys are too often inconsiderate proud and cruel

work of the fiftyone readings and am wonderfully fresh i grieve to hear of your sad occupation you know where to find rest and quiet and sympathy when you can change the dreary scene  i saw poor dear stanfield on a hint from his eldest son in a days interval between two expeditions it was clear that the shadow of the end had fallen on him  it happened well that i had seen on a wild day at

arrived here this morning a thousand thanks for it i begin to think nautically that i head westard you shall hear from me fully and finally as soon as dolby shall have reported personally  the other day i received a letter from mr  of new york who came over in the winning yacht and described the voyage in the times saying he would much like to see me i made an appointment in london and observed that when he did see me he was obviously astonished while i was sensible that the magnificence of my appearance would fully account for his being overcome i nevertheless angled for the cause of his surprise he then told me that there was a paragraph going round the papers to the effect that i was in a critical state of health i asked him if he was sure it wasnt cricketing state of health to which he replied quite i then asked him down here to dinner and he was again staggered by finding me in sporting training also much amused  yesterdays and todays post bring me this unaccountable paragraph from hosts of uneasy friends with the enormous and wonderful addition that eminent surgeons are sending me to america for cessation from literary labour so i have written a quiet line to the times certifying to my own state of health and have also begged dixon to do the like in the athenæum i mention the matter to you in order that you may contradict from me if the nonsense should reach america unaccompanied by the truth but i suppose that the new york herald will probably have got the letter from mr  aforesaid     charles reade and wilkie collins are here and the joke of the time is to feel my pulse when i appear at table and also to inveigle innocent messengers to come over to the summerhouse where i write the place is quite changed since you were here and a tunnel under the highroad connects this shrubbery with the front garden to ask with their compliments how i find myself now  if i come to america this next november even you can hardly imagine with what interest i shall try copperfield on an american audience or if they give me their heart how freely and fully i shall give them mine we will ask dolby then whether he ever heard it before  i cannot thank you enough for your invaluable help to dolby he writes that at every turn and moment the sense and knowledge and tact of mr osgood are inestimable to him                                 ever my dear

you that the play was admirably done last night and made a marked impression pauline is weak but so carefully trained and fitted into the picture as to be never disagreeable and sometimes as in the last scene very pathetic fechter has played nothing nearly so well as claude since he played in paris in the dame aux camélias or in london as ruy blas he played the fourth act as finely as macready and the first much better the dress and bearing in the fifth act are quite new and quite excellent  of the scenic arrangements the most noticeable arethe picturesque struggle of the cottage between the taste of an artist and the domestic means of poverty expressed to the eye with infinite tactthe view of lyons act v scene 1 with a foreground of quay wall which the officers are leaning on waiting for the generaland the last scenea suite of rooms giving on a conservatory at the back through which the moon is shining you are to understand that all these scenic appliances are subdued to the piece instead of the piece being sacrificed to them and that every group and situation has to be considered not only with a reference to each by itself but to the whole story  beauséants speaking the original contents of the letter was a decided point and the immense house was quite breathless when the tempter and the tempted stood confronted as he made the proposal  there was obviously a great interest in seeing a frenchman play the part the scene between claude and gaspar the small part very well done was very closely watched for the same reason and was loudly applauded i cannot say too much of the brightness intelligence picturesqueness and care of fechters impersonation throughout there was a remarkable delicacy in his gradually drooping down on his way home with his bride until he fell upon the table a crushed heap of shame and remorse while his mother told pauline the story his gradual recovery of himself as he formed better resolutions was equally well expressed and his being at last upright again and rushing enthusiastically to join the army brought the house down  i wish you could have been there he never spoke english half so well as he spoke your english and the audience heard it with the finest sympathy and respect i felt that i should have been very proud indeed to have been the writer of the play                                                    ever

reasonable guess the words i added to dolbys last telegram to boston tribune london correspondent totally false not only is there not a word of truth in the pretended conversation but it is so absurdly unlike me that i cannot suppose it to be even invented by anyone who ever heard me exchange a word with mortal creature for twenty years i am perfectly certain that i have never made any other allusion to the republication of my books in america than the goodhumoured remark that if there had been international copyright between england and the states i should have been a man of very large fortune instead of a man of moderate savings always supporting a very expensive public position nor have i ever been such a fool as to charge the absence of international copyright upon individuals nor have i ever been so ungenerous as to disguise or suppress the fact that i have received handsome sums for advance sheets when i was in the states i said what i had to say on the question and there an end i am absolutely certain that i have never since expressed myself even with soreness on the subject reverting to the preposterous fabrication of the london correspondent the statement that i ever talked about these fellows who republished my books or pretended to know what i dont know at this instant who made how much out of them or ever talked of their sending me conscience money is as grossly and completely false as the statement that i ever said anything to the effect that i could not be expected to have an interest in the american people and nothing can by any possibility be falser than that again and again in these pages all the year round i have expressed my interest in them you will see it in the childs history of england you will see it in the last preface to american notes every american who has ever spoken with me in london paris or where not knows whether i have frankly said you could have no better introduction to me than your country and for years and years when i have been asked about reading in america my invariable reply has been i have so many friends there and constantly receive so many earnest letters from personally unknown readers there that but for domestic reasons i would go tomorrow i think i must in the confidential intercourse between you and me have written you to this effect more than once  the statement of the london correspondent from beginning to end is false it is false in the letter and false in the spirit he may have been misinformed and the statement may not have originated with him with whomsoever it originated it never originated with me and consequently is false more than enough about it  as i hope to see you so soon my dear fields and as i am busily at work on the christmas number i will not make this a longer letter than i can help i thank you most heartily for your proffered hospitality and need not tell you that if i went to any friends house in america i would go to yours but the readings are very hard work and i think i cannot do better than observe the rule on that side of the atlantic which i observe on this of never under such circumstances going to a friends house but always staying at a hotel i am able to observe it here by being consistent and never breaking it if i am equally consistent there i can i hope offend no one  dolby sends his love to you and all his friends as i do and is girding up his loins vigorously                           ever my dear fields                                     heartily and affectionately yours   sidenote mr thornbury

remember reaches the readers of a printed and published statement  i told you some time ago that i believed the arsenic in eliza fennings case to have been administered by the apprentice i never was more convinced of anything in my life than of the girls innocence and i want words in which to express my indignation at the muddleheaded story of that parsonic blunderer whose audacity and conceit

it was a labour of love with him and i hold him in very high regard  dont give way to laziness and do proceed with that play there never was a time when a good new play was more wanted or had a better opening for itself fechter is a thorough artist and what he may sometimes want in personal force is compensated by the admirable whole he can make of a play and his perfect understanding of its presentation as a picture to the eye and mind  i leave london on the 8th of november early and sail from liverpool on the 9th                                              ever affectionately yours

interest and admiration and i need not say to you that the art of itthe fine constructionthe exquisite nicety of the toucheswith which it is wrought outhave been a study to me in the pursuit of which i have had extraordinary relish  taking the play as it stands i have nothing whatever to add to your notes and memoranda of the points to be touched again except that i have a little uneasiness in that burst of anger and inflexibility consequent on having been deceived coming out of hegio i see the kind of actor who must play hegio and i see that the audience will not believe in his doing anything so serious i suppose it would be impossible to get this effect out of the motheror through the mothers influence instead of out of the godfather of hegiopolis  now as to the classical ground and manners of the play i suppose the objection to the greek dress to be alreadyas defoe would write it gotten over by your suggestion i suppose the dress not to be conventionally associated with stilts and boredom but to be new to the public eye and very picturesque grant all thatthe names remain now not only used such names to be inseparable in the public mind from stately weariness but of late days they have become inseparable in the same public mind from silly puns upon the names and from burlesque you do not know i hope at least for my friends sake what the strand theatre is a greek name and a breakdown nigger dance have become inseparable there i do not mean to say that your genius may not be too powerful for such associations but i do most positively mean to say that you would lose half the play in overcoming them at the best you would have to contend against them through the first three acts the old tendency to become frozen on classical ground would be in the best part of the audience the new tendency to titter on such ground would be in the worst part and instead of starting fair with the audience it is my conviction that you would start with them against you and would have to win them over  furthermore with reference to your note to me on this head you take up a position with reference to poor dear talfourds ion which i altogether dispute it never was a popular play i say it derived a certain amount of outofdoors popularity from the circumstances under which and the man by whom it was written but i say that it never was a popular play on the stage and never made out a case of attraction there  as to changing the ground to russia let me ask you did you ever see the nouvelles russes of nicolas gogol translated into french by louis viardot there is a story among them called tarass boulla in which as it seems to me all the conditions you want for such transplantation are to be found so changed you would have the popular sympathy with the slave or serf or prisoner of war from the first but i do not think it is to be got save at great hazard and with lamentable waste of force on the ground the play now occupies  i shall keep this note until tomorrow to correct my conviction if i can see the least reason for correcting it but i feel very confident indeed that i cannot be shaken in it                                                                                                   saturday  i have thought it over again and have gone over the play again with an imaginary stage and actors before me and i am still of the same mind shall i keep the ms till you come to town                                  believe me ever affectionately yours   sidenote mr fechter                             parker house boston 3rd december 1867  my dear

triumphant last night at the lyceum  i hope to bring out our play89 with wallack in new york and to have it played in many other parts of the states i have sent to wilkie for models etc if i waited

letter and for its accompanying books i have a particular love for books of travel and shall wander into the wilds of america with great interest i have also received your charming sketch with great pleasure and admiration let me thank you for it heartily as a beautiful suggestion of nature associated with this country it shall have a quiet place on the walls of my house as long as i live  your reference to my dear friend washington irving renews the vivid impressions reawakened in my mind at baltimore the other day i saw his fine face for the last time in that city he came there from new york to pass a day or two with me before i went westward and they were made among the most memorable of my life by his delightful fancy and genial humour some unknown admirer of his books and mine sent to the hotel a most enormous mint julep wreathed with flowers we sat one on either side of it with great solemnity it filled a respectablesized paper but the solemnity was of very short duration it was quite an enchanted julep and carried us among innumerable people and places that we both knew the julep held out far into the night and my memory never saw him afterward otherwise than as bending over it with his straw with an attempted gravity after some anecdote involving some wonderfully droll and delicate observation of character and then as his eyes caught mine melting into that captivating laugh of his which was the brightest and best i have ever heard                           dear sir with many thanks faithfully yours   sidenote mrs pease

evening on which i can possibly read during the remainder of my stay in the states is arranged for and the fates divide me from the big woman with two smaller ones in tow so i send her my love to be shared in by the two smaller ones if she approvebut not otherwise and seriously assure her that her pleasant letter has been most welcome                                     dear madam faithfully your

have the earliest intelligence of me i begin this note today in my small cabin purposing if it should prove practicable to post it at queenstown for the return steamer  we are already past the banks of newfoundland although our course was seventy miles to the south with the view of avoiding ice seen by judkins in the scotia on his passage out to new york the russia is a magnificent ship and has dashed along bravely we had made more than thirteen hundred and odd miles at noon today the wind after being a little capricious rather threatens at the present time to turn against us but our run is already eighty miles ahead of the russias last run in this directiona very fast one    to all whom it may concern report the russia in the highest terms she rolls more easily than the other cunard screws is kept in perfect order and is most carefully looked after in all departments we have had nothing approaching to heavy weather still one can speak to the trim of the ship her captain a gentleman bright polite goodnatured and vigilant     as to me i am greatly better i hope i have got on my right boot today for the first time the true american seems to be turning faithless at last and i made a gads hill breakfast this morning as a further advance on having otherwise eaten and drunk all day ever since wednesday  you will see anthony trollope i daresay what was my amazement to see him with these eyes come aboard in the mail tender just before we started he had come out in the scotia just in time to dash off again in said tender to shake hands with me knowing me to be aboard here it was most heartily done he is on a special mission of convention with the united states postoffice  we have been picturing your movements and have duly checked off your journey home and have talked about you continually but i have thought about you both even much much more you will never know how i love you both or what you have been to me in america and will always be to me everywhere or how fervently i thank you  all the working of the ship seems to be done on my forehead it is scrubbed and holystoned my headnot the deck at three every morning it is scraped and swabbed all day eight pairs of heavy boots are now clattering on it getting the ship under sail again legions of ropesends are flopped upon it as i write and i must leave off with dolbys love                                                                                             thursday 30th  soon after i left off as above we had a gale of wind which blew all night for a few hours on the evening side of midnight there was no getting from this cabin of mine to the saloon or vice versâ so heavily did the sea break over the decks the ship however made nothing of it and we were all right again by monday afternoon except for a few hours yesterday when we had a very light headwind the weather has been constantly favourable and we are now bowling away at a great rate with a fresh breeze filling all our sails we expect to be at queenstown between midnight and three in the morning  i hope my dear fields you may find this legible but i rather doubt it for there is motion enough on the ship to render writing to a landsman however accustomed to pen and ink rather a difficult achievement besides which i slide away gracefully from the paper whenever i want to be particularly expressive      sitting opposite to me at breakfast always has the following items a large dish of porridge into which he casts slices of butter and a quantity of sugar two cups of tea a steak irish stew chutnee and marmalade another deputation of two has solicited a reading tonight illustrious novelist has unconditionally and absolutely declined more love and more to that from your ever affectionate friend   sidenote the same                          all the year round office may 15th 1868  my dear fields  i have found it so extremely difficult to write about america though never so briefly without appearing to blow trumpets on the one hand or to be inconsistent with my avowed determination not to write about it on the other that i have taken the simple course enclosed the number will be published on the 6th of june it appears to me to be the most modest and manly course and to derive some graceful significance from its title  thank my dear mrs fields for me for her delightful letter received on the 16th i will write to her very soon and tell her about the dogs i would write by this post but that wills absence in sussex and getting no better there as yet so overwhelms me with business that i can scarcely get through it  miss me ah my dear fellow but how do i miss you we talk about you both at gads hill every day of our lives and i never see the place looking very pretty indeed or hear the birds sing all day long and the nightingales all night without restlessly wishing that you were both there  with best love and truest and most enduring regard ever my dear fields                                                 your most affectionate     i hope you will receive by saturdays cunard a case containing  1 a trifling supply of the penknibs that suited your hand  2 a do of unfailing medicine for cockroaches  3 mrs gamp for   the case is addressed to you at bleecker street new york if it should be delayed for the knibs or nibs promised tomorrow and should be too late for the cunard packet it will in that case come by the next following inman steamer  everything here looks lovely and i find it you will be surprised to hear really a pretty place i have seen no thoroughfare twice excellent things in it but it drags to my thinking it is however a great success in the country and is now getting up with great force in paris fechter is ill and was ordered off to brighton yesterday wills is ill too and banished into sussex for perfect rest otherwise thank god i find everything well and thriving you and my dear mrs fields are constantly in my mind procter greatly better   sidenote mr fechter                             office of all the year round                                              friday 22nd may 1868  my dear fechter  i have an idea about the bedroom act which i should certainly have suggested if i had been at our repetitions here91 i want it done to the sound of the waterfall i want the sound of the waterfall louder and softer as the wind rises and falls to be spoken throughlike the music i want the waterfall listened to when spoken of and not looked out at the mystery and gloom of the scene would be greatly helped by this and it would be new and picturesquely fanciful  i am very anxious to hear from you how the piece seems to go92 and how the artists who are to act it seem to understand their parts pray tell me too when you write how you found madame fechter and give all our loves to all                                                    ever heartily yours   sidenote mrs james t fields                          gads hill higham by

miles off the two newfoundland dogs coming to meet me with the usual carriage and the usual driver and beholding me coming in my usual dress out at the usual door it struck me that their recollection of my having been absent for any unusual time was at once cancelled they behaved they are both young dogs exactly in their usual manner coming behind the basket phaeton as we trotted along and lifting their heads to have their ears pulleda special attention which they receive from no one else but when i drove into the stableyard linda the st bernard was greatly excited weeping profusely and throwing herself on her back that she might caress my foot with her great forepaws mamies little dog too mrs bouncer barked in the greatest agitation on being called down and asked by mamie who is this and tore round and round me like the dog in the faust outlines you must know that all the farmers turned out on the road in their marketchaises to say welcome home sir and that all the houses along the road were dressed with flags and that our servants to cut out the rest had dressed this house so that every brick of it was hidden they had asked mamies permission to ring the alarmbell  when master drove up but mamie having some slight idea that that compliment might awaken masters sense of the ludicrous had recommended bell abstinence but on sunday the village choir which includes the bellringers made amends after some unusually brief pious reflections in the crowns of their hats at the end of the sermon the ringers bolted out and rang like mad until i got home there had been a conspiracy among the villagers to take the horse out if i had come to our own station and draw me here mamie and georgy had got wind of it and warned me  divers birds sing here all day and the nightingales all night the place is lovely and in perfect order i have put five mirrors in the swiss châlet where i write and they reflect and refract in all kinds of ways the leaves that are quivering at the windows and the great fields of waving corn and the saildotted river my room is up among the branches of the trees and the birds and the butterflies fly in and out and the green branches shoot in at the open windows and the lights and shadows of the clouds come and go with the rest of the company the scent of the flowers and indeed of everything that is growing for miles and miles is most delicious  dolby who sends a world of messages found his wife much better than he expected and the children wonderful to relate perfect the little girl winds up her prayers every night with a special commendation to heaven of me and the ponyas if i must mount him to get there i dine with dolby i was going to write him but found it would look as if i were going to dine with the pony at greenwich this very day and if your ears do not burn from six to nine this evening then the atlantic is a nonconductor we are already settlingthink of thisthe details of my farewell course of readings i am brown beyond belief and cause the greatest disappointment in all quarters by looking so well it is really wonderful what those fine days at sea did for me my doctor was quite broken down in spirits when he saw me for the first time since my return last saturday good lord he said recoiling seven years younger  it is time i should explain the otherwise inexplicable enclosure will you tell fields with my love i suppose he hasnt used all the pens yet that i think there is in tremont street a set of my books sent out by chapman not arrived when i departed such set of the immortal works of our illustrious etc is designed for the gentleman to whom the enclosure is addressed if t f and co will kindly forward the set carriage paid with the enclosure to s address i will invoke new blessings on their heads and will get dolbys little daughter to mention them nightly  no thoroughfare is very shortly coming out in paris where it is now in active rehearsal it is still playing here but without fechter who has been very ill the doctors dismissal of him to paris however and his getting better there enables him to get up the play there he and wilkie missed so many pieces of stageeffect here that unless i am quite satisfied with his report i shall go over and try my stagemanagerial hand at the vaudeville theatre i particularly want the drugging and attempted robbing in the bedroom scene at the swiss inn to be done to the sound of a waterfall rising and falling with the wind although in the very opening of that scene they speak of the waterfall and listen to it nobody thought of its mysterious music i could make it with a good stagecarpenter in an hour  my dear love to fields once again same to you and him from mamie and georgy i cannot tell you both how i miss you or how overjoyed i should be to see you here                           ever my dear mrs fields                                         your most affectionate friend   sidenote mr alexander ireland                               the athenÆum saturday 30th may 1868  dear mr ireland  many thanks for the book93 you have kindly lent me my interest in its subject is scarcely less than your own and the book has afforded me great pleasure i hope it will prove a very useful tribute to hazlett and hunt in extending the general knowledge of their writings as well as a deservedly hearty and loving one  you gratify me much by your appreciation of my desire to promote the kindest feelings between england and america but the writer of the generous article in the manchester examiner is quite mistaken in supposing that i intend to write a book on the united states the fact is exactly the reverse or i could not have spoken without some appearance of having a purpose to serve                                                  very faithfully yours   sidenote mr james t fields                            gads hill place tuesday 7th july 1868  my dear fields  i have delayed writing to you and mrs fields to whom my love until i should have seen longfellow when he was in london the first time he came and went without reporting himself and left me in a state of unspeakable discomfiture indeed i should not have believed in his having been here at all if mrs procter had not told me of his calling to see procter however on his return he wrote to me from the langham hotel and i went up to town to see him and to make an appointment for his coming here he the girls and appleton came down last saturday night and stayed until monday forenoon i showed them all the neighbouring country that could be shown in so short a time and they finished off with a tour of inspection of the kitchens pantry winecellar pickles sauces servants sittingroom general household stores and even the cellar book of this illustrious establishment forster and kent the latter wrote certain verses to longfellow which have been published in the times and which i sent to d came down for a day and i hope we all had a really good time i turned out a couple of postillions in the old red jacket of the old red royal dover road for our ride and it was like a holiday ride in england fifty years ago of course we went to look at the old houses in rochester and the old cathedral and the old castle and the house for the six poor travellers who not being rogues or procters shall have lodging entertainment and four pence each  nothing can surpass the respect paid to longfellow here from the queen downward he is everywhere received and courted and finds as i told him he would when we talked of it in boston the workingmen at least as well acquainted with his books as the classes socially above them     last thursday i attended as sponsor the christening of dolbys son and heira most jolly baby who held on tight by the rectors left whisker while the service was performed what time too his little sister connecting me with the pony trotted up and down the centre aisle noisily driving herself as that celebrated animal so that it went very hard with the sponsorial dignity  wills is not yet recovered from that concussion of the brain and i have all his work to do this may account for my not being able to devise a christmas number but i seem to have left my invention in america in case you should find it please send it over i am going up to town today to dine with longfellow and now my dear fields you know all about me and mine  you are enjoying your holiday and are still thinking sometimes of our boston days as i do and are maturing schemes for coming here next summer a satisfactory reply to the last question is particularly entreated  i am delighted to find you both so well pleased with the blind book scheme94 i said nothing of it to you when we were together though i had made up my mind because i wanted to come upon you with that little burst from a distance it seemed something like meeting again when i remitted the money and thought of your talking of it  the dryness of the weather is amazing all the ponds and surfacewells about here are waterless and the poor people suffer greatly the people of this village have only one spring to resort to and it is a couple of miles from many cottages i do not let the great dogs swim in the canal because the people have to drink of it but when they get into the medway it is hard to get them out again the other day bumble the son newfoundland dog got into difficulties among some floating timber and became frightened don the father was standing by me shaking off the wet and looking on carelessly when all of a sudden he perceived something amiss and went in with a bound and brought bumble out by the ear the scientific way in which he towed him along was charming                                                       ever your loving   sidenote mr j e millais ra                gads hill place higham by rochester kent                                             sunday 19th july 1868  my dear millais95  i received the enclosed letter yesterday and i have perhaps unjustlysome vague suspicions of it as i know how faithful and zealous you have been in all relating to poor leech i make no apology for asking you whether you can throw any light upon its contents  you will be glad to hear that charles collins is decidedly better today and is out of doors                                    believe me always faithfully yours   sidenote mr serle                               gads hill wednesday 29th july 1868  my dear serle96  i do not believe there is the slightest chance of an international copyright law being passed in america for a long time to come some massachusetts men do believe in such a thing but they fail as i think to take into account the prompt western opposition  such an alteration as you suggest in the english law would give no copyright in america you see the american publisher could buy no absolute right of priority any american newspaper could and many would in a popular case pirate from him as soon as they could get the matter set up he could buy no more than he buys now when he arranges for advance sheets from england so that there may be simultaneous publication in the two countries and success in england is of so much importance towards the achievement of success in america that i greatly doubt whether previous publications in america would often be worth more to an american publisher or manager than simultaneous publication concerning the literary man in parliament who would undertake to bring in a bill for such an amendment of our copyright law with weight enough to keep his heart unbroken while he should be getting it through its various lingering miseries all i can say isi decidedly dont know him  on that horrible staplehurst day i had not the slightest idea that i knew anyone in the train out of my own compartment mrs cowden clarke97 wrote me afterwards telling me in the main what you tell me and i was astonished it is remarkable that my watch a special chronometer has never gone quite correctly since and to this day there sometimes comes over me on a railwayin a hansom cabor any sort of conveyancefor a few seconds a vague sense of dread that i have no power to check it comes and passes but i cannot prevent its coming                                    believe me always faithfully yours   sidenote mr rusden                                                    24th august 1868  my dear sir  i should have written to you much sooner but that i have been home from the united states barely three months and have since been a little uncertain as to the precise time and way of sending my youngest son out to join his brother alfred  it is now settled that he shall come out in the ship sussex 1000 tons belonging to messrs money wigram and co she sails from gravesend but he will join her at plymouth on the 27th september and will proceed straight to melbourne of this i apprise alfred by this mail    i cannot sufficiently thank you for your kindness to alfred i am certain that a becoming sense of it and desire to deserve it has done him great good  your report of him is an unspeakable comfort to me and i most heartily assure you of my gratitude and friendship  in the midst of your colonial seethings and heavings i suppose you have some leisure to consult equally the hopeful prophets and the dismal prophets who are all wiser than any of the rest of us as to things at home here my own strong impression is that whatsoever change the new reform bill may effect will be very gradual indeed and quite wholesome  numbers of the middle class who seldom or never voted before will vote now and the greater part of the new voters will in the main be wiser as to their electoral responsibilities and more seriously desirous to discharge them for the common good than the bumptious singers of rule britannia our dear old church of england and all the rest of it  if i can ever do anything for any accredited friend of yours coming to the old country command me i shall be truly glad of any opportunity of testifying that i do not use a mere form of words in signing myself

i am reading here and shall be through this week consequently i am only this morning in receipt of your kind note of the 10th forwarded from my own house  believe me i am as much obliged to you for your generous and ready response to my supposed letter as i should have been if i had really written it but i know nothing whatever of it or of miss jeffries except that i have a faint impression of having recently noticed that name among my beggingletter correspondents and of having associated it in my mind with a regular professional hand your caution has i hope disappointed this swindler but my testimony is at your service if you should need it and i would take any opportunity of bringing one of those vagabonds to punishment for they are one and all the most heartless and worthless vagabonds on the face of the earth                                           believe me faithfully yours   sidenote mrs james t fields                                glasgow wednesday december 16 1868  my dear mrs fields     first as you are curious about the oliver murder i will tell you about that trial of the same at which you ought to have assisted there were about a hundred people present in all i have changed my stage besides that back screen which you know so well there are two large screens of the same colour set off one on either side like the wings at a theatre and besides these again we have a quantity of curtains of the same colour with which to close in any width of room from wall to wall consequently the figure is now completely isolated and the slightest action becomes much more important this was used for the first time on the occasion but behind the stagethe orchestra being very large and built for the accommodation of a numerous chorusthere was ready on the level of the platform a very long table beautifully lighted with a large staff of men ready to open oysters and set champagnecorks flying directly i had done the screens being whisked off by my people there was disclosed one of the prettiest banquets you can imagine and when all the people came up and the gay dresses of the ladies were lighted by those powerful lights of mine the scene was exquisitely pretty the hall being newly decorated and very elegantly and the whole looking like a great bed of flowers and diamonds  now you must know that all this company were before the wine went round unmistakably pale and had horrorstricken faces next morning harness fields knowsrev williamdid an edition of shakespeareold friend of the kembles and mrs siddons writing to me about it and saying it was a most amazing and terrific thing added but i am bound to tell you that i had an almost irresistible impulse upon me to scream and that if anyone had cried out i am certain i should have followed he had no idea that on the night p the great ladies doctor had taken me aside and said my dear dickens you may rely upon it that if only one woman cries out when you murder the girl there will be a contagion of hysteria all over this place it is impossible to soften it without spoiling it and you may suppose that i am rather anxious to discover how it goes on the 5th of january we are afraid to announce it elsewhere without knowing except that i have thought it pretty safe to put it up once in dublin i asked mrs k the famous actress who was at the experiment what do you say do it or not why of course do it she replied having got at such an effect as that it must be done but rolling her large black eyes very slowly and speaking very distinctly the public have been looking out for a sensation these last fifty years or so and by heaven they have got it with which words and a long breath and a long stare she became speechless again you may suppose that i am a little anxious  not a day passes but dolby and i talk about you both and recall where we were at the corresponding time of last year my old likening of boston to edinburgh has been constantly revived within these last ten days there is a certain remarkable similarity of tone between the two places the audiences are curiously alike except that the edinburgh audience has a quicker sense of humour and is a little more genial no disparagement to boston in this because i consider an edinburgh audience perfect  i trust my dear eugenius that you have recognised yourself in a certain uncommercial and also some small reference to a name rather dear to you as an instance of how strangely something comic springs up in the midst of the direst misery look to a succeeding uncommercial called a small star in the east published today bythebye i have described with exactness the poor places into which i went and how the people behaved and what they said i was wretched looking on and yet the boilermaker and the poor man with the legs filled me with a sense of drollery not to be kept down by any pressure  the atmosphere of this place compounded of mists from the highlands and smoke from the town factories is crushing my eyebrows as i write and it rains as it never does rain anywhere else and always does rain here it is a dreadful place though much improved and possessing a deal of public spirit improvement is beginning to knock the old town of edinburgh about here and there but the canongate and the most picturesque of the horrible courts and wynds are not to be easily spoiled or made fit for the poor wretches who people them to live in edinburgh is so changed as to its notabilities that i had the only three men left of the wilson and jeffrey time to dine with me there last saturday  i think you will find fatal zero by percy fitzgerald a very curious analysis of a mind as the story advances a new beginner in a y r hon mrs clifford kinglakes sister who wrote a story in the series just finished called the abbots pool has just sent me another story i have a strong impression that with care she will step into mrs gaskells vacant place wills is no better and i have work enough even in that direction  god bless the woman with the black mittens for making me laugh so this morning i take her to be a kind of publicspirited mrs sparsit and as such take her to my bosom god bless you both my dear friends in this christmas and new year time and in all times seasons and places and send you to gads hill with the next flowers                                            ever your

you the forged letter and devoutly wish that i had to flog the writer in virtue of a legal sentence i most cordially reciprocate your kind expressions in reference to our future intercourse and shall hope to remind you of them five or six months hence when my present labours shall have gone the way of all other earthly things it was particularly interesting to me when i was last at boston to recognise poor dear feltons unaffected and genial ways in his eldest daughter and to notice how in tender remembrance of him she is as it were cambridges daughter                                    believe me always faithfully yours  footnotes  90 it was at baltimore that charles dickens first conceived the idea of a walkingmatch which should take place on his return to boston and he drew up a set of humorous articles  91 the play of no thoroughfare was produced at the adelphi theatre under the management of mr webster  92 mr fechter was at this time superintending the production of a french version of no thoroughfare in paris it was called labîme  93 the volume referred to is a list of the writings of william hazlett and leigh hunt chronologically arranged with notes descriptive critical and explanatory etc  94 a copy of the old curiosity shop in raised letters for the use of the blind had been printed by charles dickenss order at the perkins institution for the blind in boston and presented by him to that institution in this year  95 john everett millais ra the editors make use of this note as it is the only one which mr millais has been able to find for them and they are glad to have the two names associated together  96 a dramatic author who was acting manager of covent garden theatre in 1838 when his acquaintance with charles dickens first began this letter is in answer to some questions put to charles dickens by mr serle on the subject of the extension of copyright to the united states of america  97 mrs cowden clarke wrote to tell charles dickens that

thousand thanks for your note which has reached me here this afternoon at breakfast this morning dolby showed me the local paper with a paragraph in it recording poor dear tennents99 death you may imagine how shocked i was immediately before i left town this last time i had an unusually affectionate letter from him enclosing one from forster and proposing the friendly dinner since appointed for the 25th i replied to him in the same spirit and felt touched at the time by the gentle earnestness of his tone it is remarkable that i talked of him a great deal yesterday to dolby who knew nothing of him and that i reverted to him again at night before going to bedwith no reason that i know of dolby was strangely impressed by this when he showed me the newspaper  god be with us all

lost the tidings of his being very ill indeed had of course been reported to me for some days past i had taken up the newspaper with sad misgivings and this morning before i got your letter they were realised  i loved him truly his wonderful gentleness and kindness years ago when we had sickness in our household in paris has never been out of my grateful remembrance and socially his image is inseparable from some of the most genial and delightful friendly hours of my life i am almost ashamed to set such recollections by the side of your mothers great bereavement and grief but they spring out of the fulness of my heart  may god be with her and with you all                                              ever yours affectionately   sidenote mr james t fields                    adelphi

rochester castle and canterbury shall be fulfilled please god the red jackets shall turn out again upon the turnpikeroad and picnics among the cherryorchards and hopgardens shall be heard of in kent

and dolby specially charged him with the care of you and yours we shall be on the borders of wales and probably about hereford when you arrive dolby has insane projects of getting over here to meet you so amiably hopeful and obviously impracticable that i encourage him to the utmost the regular little captain of the russia cook is just now changed into the cuba whence arise disputes of seniority etc i wish he had been with you for i liked him very much when i was his passenger i like to think of your being in my ship   and  have been taking it by turns to be on the point of death and have been complimenting one another greatly on the fineness of the point attained my people got a very good impression of  and thought her a sincere and earnest little woman  the russia hauls out into the

queens ship donegal lying in the mersey have been told off to decorate st georges hall with the ships bunting they were all hanging on aloft upside down holding to the gigantically high roof by

nephew is to come and make the speech i dont envy the feelings of my noble friend when he sees the hall seriously it is less adapted to speaking than westminster abbey and is as large     i hope you will see fechter in a really clever piece by wilkie103 also you will see the academy exhibition which will be a very good one and also we will please god see everything and more and everything else after that i begin to doubt and fear on the subject of your having a horror of me after seeing the murder i dont think a hand moved while i was doing it last night or an eye looked away and there was a fixed expression of horror of me all over the theatre which could not have been surpassed if i had been going to be hanged to that red velvet table it is quite a new sensation to be execrated with that unanimity and i hope it will remain so  is it lawfulwould that woman in the black gaiters green veil and spectacles hold it soto send my love to the pretty m  pack up my dear fields and be quick

readingstonight is the seventyfourth out of one hundredand have barely time to send you a line to thank you most heartily for yours of the 30th january and for your great kindness to alfred and edward the latter wrote by the same mail on behalf of both expressing the warmest gratitude to you and reporting himself in the stoutest heart and hope i never can thank you sufficiently  you will see that the new ministry has made a decided hit with its budget and that in the matter of the irish church it has the country at its back you will also see that the reform league has dissolved itself indisputably because it became aware that the people did not want it  i think the general feeling in england is a desire to get the irish church out of the way of many social reforms and to have it done with as already done for i do not in the least believe myself that agrarian ireland is to be pacified by any such means or can have it got out of its mistaken head that the land is of right the peasantrys and that every man who owns land has stolen it and is therefore to be shot but that is not the question  the clock strikes posttime as i write and i fear to write more lest at this distance from london i should imperil the next mail                                                        cordially yours   sidenote mr thomas chappell                              office of all the year round                                               monday 3rd may 1869  my dear mr chappell  i am really touched by your letter i can most truthfully assure you that your part in the inconvenience of this mishap has given me much more concern than my own and that if i did not hope to have our london farewells yet i should be in a very gloomy condition on your account  pray do not suppose that you are to blame for my having done a little too mucha wild fancy indeed the simple fact is that the rapid railway travelling was stretched a hairs breadth too far and that i ought to have foreseen it for on the night before the last night of our reading in america when dolby was cheering me with a review of the success and the immediate prospect of the voyage home i told him to his astonishment i am too far gone and too worn out to realise anything but my own exhaustion believe me if i had to read but twice more instead of once i couldnt do it we were then just beyond our recent number and it was the travelling that i had felt throughout  the sharp precautionary remedy of stopping instantly was almost as instantly successful the other day i told dr watson that he had never seen me knocked out of time and that he had no idea of the rapidity with which i should come up again  just as three days repose on the atlantic steamer made me in my altered appearance the amazement of the captain so this last week has set me up thank god in the most wonderful manner the sense of exhaustion seems a dream already of course i shall train myself carefully nevertheless all through the summer and autumn  i beg to send my kind regards to mrs chappell and i shall hope to see her and you at teddington in the long bright days it would disappoint me indeed if a lasting friendship did not come of our business relations  in the spring i trust i shall be able to report to you that i am ready to take my farewells in london of this i am pretty certain that i never will take them at all unless with you on your own conditions  with an affectionate regard for you and your brother believe me always                                                  very faithfully yours   sidenote mr rusden

have reached you i begin with the true version of the case  i daresay i should have been very ill if i had not suddenly stopped my farewell readings when there were yet fiveandtwenty remaining to be given i was quite exhausted and was warned by the doctors to stop for the time instantly acting on the advice and going home into kent for rest i immediately began to recover and within a fortnight was in the brilliant condition in which i can nowthank godreport myself  i cannot thank you enough for your care of plorn i was quite prepared for his not settling down without a lurch or two i still hope that he may take to colonial life    in his letter to me about his leaving the station to which he got through your kindness he expresses his gratitude to you quite as strongly as if he had made a wonderful success and seems to have acquired no distaste for anything but the one individual of whom he wrote that betrayed letter but knowing the boy i want to try him fully  you know all our public news such as it is at least as well as i do many people here of whom i am one do not like the look of american matters  what i most fear is that the perpetual bluster of a party in the states will at last set the patient british back up and if our people begin to bluster too and there should come into existence an exasperating warparty on both sides there will be great danger of a dailywidening breach  the first shriek of the first engine that traverses the san francisco railroad from end to end will be a deathwarning to the disciples of jo smith the moment the mormon bubble gets touched by neighbours it will break similarly the red mans course is very nearly run a scalped stoker is the outward and visible sign of his utter extermination not quakers enough to reach from here to jerusalem will save him by the term of a single year  i dont know how it may be with you but it is the fashion here to be absolutely certain that the emperor of the french is fastened by providence and the fates on a throne of adamant expressly constructed for him since the foundations of the universe were laid  he knows better and so do the police of paris and both powers must be grimly entertained by the resolute british belief knowing what they have known and doing what they have done through the last ten years what victor hugo calls the dropcurtain behind which is constructing the great last act of the french revolution has been a little shaken at the bottom lately however one seems to see the feet of a rather large chorus getting ready  i enclose a letter for plorn to your care not knowing how to address him forgive me for so doing i write to alfred direct and believe me my dear mr rusden                                      yours faithfully and much

from here for rest and to recover his health and my son who occupies his place brought me this morning a story104 in ms with a request that i would read it i read it with extraordinary interest and was greatly surprised by its uncommon merit on asking whence it came i found that it came from you  you need not to be told after this that i accept it with more than readiness if you will allow me i will go over it with great care and very slightly touch it here and there i think it will require to be divided into three portions you shall have the proofs and i will publish it immediately i think so very highly of it that i will have special attention called to it in a separate advertisement i congratulate you most sincerely and heartily on having done a very special thing it will always stand apart in my mind from any other story i ever read i write with its impression newly and strongly upon me and feel absolutely sure that i am not mistaken                                    believe me

acland is most willingly accepted and shall come in to the next monthly part i shall make bold to condense him here and there according to my best idea of storytelling and particularly where he makes the speechand with the usual fault of being too long here and there i think you let the story out too muchprematurelyand this i hope to prevent artfully i think your title open to the same objection and therefore propose to substitute                           the disappearance                           of john acland  this will leave the reader in doubt whether he really was murdered until the

october 1869  my dear robert lytton  i am assured by a correspondent that john acland has been done before said correspondent has evidently read the storyand is almost confident in chamberss journal this is very unfortunate but of course cannot be helped there is always a possibility of such a malignant conjunction of stars when the story is a true one  in the case of a good storyas this isliable for years to be told at tableas this wasthere is nothing wonderful in such a mischance let us shuffle the cards as sancho says and begin again  you will of course understand that i do not tell you this by way of complaint indeed i should not have mentioned it at all but as an explanation to you of my reason for winding the story up which i have done today as expeditiously as possible you might otherwise have thought me on reading it as published a little hard on mr doilly i have not had time to direct search to be made in chamberss but as to the main part of the story having been printed somewhere i have not the faintest doubt and i believe my correspondent to be also right as to the where you could not help it any more than i could and therefore will not be troubled by it any more than i am  the more i get of your writing the better i shall be pleased                  do believe me to be as i am                                  your genuine admirer

rusden  this very day a great meeting is announced to come off in london as a demonstration in favour of a fenian amnesty no doubt its numbers and importance are ridiculously overestimated but i believe the gathering will turn out to be big enough to be a very serious obstruction in the london streets i have a great doubt whether such demonstrations ought to be allowed they are bad as a precedent and they unquestionably interfere with the general liberty and freedom of the subject  moreover the time must come when this kind of threat and defiance will have to be forcibly stopped and when the unreasonable toleration of it will lead to a sacrifice of life among the comparatively innocent lookerson that might have been avoided but for a false confidence on their part engendered in the damnable system of laisseraller you see how right we were you and i in our last correspondence on this head and how desperately unsatisfactory the condition of ireland is especially when considered with a reference to america the government has through mr gladstone just now spoken out boldly in reference to the desired amnesty so much the better for them or they would unquestionably have gone by the board still there is an uneasy feeling abroad that mr gladstone himself would grant this amnesty if he dared and that there is a great weakness in the rest of their irish policy and this feeling is very strong amongst the noisiest irish howlers meanwhile the newspapers go on arguing irish matters as if the irish were a reasonable people in which immense assumption i for one have not the smallest faith  again i have to thank you most heartily for your kindness to my two boys it is impossible to predict how plorn will settle down or come out of the effort to do so but he has unquestionably an affectionate nature and a certain romantic touch in him both of these qualities are i hope more impressible for good than for evil and i trust in god for the rest  the news of lord derbys death will reach you i suppose at about the same time as this letter a rash impetuous passionate man but a great loss for his party as a man of mind and mark i was staying last june with lord russellsix or seven years older but except for being rather deaf in wonderful preservation and brighter and more completely armed at all points than i have seen him these twenty years  as this need not be posted till friday i shall leave it open for a final word or two and am until then and then and always afterwards my dear mr rusden                                         your faithful and

madrid he is not long married to a charming lady and will be far better in spain than in the house of commons the ministry are now holding councils on the irish land tenure question which is the next difficulty they have to deal with as you know last sundays meeting was a preposterous failure still it brought together in the streets of london all the ruffian part of the population of london and that is a serious evil which any one of a thousand accidents might render mischievous there is no existing law however to stop these assemblages so that they keep moving while in the streets  the government was undoubtedly wrong when it considered it had the right to close hyde park that is now universally conceded  i write to alfred and plorn both by this mail they can never say enough of

                                    friday january 14th 1870  my dear fields  we live here opposite the marble arch in a charming house until the 1st of june and then return to gads the conservatory is completed and is a brilliant success but an expensive one  i should be quite ashamed of not having written to you and my dear mrs fields before now if i didnt know that you will both understand how occupied i am and how naturally when i put my papers away for the day i get up and fly i have a large room here with three fine windows overlooking the parkunsurpassable for airiness and cheerfulness  you saw the announcement of the death of poor dear harness the circumstances are curious he wrote to his old friend the dean of battle saying he would come to visit him on that day the day of his death the dean wrote back come next day instead as we are obliged to go out to dinner and you will be alone harness told his sister a little impatiently that he must go on the firstnamed day that he had made up his mind to go and must he had been getting himself ready for dinner and came to a part of the staircase whence two doors openedone upon another level passage one upon a flight of stone steps he opened the wrong door fell down the steps injured himself very severely and died in a few hours  you will knowi dontwhat fechters success is in america at the time of this present writing in his farewell performances at the princesss he acted very finely i thought the three first acts of his hamlet very much better than i had ever thought them beforeand i always thought very highly of them we gave him a foaming stirrup cup at gads hill  forster who has been ill with his bronchitis again thinks no 2 of the new book edwin drood a clincheri mean that word as his own expression for clincher there is a curious interest steadily working up to no 5 which requires a great deal of art and selfdenial i think also apart from character and picturesqueness that the young people are placed in a very novel situation so i hopeat nos 5 and 6 the story will turn upon an interest suspended until the end  i cant believe it and dont and wont but they say harrys twentyfirst birthday is next sunday i have entered him at the temple just now and if he dont get a fellowship at trinity hall when his time comes i shall be disappointed if in the present disappointed state of existence  i hope you may have met with the little touch of radicalism i gave them at birmingham in the words of buckle with pride i observe that it makes the regular political traders of all sorts perfectly mad such was my intentions as a grateful acknowledgment of having been misrepresented  i think mrs s prose very admirable but i dont believe it no i do not my conviction is that those islanders get frightfully bored by the islands and wish they had never set eyes upon them  charley collins has done a charming cover for the monthly part of the new book at the very earnest representations of millais and after having seen a great number of his drawings i am going to engage with a new man retaining of course c cs cover aforesaid107 katie has made some more capital portraits and is always improving  my dear mrs fields if he made proud by chairs and bloated by pictures does not give you my dear love let us conspire against him when you find him out and exclude him from all future confidences until then                                      ever affectionately yours and his   sidenote lord lytton                      5 hyde park place monday 14th february 1870  my dear lytton  i ought to have mentioned in my hurried note to you that my knowledge of the consultation108 in question only preceded yours by certain hours and that longman asked me if i would make the design known to you as he thought it might be a liberty to address you otherwise this i did therefore  the class of writers to whom you refer at the close of your note have no copyright and do not come within my case at all i quite agree with you as to their propensities and deserts  indeed i suppose in the main that there is very little difference between our opinions i do not think the present government worse than another and i think it better than another by the presence of mr gladstone but it appears to me that our system fails                                                             ever yours   sidenote mr frederic chapman                         5 hyde park place monday 14th march 1870  dear frederic chapman  mr fildes has been with me this morning and without complaining of  or expressing himself otherwise than as being obliged to him for his care in no 1 represents that there is a brotherstudent of his a woodengraver perfectly acquainted with his style and well understanding his meaning who would render him better  i have replied to him that there can be no doubt that he has a claim beyond dispute to our employing whomsoever he knows will present him in his best aspect therefore we must make the change the rather because the fellowstudent in question has engraved mr fildes most successful drawings hitherto                                                       faithfully yours   sidenote mr charles mackay                      office of all the year round                                          thursday 21st april 1870   my dear mackay  i have placed gods acre the prose paper the false friend has lingered because it seems to me that the idea is to be found in an introduced story of mine called the baron of grogzwig in pickwick  be pleasant with the scottish people in handling johnson because i love them                                                        ever faithfully   sidenote sir john bowring                                  gads hill thursday 5th may 1870  my dear sir john  i send you many cordial thanks for your note and the very curious drawing accompanying it i ought to tell you perhaps that the opium smoking i have described i saw exactly as i have described it penny inkbottle and all down in shadwell this last autumn a couple of the inspectors of lodginghouses knew the woman and took me to her as i was making a round with them to see for myself the working of lord shaftesburys bill                                    believe me always faithfully yours    sidenote mr j b buckstone                                          109sunday 15th may 1870  my dear buckstone  i send a duplicate of this note to the haymarket in case it should miss you out of town for a few years i have been liable at wholly uncertain and incalculable times to a severe attack of neuralgia in the foot about once in the course of a year it began in an injury to the finer muscles or nerves occasioned by overwalking in the deep snow when it comes on i cannot stand and can bear no covering whatever on the sensitive place one of these seizures is upon me now until it leaves me i could no more walk into st jamess hall than i could fly in the air i hope you will present my duty to the prince of wales and assure his royal highness that nothing short of my being most unfortunately disabled for the moment would have prevented my attending as trustee of the fund110 at the dinner and warmly expressing my poor sense of the great and inestimable service his royal highness renders to a most deserving institution by so kindly commending it to the public                                                faithfully yours always   sidenote mr rusden                             athenÆum friday evening 20th may 1870  my dear mr rusden  i received your most interesting and clearsighted letter about plorn just before the departure of the last mail from here to you i did not answer then because another incoming mail was nearly due and i expected knowing plorn so well that some communication from him such as he made to you would come to me i was not mistaken the same arguing of the squatter questionvegetables and allappeared this gave me an opportunity of touching on those points by this mail without in the least compromising you i cannot too completely express my concurrence with your excellent idea that his correspondence with you should be regarded as confidential just as i could not possibly suggest a word more neatly to the point or more thoughtfully addressed to such a young man than your reply to his letter i hope you will excuse my saying that it is a perfect model of tact good sense and good feeling i had been struck by his persistently ignoring the possibility of his holding any other position in australasia than his present position and had inferred from it a homeward tendency what is most curious to me is that he is very sensible and yet does not seem to understand that he has qualified himself for no public examinations in the old country and could not possibly hold his own against any competition for anything to which i could get him nominated  but i must not trouble you about my boys as if they were yours it is enough that i can never thank you for your goodness to them in a generous consideration of me  i believe the truth as to france to be that a citizen frenchman never forgives and that napoleon will never live down the coup détat this makes it enormously difficult for any welladvised english newspaper to support him and pretend not to know on what a volcano his throne is set informed as to his designs on the one hand and the perpetual uneasiness of his police on the other to say nothing of a doubtful army the times has a difficult game to play my own impression is that if it were played too boldly for him the old deplorable national antagonism would revive in his going down that the wind will pass over his imperiality on the sands of france i have not the slightest doubt in no country on the earth but least of all there can you seize people in their houses on political warrants and kill in the streets on no warrant at all without raising a gigantic nemesisnot very reasonable in detail perhaps but none the less terrible for that  the commonest dog or man driven mad is a much more alarming creature than the same individuality in a sober and commonplace condition  your friend   is setting the world right generally all round including the flattened ends the two poles and as a minister said to me the other day has the one little fault of omniscience  you will probably have read before now that i am going to be everything the queen can make me111 if my authority be worth anything believe on it that i am going to be nothing but what i am and that that includes my being as long as i live                                     your faithful and heartily obliged   sidenote mr alfred tennyson dickens                          athenÆum club friday night 20th may 1870  my dear alfred112  i have just time to tell you under my own hand that i invited mr bear to a dinner of such guests as he would naturally like to see and that we took to him very much and got on with him capitally  i am doubtful whether plorn is taking to australia can you find out his real mind i notice that he always writes as if his present life were the beall and the endall of his emigration and as if i had no idea of you two becoming proprietors and aspiring to the first positions in the colony without casting off the old connection  from mr bear i had the best accounts of you i told him that they did not surprise me for i had unbounded faith in you for which take my love and blessing  they will have told you all the news here and that i am hard at work this is not a letter so much as an assurance that i never think of you without hope and comfort                                     ever my dear alfred                                              your
