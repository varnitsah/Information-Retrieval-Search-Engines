45906111	the water babies     chapter i    i heard a thousand blended notes while in a grove i sate reclined in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts bring sad thoughts to the mind  to her fair works did nature link the human soul that through me ran and much it grieved my heart to think what man has made of man  wordsworth   once upon a time there was a little chimneysweep and his name was tom  that is a short name and you have heard it before so you will not have much trouble in remembering it  he lived in a great town in the north country where there were plenty of chimneys to sweep and plenty of money for tom to earn and his master to spend he could not read nor write and did not care to do either and he never washed himself for there was no water up the court where he lived  he had never been taught to say his prayers  he never had heard of god or of christ except in words which you never have heard and which it would have been well if he had never heard  he cried half his time and laughed the other half  he cried when he had to climb the dark flues rubbing his poor knees and elbows raw and when the soot got into his eyes which it did every day in the week and when his master beat him which he did every day in the week and when he had not enough to eat which happened every day in the week likewise  and he laughed the other half of the day when he was tossing halfpennies with the other boys or playing leapfrog over the posts or bowling stones at the horses legs as they trotted by which last was excellent fun when there was a wall at hand behind which to hide  as for chimneysweeping and being hungry and being beaten he took all that for the way of the world like the rain and snow and thunder and stood manfully with his back to it till it was over as his old donkey did to a hail storm and then shook his ears and was as jolly as ever and thought of the fine times coming when he would be a man and a master sweep and sit in the publichouse with a quart of beer and a long pipe and play cards for silver money and wear velveteens and anklejacks and keep a white bulldog with one gray ear and carry her puppies in his pocket just like a man  and he would have apprentices one two three if he could  how he would bully them and knock them about just as his master did to him and make them carry home the soot sacks while he rode before them on his donkey with a pipe in his mouth and a flower in his buttonhole like a king at the head of his army  yes there were good times coming and when his master let him have a pull at the leavings of his beer tom was the jolliest boy in the whole town  one day a smart little groom rode into the court where tom lived tom was just hiding behind a wall to heave half a brick at his horses legs as is the custom of that country when they welcome strangers but the groom saw him and halloed to him to know where mr grimes the chimneysweep lived  now mr grimes was toms own master and tom was a good man of business and always civil to customers so he put the halfbrick down quietly behind the wall and proceeded to take orders  mr grimes was to come up next morning to sir john harthovers at the place for his old chimneysweep was gone to prison and the chimneys wanted sweeping  and so he rode away not giving tom time to ask what the sweep had gone to prison for which was a matter of interest to tom as he had been in prison once or twice himself moreover the groom looked so very neat and clean with his drab gaiters drab breeches drab jacket snowwhite tie with a smart pin in it and clean round ruddy face that tom was offended and disgusted at his appearance and considered him a stuckup fellow who gave himself airs because he wore smart clothes and other people paid for them and went behind the wall to fetch the half brick after all but did not remembering that he had come in the way of business and was as it were under a flag of truce  his master was so delighted at his new customer that he knocked tom down out of hand and drank more beer that night than he usually did in two in order to be sure of getting up in time next morning for the more a mans head aches when he wakes the more glad he is to turn out and have a breath of fresh air  and when he did get up at four the next morning he knocked tom down again in order to teach him as young gentlemen used to be taught at public schools that he must be an extra good boy that day as they were going to a very great house and might make a very good thing of it if they could but give satisfaction  and tom thought so likewise and indeed would have done and behaved his best even without being knocked down  for of all places upon earth harthover place which he had never seen was the most wonderful and of all men on earth sir john whom he had seen having been sent to gaol by him twice was the most awful  harthover place was really a grand place even for the rich north country with a house so large that in the framebreaking riots which tom could just remember the duke of wellington and ten thousand soldiers to match were easily housed therein at least so tom believed with a park full of deer which tom believed to be monsters who were in the habit of eating children with miles of gamepreserves in which mr grimes and the collier lads poached at times on which occasions tom saw pheasants and wondered what they tasted like with a noble salmonriver in which mr grimes and his friends would have liked to poach but then they must have got into cold water and that they did not like at all  in short harthover was a grand place and sir john a grand old man whom even mr grimes respected for not only could he send mr grimes to prison when he deserved it as he did once or twice a week not only did he own all the land about for miles not only was he a jolly honest sensible squire as ever kept a pack of hounds who would do what he thought right by his neighbours as well as get what he thought right for himself but what was more he weighed full fifteen stone was nobody knew how many inches round the chest and could have thrashed mr grimes himself in fair fight which very few folk round there could do and which my dear little boy would not have been right for him to do as a great many things are not which one both can do and would like very much to do  so mr grimes touched his hat to him when he rode through the town and called him a buirdly awd chap and his young ladies gradely lasses which are two high compliments in the north country and thought that that made up for his poaching sir johns pheasants whereby you may perceive that mr grimes had not been to a properlyinspected government national school  now i dare say you never got up at three oclock on a midsummer morning  some people get up then because they want to catch salmon and some because they want to climb alps and a great many more because they must like tom  but i assure you that three oclock on a midsummer morning is the pleasantest time of all the twentyfour hours and all the three hundred and sixtyfive days and why every one does not get up then i never could tell save that they are all determined to spoil their nerves and their complexions by doing all night what they might just as well do all day  but tom instead of going out to dinner at halfpast eight at night and to a ball at ten and finishing off somewhere between twelve and four went to bed at seven when his master went to the publichouse and slept like a dead pig for which reason he was as piert as a gamecock who always gets up early to wake the maids and just ready to get up when the fine gentlemen and ladies were just ready to go to bed  so he and his master set out grimes rode the donkey in front and tom and the brushes walked behind out of the court and up the street past the closed windowshutters and the winking weary policemen and the roofs all shining gray in the gray dawn  they passed through the pitmens village all shut up and silent now and through the turnpike and then the were out in the real country and plodding along the black dusty road between black slag walls with no sound but the groaning and thumping of the pit engine in the next field  but soon the road grew white and the walls likewise and at the walls foot grew long grass and gay flowers all drenched with dew and instead of the groaning of the pitengine they heard the skylark saying his matins high up in the air and the pitbird warbling in the sedges as he had warbled all night long  all else was silent  for old mrs earth was still fast asleep and like many pretty people she looked still prettier asleep than awake  the great elmtrees in the goldgreen meadows were fast asleep above and the cows fast asleep beneath them nay the few clouds which were about were fast asleep likewise and so tired that they had lain down on the earth to rest in long white flakes and bars among the stems of the elmtrees and along the tops of the alders by the stream waiting for the sun to bid them rise and go about their days business in the clear blue overhead  on they went and tom looked and looked for he never had been so far into the country before and longed to get over a gate and pick buttercups and look for birds nests in the hedge but mr grimes was a man of business and would not have heard of that  soon they came up with a poor irishwoman trudging along with a bundle at her back  she had a gray shawl over her head and a crimson madder petticoat so you may be sure she came from galway she had neither shoes nor stockings and limped along as if she were tired and footsore but she was a very tall handsome woman with bright gray eyes and heavy black hair hanging about her cheeks  and she took mr grimes fancy so much that when he came alongside he called out to her  this is a hard road for a gradely foot like that  will ye up lass and ride behind me  but perhaps she did not admire mr grimes look and voice for she answered quietly  no thank you  id sooner walk with your little lad here  you may please yourself growled grimes and went on smoking  so she walked beside tom and talked to him and asked him where he lived and what he knew and all about himself till tom thought he had never met such a pleasantspoken woman  and she asked him at last whether he said his prayers and seemed sad when he told her that he knew no prayers to say  then he asked her where she lived and she said far away by the sea  and tom asked her about the sea and she told him how it rolled and roared over the rocks in winter nights and lay still in the bright summer days for the children to bathe and play in it and many a story more till tom longed to go and see the sea and bathe in it likewise  at last at the bottom of a hill they came to a spring not such a spring as you see here which soaks up out of a white gravel in the bog among red flycatchers and pink bottleheath and sweet white orchis nor such a one as you may see too here which bubbles up under the warm sandbank in the hollow lane by the great tuft of lady ferns and makes the sand dance reels at the bottom day and night all the year round not such a spring as either of those but a real north country limestone fountain like one of those in sicily or greece where the old heathen fancied the nymphs sat cooling themselves the hot summers day while the shepherds peeped at them from behind the bushes  out of a low cave of rock at the foot of a limestone crag the great fountain rose quelling and bubbling and gurgling so clear that you could not tell where the water ended and the air began and ran away under the road a stream large enough to turn a mill among blue geranium and golden globeflower and wild raspberry and the birdcherry with its tassels of snow  and there grimes stopped and looked and tom looked too  tom was wondering whether anything lived in that dark cave and came out at night to fly in the meadows  but grimes was not wondering at all without a word he got off his donkey and clambered over the low road wall and knelt down and began dipping his ugly head into the springand very dirty he made it  tom was picking the flowers as fast as he could  the irishwoman helped him and showed him how to tie them up and a very pretty nosegay they had made between them  but when he saw grimes actually wash he stopped quite astonished and when grimes had finished and began shaking his ears to dry them he said  why master i never saw you do that before  nor will again most likely  twasnt for cleanliness i did it but for coolness  id be ashamed to want washing every week or so like any smutty collier lad  i wish i might go and dip my head in said poor little tom  it must be as good as putting it under the townpump and there is no beadle here to drive a chap away  thou come along said grimes what dost want with washing thyself  thou did not drink half a gallon of beer last night like me  i dont care for you said naughty tom and ran down to the stream and began washing his face  grimes was very sulky because the woman preferred toms company to his so he dashed at him with horrid words and tore him up from his knees and began beating him  but tom was accustomed to that and got his head safe between mr grimes legs and kicked his shins with all his might  are you not ashamed of yourself thomas grimes cried the irishwoman over the wall  grimes looked up startled at her knowing his name but all he answered was no nor never was yet and went on beating tom  true for you  if you ever had been ashamed of yourself you would have gone over into vendale long ago  what do you know about vendale shouted grimes but he left off beating tom  i know about vendale and about you too  i know for instance what happened in aldermire copse by night two years ago come martinmas  you do shouted grimes and leaving tom he climbed up over the wall and faced the woman  tom thought he was going to strike her but she looked him too full and fierce in the face for that  yes i was there said the irishwoman quietly  you are no irishwoman by your speech said grimes after many bad words  never mind who i am  i saw what i saw and if you strike that boy again i can tell what i know  grimes seemed quite cowed and got on his donkey without another word  stop said the irishwoman  i have one more word for you both for you will both see me again before all is over  those that wish to be clean clean they will be and those that wish to be foul foul they will be  remember  and she turned away and through a gate into the meadow  grimes stood still a moment like a man who had been stunned  then he rushed after her shouting you come back  but when he got into the meadow the woman was not there  had she hidden away  there was no place to hide in  but grimes looked about and tom also for he was as puzzled as grimes himself at her disappearing so suddenly but look where they would she was not there  grimes came back again as silent as a post for he was a little frightened and getting on his donkey filled a fresh pipe and smoked away leaving tom in peace  and now they had gone three miles and more and came to sir johns lodgegates  very grand lodges they were with very grand iron gates and stone gateposts and on the top of each a most dreadful bogy all teeth horns and tail which was the crest which sir johns ancestors wore in the wars of the roses and very prudent men they were to wear it for all their enemies must have run for their lives at the very first sight of them  grimes rang at the gate and out came a keeper on the spot and opened  i was told to expect thee he said  now thoult be so good as to keep to the main avenue and not let me find a hare or a rabbit on thee when thou comest back  i shall look sharp for one i tell thee  not if its in the bottom of the sootbag quoth grimes and at that he laughed and the keeper laughed and said  if thats thy sort i may as well walk up with thee to the hall  i think thou best had  its thy business to see after thy game man and not mine  so the keeper went with them and to toms surprise he and grimes chatted together all the way quite pleasantly  he did not know that a keeper is only a poacher turned outside in and a poacher a keeper turned inside out  they walked up a great lime avenue a full mile long and between their stems tom peeped trembling at the horns of the sleeping deer which stood up among the ferns  tom had never seen such enormous trees and as he looked up he fancied that the blue sky rested on their heads  but he was puzzled very much by a strange murmuring noise which followed them all the way  so much puzzled that at last he took courage to ask the keeper what it was  he spoke very civilly and called him sir for he was horribly afraid of him which pleased the keeper and he told him that they were the bees about the lime flowers  what are bees asked tom  what make honey  what is honey asked tom  thou hold thy noise said grimes  let the boy be said the keeper  hes a civil young chap now and thats more than hell be long if he bides with thee  grimes laughed for he took that for a compliment  i wish i were a keeper said tom to live in such a beautiful place and wear green velveteens and have a real dogwhistle at my button like you  the keeper laughed he was a kindhearted fellow enough  let well alone lad and ill too at times  thy lifes safer than mine at all events eh mr grimes  and grimes laughed again and then the two men began talking quite low  tom could hear though that it was about some poaching fight and at last grimes said surlily hast thou anything against me  not now  then dont ask me any questions till thou hast for i am a man of honour  and at that they both laughed again and thought it a very good joke  and by this time they were come up to the great iron gates in front of the house and tom stared through them at the rhododendrons and azaleas which were all in flower and then at the house itself and wondered how many chimneys there were in it and how long ago it was built and what was the mans name that built it and whether he got much money for his job  these last were very difficult questions to answer  for harthover had been built at ninety different times and in nineteen different styles and looked as if somebody had built a whole street of houses of every imaginable shape and then stirred them together with a spoon   for the attics were anglosaxon the third door norman the second cinquecento the firstfloor elizabethan the right wing pure doric the centre early english with a huge portico copied from the parthenon the left wing pure boeotian which the country folk admired most of all became it was just like the new barracks in the town only three times as big the grand staircase was copied from the catacombs at rome the back staircase from the tajmahal at agra  this was built by sir johns greatgreatgreatuncle who won in lord clives indian wars plenty of money plenty of wounds and no more taste than his betters the cellars were copied from the caves of elephanta the offices from the pavilion at brighton   and the rest from nothing in heaven or earth or under the earth  so that harthover house was a great puzzle to antiquarians and a thorough naboths vineyard to critics and architects and all persons who like meddling with other mens business and spending other mens money  so they were all setting upon poor sir john year after year and trying to talk him into spending a hundred thousand pounds or so in building to please them and not himself but he always put them off like a canny northcountryman as he was  one wanted him to build a gothic house but he said he was no goth and another to build an elizabethan but he said he lived under good queen victoria and not good queen bess and another was bold enough to tell him that his house was ugly but he said he lived inside it and not outside and another that there was no unity in it but he said that that was just why he liked the old place  for he liked to see how each sir john and sir hugh and sir ralph and sir randal had left his mark upon the place each after his own taste and he had no more notion of disturbing his ancestors work than of disturbing their graves  for now the house looked like a real live house that had a history and had grown and grown as the world grew and that it was only an upstart fellow who did not know who his own grandfather was who would change it for some spick and span new gothic or elizabethan thing which looked as if it bad been all spawned in a night as mushrooms are from which you may collect if you have wit enough that sir john was a very soundheaded soundhearted squire and just the man to keep the country side in order and show good sport with his hounds  but tom and his master did not go in through the great iron gates as if they had been dukes or bishops but round the back way and a very long way round it was and into a little backdoor where the ashboy let them in yawning horribly and then in a passage the housekeeper met them in such a flowered chintz dressinggown that tom mistook her for my lady herself and she gave grimes solemn orders about you will take care of this and take care of that as if he was going up the chimneys and not tom  and grimes listened and said every now and then under his voice youll mind that you little beggar and tom did mind all at least that he could  and then the housekeeper turned them into a grand room all covered up in sheets of brown paper and bade them begin in a lofty and tremendous voice and so after a whimper or two and a kick from his master into the grate tom went and up the chimney while a housemaid stayed in the room to watch the furniture to whom mr grimes paid many playful and chivalrous compliments but met with very slight encouragement in return  how many chimneys tom swept i cannot say but he swept so many that he got quite tired and puzzled too for they were not like the town flues to which he was accustomed but such as you would find if you would only get up them and look which perhaps you would not like to doin old countryhouses large and crooked chimneys which had been altered again and again till they ran one into another anastomosing as professor owen would say considerably so tom fairly lost his way in them not that he cared much for that though he was in pitchy darkness for he was as much at home in a chimney as a mole is underground but at last coming down as he thought the right chimney he came down the wrong one and found himself standing on the hearthrug in a room the like of which he had never seen before  tom had never seen the like  he had never been in gentlefolks rooms but when the carpets were all up and the curtains down and the furniture huddled together under a cloth and the pictures covered with aprons and dusters and he had often enough wondered what the rooms were like when they were all ready for the quality to sit in  and now he saw and he thought the sight very pretty  the room was all dressed in whitewhite windowcurtains white bedcurtains white furniture and white walls with just a few lines of pink here and there  the carpet was all over gay little flowers and the walls were hung with pictures in gilt frames which amused tom very much  there were pictures of ladies and gentlemen and pictures of horses and dogs  the horses he liked but the dogs he did not care for much for there were no bulldogs among them not even a terrier  but the two pictures which took his fancy most were one a man in long garments with little children and their mothers round him who was laying his hand upon the childrens heads  that was a very pretty picture tom thought to hang in a ladys room  for he could see that it was a ladys room by the dresses which lay about  the other picture was that of a man nailed to a cross which surprised tom much  he fancied that he had seen something like it in a shopwindow  but why was it there  poor man thought tom and he looks so kind and quiet  but why should the lady have such a sad picture as that in her room  perhaps it was some kinsman of hers who had been murdered by the savages in foreign parts and she kept it there for a remembrance  and tom felt sad and awed and turned to look at something else  the next thing he saw and that too puzzled him was a washing stand with ewers and basins and soap and brushes and towels and a large bath full of clean waterwhat a heap of things all for washing  she must be a very dirty lady thought tom by my masters rule to want as much scrubbing as all that  but she must be very cunning to put the dirt out of the way so well afterwards for i dont see a speck about the room not even on the very towels  and then looking toward the bed he saw that dirty lady and held his breath with astonishment  under the snowwhite coverlet upon the snowwhite pillow lay the most beautiful little girl that tom had ever seen  her cheeks were almost as white as the pillow and her hair was like threads of gold spread all about over the bed  she might have been as old as tom or maybe a year or two older but tom did not think of that he thought only of her delicate skin and golden hair and wondered whether she was a real live person or one of the wax dolls he had seen in the shops  but when he saw her breathe he made up his mind that she was alive and stood staring at her as if she had been an angel out of heaven  no  she cannot be dirty  she never could have been dirty thought tom to himself  and then he thought and are all people like that when they are washed  and he looked at his own wrist and tried to rub the soot off and wondered whether it ever would come off certainly i should look much prettier then if i grew at all like her  and looking round he suddenly saw standing close to him a little ugly black ragged figure with bleared eyes and grinning white teeth  he turned on it angrily  what did such a little black ape want in that sweet young ladys room  and behold it was himself reflected in a great mirror the like of which tom had never seen before  and tom for the first time in his life found out that he was dirty and burst into tears with shame and anger and turned to sneak up the chimney again and hide and upset the fender and threw the fireirons down with a noise as of ten thousand tin kettles tied to ten thousand mad dogs tails  up jumped the little white lady in her bed and seeing tom screamed as shrill as any peacock  in rushed a stout old nurse from the next room and seeing tom likewise made up her mind that he had come to rob plunder destroy and burn and dashed at him as he lay over the fender so fast that she caught him by the jacket  but she did not hold him  tom had been in a policemans hands many a time and out of them too what is more and he would have been ashamed to face his friends for ever if he had been stupid enough to be caught by an old woman so he doubled under the good ladys arm across the room and out of the window in a moment  he did not need to drop out though he would have done so bravely enough  nor even to let himself down a spout which would have been an old game to him for once he got up by a spout to the church roof he said to take jackdaws eggs but the policeman said to steal lead and when he was seen on high sat there till the sun got too hot and came down by another spout leaving the policemen to go back to the stationhouse and eat their dinners  but all under the window spread a tree with great leaves and sweet white flowers almost as big as his head  it was magnolia i suppose but tom knew nothing about that and cared less for down the tree he went like a cat and across the garden lawn and over the iron railings and up the park towards the wood leaving the old nurse to scream murder and fire at the window  the under gardener mowing saw tom and threw down his scythe caught his leg in it and cut his shin open whereby he kept his bed for a week but in his hurry he never knew it and gave chase to poor tom  the dairymaid heard the noise got the churn between her knees and tumbled over it spilling all the cream and yet she jumped up and gave chase to tom  a groom cleaning sir johns hack at the stables let him go loose whereby he kicked himself lame in five minutes but he ran out and gave chase to tom  grimes upset the sootsack in the newgravelled yard and spoilt it all utterly but he ran out and gave chase to tom  the old steward opened the parkgate in such a hurry that he hung up his ponys chin upon the spikes and for aught i know it hangs there still but he jumped off and gave chase to tom  the ploughman left his horses at the headland and one jumped over the fence and pulled the other into the ditch plough and all but he ran on and gave chase to tom the keeper who was taking a stoat out of a trap let the stoat go and caught his own finger but he jumped up and ran after tom and considering what he said and how he looked i should have been sorry for tom if he had caught him  sir john looked out of his study window for he was an early old gentleman and up at the nurse and a marten dropped mud in his eye so that he had at last to send for the doctor and yet he ran out and gave chase to tom the irishwoman too was walking up to the house to begshe must have got round by some bywaybut she threw away her bundle and gave chase to tom likewise  only my lady did not give chase for when she had put her head out of the window her nightwig fell into the garden and she had to ring up her ladysmaid and send her down for it privately which quite put her out of the running so that she came in nowhere and is consequently not placed  in a word never was there heard at hall placenot even when the fox was killed in the conservatory among acres of broken glass and tons of smashed flowerpotssuch a noise row hubbub babel shindy hullabaloo stramash charivari and total contempt of dignity repose and order as that day when grimes gardener the groom the dairymaid sir john the steward the ploughman the keeper and the irishwoman all ran up the park shouting stop thief in the belief that tom had at least a thousand pounds worth of jewels in his empty pockets and the very magpies and jays followed tom up screaking and screaming as if he were a hunted fox beginning to droop his brush  and all the while poor tom paddled up the park with his little bare feet like a small black gorilla fleeing to the forest  alas for him there was no big father gorilla therein to take his partto scratch out the gardeners inside with one paw toss the dairymaid into a tree with another and wrench off sir johns head with a third while he cracked the keepers skull with his teeth as easily as if it had been a cocoanut or a pavingstone  however tom did not remember ever having had a father so he did not look for one and expected to have to take care of himself while as for running he could keep up for a couple of miles with any stagecoach if there was the chance of a copper or a cigar end and turn coachwheels on his hands and feet ten times following which is more than you can do  wherefore his pursuers found it very difficult to catch him and we will hope that they did not catch him at all  tom of course made for the woods  he had never been in a wood in his life but he was sharp enough to know that he might hide in a bush or swarm up a tree and altogether had more chance there than in the open  if he had not known that he would have been foolisher than a mouse or a minnow  but when he got into the wood he found it a very different sort of place from what he had fancied  he pushed into a thick cover of rhododendrons and found himself at once caught in a trap  the boughs laid hold of his legs and arms poked him in his face and his stomach made him shut his eyes tight though that was no great loss for he could not see at best a yard before his nose and when he got through the rhododendrons the hassockgrass and sedges tumbled him over and cut his poor little fingers afterwards most spitefully the birches birched him as soundly as if he had been a nobleman at eton and over the face too which is not fair swishing as all brave boys will agree and the lawyers tripped him up and tore his shins as if they had sharks teethwhich lawyers are likely enough to have  i must get out of this thought tom or i shall stay here till somebody comes to help mewhich is just what i dont want  but how to get out was the difficult matter  and indeed i dont think he would ever have got out at all but have stayed there till the cockrobins covered him with leaves if he had not suddenly run his head against a wall  now running your head against a wall is not pleasant especially if it is a loose wall with the stones all set on edge and a sharp cornered one hits you between the eyes and makes you see all manner of beautiful stars  the stars are very beautiful certainly but unfortunately they go in the twentythousandth part of a split second and the pain which comes after them does not  and so tom hurt his head but he was a brave boy and did not mind that a penny  he guessed that over the wall the cover would end and up it he went and over like a squirrel  and there he was out on the great grousemoors which the country folk called harthover fellheather and bog and rock stretching away and up up to the very sky  now tom was a cunning little fellowas cunning as an old exmoor stag  why not  though he was but ten years old he had lived longer than most stags and had more wits to start with into the bargain  he knew as well as a stag that if he backed he might throw the hounds out  so the first thing he did when he was over the wall was to make the neatest double sharp to his right and run along under the wall for nearly half a mile  whereby sir john and the keeper and the steward and the gardener and the ploughman and the dairymaid and all the hue andcry together went on ahead half a mile in the very opposite direction and inside the wall leaving him a mile off on the outside while tom heard their shouts die away in the woods and chuckled to himself merrily  at last he came to a dip in the land and went to the bottom of it and then he turned bravely away from the wall and up the moor for he knew that he had put a hill between him and his enemies and could go on without their seeing him  but the irishwoman alone of them all had seen which way tom went she had kept ahead of every one the whole time and yet she neither walked nor ran  she went along quite smoothly and gracefully while her feet twinkled past each other so fast that you could not see which was foremost till every one asked the other who the strange woman was and all agreed for want of anything better to say that she must be in league with tom  but when she came to the plantation they lost sight of her and they could do no less  for she went quietly over the wall after tom and followed him wherever he went  sir john and the rest saw no more of her and out of sight was out of mind  and now tom was right away into the heather over just such a moor as those in which you have been bred except that there were rocks and stones lying about everywhere and that instead of the moor growing flat as he went upwards it grew more and more broken and hilly but not so rough but that little tom could jog along well enough and find time too to stare about at the strange place which was like a new world to him  he saw great spiders there with crowns and crosses marked on their backs who sat in the middle of their webs and when they saw tom coming shook them so fast that they became invisible  then he saw lizards brown and gray and green and thought they were snakes and would sting him but they were as much frightened as he and shot away into the heath  and then under a rock he saw a pretty sighta great brown sharpnosed creature with a white tag to her brush and round her four or five smutty little cubs the funniest fellows tom ever saw  she lay on her back rolling about and stretching out her legs and head and tail in the bright sunshine and the cubs jumped over her and ran round her and nibbled her paws and lugged her about by the tail and she seemed to enjoy it mightily  but one selfish little fellow stole away from the rest to a dead crow close by and dragged it off to hide it though it was nearly as big as he was  whereat all his little brothers set off after him in full cry and saw tom and then all ran back and up jumped mrs vixen and caught one up in her mouth and the rest toddled after her and into a dark crack in the rocks and there was an end of the show  and next he had a fright for as he scrambled up a sandy brow whirrpoofpoofcockcockkicksomething went off in his face with a most horrid noise  he thought the ground had blown up and the end of the world come  and when he opened his eyes for he shut them very tight it was only an old cockgrouse who had been washing himself in sand like an arab for want of water and who when tom had all but trodden on him jumped up with a noise like the express train leaving his wife and children to shift for themselves like an old coward and went off screaming curruuuck curruuuckmurder thieves firecuruuckcockkickthe end of the world is comekickkick cockkick  he was always fancying that the end of the world was come when anything happened which was farther off than the end of his own nose  but the end of the world was not come any more than the twelfth of august was though the old grousecock was quite certain of it  so the old grouse came back to his wife and family an hour afterwards and said solemnly cockcockkick my dears the end of the world is not quite come but i assure you it is coming the day after tomorrowcock  but his wife had heard that so often that she knew all about it and a little more  and besides she was the mother of a family and had seven little poults to wash and feed every day and that made her very practical and a little sharptempered so all she answered was  kickkickkickgo and catch spiders go and catch spiderskick  so tom went on and on he hardly knew why but he liked the great wide strange place and the cool fresh bracing air  but he went more and more slowly as he got higher up the hill for now the ground grew very bad indeed  instead of soft turf and springy heather he met great patches of flat limestone rock just like illmade pavements with deep cracks between the stones and ledges filled with ferns so he had to hop from stone to stone and now and then he slipped in between and hurt his little bare toes though they were tolerably tough ones but still he would go on and up he could not tell why  what would tom have said if he had seen walking over the moor behind him the very same irishwoman who had taken his part upon the road  but whether it was that he looked too little behind him or whether it was that she kept out of sight behind the rocks and knolls he never saw her though she saw him  and now he began to get a little hungry and very thirsty for he had run a long way and the sun had risen high in heaven and the rock was as hot as an oven and the air danced reels over it as it does over a limekiln till everything round seemed quivering and melting in the glare  but he could see nothing to eat anywhere and still less to drink  the heath was full of bilberries and whimberries but they were only in flower yet for it was june  and as for water who can find that on the top of a limestone rock  now and then he passed by a deep dark swallowhole going down into the earth as if it was the chimney of some dwarfs house underground and more than once as he passed he could hear water falling trickling tinkling many many feet below  how he longed to get down to it and cool his poor baked lips  but brave little chimneysweep as he was he dared not climb down such chimneys as those  so he went on and on till his head spun round with the heat and he thought he heard churchbells ringing a long way off  ah he thought where there is a church there will be houses and people and perhaps some one will give me a bit and a sup  so he set off again to look for the church for he was sure that he heard the bells quite plain  and in a minute more when he looked round he stopped again and said why what a big place the world is  and so it was for from the top of the mountain he could seewhat could he not see  behind him far below was harthover and the dark woods and the shining salmon river and on his left far below was the town and the smoking chimneys of the collieries and far far away the river widened to the shining sea and little white specks which were ships lay on its bosom  before him lay spread out like a map great plains and farms and villages amid dark knots of trees  they all seemed at his very feet but he had sense to see that they were long miles away  and to his right rose moor after moor hill after hill till they faded away blue into blue sky  but between him and those moors and really at his very feet lay something to which as soon as tom saw it he determined to go for that was the place for him  a deep deep green and rocky valley very narrow and filled with wood but through the wood hundreds of feet below him he could see a clear stream glance  oh if he could but get down to that stream  then by the stream he saw the roof of a little cottage and a little garden set out in squares and beds  and there was a tiny little red thing moving in the garden no bigger than a fly as tom looked down he saw that it was a woman in a red petticoat ah perhaps she would give him something to eat  and there were the churchbells ringing again  surely there must be a village down there  well nobody would know him or what had happened at the place  the news could not have got there yet even if sir john had set all the policemen in the county after him and he could get down there in five minutes  tom was quite right about the hueandcry not having got thither for he had come without knowing it the best part of ten miles from harthover but he was wrong about getting down in five minutes for the cottage was more than a mile off and a good thousand feet below  however down he went like a brave little man as he was though he was very footsore and tired and hungry and thirsty while the churchbells rang so loud he began to think that they must be inside his own head and the river chimed and tinkled far below and this was the song which it sang   clear and cool clear and cool by laughing shallow and dreaming pool cool and clear cool and clear by shining shingle and foaming wear under the crag where the ouzel sings and the ivied wall where the churchbell rings undefiled for the undefiled play by me bathe in me mother and child  dank and foul dank and foul by the smoky town in its murky cowl foul and dank foul and dank by wharf and sewer and slimy bank darker and darker the farther i go baser and baser the richer i grow who dares sport with the sindefiled shrink from me turn from me mother and child  strong and free strong and free the floodgates are open away to the sea free and strong free and strong cleansing my streams as i hurry along to the golden sands and the leaping bar and the taintless tide that awaits me afar as i lose myself in the infinite main like a soul that has sinned and is pardoned again undefiled for the undefiled play by me bathe in me mother and child   so tom went down and all the while he never saw the irishwoman going down behind him    chapter ii    and is there care in heaven and is there love in heavenly spirits to these creatures base that may compassion of their evils move there is else much more wretched were the case of men than beasts  but oh the exceeding grace of highest god that loves his creatures so and all his works with mercy doth embrace that blessed angels he sends to and fro to serve to wicked man to serve his wicked foe  spenser   a mile off and a thousand feet down  so tom found it though it seemed as if he could have chucked a pebble on to the back of the woman in the red petticoat who was weeding in the garden or even across the dale to the rocks beyond for the bottom of the valley was just one field broad and on the other side ran the stream and above it gray crag gray down gray stair gray moor walled up to heaven  a quiet silent rich happy place a narrow crack cut deep into the earth so deep and so out of the way that the bad bogies can hardly find it out  the name of the place is vendale and if you want to see it for yourself you must go up into the high craven and search from bolland forest north by ingleborough to the nine standards and cross fell and if you have not found it you must turn south and search the lake mountains down to scaw fell and the sea and then if you have not found it you must go northward again by merry carlisle and search the cheviots all across from annan water to berwick law and then whether you have found vendale or not you will have found such a country and such a people as ought to make you proud of being a british boy  so tom went to go down and first he went down three hundred feet of steep heather mixed up with loose brown grindstone as rough as a file which was not pleasant to his poor little heels as he came bump stump jump down the steep  and still he thought he could throw a stone into the garden  then he went down three hundred feet of limestone terraces one below the other as straight as if a carpenter had ruled them with his ruler and then cut them out with his chisel  there was no heath there but   first a little grass slope covered with the prettiest flowers rockrose and saxifrage and thyme and basil and all sorts of sweet herbs  then bump down a twofoot step of limestone  then another bit of grass and flowers  then bump down a onefoot step  then another bit of grass and flowers for fifty yards as steep as the houseroof where he had to slide down on his dear little tail  then another step of stone ten feet high and there he had to stop himself and crawl along the edge to find a crack for if he had rolled over he would have rolled right into the old womans garden and frightened her out of her wits  then when he had found a dark narrow crack full of greenstalked fern such as hangs in the basket in the drawingroom and had crawled down through it with knees and elbows as he would down a chimney there was another grass slope and another step and so on tilloh dear me  i wish it was all over and so did he  and yet he thought he could throw a stone into the old womans garden  at last he came to a bank of beautiful shrubs whitebeam with its great silverbacked leaves and mountainash and oak and below them cliff and crag cliff and crag with great beds of crownferns and woodsedge while through the shrubs he could see the stream sparkling and hear it murmur on the white pebbles  he did not know that it was three hundred feet below  you would have been giddy perhaps at looking down  but tom was not  he was a brave little chimneysweep and when he found himself on the top of a high cliff instead of sitting down and crying for his baba though he never had had any baba to cry for he said ah this will just suit me though he was very tired and down he went by stock and stone sedge and ledge bush and rush as if he had been born a jolly little black ape with four hands instead of two  and all the while he never saw the irishwoman coming down behind him  but he was getting terribly tired now  the burning sun on the fells had sucked him up but the damp heat of the woody crag sucked him up still more and the perspiration ran out of the ends of his fingers and toes and washed him cleaner than he had been for a whole year  but of course he dirtied everything terribly as he went  there has been a great black smudge all down the crag ever since  and there have been more black beetles in vendale since than ever were known before all of course owing to toms having blacked the original papa of them all just as he was setting off to be married with a skyblue coat and scarlet leggins as smart as a gardeners dog with a polyanthus in his mouth  at last he got to the bottom  but behold it was not the bottom as people usually find when they are coming down a mountain  for at the foot of the crag were heaps and heaps of fallen limestone of every size from that of your head to that of a stagewaggon with holes between them full of sweet heathfern and before tom got through them he was out in the bright sunshine again and then he felt once for all and suddenly as people generally do that he was beat beat  you must expect to be beat a few times in your life little man if you live such a life as a man ought to live let you be as strong and healthy as you may  and when you are you will find it a very ugly feeling  i hope that that day you may have a stout staunch friend by you who is not beat for if you have not you had best lie where you are and wait for better times as poor tom did  he could not get on  the sun was burning and yet he felt chill all over  he was quite empty and yet he felt quite sick  there was but two hundred yards of smooth pasture between him and the cottage and yet he could not walk down it  he could hear the stream murmuring only one field beyond it and yet it seemed to him as if it was a hundred miles off  he lay down on the grass till the beetles ran over him and the flies settled on his nose  i dont know when he would have got up again if the gnats and the midges had not taken compassion on him but the gnats blew their trumpets so loud in his ear and the midges nibbled so at his hands and face wherever they could find a place free from soot that at last he woke up and stumbled away down over a low wall and into a narrow road and up to the cottagedoor  and a neat pretty cottage it was with clipped yew hedges all round the garden and yews inside too cut into peacocks and trumpets and teapots and all kinds of queer shapes  and out of the open door came a noise like that of the frogs on the greata when they know that it is going to be scorching hot tomorrowand how they know that i dont know and you dont know and nobody knows  he came slowly up to the open door which was all hung round with clematis and roses and then peeped in half afraid  and there sat by the empty fireplace which was filled with a pot of sweet herbs the nicest old woman that ever was seen in her red petticoat and short dimity bedgown and clean white cap with a black silk handkerchief over it tied under her chin  at her feet sat the grandfather of all the cats and opposite her sat on two benches twelve or fourteen neat rosy chubby little children learning their chriscrossrow and gabble enough they made about it  such a pleasant cottage it was with a shiny clean stone floor and curious old prints on the walls and an old black oak sideboard full of bright pewter and brass dishes and a cuckoo clock in the corner which began shouting as soon as tom appeared  not that it was frightened at tom but that it was just eleven oclock  all the children started at toms dirty black figurethe girls began to cry and the boys began to laugh and all pointed at him rudely enough but tom was too tired to care for that  what art thou and what dost want cried the old dame  a chimneysweep  away with thee  ill have no sweeps here  water said poor little tom quite faint  water  theres plenty i the beck she said quite sharply  but i cant get there im most clemmed with hunger and drought and tom sank down upon the doorstep and laid his head against the post  and the old dame looked at him through her spectacles one minute and two and three and then she said hes sick and a bairns a bairn sweep or none  water said tom  god forgive me and she put by her spectacles and rose and came to tom  waters bad for thee ill give thee milk  and she toddled off into the next room and brought a cup of milk and a bit of bread  tom drank the milk off at one draught and then looked up revived  where didst come from said the dame  over fell there said tom and pointed up into the sky  over harthover and down lewthwaite crag  art sure thou art not lying  why should i said tom and leant his head against the post  and how got ye up there  i came over from the place and tom was so tired and desperate he had no heart or time to think of a story so he told all the truth in a few words  bless thy little heart  and thou hast not been stealing then  no  bless thy little heart and ill warrant not  why gods guided the bairn because he was innocent  away from the place and over harthover fell and down lewthwaite crag  who ever heard the like if god hadnt led him  why dost not eat thy bread  i cant  its good enough for i made it myself  i cant said tom and he laid his head on his knees and then asked   is it sunday  no then why should it be  because i hear the churchbells ringing so  bless thy pretty heart  the bairns sick  come wi me and ill hap thee up somewhere  if thou wert a bit cleaner id put thee in my own bed for the lords sake  but come along here  but when tom tried to get up he was so tired and giddy that she had to help him and lead him  she put him in an outhouse upon soft sweet hay and an old rug and bade him sleep off his walk and she would come to him when school was over in an hours time  and so she went in again expecting tom to fall fast asleep at once  but tom did not fall asleep  instead of it he turned and tossed and kicked about in the strangest way and felt so hot all over that he longed to get into the river and cool himself and then he fell half asleep and dreamt that he heard the little white lady crying to him oh youre so dirty go and be washed and then that he heard the irishwoman saying those that wish to be clean clean they will be  and then he heard the churchbells ring so loud close to him too that he was sure it must be sunday in spite of what the old dame had said and he would go to church and see what a church was like inside for he had never been in one poor little fellow in all his life  but the people would never let him come in all over soot and dirt like that  he must go to the river and wash first and he said out loud again and again though being half asleep he did not know it i must be clean i must be clean  and all of a sudden he found himself not in the outhouse on the hay but in the middle of a meadow over the road with the stream just before him saying continually i must be clean i must be clean  he had got there on his own legs between sleep and awake as children will often get out of bed and go about the room when they are not quite well  but he was not a bit surprised and went on to the bank of the brook and lay down on the grass and looked into the clear clear limestone water with every pebble at the bottom bright and clean while the little silver trout dashed about in fright at the sight of his black face and he dipped his hand in and found it so cool cool cool and he said i will be a fish i will swim in the water i must be clean i must be clean  so he pulled off all his clothes in such haste that he tore some of them which was easy enough with such ragged old things  and he put his poor hot sore feet into the water and then his legs and the farther he went in the more the churchbells rang in his head  ah said tom i must be quick and wash myself the bells are ringing quite loud now and they will stop soon and then the door will be shut and i shall never be able to get in at all  tom was mistaken  for in england the church doors are left open all service time for everybody who likes to come in churchman or dissenter ay even if he were a turk or a heathen and if any man dared to turn him out as long as he behaved quietly the good old english law would punish that man as he deserved for ordering any peaceable person out of gods house which belongs to all alike but tom did not know that any more than he knew a great deal more which people ought to know  and all the while he never saw the irishwoman not behind him this time but before  for just before he came to the river side she had stept down into the cool clear water and her shawl and her petticoat floated off her and the green waterweeds floated round her sides and the white waterlilies floated round her head and the fairies of the stream came up from the bottom and bore her away and down upon their arms for she was the queen of them all and perhaps of more besides  where have you been they asked her  i have been smoothing sick folks pillows and whispering sweet dreams into their ears opening cottage casements to let out the stifling air coaxing little children away from gutters and foul pools where fever breeds turning women from the ginshop door and staying mens hands as they were going to strike their wives doing all i can to help those who will not help themselves  and little enough that is and weary work for me  but i have brought you a new little brother and watched him safe all the way here  then all the fairies laughed for joy at the thought that they had a little brother coming  but mind maidens he must not see you or know that you are here he is but a savage now and like the beasts which perish and from the beasts which perish he must learn  so you must not play with him or speak to him or let him see you  but only keep him from being harmed  then the fairies were sad because they could not play with their new brother but they always did what they were told  and their queen floated away down the river and whither she went thither she came  but all this tom of course never saw or heard and perhaps if he had it would have made little difference in the story for was so hot and thirsty and longed so to be clean for once that he tumbled himself as quick as he could into the clear cool stream  and he had not been in it two minutes before he fell fast asleep into the quietest sunniest cosiest sleep that ever he had in his life and he dreamt about the green meadows by which he had walked that morning and the tall elmtrees and the sleeping cows and after that he dreamt of nothing at all  the reason of his falling into such a delightful sleep is very simple and yet hardly any one has found it out  it was merely that the fairies took him  some people think that there are no fairies  cousin cramchild tells little folks so in his conversations  well perhaps there are nonein boston us where he was raised  there are only a clumsy lot of spirits there who cant make people hear without thumping on the table  but they get their living thereby and i suppose that is all they want  and aunt agitate in her arguments on political economy says there are none  well perhaps there are nonein her political economy  but it is a wide world my little manand thank heaven for it for else between crinolines and theories some of us would get squashedand plenty of room in it for fairies without people seeing them unless of course they look in the right place  the most wonderful and the strongest things in the world you know are just the things which no one can see  there is life in you and it is the life in you which makes you grow and move and think  and yet you cant see it  and there is steam in a steamengine and that is what makes it move and yet you cant see it and so there may be fairies in the world and they may be just what makes the world go round to the old tune of   cest lamour lamour lamour qui fait la monde a la ronde   and yet no one may be able to see them except those whose hearts are going round to that same tune  at all events we will make believe that there are fairies in the world  it will not be the last time by many a one that we shall have to make believe  and yet after all there is no need for that  there must be fairies for this is a fairy tale  and how can one have a fairy tale if there are no fairies  you dont see the logic of that  perhaps not  then please not to see the logic of a great many arguments exactly like it which you will hear before your beard is gray  the kind old dame came back at twelve when school was over to look at tom  but there was no tom there  she looked about for his footprints but the ground was so hard that there was no slot as they say in dear old north devon  and if you grow up to be a brave healthy man you may know some day what no slot means and know too i hope what a slot does meana broad slot with blunt claws which makes a man put out his cigar and set his teeth and tighten his girths when he sees it and what his rights mean if he has them brow bay tray and points and see something worth seeing between haddon wood and countisbury cliff with good mr palk collyns to show you the way and mend your bones as fast as you smash them  only when that jolly day comes please dont break your neck stogged in a mire you never will be i trust for you are a heathcropper bred and born  so the old dame went in again quite sulky thinking that little tom had tricked her with a false story and shammed ill and then run away again  but she altered her mind the next day  for when sir john and the rest of them had run themselves out of breath and lost tom they went back again looking very foolish  and they looked more foolish still when sir john heard more of the story from the nurse and more foolish still again when they heard the whole story from miss ellie the little lady in white all she had seen was a poor little black chimneysweep crying and sobbing and going to get up the chimney again  of course she was very much frightened  and no wonder  but that was all  the boy had taken nothing in the room by the mark of his little sooty feet they could see that he had never been off the hearthrug till the nurse caught hold of him  it was all a mistake  so sir john told grimes to go home and promised him five shillings if he would bring the boy quietly up to him without beating him that he might be sure of the truth  for he took for granted and grimes too that tom had made his way home  but no tom came back to mr grimes that evening and he went to the policeoffice to tell them to look out for the boy  but no tom was heard of  as for his having gone over those great fells to vendale they no more dreamed of that than of his having gone to the moon  so mr grimes came up to harthover next day with a very sour face but when he got there sir john was over the hills and far away and mr grimes had to sit in the outer servants hall all day and drink strong ale to wash away his sorrows and they were washed away long before sir john came back  for good sir john had slept very badly that night and he said to his lady my dear the boy must have got over into the grouse moors and lost himself and he lies very heavily on my conscience poor little lad  but i know what i will do  so at five the next morning up he got and into his bath and into his shootingjacket and gaiters and into the stableyard like a fine old english gentleman with a face as red as a rose and a hand as hard as a table and a back as broad as a bullocks and bade them bring his shooting pony and the keeper to come on his pony and the huntsman and the first whip and the second whip and the underkeeper with the bloodhound in a leasha great dog as tall as a calf of the colour of a gravelwalk with mahogany ears and nose and a throat like a churchbell  they took him up to the place where tom had gone into the wood and there the hound lifted up his mighty voice and told them all he knew  then he took them to the place where tom had climbed the wall and they shoved it down and all got through  and then the wise dog took them over the moor and over the fells step by step very slowly for the scent was a day old you know and very light from the heat and drought  but that was why cunning old sir john started at five in the morning  and at last he came to the top of lewthwaite crag and there he bayed and looked up in their faces as much as to say i tell you he is gone down here  they could hardly believe that tom would have gone so far and when they looked at that awful cliff they could never believe that he would have dared to face it  but if the dog said so it must be true  heaven forgive us said sir john  if we find him at all we shall find him lying at the bottom  and he slapped his great hand upon his great thigh and said   who will go down over lewthwaite crag and see if that boy is alive  oh that i were twenty years younger and i would go down myself  and so he would have done as well as any sweep in the county  then he said   twenty pounds to the man who brings me that boy alive and as was his way what he said he meant  now among the lot was a little groomboy a very little groom indeed and he was the same who had ridden up the court and told tom to come to the hall and he said   twenty pounds or none i will go down over lewthwaite crag if its only for the poor boys sake  for he was as civil a spoken little chap as ever climbed a flue  so down over lewthwaite crag he went  a very smart groom he was at the top and a very shabby one at the bottom for he tore his gaiters and he tore his breeches and he tore his jacket and he burst his braces and he burst his boots and he lost his hat and what was worst of all he lost his shirt pin which he prized very much for it was gold and he had won it in a raffle at malton and there was a figure at the top of it of tould mare noble old beeswing herself as natural as life so it was a really severe loss  but he never saw anything of tom  and all the while sir john and the rest were riding round full three miles to the right and back again to get into vendale and to the foot of the crag  when they came to the old dames school all the children came out to see  and the old dame came out too and when she saw sir john she curtsied very low for she was a tenant of his  well dame and how are you said sir john  blessings on you as broad as your back harthover says sheshe didnt call him sir john but only harthover for that is the fashion in the north countryand welcome into vendale  but youre no hunting the fox this time of the year  i am hunting and strange game too said he  blessings on your heart and what makes you look so sad the morn  im looking for a lost child a chimneysweep that is run away  oh harthover harthover says she ye were always a just man and a merciful and yell no harm the poor little lad if i give you tidings of him  not i not i dame  im afraid we hunted him out of the house all on a miserable mistake and the hound has brought him to the top of lewthwaite crag and  whereat the old dame broke out crying without letting him finish his story  so he told me the truth after all poor little dear  ah first thoughts are best and a bodys heartll guide them right if they will but hearken to it  and then she told sir john all  bring the dog here and lay him on said sir john without another word and he set his teeth very hard  and the dog opened at once and went away at the back of the cottage over the road and over the meadow and through a bit of alder copse and there upon an alder stump they saw toms clothes lying  and then they knew as much about it all as there was any need to know  and tom  ah now comes the most wonderful part of this wonderful story tom when he woke for of course he wokechildren always wake after they have slept exactly as long as is good for themfound himself swimming about in the stream being about four inches or that i may be accurate387902 inches long and having round the parotid region of his fauces a set of external gills i hope you understand all the big words just like those of a sucking eft which he mistook for a lace frill till he pulled at them found he hurt himself and made up his mind that they were part of himself and best left alone  in fact the fairies had turned him into a waterbaby  a waterbaby  you never heard of a waterbaby  perhaps not  that is the very reason why this story was written  there are a great many things in the world which you never heard of and a great many more which nobody ever heard of and a great many things too which nobody will ever hear of at least until the coming of the cocqcigrues when man shall be the measure of all things  but there are no such things as waterbabies  how do you know that  have you been there to see  and if you had been there to see and had seen none that would not prove that there were none  if mr garth does not find a fox in eversley woodas folks sometimes fear he never willthat does not prove that there are no such things as foxes  and as is eversley wood to all the woods in england so are the waters we know to all the waters in the world  and no one has a right to say that no water babies exist till they have seen no waterbabies existing which is quite a different thing mind from not seeing waterbabies and a thing which nobody ever did or perhaps ever will do  but surely if there were waterbabies somebody would have caught one at least  well  how do you know that somebody has not  but they would have put it into spirits or into the illustrated news or perhaps cut it into two halves poor dear little thing and sent one to professor owen and one to professor huxley to see what they would each say about it  ah my dear little man that does not follow at all as you will see before the end of the story  but a waterbaby is contrary to nature  well but my dear little man you must learn to talk about such things when you grow older in a very different way from that you must not talk about aint and cant when you speak of this great wonderful world round you of which the wisest man knows only the very smallest corner and is as the great sir isaac newton said only a child picking up pebbles on the shore of a boundless ocean  you must not say that this cannot be or that that is contrary to nature  you do not know what nature is or what she can do and nobody knows not even sir roderick murchison or professor owen or professor sedgwick or professor huxley or mr darwin or professor faraday or mr grove or any other of the great men whom good boys are taught to respect  they are very wise men and you must listen respectfully to all they say  but even if they should say which i am sure they never would that cannot exist  that is contrary to nature you must wait a little and see for perhaps even they may be wrong  it is only children who read aunt agitates arguments or cousin cramchilds conversations or lads who go to popular lectures and see a man pointing at a few big ugly pictures on the wall or making nasty smells with bottles and squirts for an hour or two and calling that anatomy or chemistry who talk about cannot exist and contrary to nature  wise men are afraid to say that there is anything contrary to nature except what is contrary to mathematical truth for two and two cannot make five and two straight lines cannot join twice and a part cannot be as great as the whole and so on at least so it seems at present  but the wiser men are the less they talk about cannot  that is a very rash dangerous word that cannot and if people use it too often the queen of all the fairies who makes the clouds thunder and the fleas bite and takes just as much trouble about one as about the other is apt to astonish them suddenly by showing them that though they say she cannot yet she can and what is more will whether they approve or not  and therefore it is that there are dozens and hundreds of things in the world which we should certainly have said were contrary to nature if we did not see them going on under our eyes all day long  if people had never seen little seeds grow into great plants and trees of quite different shape from themselves and these trees again produce fresh seeds to grow into fresh trees they would have said the thing cannot be it is contrary to nature and they would have been quite as right in saying so as in saying that most other things cannot be  or suppose again that you had come like m du chaillu a traveller from unknown parts and that no human being had ever seen or heard of an elephant  and suppose that you described him to people and said this is the shape and plan and anatomy of the beast and of his feet and of his trunk and of his grinders and of his tusks though they are not tusks at all but two fore teeth run mad and this is the section of his skull more like a mushroom than a reasonable skull of a reasonable or unreasonable beast and so forth and so forth and though the beast which i assure you i have seen and shot is first cousin to the little hairy coney of scripture second cousin to a pig and i suspect thirteenth or fourteenth cousin to a rabbit yet he is the wisest of all beasts and can do everything save read write and cast accounts  people would surely have said nonsense your elephant is contrary to nature and have thought you were telling storiesas the french thought of le vaillant when he came back to paris and said that he had shot a giraffe and as the king of the cannibal islands thought of the english sailor when he said that in his country water turned to marble and rain fell as feathers  they would tell you the more they knew of science your elephant is an impossible monster contrary to the laws of comparative anatomy as far as yet known  to which you would answer the less the more you thought  did not learned men too hold till within the last twentyfive years that a flying dragon was an impossible monster  and do we not now know that there are hundreds of them found fossil up and down the world  people call them pterodactyles  but that is only because they are ashamed to call them flying dragons after denying so long that flying dragons could exist  the truth is that folks fancy that such and such things cannot be simply because they have not seen them is worth no more than a savages fancy that there cannot be such a thing as a locomotive because he never saw one running wild in the forest  wise men know that their business is to examine what is and not to settle what is not  they know that there are elephants they know that there have been flying dragons and the wiser they are the less inclined they will be to say positively that there are no waterbabies  no waterbabies indeed  why wise men of old said that everything on earth had its double in the water and you may see that that is if not quite true still quite as true as most other theories which you are likely to hear for many a day  there are landbabiesthen why not waterbabies  are there not waterrats waterflies watercrickets watercrabs watertortoises waterscorpions watertigers and waterhogs watercats and waterdogs sealions and seabears seahorses and seaelephants seamice and sea urchins searazors and seapens seacombs and seafans and of plants are there not watergrass and watercrowfoot water milfoil and so on without end  but all these things are only nicknames the water things are not really akin to the land things  thats not always true  they are in millions of cases not only of the same family but actually the same individual creatures  do not even you know that a green drake and an alderfly and a dragonfly live under water till they change their skins just as tom changed his  and if a water animal can continually change into a land animal why should not a land animal sometimes change into a water animal  dont be put down by any of cousin cramchilds arguments but stand up to him like a man and answer him quite respectfully of course thus  if cousin cramchild says that if there are waterbabies they must grow into watermen ask him how he knows that they do not and then how he knows that they must any more than the proteus of the adelsberg caverns grows into a perfect newt  if he says that it is too strange a transformation for a landbaby to turn into a waterbaby ask him if he ever heard of the transformation of syllis or the distomas or the common jelly fish of which m quatrefages says excellently wellwho would not exclaim that a miracle had come to pass if he saw a reptile come out of the egg dropped by the hen in his poultryyard and the reptile give birth at once to an indefinite number of fishes and birds  yet the history of the jellyfish is quite as wonderful as that would be  ask him if he knows about all this and if he does not tell him to go and look for himself and advise him very respectfully of course to settle no more what strange things cannot happen till he has seen what strange things do happen every day  if he says that things cannot degrade that is change downwards into lower forms ask him who told him that waterbabies were lower than landbabies  but even if they were does he know about the strange degradation of the common goosebarnacles which one finds sticking on ships bottoms or the still stranger degradation of some cousins of theirs of which one hardly likes to talk so shocking and ugly it is  and lastly if he says as he most certainly will that these transformations only take place in the lower animals and not in the higher say that that seems to little boys and to some grown people a very strange fancy  for if the changes of the lower animals are so wonderful and so difficult to discover why should not there be changes in the higher animals far more wonderful and far more difficult to discover  and may not man the crown and flower of all things undergo some change as much more wonderful than all the rest as the great exhibition is more wonderful than a rabbitburrow  let him answer that  and if he says as he will that not having seen such a change in his experience he is not bound to believe it ask him respectfully where his microscope has been  does not each of us in coming into this world go through a transformation just as wonderful as that of a seaegg or a butterfly and do not reason and analogy as well as scripture tell us that that transformation is not the last and that though what we shall be we know not yet we are here but as the crawling caterpillar and shall be hereafter as the perfect fly  the old greeks heathens as they were saw as much as that two thousand years ago and i care very little for cousin cramchild if he sees even less than they  and so forth and so forth till he is quite cross  and then tell him that if there are no waterbabies at least there ought to be and that at least he cannot answer  and meanwhile my dear little man till you know a great deal more about nature than professor owen and professor huxley put together dont tell me about what cannot be or fancy that anything is too wonderful to be true  we are fearfully and wonderfully made said old david and so we are and so is everything around us down to the very deal table  yes much more fearfully and wonderfully made already is the table as it stands now nothing but a piece of dead deal wood than if as foxes say and geese believe spirits could make it dance or talk to you by rapping on it  am i in earnest  oh dear no  dont you know that this is a fairy tale and all fun and pretence and that you are not to believe one word of it even if it is true  but at all events so it happened to tom  and therefore the keeper and the groom and sir john made a great mistake and were very unhappy sir john at least without any reason when they found a black thing in the water and said it was toms body and that he had been drowned  they were utterly mistaken  tom was quite alive and cleaner and merrier than he ever had been  the fairies had washed him you see in the swift river so thoroughly that not only his dirt but his whole husk and shell had been washed quite off him and the pretty little real tom was washed out of the inside of it and swam away as a caddis does when its case of stones and silk is bored through and away it goes on its back paddling to the shore there to split its skin and fly away as a caperer on four fawncoloured wings with long legs and horns they are foolish fellows the caperers and fly into the candle at night if you leave the door open  we will hope tom will be wiser now he has got safe out of his sooty old shell  but good sir john did not understand all this not being a fellow of the linnaean society and he took it into his head that tom was drowned  when they looked into the empty pockets of his shell and found no jewels there nor moneynothing but three marbles and a brass button with a string to itthen sir john did something as like crying as ever he did in his life and blamed himself more bitterly than he need have done  so he cried and the groomboy cried and the huntsman cried and the dame cried and the little girl cried and the dairymaid cried and the old nurse cried for it was somewhat her fault and my lady cried for though people have wigs that is no reason why they should not have hearts but the keeper did not cry though he had been so goodnatured to tom the morning before for he was so dried up with running after poachers that you could no more get tears out of him than milk out of leather  and grimes did not cry for sir john gave him ten pounds and he drank it all in a week  sir john sent far and wide to find toms father and mother  but he might have looked till doomsday for them for one was dead and the other was in botany bay  and the little girl would not play with her dolls for a whole week and never forgot poor little tom  and soon my lady put a pretty little tombstone over toms shell in the little churchyard in vendale where the old dalesmen all sleep side by side between the limestone crags  and the dame decked it with garlands every sunday till she grew so old that she could not stir abroad then the little children decked it for her  and always she sang an old old song as she sat spinning what she called her weddingdress  the children could not understand it but they liked it none the less for that for it was very sweet and very sad and that was enough for them  and these are the words of it   when all the world is young lad and all the trees are green and every goose a swan lad and every lass a queen then hey for boot and horse lad and round the world away young blood must have its course lad and every dog his day  when all the world is old lad and all the trees are brown and all the sport is stale lad and all the wheels run down creep home and take your place there the spent and maimed among god grant you find one face there you loved when all was young   those are the words  but they are only the body of it  the soul of the song was the dear old womans sweet face and sweet voice and the sweet old air to which she sang and that alas one cannot put on paper  and at last she grew so stiff and lame that the angels were forced to carry her and they helped her on with her weddingdress and carried her up over harthover fells and a long way beyond that too and there was a new schoolmistress in vendale and we will hope that she was not certificated  and all the while tom was swimming about in the river with a pretty little lacecollar of gills about his neck as lively as a grig and as clean as a freshrun salmon  now if you dont like my story then go to the schoolroom and learn your multiplicationtable and see if you like that better  some people no doubt would do so  so much the better for us if not for them  it takes all sorts they say to make a world    chapter iii    he prayeth well who loveth well both men and bird and beast he prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small for the dear god who loveth us he made and loveth all  coleridge   tom was now quite amphibious  you do not know what that means you had better then ask the nearest government pupilteacher who may possibly answer you smartly enough thus   amphibious  adjective derived from two greek words amphi a fish and bios a beast  an animal supposed by our ignorant ancestors to be compounded of a fish and a beast which therefore like the hippopotamus cant live on the land and dies in the water  however that may be tom was amphibious  and what is better still he was clean  for the first time in his life he felt how comfortable it was to have nothing on him but himself  but he only enjoyed it  he did not know it or think about it just as you enjoy life and health and yet never think about being alive and healthy and may it be long before you have to think about it  he did not remember having ever been dirty  indeed he did not remember any of his old troubles being tired or hungry or beaten or sent up dark chimneys  since that sweet sleep he had forgotten all about his master and harthover place and the little white girl and in a word all that had happened to him when he lived before and what was best of all he had forgotten all the bad words which he had learned from grimes and the rude boys with whom he used to play  that is not strange  for you know when you came into this world and became a landbaby you remembered nothing  so why should he when he became a waterbaby  then have you lived before  my dear child who can tell  one can only tell that by remembering something which happened where we lived before and as we remember nothing we know nothing about it and no book and no man can ever tell us certainly  there was a wise man once a very wise man and a very good man who wrote a poem about the feelings which some children have about having lived before and this is what he said    our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting the soul that rises with us our lifes star hath elsewhere had its setting and cometh from afar not in entire forgetfulness and not in utter nakedness but trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home   there you can know no more than that  but if i was you i would believe that  for then the great fairy science who is likely to be queen of all the fairies for many a year to come can only do you good and never do you harm and instead of fancying with some people that your body makes your soul as if a steamengine could make its own coke or with some people that your soul has nothing to do with your body but is only stuck into it like a pin into a pincushion to fall out with the first shakeyou will believe the one true  orthodox      inductive rational      deductive philosophical seductive logical       productive irrefragable  salutary nominalistic  comfortable realistic and onallaccountstobereceived  doctrine of this wonderful fairy tale which is that your soul makes your body just as a snail makes his shell  for the rest it is enough for us to be sure that whether or not we lived before we shall live again though not i hope as poor little heathen tom did  for he went downward into the water  but we i hope shall go upward to a very different place  but tom was very happy in the water  he had been sadly overworked in the landworld and so now to make up for that he had nothing but holidays in the waterworld for a long long time to come  he had nothing to do now but enjoy himself and look at all the pretty things which are to be seen in the cool clear waterworld where the sun is never too hot and the frost is never too cold  and what did he live on  watercresses perhaps or perhaps water gruel and watermilk too many landbabies do so likewise  but we do not know what onetenth of the waterthings eat so we are not answerable for the waterbabies  sometimes he went along the smooth gravel waterways looking at the crickets which ran in and out among the stones as rabbits do on land or he climbed over the ledges of rock and saw the sand pipes hanging in thousands with every one of them a pretty little head and legs peeping out or he went into a still corner and watched the caddises eating dead sticks as greedily as you would eat plumpudding and building their houses with silk and glue very fanciful ladies they were none of them would keep to the same materials for a day  one would begin with some pebbles then she would stick on a piece of green wood then she found a shell and stuck it on too and the poor shell was alive and did not like at all being taken to build houses with  but the caddis did not let him have any voice in the matter being rude and selfish as vain people are apt to be then she stuck on a piece of rotten wood then a very smart pink stone and so on till she was patched all over like an irishmans coat  then she found a long straw five times as long as herself and said hurrah my sister has a tail and ill have one too and she stuck it on her back and marched about with it quite proud though it was very inconvenient indeed and at that tails became all the fashion among the caddisbaits in that pool as they were at the end of the long pond last may and they all toddled about with long straws sticking out behind getting between each others legs and tumbling over each other and looking so ridiculous that tom laughed at them till he cried as we did  but they were quite right you know for people must always follow the fashion even if it be spoonbonnets  then sometimes he came to a deep still reach and there he saw the waterforests  they would have looked to you only little weeds but tom you must remember was so little that everything looked a hundred times as big to him as it does to you just as things do to a minnow who sees and catches the little watercreatures which you can only see in a microscope  and in the waterforest he saw the watermonkeys and water squirrels they had all six legs though everything almost has six legs in the water except efts and waterbabies and nimbly enough they ran among the branches  there were waterflowers there too in thousands and tom tried to pick them  but as soon as he touched them they drew themselves in and turned into knots of jelly and then tom saw that they were all alivebells and stars and wheels and flowers of all beautiful shapes and colours and all alive and busy just as tom was  so now he found that there was a great deal more in the world than he had fancied at first sight  there was one wonderful little fellow too who peeped out of the top of a house built of round bricks  he had two big wheels and one little one all over teeth spinning round and round like the wheels in a thrashingmachine and tom stood and stared at him to see what he was going to make with his machinery  and what do you think he was doing  brickmaking  with his two big wheels he swept together all the mud which floated in the water  all that was nice in it he put into his stomach and ate and all the mud he put into the little wheel on his breast which really was a round hole set with teeth and there he spun it into a neat hard round brick and then he took it and stuck it on the top of his house wall and set to work to make another now was not he a clever little fellow  tom thought so  but when he wanted to talk to him the brickmaker was much too busy and proud of his work to take notice of him  now you must know that all the things under the water talk only not such a language as ours but such as horses and dogs and cows and birds talk to each other and tom soon learned to understand them and talk to them so that he might have had very pleasant company if he had only been a good boy  but i am sorry to say he was too like some other little boys very fond of hunting and tormenting creatures for mere sport  some people say that boys cannot help it that it is nature and only a proof that we are all originally descended from beasts of prey  but whether it is nature or not little boys can help it and must help it  for if they have naughty low mischievous tricks in their nature as monkeys have that is no reason why they should give way to those tricks like monkeys who know no better  and therefore they must not torment dumb creatures for if they do a certain old lady who is coming will surely give them exactly what they deserve  but tom did not know that and he pecked and howked the poor water things about sadly till they were all afraid of him and got out of his way or crept into their shells so he had no one to speak to or play with  the waterfairies of course were very sorry to see him so unhappy and longed to take him and tell him how naughty he was and teach him to be good and to play and romp with him too  but they had been forbidden to do that  tom had to learn his lesson for himself by sound and sharp experience as many another foolish person has to do though there may be many a kind heart yearning over them all the while and longing to teach them what they can only teach themselves  at last one day he found a caddis and wanted it to peep out of its house  but its housedoor was shut  he had never seen a caddis with a housedoor before  so what must he do the meddlesome little fellow but pull it open to see what the poor lady was doing inside  what a shame  how should you like to have any one breaking your bedroomdoor in to see how you looked when you where in bed  so tom broke to pieces the door which was the prettiest little grating of silk stuck all over with shining bits of crystal and when he looked in the caddis poked out her head and it had turned into just the shape of a birds  but when tom spoke to her she could not answer for her mouth and face were tight tied up in a new nightcap of neat pink skin  however if she didnt answer all the other caddises did for they held up their hands and shrieked like the cats in struwelpeter  oh you nasty horrid boy there you are at it again  and she had just laid herself up for a fortnights sleep and then she would have come out with such beautiful wings and flown about and laid such lots of eggs  and now you have broken her door and she cant mend it because her mouth is tied up for a fortnight and she will die  who sent you here to worry us out of our lives  so tom swam away  he was very much ashamed of himself and felt all the naughtier as little boys do when they have done wrong and wont say so  then he came to a pool full of little trout and began tormenting them and trying to catch them  but they slipped through his fingers and jumped clean out of water in their fright  but as tom chased them he came close to a great dark hover under an alder root and out floushed a huge old brown trout ten times as big as he was and ran right against him and knocked all the breath out of his body and i dont know which was the more frightened of the two  then he went on sulky and lonely as he deserved to be and under a bank he saw a very ugly dirty creature sitting about half as big as himself which had six legs and a big stomach and a most ridiculous head with two great eyes and a face just like a donkeys  oh said tom you are an ugly fellow to be sure and he began making faces at him and put his nose close to him and halloed at him like a very rude boy  when hey presto all the things donkeyface came off in a moment and out popped a long arm with a pair of pincers at the end of it and caught tom by the nose  it did not hurt him much but it held him quite tight  yah ah  oh let me go cried tom  then let me go said the creature  i want to be quiet  i want to split  tom promised to let him alone and he let go  why do you want to split said tom  because my brothers and sisters have all split and turned into beautiful creatures with wings and i want to split too  dont speak to me  i am sure i shall split  i will split  tom stood still and watched him  and he swelled himself and puffed and stretched himself out stiff and at lastcrack puff banghe opened all down his back and then up to the top of his head  and out of his inside came the most slender elegant soft creature as soft and smooth as tom  but very pale and weak like a little child who has been ill a long time in a dark room  it moved its legs very feebly and looked about it half ashamed like a girl when she goes for the first time into a ballroom and then it began walking slowly up a grass stem to the top of the water  tom was so astonished that he never said a word but he stared with all his eyes  and he went up to the top of the water too and peeped out to see what would happen  and as the creature sat in the warm bright sun a wonderful change came over it  it grew strong and firm the most lovely colours began to show on its body blue and yellow and black spots and bars and rings out of its back rose four great wings of bright brown gauze and its eyes grew so large that they filled all its head and shone like ten thousand diamonds  oh you beautiful creature said tom and he put out his hand to catch it  but the thing whirred up into the air and hung poised on its wings a moment and then settled down again by tom quite fearless  no it said you cannot catch me  i am a dragonfly now the king of all the flies and i shall dance in the sunshine and hawk over the river and catch gnats and have a beautiful wife like myself  i know what i shall do  hurrah  and he flew away into the air and began catching gnats  oh come back come back cried tom you beautiful creature  i have no one to play with and i am so lonely here  if you will but come back i will never try to catch you  i dont care whether you do or not said the dragonfly for you cant  but when i have had my dinner and looked a little about this pretty place i will come back and have a little chat about all i have seen in my travels  why what a huge tree this is and what huge leaves on it  it was only a big dock  but you know the dragonfly had never seen any but little watertrees starwort and milfoil and water crowfoot and such like so it did look very big to him  besides he was very shortsighted as all dragonflies are and never could see a yard before his nose any more than a great many other folks who are not half as handsome as he  the dragonfly did come back and chatted away with tom  he was a little conceited about his fine colours and his large wings but you know he had been a poor dirty ugly creature all his life before so there were great excuses for him  he was very fond of talking about all the wonderful things he saw in the trees and the meadows and tom liked to listen to him for he had forgotten all about them  so in a little while they became great friends  and i am very glad to say that tom learned such a lesson that day that he did not torment creatures for a long time after  and then the caddises grew quite tame and used to tell him strange stories about the way they built their houses and changed their skins and turned at last into winged flies till tom began to long to change his skin and have wings like them some day  and the trout and he made it up for trout very soon forget if they have been frightened and hurt  so tom used to play with them at hare and hounds and great fun they had and he used to try to leap out of the water head over heels as they did before a shower came on but somehow he never could manage it  he liked most though to see them rising at the flies as they sailed round and round under the shadow of the great oak where the beetles fell flop into the water and the green caterpillars let themselves down from the boughs by silk ropes for no reason at all and then changed their foolish minds for no reason at all either and hauled themselves up again into the tree rolling up the rope in a ball between their paws which is a very clever ropedancers trick and neither blondin nor leotard could do it  but why they should take so much trouble about it no one can tell for they cannot get their living as blondin and leotard do by trying to break their necks on a string  and very often tom caught them just as they touched the water and caught the alderflies and the caperers and the cocktailed duns and spinners yellow and brown and claret and gray and gave them to his friends the trout  perhaps he was not quite kind to the flies but one must do a good turn to ones friends when one can  and at last he gave up catching even the flies for he made acquaintance with one by accident and found him a very merry little fellow  and this was the way it happened and it is all quite true  he was basking at the top of the water one hot day in july catching duns and feeding the trout when he saw a new sort a dark gray little fellow with a brown head  he was a very little fellow indeed  but he made the most of himself as people ought to do he cocked up his head and he cocked up his wings and he cocked up his tail and he cocked up the two whisks at his tailend and in short he looked the cockiest little man of all little men  and so he proved to be for instead of getting away he hopped upon toms finger and sat there as bold as nine tailors and he cried out in the tiniest shrillest squeakiest little voice you ever heard  much obliged to you indeed but i dont want it yet  want what said tom quite taken aback by his impudence  your leg which you are kind enough to hold out for me to sit on i must just go and see after my wife for a few minutes  dear me what a troublesome business a family is though the idle little rogue did nothing at all but left his poor wife to lay all the eggs by herself  when i come back i shall be glad of it if youll be so good as to keep it sticking out just so and off he flew  tom thought him a very cool sort of personage and still more so when in five minutes he came back and saidah you were tired waiting  well your other leg will do as well  and he popped himself down on toms knee and began chatting away in his squeaking voice  so you live under the water  its a low place  i lived there for some time and was very shabby and dirty  but i didnt choose that that should last  so i turned respectable and came up to the top and put on this gray suit  its a very businesslike suit you think dont you  very neat and quiet indeed said tom  yes one must be quiet and neat and respectable and all that sort of thing for a little when one becomes a family man  but im tired of it thats the truth  ive done quite enough business i consider in the last week to last me my life  so i shall put on a ball dress and go out and be a smart man and see the gay world and have a dance or two  why shouldnt one be jolly if one can  and what will become of your wife  oh she is a very plain stupid creature and thats the truth and thinks about nothing but eggs  if she chooses to come why she may and if not why i go without herand here i go  and as he spoke he turned quite pale and then quite white  why youre ill said tom  but he did not answer  youre dead said tom looking at him as he stood on his knee as white as a ghost  no i aint answered a little squeaking voice over his head this is me up here in my balldress and thats my skin  ha ha you could not do such a trick as that  and no more tom could nor houdin nor robin nor frikell nor all the conjurors in the world  for the little rogue had jumped clean out of his own skin and left it standing on toms knee eyes wings legs tail exactly as if it had been alive  ha ha he said and he jerked and skipped up and down never stopping an instant just as if he had st vituss dance  aint i a pretty fellow now  and so he was for his body was white and his tail orange and his eyes all the colours of a peacocks tail  and what was the oddest of all the whisks at the end of his tail had grown five times as long as they were before  ah said he now i will see the gay world  my living wont cost me much for i have no mouth you see and no inside so i can never be hungry nor have the stomachache neither  no more he had  he had grown as dry and hard and empty as a quill as such silly shallowhearted fellows deserve to grow  but instead of being ashamed of his emptiness he was quite proud of it as a good many fine gentlemen are and began flirting and flipping up and down and singing    my wife shall dance and i shall sing so merrily pass the day for i hold it for quite the wisest thing to drive dull care away   and he danced up and down for three days and three nights till he grew so tired that he tumbled into the water and floated down but what became of him tom never knew and he himself never minded for tom heard him singing to the last as he floated down    to drive dull care awayayay   and if he did not care why nobody else cared either  but one day tom had a new adventure  he was sitting on a water lily leaf he and his friend the dragonfly watching the gnats dance  the dragonfly had eaten as many as he wanted and was sitting quite still and sleepy for it was very hot and bright the gnats who did not care the least for their poor brothers death danced a foot over his head quite happily and a large black fly settled within an inch of his nose and began washing his own face and combing his hair with his paws  but the dragonfly never stirred and kept on chatting to tom about the times when he lived under the water  suddenly tom heard the strangest noise up the stream cooing and grunting and whining and squeaking as if you had put into a bag two stockdoves nine mice three guineapigs and a blind puppy and left them there to settle themselves and make music  he looked up the water and there he saw a sight as strange as the noise a great ball rolling over and over down the stream seeming one moment of soft brown fur and the next of shining glass  and yet it was not a ball for sometimes it broke up and streamed away in pieces and then it joined again and all the while the noise came out of it louder and louder  tom asked the dragonfly what it could be  but of course with his short sight he could not even see it though it was not ten yards away  so he took the neatest little header into the water and started off to see for himself and when he came near the ball turned out to be four or five beautiful creatures many times larger than tom who were swimming about and rolling and diving and twisting and wrestling and cuddling and kissing and biting and scratching in the most charming fashion that ever was seen and if you dont believe me you may go to the zoological gardens for i am afraid that you wont see it nearer unless perhaps you get up at five in the morning and go down to corderys moor and watch by the great withy pollard which hangs over the backwater where the otters breed sometimes and then say if otters at play in the water are not the merriest lithest gracefullest creatures you ever saw  but when the biggest of them saw tom she darted out from the rest and cried in the waterlanguage sharply enough quick children here is something to eat indeed and came at poor tom showing such a wicked pair of eyes and such a set of sharp teeth in a grinning mouth that tom who had thought her very handsome said to himself handsome is that handsome does and slipped in between the waterlily roots as fast as he could and then turned round and made faces at her  come out said the wicked old otter or it will be worse for you  but tom looked at her from between two thick roots and shook them with all his might making horrible faces all the while just as he used to grin through the railings at the old women when he lived before  it was not quite well bred no doubt but you know tom had not finished his education yet  come away children said the otter in disgust it is not worth eating after all  it is only a nasty eft which nothing eats not even those vulgar pike in the pond  i am not an eft said tom efts have tails  you are an eft said the otter very positively i see your two hands quite plain and i know you have a tail  i tell you i have not said tom  look here and he turned his pretty little self quite round and sure enough he had no more tail than you  the otter might have got out of it by saying that tom was a frog but like a great many other people when she had once said a thing she stood to it right or wrong so she answered  i say you are an eft and therefore you are and not fit food for gentlefolk like me and my children  you may stay there till the salmon eat you she knew the salmon would not but she wanted to frighten poor tom  ha ha they will eat you and we will eat them and the otter laughed such a wicked cruel laughas you may hear them do sometimes and the first time that you hear it you will probably think it is bogies  what are salmon asked tom  fish you eft great fish nice fish to eat  they are the lords of the fish and we are lords of the salmon and she laughed again  we hunt them up and down the pools and drive them up into a corner the silly things they are so proud and bully the little trout and the minnows till they see us coming and then they are so meek all at once and we catch them but we disdain to eat them all we just bite out their soft throats and suck their sweet juiceoh so goodand she licked her wicked lipsand then throw them away and go and catch another  they are coming soon children coming soon i can smell the rain coming up off the sea and then hurrah for a fresh and salmon and plenty of eating all day long  and the otter grew so proud that she turned head over heels twice and then stood upright half out of the water grinning like a cheshire cat  and where do they come from asked tom who kept himself very close for he was considerably frightened  out of the sea eft the great wide sea where they might stay and be safe if they liked  but out of the sea the silly things come into the great river down below and we come up to watch for them and when they go down again we go down and follow them  and there we fish for the bass and the pollock and have jolly days along the shore and toss and roll in the breakers and sleep snug in the warm dry crags  ah that is a merry life too children if it were not for those horrid men  what are men asked tom but somehow he seemed to know before he asked  twolegged things eft  and now i come to look at you they are actually something like you if you had not a tail she was determined that tom should have a tail only a great deal bigger worse luck for us and they catch the fish with hooks and lines which get into our feet sometimes and set pots along the rocks to catch lobsters  they speared my poor dear husband as he went out to find something for me to eat  i was laid up among the crags then and we were very low in the world for the sea was so rough that no fish would come in shore  but they speared him poor fellow and i saw them carrying him away upon a pole  all he lost his life for your sakes my children poor dear obedient creature that he was  and the otter grew so sentimental for otters can be very sentimental when they choose like a good many people who are both cruel and greedy and no good to anybody at all that she sailed solemnly away down the burn and tom saw her no more for that time and lucky it was for her that she did so for no sooner was she gone than down the bank came seven little rough terrier doors snuffing and yapping and grubbing and splashing in full cry after the otter  tom hid among the waterlilies till they were gone for he could not guess that they were the waterfairies come to help him  but he could not help thinking of what the otter had said about the great river and the broad sea  and as he thought he longed to go and see them  he could not tell why but the more he thought the more he grew discontented with the narrow little stream in which he lived and all his companions there and wanted to get out into the wide wide world and enjoy all the wonderful sights of which he was sure it was full  and once he set off to go down the stream  but the stream was very low and when he came to the shallows he could not keep under water for there was no water left to keep under  so the sun burned his back and made him sick and he went back again and lay quiet in the pool for a whole week more  and then on the evening of a very hot day he saw a sight  he had been very stupid all day and so had the trout for they would not move an inch to take a fly though there were thousands on the water but lay dozing at the bottom under the shade of the stones and tom lay dozing too and was glad to cuddle their smooth cool sides for the water was quite warm and unpleasant  but toward evening it grew suddenly dark and tom looked up and saw a blanket of black clouds lying right across the valley above his head resting on the crags right and left  he felt not quite frightened but very still for everything was still  there was not a whisper of wind nor a chirp of a bird to be heard and next a few great drops of rain fell plop into the water and one hit tom on the nose and made him pop his head down quickly enough  and then the thunder roared and the lightning flashed and leapt across vendale and back again from cloud to cloud and cliff to cliff till the very rocks in the stream seemed to shake  and tom looked up at it through the water and thought it the finest thing he ever saw in his life  but out of the water he dared not put his head for the rain came down by bucketsful and the hail hammered like shot on the stream and churned it into foam and soon the stream rose and rushed down higher and higher and fouler and fouler full of beetles and sticks and straws and worms and addleeggs and woodlice and leeches and odds and ends and omniumgatherums and this that and the other enough to fill nine museums  tom could hardly stand against the stream and hid behind a rock but the trout did not for out they rushed from among the stones and began gobbling the beetles and leeches in the most greedy and quarrelsome way and swimming about with great worms hanging out of their mouths tugging and kicking to get them away from each other  and now by the flashes of the lightning tom saw a new sightall the bottom of the stream alive with great eels turning and twisting along all down stream and away  they had been hiding for weeks past in the cracks of the rocks and in burrows in the mud and tom had hardly ever seen them except now and then at night but now they were all out and went hurrying past him so fiercely and wildly that he was quite frightened  and as they hurried past he could hear them say to each other we must run we must run what a jolly thunderstorm  down to the sea down to the sea  and then the otter came by with all her brood twining and sweeping along as fast as the eels themselves and she spied tom as she came by and said now is your time eft if you want to see the world come along children never mind those nasty eels  we shall breakfast on salmon tomorrow  down to the sea down to the sea  then came a flash brighter than all the rest and by the light of itin the thousandth part of a second they were gone againbut he had seen them he was certain of itthree beautiful little white girls with their arms twined round each others necks floating down the torrent as they sang down to the sea down to the sea  oh stay  wait for me cried tom but they were gone  yet he could hear their voices clear and sweet through the roar of thunder and water and wind singing as they died away down to the sea  down to the sea said tom everything is going to the sea and i will go too  goodbye trout  but the trout were so busy gobbling worms that they never turned to answer him so that tom was spared the pain of bidding them farewell  and now down the rushing stream guided by the bright flashes of the storm past tall birchfringed rocks which shone out one moment as clear as day and the next were dark as night past dark hovers under swirling banks from which great trout rushed out on tom thinking him to be good to eat and turned back sulkily for the fairies sent them home again with a tremendous scolding for daring to meddle with a waterbaby on through narrow strids and roaring cataracts where tom was deafened and blinded for a moment by the rushing waters along deep reaches where the white water lilies tossed and flapped beneath the wind and hail past sleeping villages under dark bridgearches and away and away to the sea and tom could not stop and did not care to stop he would see the great world below and the salmon and the breakers and the wide wide sea  and when the daylight came tom found himself out in the salmon river  and what sort of a river was it  was it like an irish stream winding through the brown bogs where the wild ducks squatter up from among the white waterlilies and the curlews flit to and fro crying tulliewheep mind your sheep and dennis tells you strange stories of the peishtamore the great bogysnake which lies in the black peat pools among the old pinestems and puts his head out at night to snap at the cattle as they come down to drinkbut you must not believe all that dennis tells you mind for if you ask him  is there a salmon here do you think dennis  is it salmon thin your honour manes  salmon  cartloads it is of thim thin an ridgmens shouldthering ache out of water av yed but the luck to see thim  then you fish the pool all over and never get a rise  but there cant be a salmon here dennis and if youll but think if one had come up last tide hed be gone to the higher pools by now  shure thin and your honours the thrue fisherman and understands it all like a book  why ye spake as if yed known the wather a thousand years  as i said how could there be a fish here at all just now  but you said just now they were shouldering each other out of water  and then dennis will look up at you with his handsome sly soft sleepy goodnatured untrustable irish gray eye and answer with the prettiest smile  shure and didnt i think your honour would like a pleasant answer  so you must not trust dennis because he is in the habit of giving pleasant answers  but instead of being angry with him you must remember that he is a poor paddy and knows no better so you must just burst out laughing and then he will burst out laughing too and slave for you and trot about after you and show you good sport if he canfor he is an affectionate fellow and as fond of sport as you areand if he cant tell you fibs instead a hundred an hour and wonder all the while why poor ould ireland does not prosper like england and scotland and some other places where folk have taken up a ridiculous fancy that honesty is the best policy  or was it like a welsh salmon river which is remarkable chiefly at least till this last year for containing no salmon as they have been all poached out by the enlightened peasantry to prevent the cythrawl sassenach which means you my little dear your kith and kin and signifies much the same as the chinese fan quei from coming bothering into wales with good tackle and ready money and civilisation and common honesty and other like things of which the cymry stand in no need whatsoever  or was it such a salmon stream as i trust you will see among the hampshire watermeadows before your hairs are gray under the wise new fishinglawswhen winchester apprentices shall covenant as they did three hundred years ago not to be made to eat salmon more than three days a week and freshrun fish shall be as plentiful under salisbury spire as they are in hollyhole at christchurch in the good time coming when folks shall see that of all heavens gifts of food the one to be protected most carefully is that worthy gentleman salmon who is generous enough to go down to the sea weighing five ounces and to come back next year weighing five pounds without having cost the soil or the state one farthing  or was it like a scotch stream such as arthur clough drew in his bothie   where over a ledge of granite into a granite bason the amber torrent descended     beautiful there for the colour derived from green rocks under beautiful most of all where beads of foam uprising mingle their clouds of white with the delicate hue of the stillness    cliff over cliff for its sides with rowan and pendant birch boughs      ah my little man when you are a big man and fish such a stream as that you will hardly care i think whether she be roaring down in full spate like coffee covered with scald cream while the fish are swirling at your fly as an oarblade swirls in a boatrace or flashing up the cataract like silver arrows out of the fiercest of the foam or whether the fall be dwindled to a single thread and the shingle below be as white and dusty as a turnpike road while the salmon huddle together in one dark cloud in the clear amber pool sleeping away their time till the rain creeps back again off the sea  you will not care much if you have eyes and brains for you will lay down your rod contentedly and drink in at your eyes the beauty of that glorious place and listen to the waterouzel piping on the stones and watch the yellow roes come down to drink and look up at you with their great soft trustful eyes as much as to say you could not have the heart to shoot at us  and then if you have sense you will turn and talk to the great giant of a gilly who lies basking on the stone beside you  he will tell you no fibs my little man for he is a scotchman and fears god and not the priest and as you talk with him you will be surprised more and more at his knowledge his sense his humour his courtesy and you will find outunless you have found it out beforethat a man may learn from his bible to be a more thorough gentleman than if he had been brought up in all the drawingrooms in london  no  it was none of these the salmon stream at harthover  it was such a stream as you see in dear old bewick bewick who was born and bred upon them  a full hundred yards broad it was sliding on from broad pool to broad shallow and broad shallow to broad pool over great fields of shingle under oak and ash coverts past low cliffs of sandstone past green meadows and fair parks and a great house of gray stone and brown moors above and here and there against the sky the smoking chimney of a colliery  you must look at bewick to see just what it was like for he has drawn it a hundred times with the care and the love of a true north countryman and even if you do not care about the salmon river you ought like all good boys to know your bewick  at least so old sir john used to say and very sensibly he put it too as he was wont to do  if they want to describe a finished young gentleman in france i hear they say of him il sait son rabelais  but if i want to describe one in england i say he knows his bewick  and i think that is the higher compliment  but tom thought nothing about what the river was like  all his fancy was to get down to the wide wide sea  and after a while he came to a place where the river spread out into broad still shallow reaches so wide that little tom as he put his head out of the water could hardly see across  and there he stopped  he got a little frightened  this must be the sea he thought  what a wide place it is  if i go on into it i shall surely lose my way or some strange thing will bite me i will stop here and look out for the otter or the eels or some one to tell me where i shall go  so he went back a little way and crept into a crack of the rock just where the river opened out into the wide shallows and watched for some one to tell him his way  but the otter and the eels were gone on miles and miles down the stream  there he waited and slept too for he was quite tired with his nights journey and when he woke the stream was clearing to a beautiful amber hue though it was still very high  and after a while he saw a sight which made him jump up for he knew in a moment it was one of the things which he had come to look for  such a fish ten times as big as the biggest trout and a hundred times as big as tom sculling up the stream past him as easily as tom had sculled down  such a fish shining silver from head to tail and here and there a crimson dot with a grand hooked nose and grand curling lip and a grand bright eye looking round him as proudly as a king and surveying the water right and left as if all belonged to him surely he must be the salmon the king of all the fish  tom was so frightened that he longed to creep into a hole but he need not have been for salmon are all true gentlemen and like true gentlemen they look noble and proud enough and yet like true gentlemen they never harm or quarrel with any one but go about their own business and leave rude fellows to themselves  the salmon looked at him full in the face and then went on without minding him with a swish or two of his tail which made the stream boil again and in a few minutes came another and then four or five and so on and all passed tom rushing and plunging up the cataract with strong strokes of their silver tails now and then leaping clean out of water and up over a rock shining gloriously for a moment in the bright sun while tom was so delighted that he could have watched them all day long  and at last one came up bigger than all the rest but he came slowly and stopped and looked back and seemed very anxious and busy  and tom saw that he was helping another salmon an especially handsome one who had not a single spot upon it but was clothed in pure silver from nose to tail  my dear said the great fish to his companion you really look dreadfully tired and you must not overexert yourself at first do rest yourself behind this rock and he shoved her gently with his nose to the rock where tom sat  you must know that this was the salmons wife  for salmon like other true gentlemen always choose their lady and love her and are true to her and take care of her and work for her and fight for her as every true gentleman ought and are not like vulgar chub and roach and pike who have no high feelings and take no care of their wives  then he saw tom and looked at him very fiercely one moment as if he was going to bite him  what do you want here he said very fiercely  oh dont hurt me cried tom  i only want to look at you you are so handsome  ah said the salmon very stately but very civilly  i really beg your pardon i see what you are my little dear  i have met one or two creatures like you before and found them very agreeable and wellbehaved  indeed one of them showed me a great kindness lately which i hope to be able to repay  i hope we shall not be in your way here  as soon as this lady is rested we shall proceed on our journey  what a wellbred old salmon he was  so you have seen things like me before asked tom  several times my dear  indeed it was only last night that one at the rivers mouth came and warned me and my wife of some new stakenets which had got into the stream i cannot tell how since last winter and showed us the way round them in the most charmingly obliging way  so there are babies in the sea cried tom and clapped his little hands  then i shall have some one to play with there  how delightful  were there no babies up this stream asked the lady salmon  no and i grew so lonely  i thought i saw three last night but they were gone in an instant down to the sea  so i went too for i had nothing to play with but caddises and dragonflies and trout  ugh cried the lady what low company  my dear if he has been in low company he has certainly not learnt their low manners said the salmon  no indeed poor little dear  but how sad for him to live among such people as caddises who have actually six legs the nasty things and dragonflies too why they are not even good to eat for i tried them once and they are all hard and empty and as for trout every one knows what they are  whereon she curled up her lip and looked dreadfully scornful while her husband curled up his too till he looked as proud as alcibiades  why do you dislike the trout so asked tom  my dear we do not even mention them if we can help it for i am sorry to say they are relations of ours who do us no credit  a great many years ago they were just like us  but they were so lazy and cowardly and greedy that instead of going down to the sea every year to see the world and grow strong and fat they chose to stay and poke about in the little streams and eat worms and grubs and they are very properly punished for it for they have grown ugly and brown and spotted and small and are actually so degraded in their tastes that they will eat our children  and then they pretend to scrape acquaintance with us again said the lady  why i have actually known one of them propose to a lady salmon the little impudent little creature  i should hope said the gentleman that there are very few ladies of our race who would degrade themselves by listening to such a creature for an instant  if i saw such a thing happen i should consider it my duty to put them both to death upon the spot  so the old salmon said like an old blueblooded hidalgo of spain and what is more he would have done it too  for you must know no enemies are so bitter against each other as those who are of the same race and a salmon looks on a trout as some great folks look on some little folks as something just too much like himself to be tolerated    chapter iv    sweet is the lore which nature brings our meddling intellect misshapes the beauteous forms of things we murder to dissect  enough of science and of art close up these barren leaves come forth and bring with you a heart that watches and receives  wordsworth   so the salmon went up after tom had warned them of the wicked old otter and tom went down but slowly and cautiously coasting along shore  he was many days about it for it was many miles down to the sea and perhaps he would never have found his way if the fairies had not guided him without his seeing their fair faces or feeling their gentle hands  and as he went he had a very strange adventure  it was a clear still september night and the moon shone so brightly down through the water that he could not sleep though he shut his eyes as tight as possible  so at last he came up to the top and sat upon a little point of rock and looked up at the broad yellow moon and wondered what she was and thought that she looked at him  and he watched the moonlight on the rippling river and the black heads of the firs and the silverfrosted lawns and listened to the owls hoot and the snipes bleat and the foxs bark and the otters laugh and smelt the soft perfume of the birches and the wafts of heather honey off the grouse moor far above and felt very happy though he could not well tell why  you of course would have been very cold sitting there on a september night without the least bit of clothes on your wet back but tom was a waterbaby and therefore felt cold no more than a fish  suddenly he saw a beautiful sight  a bright red light moved along the riverside and threw down into the water a long taproot of flame  tom curious little rogue that he was must needs go and see what it was so he swam to the shore and met the light as it stopped over a shallow run at the edge of a low rock  and there underneath the light lay five or six great salmon looking up at the flame with their great goggle eyes and wagging their tails as if they were very much pleased at it  tom came to the top to look at this wonderful light nearer and made a splash  and he heard a voice say  there was a fish rose  he did not know what the words meant  but he seemed to know the sound of them and to know the voice which spoke them and he saw on the bank three great twolegged creatures one of whom held the light flaring and sputtering and another a long pole  and he knew that they were men and was frightened and crept into a hole in the rock from which he could see what went on  the man with the torch bent down over the water and looked earnestly in and then he said  tak that muckle fellow lad hes ower fifteen punds and haud your hand steady  tom felt that there was some danger coming and longed to warn the foolish salmon who kept staring up at the light as if he was bewitched  but before he could make up his mind down came the pole through the water there was a fearful splash and struggle and tom saw that the poor salmon was speared right through and was lifted out of the water  and then from behind there sprang on these three men three other men and there were shouts and blows and words which tom recollected to have heard before and he shuddered and turned sick at them now for he felt somehow that they were strange and ugly and wrong and horrible  and it all began to come back to him they were men and they were fighting savage desperate upand down fighting such as tom had seen too many times before  and he stopped his little ears and longed to swim away and was very glad that he was a waterbaby and had nothing to do any more with horrid dirty men with foul clothes on their backs and foul words on their lips but he dared not stir out of his hole  while the rock shook over his head with the trampling and struggling of the keepers and the poachers  all of a sudden there was a tremendous splash and a frightful flash and a hissing and all was still  for into the water close to tom fell one of the men he who held the light in his hand  into the swift river he sank and rolled over and over in the current  tom heard the men above run along seemingly looking for him but he drifted down into the deep hole below and there lay quite still and they could not find him  tom waited a long time till all was quiet and then he peeped out and saw the man lying  at last he screwed up his courage and swam down to him  perhaps he thought the water has made him fall asleep as it did me  then he went nearer  he grew more and more curious he could not tell why  he must go and look at him  he would go very quietly of course so he swam round and round him closer and closer and as he did not stir at last he came quite close and looked him in the face  the moon shone so bright that tom could see every feature and as he saw he recollected bit by bit it was his old master grimes  tom turned tail and swam away as fast as he could  oh dear me he thought now he will turn into a waterbaby what a nasty troublesome one he will be  and perhaps he will find me out and beat me again  so he went up the river again a little way and lay there the rest of the night under an alder root but when morning came he longed to go down again to the big pool and see whether mr grimes had turned into a waterbaby yet  so he went very carefully peeping round all the rocks and hiding under all the roots  mr grimes lay there still he had not turned into a waterbaby  in the afternoon tom went back again  he could not rest till he had found out what had become of mr grimes  but this time mr grimes was gone and tom made up his mind that he was turned into a waterbaby  he might have made himself easy poor little man mr grimes did not turn into a waterbaby or anything like one at all  but he did not make himself easy and a long time he was fearful lest he should meet grimes suddenly in some deep pool  he could not know that the fairies had carried him away and put him where they put everything which falls into the water exactly where it ought to be  but do you know what had happened to mr grimes had such an effect on him that he never poached salmon any more  and it is quite certain that when a man becomes a confirmed poacher the only way to cure him is to put him under water for twentyfour hours like grimes  so when you grow to be a big man do you behave as all honest fellows should and never touch a fish or a head of game which belongs to another man without his express leave and then people will call you a gentleman and treat you like one and perhaps give you good sport  instead of hitting you into the river or calling you a poaching snob  then tom went on down for he was afraid of staying near grimes and as he went all the vale looked sad  the red and yellow leaves showered down into the river the flies and beetles were all dead and gone the chill autumn fog lay low upon the hills and sometimes spread itself so thickly on the river that he could not see his way  but he felt his way instead following the flow of the stream day after day past great bridges past boats and barges past the great town with its wharfs and mills and tall smoking chimneys and ships which rode at anchor in the stream and now and then he ran against their hawsers and wondered what they were and peeped out and saw the sailors lounging on board smoking their pipes and ducked under again for he was terribly afraid of being caught by man and turned into a chimneysweep once more  he did not know that the fairies were close to him always shutting the sailors eyes lest they should see him and turning him aside from millraces and sewermouths and all foul and dangerous things  poor little fellow it was a dreary journey for him and more than once he longed to be back in vendale playing with the trout in the bright summer sun  but it could not be  what has been once can never come over again  and people can be little babies even waterbabies only once in their lives  besides people who make up their minds to go and see the world as tom did must needs find it a weary journey  lucky for them if they do not lose heart and stop halfway instead of going on bravely to the end as tom did  for then they will remain neither boys nor men neither fish flesh nor good redherring  having learnt a great deal too much and yet not enough and sown their wild oats without having the advantage of reaping them  but tom was always a brave determined little english bulldog who never knew when he was beaten and on and on he held till he saw a long way off the red buoy through the fog  and then he found to his surprise the stream turned round and running up inland  it was the tide of course  but tom knew nothing of the tide  he only knew that in a minute more the water which had been fresh turned salt all round him  and then there came a change over him he felt as strong and light and fresh as if his veins had run champagne and gave he did not know why three skips out of the water a yard high and head over heels just as the salmon do when they first touch the noble rich salt water which as some wise men tell us is the mother of all living things  he did not care now for the tide being against him  the red buoy was in sight dancing in the open sea and to the buoy he would go and to it he went  he passed great shoals of bass and mullet leaping and rushing in after the shrimps but he never heeded them or they him and once he passed a great black shining seal who was coming in after the mullet  the seal put his head and shoulders out of water and stared at him looking exactly like a fat old greasy negro with a gray pate  and tom instead of being frightened said how dye do sir what a beautiful place the sea is  and the old seal instead of trying to bite him looked at him with his soft sleepy winking eyes and said good tide to you my little man are you looking for your brothers and sisters  i passed them all at play outside  oh then said tom i shall have playfellows at last and he swam on to the buoy and got upon it for he was quite out of breath and sat there and looked round for waterbabies  but there were none to be seen  the seabreeze came in freshly with the tide and blew the fog away and the little waves danced for joy around the buoy and the old buoy danced with them  the shadows of the clouds ran races over the bright blue bay and yet never caught each other up and the breakers plunged merrily upon the wide white sands and jumped up over the rocks to see what the green fields inside were like and tumbled down and broke themselves all to pieces and never minded it a bit but mended themselves and jumped up again  and the terns hovered over tom like huge white dragonflies with black heads and the gulls laughed like girls at play and the seapies with their red bills and legs flew to and fro from shore to shore and whistled sweet and wild  and tom looked and looked and listened and he would have been very happy if he could only have seen the waterbabies  then when the tide turned he left the buoy and swam round and round in search of them  but in vain  sometimes he thought he heard them laughing  but it was only the laughter of the ripples  and sometimes he thought he saw them at the bottom but it was only white and pink shells  and once he was sure he had found one for he saw two bright eyes peeping out of the sand  so he dived down and began scraping the sand away and cried dont hide i do want some one to play with so much  and out jumped a great turbot with his ugly eyes and mouth all awry and flopped away along the bottom knocking poor tom over  and he sat down at the bottom of the sea and cried salt tears from sheer disappointment  to have come all this way and faced so many dangers and yet to find no waterbabies  how hard  well it did seem hard  but people even little babies cannot have all they want without waiting for it and working for it too my little man as you will find out some day  and tom sat upon the buoy long days long weeks looking out to sea and wondering when the waterbabies would come back and yet they never came  then he began to ask all the strange things which came in out of the sea if they had seen any and some said yes and some said nothing at all  he asked the bass and the pollock but they were so greedy after the shrimps that they did not care to answer him a word  then there came in a whole fleet of purple seasnails floating along each on a sponge full of foam and tom said where do you come from you pretty creatures and have you seen the water babies  and the seasnails answered whence we come we know not and whither we are going who can tell  we float out our life in the midocean with the warm sunshine above our heads and the warm gulfstream below and that is enough for us  yes perhaps we have seen the waterbabies  we have seen many strange things as we sailed along  and they floated away the happy stupid things and all went ashore upon the sands  then there came in a great lazy sunfish as big as a fat pig cut in half and he seemed to have been cut in half too and squeezed in a clothespress till he was flat but to all his big body and big fins he had only a little rabbits mouth no bigger than toms and when tom questioned him he answered in a little squeaky feeble voice  im sure i dont know ive lost my way  i meant to go to the chesapeake and im afraid ive got wrong somehow  dear me it was all by following that pleasant warm water  im sure ive lost my way  and when tom asked him again he could only answer ive lost my way  dont talk to me i want to think  but like a good many other people the more he tried to think the less he could think and tom saw him blundering about all day till the coastguardsmen saw his big fin above the water and rowed out and struck a boathook into him and took him away  they took him up to the town and showed him for a penny a head and made a good days work of it  but of course tom did not know that  then there came by a shoal of porpoises rolling as they went papas and mammas and little childrenand all quite smooth and shiny because the fairies frenchpolish them every morning and they sighed so softly as they came by that tom took courage to speak to them  but all they answered was hush hush hush for that was all they had learnt to say  and then there came a shoal of basking sharks some of them as long as a boat and tom was frightened at them  but they were very lazy goodnatured fellows not greedy tyrants like white sharks and blue sharks and ground sharks and hammerheads who eat men or sawfish and threshers and icesharks who hunt the poor old whales  they came and rubbed their great sides against the buoy and lay basking in the sun with their backfins out of water and winked at tom  but he never could get them to speak  they had eaten so many herrings that they were quite stupid and tom was glad when a collier brig came by and frightened them all away for they did smell most horribly certainly and he had to hold his nose tight as long as they were there  and then there came by a beautiful creature like a ribbon of pure silver with a sharp head and very long teeth but it seemed very sick and sad  sometimes it rolled helpless on its side and then it dashed away glittering like white fire and then it lay sick again and motionless  where do you come from asked tom  and why are you so sick and sad  i come from the warm carolinas and the sandbanks fringed with pines where the great owlrays leap and flap like giant bats upon the tide  but i wandered north and north upon the treacherous warm gulfstream till i met with the cold icebergs afloat in the mid ocean  so i got tangled among the icebergs and chilled with their frozen breath  but the waterbabies helped me from among them and set me free again  and now i am mending every day but i am very sick and sad and perhaps i shall never get home again to play with the owlrays any more  oh cried tom  and you have seen waterbabies  have you seen any near here  yes they helped me again last night or i should have been eaten by a great black porpoise  how vexatious  the waterbabies close to him and yet he could not find one  and then he left the buoy and used to go along the sands and round the rocks and come out in the nightlike the forsaken merman in mr arnolds beautiful beautiful poem which you must learn by heart some dayand sit upon a point of rock among the shining seaweeds in the low october tides and cry and call for the waterbabies but he never heard a voice call in return  and at last with his fretting and crying he grew quite lean and thin  but one day among the rocks he found a playfellow  it was not a waterbaby alas but it was a lobster and a very distinguished lobster he was for he had live barnacles on his claws which is a great mark of distinction in lobsterdom and no more to be bought for money than a good conscience or the victoria cross  tom had never seen a lobster before and he was mightily taken with this one for he thought him the most curious odd ridiculous creature he had ever seen and there he was not far wrong for all the ingenious men and all the scientific men and all the fanciful men in the world with all the old german bogypainters into the bargain could never invent if all their wits were boiled into one anything so curious and so ridiculous as a lobster  he had one claw knobbed and the other jagged and tom delighted in watching him hold on to the seaweed with his knobbed claw while he cut up salads with his jagged one and then put them into his mouth after smelling at them like a monkey  and always the little barnacles threw out their castingnets and swept the water and came in for their share of whatever there was for dinner  but tom was most astonished to see how he fired himself offsnap like the leapfrogs which you make out of a gooses breastbone certainly he took the most wonderful shots and backwards too for if he wanted to go into a narrow crack ten yards off what do you think he did  if he had gone in head foremost of course he could not have turned round  so he used to turn his tail to it and lay his long horns which carry his sixth sense in their tips and nobody knows what that sixth sense is straight down his back to guide him and twist his eyes back till they almost came out of their sockets and then made ready present fire snapand away he went pop into the hole and peeped out and twiddled his whiskers as much as to say you couldnt do that  tom asked him about waterbabies  yes he said  he had seen them often  but he did not think much of them  they were meddlesome little creatures that went about helping fish and shells which got into scrapes  well for his part he should be ashamed to be helped by little soft creatures that had not even a shell on their backs  he had lived quite long enough in the world to take care of himself  he was a conceited fellow the old lobster and not very civil to tom and you will hear how he had to alter his mind before he was done as conceited people generally have  but he was so funny and tom so lonely that he could not quarrel with him and they used to sit in holes in the rocks and chat for hours  and about this time there happened to tom a very strange and important adventureso important indeed that he was very near never finding the waterbabies at all and i am sure you would have been sorry for that  i hope that you have not forgotten the little white lady all this while  at least here she comes looking like a clean white good little darling as she always was and always will be  for it befell in the pleasant short december days when the wind always blows from the southwest till old father christmas comes and spreads the great white tablecloth ready for little boys and girls to give the birds their christmas dinner of crumbsit befell to go on in the pleasant december days that sir john was so busy hunting that nobody at home could get a word out of him  four days a week he hunted and very good sport he had and the other two he went to the bench and the board of guardians and very good justice he did and when he got home in time he dined at five for he hated this absurd new fashion of dining at eight in the hunting season which forces a man to make interest with the footman for cold beef and beer as soon as he comes in and so spoil his appetite and then sleep in an armchair in his bedroom all stiff and tired for two or three hours before he can get his dinner like a gentleman  and do you be like sir john my dear little man when you are your own master and if you want either to read hard or ride hard stick to the good old cambridge hours of breakfast at eight and dinner at five by which you may get two days work out of one  but of course if you find a fox at three in the afternoon and run him till dark and leave off twenty miles from home why you must wait for your dinner till you can get it as better men than you have done  only see that if you go hungry your horse does not but give him his warm gruel and beer and take him gently home remembering that good horses dont grow on the hedge like blackberries  it befell to go on a second time that sir john hunting all day and dining at five fell asleep every evening and snored so terribly that all the windows in harthover shook and the soot fell down the chimneys  whereon my lady being no more able to get conversation out of him than a song out of a dead nightingale determined to go off and leave him and the doctor and captain swinger the agent to snore in concert every evening to their hearts content  so she started for the seaside with all the children in order to put herself and them into condition by mild applications of iodine  she might as well have stayed at home and used parrys liquid horseblister for there was plenty of it in the stables and then she would have saved her money and saved the chance also of making all the children ill instead of well as hundreds are made by taking them to some nasty smelling undrained lodging and then wondering how they caught scarlatina and diphtheria  but people wont be wise enough to understand that till they are dead of bad smells and then it will be too late besides you see sir john did certainly snore very loud  but where she went to nobody must know for fear young ladies should begin to fancy that there are waterbabies there and so hunt and howk after them besides raising the price of lodgings and keep them in aquariums as the ladies at pompeii as you may see by the paintings used to keep cupids in cages  but nobody ever heard that they starved the cupids or let them die of dirt and neglect as english young ladies do by the poor seabeasts  so nobody must know where my lady went  letting waterbabies die is as bad as taking singing birds eggs for though there are thousands ay millions of both of them in the world yet there is not one too many  now it befell that on the very shore and over the very rocks where tom was sitting with his friend the lobster there walked one day the little white lady ellie herself and with her a very wise man indeedprofessor ptthmllnsprts  his mother was a dutchwoman and therefore he was born at curacao of course you have learnt your geography and therefore know why and his father a pole and therefore he was brought up at petropaulowski of course you have learnt your modern politics and therefore know why  but for all that he was as thorough an englishman as ever coveted his neighbours goods  and his name as i said was professor ptthmllnsprts which is a very ancient and noble polish name  he was as i said a very great naturalist and chief professor of necrobioneopalaeonthydrochthonanthropopithekology in the new university which the king of the cannibal islands had founded and being a member of the acclimatisation society he had come here to collect all the nasty things which he could find on the coast of england and turn them loose round the cannibal islands because they had not nasty things enough there to eat what they left  but he was a very worthy kind goodnatured little old gentleman and very fond of children for he was not the least a cannibal himself and very good to all the world as long as it was good to him  only one fault he had which cockrobins have likewise as you may see if you look out of the nursery windowthat when any one else found a curious worm he would hop round them and peck them and set up his tail and bristle up his feathers just as a cockrobin would and declare that he found the worm first and that it was his worm and if not that then it was not a worm at all  he had met sir john at scarborough or fleetwood or somewhere or other if you dont care where nobody else does and had made acquaintance with him and become very fond of his children  now sir john knew nothing about seacockyolybirds and cared less provided the fishmonger sent him good fish for dinner and my lady knew as little  but she thought it proper that the children should know something  for in the stupid old times you must understand children were taught to know one thing and to know it well but in these enlightened new times they are taught to know a little about everything and to know it all ill which is a great deal pleasanter and easier and therefore quite right  so ellie and he were walking on the rocks and he was showing her about one in ten thousand of all the beautiful and curious things which are to be seen there  but little ellie was not satisfied with them at all  she liked much better to play with live children or even with dolls which she could pretend were alive and at last she said honestly i dont care about all these things because they cant play with me or talk to me  if there were little children now in the water as there used to be and i could see them i should like that  children in the water you strange little duck said the professor  yes said ellie  i know there used to be children in the water and mermaids too and mermen  i saw them all in a picture at home of a beautiful lady sailing in a car drawn by dolphins and babies flying round her and one sitting in her lap and the mermaids swimming and playing and the mermen trumpeting on conchshells and it is called the triumph of galatea and there is a burning mountain in the picture behind  it hangs on the great staircase and i have looked at it ever since i was a baby and dreamt about it a hundred times and it is so beautiful that it must be true  but the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things were true merely because people thought them beautiful  for at that rate he said the baltas would be quite right in thinking it a fine thing to eat their grandpapas because they thought it an ugly thing to put them underground  the professor indeed went further and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be true but what he could see hear taste or handle  he held very strange theories about a good many things  he had even got up once at the british association and declared that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have  which was a shocking thing to say for if it were so what would become of the faith hope and charity of immortal millions  you may think that there are other more important differences between you and an ape such as being able to speak and make machines and know right from wrong and say your prayers and other little matters of that kind but that is a childs fancy my dear nothing is to be depended on but the great hippopotamus test  if you have a hippopotamus major in your brain you are no ape though you had four hands no feet and were more apish than the apes of all aperies  but if a hippopotamus major is ever discovered in one single apes brain nothing will save your greatgreatgreatgreat greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatergreatest grandmother from having been an ape too  no my dear little man always remember that the one true certain final and all important difference between you and an ape is that you have a hippopotamus major in your brain and it has none and that therefore to discover one in its brain will be a very wrong and dangerous thing at which every one will be very much shocked as we may suppose they were at the professorthough really after all it dont much matter becauseas lord dundreary and others would put itnobody but men have hippopotamuses in their brains so if a hippopotamus was discovered in an apes brain why it would not be one you know but something else  but the professor had gone i am sorry to say even further than that for he had read at the british association at melbourne australia in the year 1999 a paper which assured every one who found himself the better or wiser for the news that there were not never had been and could not be any rational or half rational beings except men anywhere anywhen or anyhow that nymphs satyrs fauns inui dwarfs trolls elves gnomes fairies brownies nixes wills kobolds leprechaunes cluricaunes banshees willothewisps follets lutins magots goblins afrits marids jinns ghouls peris deevs angels archangels imps bogies or worse were nothing at all and pure bosh and wind  and he had to get up very early in the morning to prove that and to eat his breakfast overnight but he did it at least to his own satisfaction  whereon a certain great divine and a very clever divine was he called him a regular sadducee and probably he was quite right  whereon the professor in return called him a regular pharisee and probably he was quite right too but they did not quarrel in the least for when men are men of the world hard words run off them like water off a ducks back  so the professor and the divine met at dinner that evening and sat together on the sofa afterwards for an hour and talked over the state of female labour on the antarctic continent for nobody talks shop after his claret and each vowed that the other was the best company he ever met in his life  what an advantage it is to be men of the world  from all which you may guess that the professor was not the least of little ellies opinion  so he gave her a succinct compendium of his famous paper at the british association in a form suited for the youthful mind  but as we have gone over his arguments against waterbabies once already which is once too often we will not repeat them here  now little ellie was i suppose a stupid little girl for instead of being convinced by professor ptthmllnsprts arguments she only asked the same question over again  but why are there not waterbabies  i trust and hope that it was because the professor trod at that moment on the edge of a very sharp mussel and hurt one of his corns sadly that he answered quite sharply forgetting that he was a scientific man and therefore ought to have known that he couldnt know and that he was a logician and therefore ought to have known that he could not prove a universal negativei say i trust and hope it was because the mussel hurt his corn that the professor answered quite sharply  because there aint  which was not even good english my dear little boy for as you must know from aunt agitates arguments the professor ought to have said if he was so angry as to say anything of the kind because there are not  or are none  or are none of them or if he had been reading aunt agitate too because they do not exist  and he groped with his net under the weeds so violently that as it befell he caught poor little tom  he felt the net very heavy and lifted it out quickly with tom all entangled in the meshes  dear me he cried  what a large pink holothurian with hands too  it must be connected with synapta  and he took him out  it has actually eyes he cried  why it must be a cephalopod this is most extraordinary  no i aint cried tom as loud as he could for he did not like to be called bad names  it is a waterbaby cried ellie and of course it was  waterfiddlesticks my dear said the professor and he turned away sharply  there was no denying it  it was a waterbaby  and he had said a moment ago that there were none  what was he to do  he would have liked of course to have taken tom home in a bucket he would not have put him in spirits  of course not  he would have kept him alive and petted him for he was a very kind old gentleman and written a book about him and given him two long names of which the first would have said a little about tom and the second all about himself for of course he would have called him hydrotecnon ptthmllnsprtsianum or some other long name like that for they are forced to call everything by long names now because they have used up all the short ones ever since they took to making nine species out of one  butwhat would all the learned men say to him after his speech at the british association  and what would ellie say after what he had just told her  there was a wise old heathen once who said maxima debetur pueris reverentiathe greatest reverence is due to children that is that grown people should never say or do anything wrong before children lest they should set them a bad examplecousin cramchild says it means the greatest respectfulness is expected from little boys  but he was raised in a country where little boys are not expected to be respectful because all of them are as good as the president well every one knows his own concerns best so perhaps they are  but poor cousin cramchild to do him justice not being of that opinion and having a moral mission and being no scholar to speak of and hard up for an authoritywhy it was a very great temptation for him  but some people and i am afraid the professor was one of them interpret that in a more strange curious onesided lefthanded topsyturvy insideout behindbefore fashion than even cousin cramchild for they make it mean that you must show your respect for children by never confessing yourself in the wrong to them even if you know that you are so lest they should lose confidence in their elders  now if the professor had said to ellie yes my darling it is a waterbaby and a very wonderful thing it is and it shows how little i know of the wonders of nature in spite of forty years honest labour  i was just telling you that there could be no such creatures and behold here is one come to confound my conceit and show me that nature can do and has done beyond all that mans poor fancy can imagine  so let us thank the maker and inspirer and lord of nature for all his wonderful and glorious works and try and find out something about this onei think that if the professor had said that little ellie would have believed him more firmly and respected him more deeply and loved him better than ever she had done before  but he was of a different opinion  he hesitated a moment  he longed to keep tom and yet he half wished he never had caught him and at last he quite longed to get rid of him  so he turned away and poked tom with his finger for want of anything better to do and said carelessly my dear little maid you must have dreamt of waterbabies last night your head is so full of them  now tom had been in the most horrible and unspeakable fright all the while and had kept as quiet as he could though he was called a holothurian and a cephalopod for it was fixed in his little head that if a man with clothes on caught him he might put clothes on him too and make a dirty black chimneysweep of him again  but when the professor poked him it was more than he could bear and between fright and rage he turned to bay as valiantly as a mouse in a corner and bit the professors finger till it bled  oh ah yah cried he and glad of an excuse to be rid of tom dropped him on to the seaweed and thence he dived into the water and was gone in a moment  but it was a waterbaby and i heard it speak cried ellie  ah it is gone  and she jumped down off the rock to try and catch tom before he slipped into the sea  too late and what was worse as she sprang down she slipped and fell some six feet with her head on a sharp rock and lay quite still  the professor picked her up and tried to waken her and called to her and cried over her for he loved her very much  but she would not waken at all  so he took her up in his arms and carried her to her governess and they all went home and little ellie was put to bed and lay there quite still only now and then she woke up and called out about the waterbaby  but no one knew what she meant and the professor did not tell for he was ashamed to tell  and after a week one moonlight night the fairies came flying in at the window and brought her such a pretty pair of wings that she could not help putting them on and she flew with them out of the window and over the land and over the sea and up through the clouds and nobody heard or saw anything of her for a very long while  and this is why they say that no one has ever yet seen a water baby  for my part i believe that the naturalists get dozens of them when they are out dredging but they say nothing about them and throw them overboard again for fear of spoiling their theories  but you see the professor was found out as every one is in due time  a very terrible old fairy found the professor out she felt his bumps and cast his nativity and took the lunars of him carefully inside and out and so she knew what he would do as well as if she had seen it in a print book as they say in the dear old west country and he did it and so he was found out beforehand as everybody always is and the old fairy will find out the naturalists some day and put them in the times and then on whose side will the laugh be  so the old fairy took him in hand very severely there and then but she says she is always most severe with the best people because there is most chance of curing them and therefore they are the patients who pay her best for she has to work on the same salary as the emperor of chinas physicians it is a pity that all do not no cure no pay  so she took the poor professor in hand  and because he was not content with things as they are she filled his head with things as they are not to try if he would like them better and because he did not choose to believe in a waterbaby when he saw it she made him believe in worse things than waterbabiesin unicorns fire drakes manticoras basilisks amphisbaenas griffins phoenixes rocs orcs dogheaded men threeheaded dogs threebodied geryons and other pleasant creatures which folks think never existed yet and which folks hope never will exist though they know nothing about the matter and never will and these creatures so upset terrified flustered aggravated confused astounded horrified and totally flabbergasted the poor professor that the doctors said that he was out of his wits for three months and perhaps they were right as they are now and then  so all the doctors in the county were called in to make a report on his case and of course every one of them flatly contradicted the other  else what use is there in being men of science  but at last the majority agreed on a report in the true medical language one half bad latin the other half worse greek and the rest what might have been english if they had only learnt to write it  and this is the beginning thereof    the subanhypaposupernal anastomoses of peritomic diacellurite in the encephalo digital region of the distinguished individual of whose symptomatic phoenomena we had the melancholy honour subsequently to a preliminary diagnostic inspection of making an inspectorial diagnosis presenting the interexclusively quadrilateral and antinomian diathesis known as bumpsterhausens blue follicles we proceeded    but what they proceeded to do my lady never knew for she was so frightened at the long words that she ran for her life and locked herself into her bedroom for fear of being squashed by the words and strangled by the sentence  a boa constrictor she said was bad company enough  but what was a boa constrictor made of paving stones  it was quite shocking  what can they think is the matter with him said she to the old nurse  that his wits just addled may be wi unbelief and heathenry quoth she  then why cant they say so  and the heaven and the sea and the rocks and the vales re echoedwhy indeed  but the doctors never heard them  so she made sir john write to the times to command the chancellor of the exchequer for the time being to put a tax on long words   a light tax on words over three syllables which are necessary evils like rats  but like them must be kept down judiciously  a heavy tax on words over four syllables as heterodoxy spontaneity spiritualism spuriosity etc  and on words over five syllables of which i hope no one will wish to see any examples a totally prohibitory tax  and a similar prohibitory tax on words derived from three or more languages at once words derived from two languages having become so common that there was no more hope of rooting out them than of rooting out pethwinds  the chancellor of the exchequer being a scholar and a man of sense jumped at the notion for he saw in it the one and only plan for abolishing schedule d  but when he brought in his bill most of the irish members and i am sorry to say some of the scotch likewise opposed it most strongly on the ground that in a free country no man was bound either to understand himself or to let others understand him  so the bill fell through on the first reading and the chancellor being a philosopher comforted himself with the thought that it was not the first time that a woman had hit off a grand idea and the men turned up their stupid noses thereat  now the doctors had it all their own way and to work they went in earnest and they gave the poor professor divers and sundry medicines as prescribed by the ancients and moderns from hippocrates to feuchtersleben as below viz  1  hellebore to wit   hellebore of aeta hellebore of galatia hellebore of sicily  and all other hellebores after the method of the helleborising helleborists of the helleboric era  but that would not do bumpsterhausens blue follicles would not stir an inch out of his encephalo digital region  2  trying to find out what was the matter with him after the method of  hippocrates aretaeus celsus coelius aurelianus and galen  but they found that a great deal too much trouble as most people have since and so had recourse to   3  borage cauteries  boring a hole in his head to let out fumes which says gordonius will without doubt do much good  but it didnt  bezoar stone diamargaritum a rams brain boiled in spice oil of wormwood water of nile capers good wine but there was none to be got the water of a smiths forge ambergris mandrake pillows dormouse fat hares ears starvation camphor salts and senna musk opium straitwaistcoats bullyings bumpings bleedings bucketings with cold water knockings down kneeling on his chest till they broke it in etc etc after the medieval or monkish method  but that would not do bumpsterhausens blue follicles stuck there still  then   4  coaxing kissing champagne and turtle red herrings and soda water good advice gardening croquet musical soirees aunt salty mild tobacco the saturday review a carriage with outriders etc etc  after the modern method  but that would not do  and if he had but been a convict lunatic and had shot at the queen killed all his creditors to avoid paying them or indulged in any other little amiable eccentricity of that kind they would have given him in addition   the healthiest situation in england on easthampstead plain  free run of windsor forest  the times every morning  a doublebarrelled gun and pointers and leave to shoot three wellington college boys a week not more in case black game was scarce  but as he was neither mad enough nor bad enough to be allowed such luxuries they grew desperate and fell into bad ways viz   5  suffumigations of sulphur herrwiggius his incomparable

brother  apathy or doing nothing at all  with all other ipathies and opathies which noodle has invented and foodle tried since blackfellows chipped flints at abbeville which is a considerable time ago to judge by the great exhibition   but nothing would do for he screamed and cried all day for a waterbaby to come and drive away the monsters and of course they did not try to find one because they did not believe in them and were thinking of nothing but bumpsterhausens blue follicles having as usual set the cart before the horse and taken the effect for the cause  so they were forced at last to let the poor professor ease his mind by writing a great book exactly contrary to all his old opinions in which he proved that the moon was made of green cheese and that all the mites in it which you may see sometimes quite plain through a telescope if you will only keep the lens dirty enough as mr weekes kept his voltaic battery are nothing in the world but little babies who are hatching and swarming up there in millions ready to come down into this world whenever children want a new little brother or sister  which must be a mistake for this one reason  that there being no atmosphere round the moon though some one or other says there is at least on the other side and that he has been round at the back of it to see and found that the moon was just the shape of a bath bun and so wet that the man in the moon went about on midsummer day in macintoshes and cordings boots spearing eels and sneezing that therefore i say there being no atmosphere there can be no evaporation and therefore the dewpoint can never fall below 715 degrees below zero of fahrenheit  and therefore it cannot be cold enough there about four oclock in the morning to condense the babies mesenteric apophthegms into their left ventricles and therefore they can never catch the hoopingcough and if they do not have hoopingcough they cannot be babies at all and therefore there are no babies in the moonqed  which may seem a roundabout reason and so perhaps it is  but you will have heard worse ones in your time and from better men than you are  but one thing is certain that when the good old doctor got his book written he felt considerably relieved from bumpsterhausens blue follicles and a few things infinitely worse to wit from pride and vainglory and from blindness and hardness of heart which are the true causes of bumpsterhausens blue follicles and of a good many other ugly things besides  whereon the foul flood water in his brains ran down and cleared to a fine coffee colour such as fish like to rise in till very fine clean freshrun fish did begin to rise in his brains and he caught two or three of them which is exceedingly fine sport for brain rivers and anatomised them carefully and never mentioned what he found out from them except to little children and became ever after a sadder and a wiser man which is a very good thing to become my dear little boy even though one has to pay a heavy price for the blessing    chapter v    stern lawgiver yet thou dost wear the godheads most benignant grace nor know we anything so fair as is the smile upon thy face flowers laugh before thee on their beds and fragrance in thy footing treads thou dost preserve the stars from wrong and the most ancient heavens through thee are fresh and strong  wordsworth ode to duty   what became of little tom  he slipped away off the rocks into the water as i said before but he could not help thinking of little ellie  he did not remember who she was but he knew that she was a little girl though she was a hundred times as big as he  that is not surprising  size has nothing to do with kindred  a tiny weed may be first cousin to a great tree and a little dog like vick knows that lioness is a dog too though she is twenty times larger than herself  so tom knew that ellie was a little girl and thought about her all that day and longed to have had her to play with but he had very soon to think of something else  and here is the account of what happened to him as it was published next morning in the waterproof gazette on the finest watered paper for the use of the great fairy mrs bedonebyasyoudid who reads the news very carefully every morning and especially the police cases as you will hear very soon  he was going along the rocks in threefathom water watching the pollock catch prawns and the wrasses nibble barnacles off the rocks shells and all when he saw a round cage of green withes and inside it looking very much ashamed of himself sat his friend the lobster twiddling his horns instead of thumbs  what have you been naughty and have they put you in the lock up asked tom  the lobster felt a little indignant at such a notion but he was too much depressed in spirits to argue so he only said i cant get out  why did you get in  after that nasty piece of dead fish  he had thought it looked and smelt very nice when he was outside and so it did for a lobster  but now he turned round and abused it because he was angry with himself  where did you get in  through that round hole at the top  then why dont you get out through it  because i cant and the lobster twiddled his horns more fiercely than ever but he was forced to confess  i have jumped upwards downwards backwards and sideways at least four thousand times and i cant get out  i always get up underneath there and cant find the hole  tom looked at the trap and having more wit than the lobster he saw plainly enough what was the matter as you may if you will look at a lobsterpot  stop a bit said tom  turn your tail up to me and ill pull you through hindforemost and then you wont stick in the spikes  but the lobster was so stupid and clumsy that he couldnt hit the hole  like a great many foxhunters he was very sharp as long as he was in his own country but as soon as they get out of it they lose their heads and so the lobster so to speak lost his tail  tom reached and clawed down the hole after him till he caught hold of him and then as was to be expected the clumsy lobster pulled him in head foremost  hullo here is a pretty business said tom  now take your great claws and break the points off those spikes and then we shall both get out easily  dear me i never thought of that said the lobster and after all the experience of life that i have had  you see experience is of very little good unless a man or a lobster has wit enough to make use of it  for a good many people like old polonius have seen all the world and yet remain little better than children after all  but they had not got half the spikes away when they saw a great dark cloud over them  and lo and behold it was the otter  how she did grin and grin when she saw tom  yar said she you little meddlesome wretch i have you now  i will serve you out for telling the salmon where i was  and she crawled all over the pot to get in  tom was horribly frightened and still more frightened when she found the hole in the top and squeezed herself right down through it all eyes and teeth  but no sooner was her head inside than valiant mr lobster caught her by the nose and held on  and there they were all three in the pot rolling over and over and very tight packing it was  and the lobster tore at the otter and the otter tore at the lobster and both squeezed and thumped poor tom till he had no breath left in his body and i dont know what would have happened to him if he had not at last got on the otters back and safe out of the hole  he was right glad when he got out  but he would not desert his friend who had saved him and the first time he saw his tail uppermost he caught hold of it and pulled with all his might  but the lobster would not let go  come along said tom dont you see she is dead  and so she was quite drowned and dead  and that was the end of the wicked otter  but the lobster would not let go  come along you stupid old stickinthemud cried tom or the fisherman will catch you  and that was true for tom felt some one above beginning to haul up the pot  but the lobster would not let go  tom saw the fisherman haul him up to the boatside and thought it was all up with him  but when mr lobster saw the fisherman he gave such a furious and tremendous snap that he snapped out of his hand and out of the pot and safe into the sea  but he left his knobbed claw behind him for it never came into his stupid head to let go after all so he just shook his claw off as the easier method  it was something of a bull that but you must know the lobster was an irish lobster and was hatched off island magee at the mouth of belfast lough  tom asked the lobster why he never thought of letting go  he said very determinedly that it was a point of honour among lobsters and so it is as the mayor of plymouth found out once to his cost eight or nine hundred years ago of course for if it had happened lately it would be personal to mention it  for one day he was so tired with sitting on a hard chair in a grand furred gown with a gold chain round his neck hearing one policeman after another come in and sing what shall we do with the drunken sailor so early in the morning and answering them each exactly alike  put him in the round house till he gets sober so early in the morning   that when it was over he jumped up and played leapfrog with the townclerk till he burst his buttons and then had his luncheon and burst some more buttons and then said  it is a low spring tide i shall go out this afternoon and cut my capers  now he did not mean to cut such capers as you eat with boiled mutton  it was the commandant of artillery at valetta who used to amuse himself with cutting them and who stuck upon one of the bastions a notice no one allowed to cut capers here but me which greatly edified the midshipmen in port and the maltese on the nix mangiare stairs  but all that the mayor meant was that he would go and have an afternoons fun like any schoolboy and catch lobsters with an iron hook  so to the mewstone he went and for lobsters he looked  and when he came to a certain crack in the rocks he was so excited that instead of putting in his hook he put in his hand and mr lobster was at home and caught him by the finger and held on  yah said the mayor and pulled as hard as he dared  but the more he pulled the more the lobster pinched till he was forced to be quiet  then he tried to get his hook in with his other hand but the hole was too narrow  then he pulled again but he could not stand the pain  then he shouted and bawled for help  but there was no one nearer him than the menofwar inside the breakwater  then he began to turn a little pale for the tide flowed and still the lobster held on  then he turned quite white for the tide was up to his knees and still the lobster held on  then he thought of cutting off his finger but he wanted two things to do it withcourage and a knife and he had got neither  then he turned quite yellow for the tide was up to his waist and still the lobster held on  then he thought over all the naughty things he ever had done all the sand which he had put in the sugar and the sloeleaves in the tea and the water in the treacle and the salt in the tobacco because his brother was a brewer and a man must help his own kin  then he turned quite blue for the tide was up to his breast and still the lobster held on  then i have no doubt he repented fully of all the said naughty things which he had done and promised to mend his life as too many do when they think they have no life left to mend  whereby as they fancy they make a very cheap bargain  but the old fairy with the birch rod soon undeceives them  and then he grew all colours at once and turned up his eyes like a duck in thunder for the water was up to his chin and still the lobster held on  and then came a manofwars boat round the mewstone and saw his head sticking up out of the water  one said it was a keg of brandy and another that it was a cocoanut and another that it was a buoy loose and another that it was a black diver and wanted to fire at it which would not have been pleasant for the mayor but just then such a yell came out of a great hole in the middle of it that the midshipman in charge guessed what it was and bade pull up to it as fast as they could  so somehow or other the jacktars got the lobster out and set the mayor free and put him ashore at the barbican  he never went lobstercatching again and we will hope he put no more salt in the tobacco not even to sell his brothers beer  and that is the story of the mayor of plymouth which has two advantagesfirst that of being quite true and second that of having as folks say all good stories ought to have no moral whatsoever  no more indeed has any part of this book because it is a fairy tale you know  and now happened to tom a most wonderful thing for he had not left the lobster five minutes before he came upon a waterbaby  a real live waterbaby sitting on the white sand very busy about a little point of rock  and when it saw tom it looked up for a moment and then cried why you are not one of us  you are a new baby  oh how delightful  and it ran to tom and tom ran to it and they hugged and kissed each other for ever so long they did not know why  but they did not want any introductions there under the water  at last tom said oh where have you been all this while  i have been looking for you so long and i have been so lonely  we have been here for days and days  there are hundreds of us about the rocks  how was it you did not see us or hear us when we sing and romp every evening before we go home  tom looked at the baby again and then he said  well this is wonderful  i have seen things just like you again and again but i thought you were shells or seacreatures  i never took you for waterbabies like myself  now was not that very odd  so odd indeed that you will no doubt want to know how it happened and why tom could never find a waterbaby till after he had got the lobster out of the pot  and if you will read this story nine times over and then think for yourself you will find out why  it is not good for little boys to be told everything and never to be forced to use their own wits they would learn then no more than they do at dr dulcimers famous suburban establishment for the idler members of the youthful aristocracy where the masters learn the lessons and the boys hear themwhich saves a great deal of troublefor the time being  now said the baby come and help me or i shall not have finished before my brothers and sisters come and it is time to go home  what shall i help you at  at this poor dear little rock a great clumsy boulder came rolling by in the last storm and knocked all its head off and rubbed off all its flowers  and now i must plant it again with seaweeds and coralline and anemones and i will make it the prettiest little rockgarden on all the shore  so they worked away at the rock and planted it and smoothed the sand down round it and capital fun they had till the tide began to turn  and then tom heard all the other babies coming laughing and singing and shouting and romping and the noise they made was just like the noise of the ripple  so he knew that he had been hearing and seeing the waterbabies all along only he did not know them because his eyes and ears were not opened  and in they came dozens and dozens of them some bigger than tom and some smaller all in the neatest little white bathing dresses and when they found that he was a new baby they hugged him and kissed him and then put him in the middle and danced round him on the sand and there was no one ever so happy as poor little tom  now then they cried all at once we must come away home we must come away home or the tide will leave us dry  we have mended all the broken seaweed and put all the rockpools in order and planted all the shells again in the sand and nobody will see where the ugly storm swept in last week  and this is the reason why the rockpools are always so neat and clean because the waterbabies come inshore after every storm to sweep them out and comb them down and put them all to rights again  only where men are wasteful and dirty and let sewers run into the sea instead of putting the stuff upon the fields like thrifty reasonable souls or throw herrings heads and dead dogfish or any other refuse into the water or in any way make a mess upon the clean shorethere the waterbabies will not come sometimes not for hundreds of years for they cannot abide anything smelly or foul but leave the seaanemones and the crabs to clear away everything till the good tidy sea has covered up all the dirt in soft mud and clean sand where the waterbabies can plant live cockles and whelks and razorshells and seacucumbers and golden combs and make a pretty live garden again after mans dirt is cleared away  and that i suppose is the reason why there are no waterbabies at any wateringplace which i have ever seen  and where is the home of the waterbabies  in st brandans fairy isle  did you never hear of the blessed st brandan how he preached to the wild irish on the wild wild kerry coast he and five other hermits till they were weary and longed to rest  for the wild irish would not listen to them or come to confession and to mass but liked better to brew potheen and dance the pater opee and knock each other over the head with shillelaghs and shoot each other from behind turfdykes and steal each others cattle and burn each others homes till st brandan and his friends were weary of them for they would not learn to be peaceable christians at all  so st brandan went out to the point of old dunmore and looked over the tideway roaring round the blasquets at the end of all the world and away into the ocean and sighedah that i had wings as a dove  and far away before the setting sun he saw a blue fairy sea and golden fairy islands and he said those are the islands of the blest  then he and his friends got into a hooker and sailed away and away to the westward and were never heard of more  but the people who would not hear him were changed into gorillas and gorillas they are until this day  and when st brandan and the hermits came to that fairy isle they found it overgrown with cedars and full of beautiful birds and he sat down under the cedars and preached to all the birds in the air and they liked his sermons so well that they told the fishes in the sea and they came and st brandan preached to them and the fishes told the waterbabies who live in the caves under the isle and they came up by hundreds every sunday and st brandan got quite a neat little sundayschool  and there he taught the water babies for a great many hundred years till his eyes grew too dim to see and his beard grew so long that he dared not walk for fear of treading on it and then he might have tumbled down  and at last he and the five hermits fell fast asleep under the cedar shades and there they sleep unto this day  but the fairies took to the waterbabies and taught them their lessons themselves  and some say that st brandan will awake and begin to teach the babies once more  but some think that he will sleep on for better for worse till the coming of the cocqcigrues  but on still clear summer evenings when the sun sinks down into the sea among golden cloudcapes and cloudislands and locks and friths of azure sky the sailors fancy that they see away to westward st brandans fairy isle  but whether men can see it or not st brandans isle once actually stood there a great land out in the ocean which has sunk and sunk beneath the waves  old plato called it atlantis and told strange tales of the wise men who lived therein and of the wars they fought in the old times  and from off that island came strange flowers which linger still about this land the cornish heath and cornish moneywort and the delicate venuss hair and the londonpride which covers the kerry mountains and the little pink butterwort of devon and the great blue butterwort of ireland and the connemara heath and the bristlefern of the turk waterfall and many a strange plant more all fairy tokens left for wise men and good children from off st brandans isle  now when tom got there he found that the isle stood all on pillars and that its roots were full of caves  there were pillars of black basalt like staffa and pillars of green and crimson serpentine like kynance and pillars ribboned with red and white and yellow sandstone like livermead and there were blue grottoes like capri and white grottoes like adelsberg all curtained and draped with seaweeds purple and crimson green and brown and strewn with soft white sand on which the waterbabies sleep every night  but to keep the place clean and sweet the crabs picked up all the scraps off the floor and ate them like so many monkeys while the rocks were covered with ten thousand seaanemones and corals and madrepores who scavenged the water all day long and kept it nice and pure  but to make up to them for having to do such nasty work they were not left black and dirty as poor chimneysweeps and dustmen are  no the fairies are more considerate and just than that and have dressed them all in the most beautiful colours and patterns till they look like vast flowerbeds of gay blossoms  if you think i am talking nonsense i can only say that it is true and that an old gentleman named fourier used to say that we ought to do the same by chimneysweeps and dustmen and honour them instead of despising them and he was a very clever old gentleman  but unfortunately for him and the world as mad as a march hare  and instead of watchmen and policemen to keep out nasty things at night there were thousands and thousands of watersnakes and most wonderful creatures they were  they were all named after the nereids the seafairies who took care of them eunice and polynoe phyllodoce and psamathe and all the rest of the pretty darlings who swim round their queen amphitrite and her car of cameo shell they were dressed in green velvet and black velvet and purple velvet and were all jointed in rings and some of them had three hundred brains apiece so that they must have been uncommonly shrewd detectives and some had eyes in their tails and some had eyes in every joint so that they kept a very sharp lookout and when they wanted a babysnake they just grew one at the end of their own tails and when it was able to take care of itself it dropped off so that they brought up their families very cheaply but if any nasty thing came by out they rushed upon it and then out of each of their hundreds of feet there sprang a whole cutlers shop of  scythes        javelins billhooks      lances pickaxes       halberts forks          gisarines penknives      poleaxes rapiers        fishhooks sabres         bradawls yataghans      gimblets creeses        corkscrews ghoorka swords pins tucks          needles and so forth  which stabbed shot poked pricked scratched ripped pinked and crimped those naughty beasts so terribly that they had to run for their lives or else be chopped into small pieces and be eaten afterwards  and if that is not all every word true then there is no faith in microscopes and all is over with the linnaean society  and there were the waterbabies in thousands more than tom or you either could countall the little children whom the good fairies take to because their cruel mothers and fathers will not all who are untaught and brought up heathens and all who come to grief by illusage or ignorance or neglect all the little children who are overlaid or given gin when they are young or are let to drink out of hot kettles or to fall into the fire all the little children in alleys and courts and tumbledown cottages who die by fever and cholera and measles and scarlatina and nasty complaints which no one has any business to have and which no one will have some day when folks have common sense and all the little children who have been killed by cruel masters and wicked soldiers they were all there except of course the babes of bethlehem who were killed by wicked king herod for they were taken straight to heaven long ago as everybody knows and we call them the holy innocents  but i wish tom had given up all his naughty tricks and left off tormenting dumb animals now that he had plenty of playfellows to amuse him  instead of that i am sorry to say he would meddle with the creatures all but the watersnakes for they would stand no nonsense  so he tickled the madrepores to make them shut up and frightened the crabs to make them hide in the sand and peep out at him with the tips of their eyes and put stones into the anemones mouths to make them fancy that their dinner was coming  the other children warned him and said take care what you are at  mrs bedonebyasyoudid is coming  but tom never heeded them being quite riotous with high spirits and good luck till one friday morning early mrs bedonebyasyoudid came indeed  a very tremendous lady she was and when the children saw her they all stood in a row very upright indeed and smoothed down their bathing dresses and put their hands behind them just as if they were going to be examined by the inspector  and she had on a black bonnet and a black shawl and no crinoline at all and a pair of large green spectacles and a great hooked nose hooked so much that the bridge of it stood quite up above her eyebrows and under her arm she carried a great birchrod  indeed she was so ugly that tom was tempted to make faces at her  but did not for he did not admire the look of the birchrod under her arm  and she looked at the children one by one and seemed very much pleased with them though she never asked them one question about how they were behaving and then began giving them all sorts of nice seathingsseacakes seaapples seaoranges seabullseyes seatoffee and to the very best of all she gave seaices made out of seacows cream which never melt under water  and if you dont quite believe me then just thinkwhat is more cheap and plentiful than searock  then why should there not be seatoffee as well  and every one can find sealemons ready quartered too if they will look for them at low tide and sea grapes too sometimes hanging in bunches and if you will go to nice you will find the fishmarket full of seafruit which they call frutta di mare though i suppose they call them fruits de mer now out of compliment to that most successful and therefore most immaculate potentate who is seemingly desirous of inheriting the blessing pronounced on those who remove their neighbours land mark  and perhaps that is the very reason why the place is called nice because there are so many nice things in the sea there  at least if it is not it ought to be  now little tom watched all these sweet things given away till his mouth watered and his eyes grew as round as an owls  for he hoped that his turn would come at last and so it did  for the lady called him up and held out her fingers with something in them and popped it into his mouth and lo and behold it was a nasty cold hard pebble  you are a very cruel woman said he and began to whimper  and you are a very cruel boy who puts pebbles into the sea anemones mouths to take them in and make them fancy that they had caught a good dinner  as you did to them so i must do to you  who told you that said tom  you did yourself this very minute  tom had never opened his lips so he was very much taken aback indeed  yes every one tells me exactly what they have done wrong and that without knowing it themselves  so there is no use trying to hide anything from me  now go and be a good boy and i will put no more pebbles in your mouth if you put none in other creatures  i did not know there was any harm in it said tom  then you know now  people continually say that to me  but i tell them if you dont know that fire burns that is no reason that it should not burn you and if you dont know that dirt breeds fever that is no reason why the fevers should not kill you  the lobster did not know that there was any harm in getting into the lobster pot but it caught him all the same  dear me thought tom she knows everything  and so she did indeed  and so if you do not know that things are wrong that is no reason why you should not be punished for them though not as much not as much my little man and the lady looked very kindly after all as if you did know  well you are a little hard on a poor lad said tom  not at all i am the best friend you ever had in all your life but i will tell you i cannot help punishing people when they do wrong  i like it no more than they do i am often very very sorry for them poor things  but i cannot help it  if i tried not to do it i should do it all the same  for i work by machinery just like an engine and am full of wheels and springs inside and am wound up very carefully so that i cannot help going  was it long ago since they wound you up asked tom  for he thought the cunning little fellow she will run down some day or they may forget to wind her up as old grimes used to forget to wind up his watch when he came in from the publichouse and then i shall be safe  i was wound up once and for all so long ago that i forget all about it  dear me said tom you must have been made a long time  i never was made my child and i shall go for ever and ever for i am as old as eternity and yet as young as time  and there came over the ladys face a very curious expressionvery solemn and very sad and yet very very sweet  and she looked up and away as if she were gazing through the sea and through the sky at something far far off and as she did so there came such a quiet tender patient hopeful smile over her face that tom thought for the moment that she did not look ugly at all  and no more she did for she was like a great many people who have not a pretty feature in their faces and yet are lovely to behold and draw little childrens hearts to them at once because though the house is plain enough yet from the windows a beautiful and good spirit is looking forth  and tom smiled in her face she looked so pleasant for the moment and the strange fairy smiled too and said  yes  you thought me very ugly just now did you not  tom hung down his head and got very red about the ears  and i am very ugly  i am the ugliest fairy in the world and i shall be till people behave themselves as they ought to do  and then i shall grow as handsome as my sister who is the loveliest fairy in the world and her name is mrs doasyouwouldbedoneby  so she begins where i end and i begin where she ends and those who will not listen to her must listen to me as you will see  now all of you run away except tom and he may stay and see what i am going to do  it will be a very good warning for him to begin with before he goes to school  now tom every friday i come down here and call up all who have illused little children and serve them as they served the children  and at that tom was frightened and crept under a stone which made the two crabs who lived there very angry and frightened their friend the butterfish into flapping hysterics  but he would not move for them  and first she called up all the doctors who give little children so much physic they were most of them old ones for the young ones have learnt better all but a few army surgeons who still fancy that a babys inside is much like a scotch grenadiers and she set them all in a row and very rueful they looked for they knew what was coming  and first she pulled all their teeth out and then she bled them all round  and then she dosed them with calomel and jalap and salts and senna and brimstone and treacle and horrible faces they made and then she gave them a great emetic of mustard and water and no basons and began all over again and that was the way she spent the morning  and then she called up a whole troop of foolish ladies who pinch up their childrens waists and toes and she laced them all up in tight stays so that they were choked and sick and their noses grew red and their hands and feet swelled and then she crammed their poor feet into the most dreadfully tight boots and made them all dance which they did most clumsily indeed and then she asked them how they liked it and when they said not at all she let them go  because they had only done it out of foolish fashion fancying it was for their childrens good as if wasps waists and pigs toes could be pretty or wholesome or of any use to anybody  then she called up all the careless nurserymaids and stuck pins into them all over and wheeled them about in perambulators with tight straps across their stomachs and their heads and arms hanging over the side till they were quite sick and stupid and would have had sunstrokes  but being under the water they could only have waterstrokes which i assure you are nearly as bad as you will find if you try to sit under a millwheel  and mindwhen you hear a rumbling at the bottom of the sea sailors will tell you that it is a groundswell  but now you know better  it is the old lady wheeling the maids about in perambulators  and by that time she was so tired she had to go to luncheon  and after luncheon she set to work again and called up all the cruel schoolmasterswhole regiments and brigades of them and when she saw them she frowned most terribly and set to work in earnest as if the best part of the days work was to come  more than half of them were nasty dirty frowzy grubby smelly old monks who because they dare not hit a man of their own size amused themselves with beating little children instead as you may see in the picture of old pope gregory good man and true though he was when he meddled with things which he did understand teaching children to sing their fafamifa with a catonine tails under his chair  but because they never had any children of their own they took into their heads as some folks do still that they were the only people in the world who knew how to manage children  and they first brought into england in the old anglosaxon times the fashion of treating free boys and girls too worse than you would treat a dog or a horse  but mrs bedonebyasyoudid has caught them all long ago and given them many a taste of their own rods and much good may it do them  and she boxed their ears and thumped them over the head with rulers and pandied their hands with canes and told them that they told stories and were this and that bad sort of people and the more they were very indignant and stood upon their honour and declared they told the truth the more she declared they were not and that they were only telling lies and at last she birched them all round soundly with her great birchrod and set them each an imposition of three hundred thousand lines of hebrew to learn by heart before she came back next friday  and at that they all cried and howled so that their breaths came all up through the sea like bubbles out of sodawater and that is one reason of the bubbles in the sea  there are others  but that is the one which principally concerns little boys  and by that time she was so tired that she was glad to stop and indeed she had done a very good days work  tom did not quite dislike the old lady  but he could not help thinking her a little spitefuland no wonder if she was poor old soul for if she has to wait to grow handsome till people do as they would be done by she will have to wait a very long time  poor old mrs bedonebyasyoudid she has a great deal of hard work before her and had better have been born a washerwoman and stood over a tub all day  but you see people cannot always choose their own profession  but tom longed to ask her one question and after all whenever she looked at him she did not look cross at all and now and then there was a funny smile in her face and she chuckled to herself in a way which gave tom courage and at last he said  pray maam may i ask you a question  certainly my little dear  why dont you bring all the bad masters here and serve them out too  the butties that knock about the poor collierboys and the nailers that file off their lads noses and hammer their fingers and all the master sweeps like my master grimes  i saw him fall into the water long ago so i surely expected he would have been here  im sure he was bad enough to me  then the old lady looked so very stern that tom was quite frightened and sorry that he had been so bold  but she was not angry with him  she only answered i look after them all the week round and they are in a very different place from this because they knew that they were doing wrong  she spoke very quietly but there was something in her voice which made tom tingle from head to foot as if he had got into a shoal of seanettles  but these people she went on did not know that they were doing wrong  they were only stupid and impatient and therefore i only punish them till they become patient and learn to use their common sense like reasonable beings  but as for chimneysweeps and collierboys and nailer lads my sister has set good people to stop all that sort of thing and very much obliged to her i am for if she could only stop the cruel masters from illusing poor children i should grow handsome at least a thousand years sooner and now do you be a good boy and do as you would be done by which they did not and then when my sister madame doasyouwouldbedoneby comes on sunday perhaps she will take notice of you and teach you how to behave  she understands that better than i do  and so she went  tom was very glad to hear that there was no chance of meeting grimes again though he was a little sorry for him considering that he used sometimes to give him the leavings of the beer  but he determined to be a very good boy all saturday and he was for he never frightened one crab nor tickled any live corals nor put stones into the sea anemones mouths to make them fancy they had got a dinner and when sunday morning came sure enough mrs doasyouwouldbedoneby came too  whereat all the little children began dancing and clapping their hands and tom danced too with all his might  and as for the pretty lady i cannot tell you what the colour of her hair was or of her eyes  no more could tom for when any one looks at her all they can think of is that she has the sweetest kindest tenderest funniest merriest face they ever saw or want to see  but tom saw that she was a very tall woman as tall as her sister  but instead of being gnarly and horny and scaly and prickly like her she was the most nice soft fat smooth pussy cuddly delicious creature who ever nursed a baby and she understood babies thoroughly for she had plenty of her own whole rows and regiments of them and has to this day  and all her delight was whenever she had a spare moment to play with babies in which she showed herself a woman of sense for babies are the best company and the pleasantest playfellows in the world at least so all the wise people in the world think  and therefore when the children saw her they naturally all caught hold of her and pulled her till she sat down on a stone and climbed into her lap and clung round her neck and caught hold of her hands and then they all put their thumbs into their mouths and began cuddling and purring like so many kittens as they ought to have done  while those who could get nowhere else sat down on the sand and cuddled her feetfor no one you know wear shoes in the water except horrid old bathingwomen who are afraid of the waterbabies pinching their horny toes  and tom stood staring at them for he could not understand what it was all about  and who are you you little darling she said  oh that is the new baby they all cried pulling their thumbs out of their mouths and he never had any mother and they all put their thumbs back again for they did not wish to lose any time  then i will be his mother and he shall have the very best place so get out all of you this moment  and she took up two great armfuls of babiesnine hundred under one arm and thirteen hundred under the otherand threw them away right and left into the water  but they minded it no more than the naughty boys in struwelpeter minded when st nicholas dipped them in his inkstand and did not even take their thumbs out of their mouths but came paddling and wriggling back to her like so many tadpoles till you could see nothing of her from head to foot for the swarm of little babies  but she took tom in her arms and laid him in the softest place of all and kissed him and patted him and talked to him tenderly and low such things as he had never heard before in his life and tom looked up into her eyes and loved her and loved till he fell fast asleep from pure love  and when he woke she was telling the children a story  and what story did she tell them  one story she told them which begins every christmas eve and yet never ends at all for ever and ever and as she went on the children took their thumbs out of their mouths and listened quite seriously but not sadly at all for she never told them anything sad and tom listened too and never grew tired of listening  and he listened so long that he fell fast asleep again and when he woke the lady was nursing him still  dont go away said little tom  this is so nice  i never had any one to cuddle me before  dont go away said all the children you have not sung us one song  well i have time for only one  so what shall it be  the doll you lost  the doll you lost cried all the babies at once  so the strange fairy sang   i once had a sweet little doll dears the prettiest doll in the world her cheeks were so red and so white dears and her hair was so charmingly curled but i lost my poor little doll dears as i played in the heath one day and i cried for her more than a week dears but i never could find where she lay  i found my poor little doll dears as i played in the heath one day folks say she is terribly changed dears for her paint is all washed away and her arm trodden off by the cows dears and her hair not the least bit curled yet for old sakes sake she is still dears the prettiest doll in the world   what a silly song for a fairy to sing  and what silly waterbabies to be quite delighted at it  well but you see they have not the advantage of aunt agitates arguments in the sealand down below  now said the fairy to tom will you be a good boy for my sake and torment no more seabeasts till i come back  and you will cuddle me again said poor little tom  of course i will you little duck  i should like to take you with me and cuddle you all the way only i must not and away she went  so tom really tried to be a good boy and tormented no seabeasts after that as long as he lived and he is quite alive i assure you still  oh how good little boys ought to be who have kind pussy mammas to cuddle them and tell them stories and how afraid they ought to be of growing naughty and bringing tears into their mammas pretty eyes    chapter vi    thou little child yet glorious in the night of heavenborn freedom on thy beings height why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke the years to bring the inevitable yoke  thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight and custom lie upon thee with a weight heavy as frost and deep almost as life  wordsworth   i come to the very saddest part of all my story  i know some people will only laugh at it and call it much ado about nothing but i know one man who would not and he was an officer with a pair of gray moustaches as long as your arm who said once in company that two of the most heartrending sights in the world which moved him most to tears which he would do anything to prevent or remedy were a child over a broken toy and a child stealing sweets  the company did not laugh at him his moustaches were too long and too gray for that  but after he was gone they called him sentimental and so forth all but one dear little old quaker lady with a soul as white as her cap who was not of course generally partial to soldiers and she said very quietly like a quaker  friends it is borne upon my mind that that is a truly brave man  now you may fancy that tom was quite good when he had everything that he could want or wish  but you would be very much mistaken being quite comfortable is a very good thing but it does not make people good  indeed it sometimes makes them naughty as it has made the people in america and as it made the people in the bible who waxed fat and kicked like horses overfed and underworked  and i am very sorry to say that this happened to little tom  for he grew so fond of the seabullseyes and sealollipops that his foolish little head could think of nothing else  and he was always longing for more and wondering when the strange lady would come again and give him some and what she would give him and how much and whether she would give him more than the others  and he thought of nothing but lollipops by day and dreamt of nothing else by nightand what happened then  that he began to watch the lady to see where she kept the sweet things  and began hiding and sneaking and following her about and pretending to be looking the other way or going after something else till he found out that she kept them in a beautiful motherofpearl cabinet away in a deep crack of the rocks  and he longed to go to the cabinet and yet he was afraid and then he longed again and was less afraid and at last by continual thinking about it he longed so violently that he was not afraid at all  and one night when all the other children were asleep and he could not sleep for thinking of lollipops he crept away among the rocks and got to the cabinet and behold it was open  but when he saw all the nice things inside instead of being delighted he was quite frightened and wished he had never come there  and then he would only touch them and he did and then he would only taste one and he did and then he would only eat one and he did and then he would only eat two and then three and so on and then he was terrified lest she should come and catch him and began gobbling them down so fast that he did not taste them or have any pleasure in them and then he felt sick and would have only one more and then only one more again and so on till he had eaten them all up  and all the while close behind him stood mrs bedonebyasyoudid  some people may say but why did she not keep her cupboard locked well i knowit may seem a very strange thing but she never does keep her cupboard locked every one may go and taste for themselves and fare accordingly  it is very odd but so it is and i am quite sure that she knows best  perhaps she wishes people to keep their fingers out of the fire by having them burned  she took off her spectacles because she did not like to see too much and in her pity she arched up her eyebrows into her very hair and her eyes grew so wide that they would have taken in all the sorrows of the world and filled with great big tears as they too often do  but all she said was  ah you poor little dear you are just like all the rest  but she said it to herself and tom neither heard nor saw her now you must not fancy that she was sentimental at all  if you do and think that she is going to let off you or me or any human being when we do wrong because she is too tenderhearted to punish us then you will find yourself very much mistaken as many a man does every year and every day  but what did the strange fairy do when she saw all her lollipops eaten  did she fly at tom catch him by the scruff of the neck hold him howk him hump him hurry him hit him poke him pull him pinch him pound him put him in the corner shake him slap him set him on a cold stone to reconsider himself and so forth  not a bit  you may watch her at work if you know where to find her  but you will never see her do that  for if she had she knew quite well tom would have fought and kicked and bit and said bad words and turned again that moment into a naughty little heathen chimneysweep with his hand like ishmaels of old against every man and every mans hand against him  did she question him hurry him frighten him threaten him to make him confess  not a bit  you may see her as i said at her work often enough if you know where to look for her  but you will never see her do that  for if she had she would have tempted him to tell lies in his fright and that would have been worse for him if possible than even becoming a heathen chimneysweep again  no  she leaves that for anxious parents and teachers lazy ones some call them who instead of giving children a fair trial such as they would expect and demand for themselves force them by fright to confess their own faultswhich is so cruel and unfair that no judge on the bench dare do it to the wickedest thief or murderer for the good british law forbids itay and even punish them to make them confess which is so detestable a crime that it is never committed now save by inquisitors and kings of naples and a few other wretched people of whom the world is weary  and then they say we have trained up the child in the way he should go and when he grew up he has departed from it  why then did solomon say that he would not depart from it  but perhaps the way of beating and hurrying and frightening and questioning was not the way that the child should go for it is not even the way in which a colt should go if you want to break it in and make it a quiet serviceable horse  some folks may say ah but the fairy does not need to do that if she knows everything already  true  but if she did not know she would not surely behave worse than a british judge and jury and no more should parents and teachers either  so she just said nothing at all about the matter not even when tom came next day with the rest for sweet things  he was horribly afraid of coming  but he was still more afraid of staying away lest any one should suspect him  he was dreadfully afraid too lest there should be no sweetsas was to be expected he having eaten them alland lest then the fairy should inquire who had taken them  but behold she pulled out just as many as ever which astonished tom and frightened him still more  and when the fairy looked him full in the face he shook from head to foot  however she gave him his share like the rest and he thought within himself that she could not have found him out  but when he put the sweets into his mouth he hated the taste of them and they made him so sick that he had to get away as fast as he could and terribly sick he was and very cross and unhappy all the week after  then when next week came he had his share again and again the fairy looked him full in the face but more sadly than she had ever looked  and he could not bear the sweets  but took them again in spite of himself  and when mrs doasyouwouldbedoneby came he wanted to be cuddled like the rest but she said very seriously  i should like to cuddle you but i cannot you are so horny and prickly  and tom looked at himself  and he was all over prickles just like a seaegg  which was quite natural for you must know and believe that peoples souls make their bodies just as a snail makes its shell i am not joking my little man i am in serious solemn earnest and therefore when toms soul grew all prickly with naughty tempers his body could not help growing prickly too so that nobody would cuddle him or play with him or even like to look at him  what could tom do now but go away and hide in a corner and cry for nobody would play with him and he knew full well why  and he was so miserable all that week that when the ugly fairy came and looked at him once more full in the face more seriously and sadly than ever he could stand it no longer and thrust the sweetmeats away saying no i dont want any  i cant bear them now and then burst out crying poor little man and told mrs bedonebyasyoudid every word as it happened  he was horribly frightened when he had done so for he expected her to punish him very severely  but instead she only took him up and kissed him which was not quite pleasant for her chin was very bristly indeed but he was so lonelyhearted he thought that rough kissing was better than none  i will forgive you little man she said  i always forgive every one the moment they tell me the truth of their own accord  then you will take away all these nasty prickles  that is a very different matter  you put them there yourself and only you can take them away  but how can i do that asked tom crying afresh  well i think it is time for you to go to school so i shall fetch you a schoolmistress who will teach you how to get rid of your prickles  and so she went away  tom was frightened at the notion of a schoolmistress for he thought she would certainly come with a birchrod or a cane but he comforted himself at last that she might be something like the old woman in vendalewhich she was not in the least for when the fairy brought her she was the most beautiful little girl that ever was seen with long curls floating behind her like a golden cloud and long robes floating all round her like a silver one  there he is said the fairy and you must teach him to be good whether you like or not  i know said the little girl but she did not seem quite to like for she put her finger in her mouth and looked at tom under her brows and tom put his finger in his mouth and looked at her under his brows for he was horribly ashamed of himself  the little girl seemed hardly to know how to begin and perhaps she would never have begun at all if poor tom had not burst out crying and begged her to teach him to be good and help him to cure his prickles and at that she grew so tenderhearted that she began teaching him as prettily as ever child was taught in the world  and what did the little girl teach tom  she taught him first what you have been taught ever since you said your first prayers at your mothers knees but she taught him much more simply  for the lessons in that world my child have no such hard words in them as the lessons in this and therefore the waterbabies like them better than you like your lessons and long to learn them more and more and grown men cannot puzzle nor quarrel over their meaning as they do here on land for those lessons all rise clear and pure like the test out of overton pool out of the everlasting ground of all life and truth  so she taught tom every day in the week only on sundays she always went away home and the kind fairy took her place  and before she had taught tom many sundays his prickles had vanished quite away and his skin was smooth and clean again  dear me said the little girl why i know you now  you are the very same little chimneysweep who came into my bedroom  dear me cried tom  and i know you too now  you are the very little white lady whom i saw in bed  and he jumped at her and longed to hug and kiss her but did not remembering that she was a lady born so he only jumped round and round her till he was quite tired  and then they began telling each other all their storyhow he had got into the water and she had fallen over the rock and how he had swum down to the sea and how she had flown out of the window and how this that and the other till it was all talked out  and then they both began over again and i cant say which of the two talked fastest  and then they set to work at their lessons again and both liked them so well that they went on well till seven full years were past and gone  you may fancy that tom was quite content and happy all those seven years but the truth is he was not  he had always one thing on his mind and that waswhere little ellie went when she went home on sundays  to a very beautiful place she said  but what was the beautiful place like and where was it  ah that is just what she could not say  and it is strange but true that no one can say and that those who have been oftenest in it or even nearest to it can say least about it and make people understand least what it is like  there are a good many folks about the otherendofnowhere where tom went afterwards who pretend to know it from north to south as well as if they had been penny postmen there but as they are safe at the otherendof nowhere nine hundred and ninetynine million miles away what they say cannot concern us  but the dear sweet loving wise good selfsacrificing people who really go there can never tell you anything about it save that it is the most beautiful place in all the world and if you ask them more they grow modest and hold their peace for fear of being laughed at and quite right they are  so all that good little ellie could say was that it was worth all the rest of the world put together  and of course that only made tom the more anxious to go likewise  miss ellie he said at last i will know why i cannot go with you when you go home on sundays or i shall have no peace and give you none either  you must ask the fairies that  so when the fairy mrs bedonebyasyoudid came next tom asked her  little boys who are only fit to play with seabeasts cannot go there she said  those who go there must go first where they do not like and do what they do not like and help somebody they do not like  why did ellie do that  ask her  and ellie blushed and said yes tom i did not like coming here at first i was so much happier at home where it is always sunday and i was afraid of you tom at first becausebecause  because i was all over prickles  but i am not prickly now am i miss ellie  no said ellie  i like you very much now and i like coming here too  and perhaps said the fairy you will learn to like going where you dont like and helping some one that you dont like as ellie has  but tom put his finger in his mouth and hung his head down for he did not see that at all  so when mrs doasyouwouldbedoneby came tom asked her for he thought in his little head she is not so strict as her sister and perhaps she may let me off more easily  ah tom tom silly fellow and yet i dont know why i should blame you while so many grown people have got the very same notion in their heads  but when they try it they get just the same answer as tom did for when he asked the second fairy she told him just what the first did and in the very same words  tom was very unhappy at that  and when ellie went home on sunday he fretted and cried all day and did not care to listen to the fairys stories about good children though they were prettier than ever  indeed the more he overheard of them the less he liked to listen because they were all about children who did what they did not like and took trouble for other people and worked to feed their little brothers and sisters instead of caring only for their play  and when she began to tell a story about a holy child in old times who was martyred by the heathen because it would not worship idols tom could bear no more and ran away and hid among the rocks  and when ellie came back he was shy with her because he fancied she looked down on him and thought him a coward  and then he grew quite cross with her because she was superior to him and did what he could not do  and poor ellie was quite surprised and sad and at last tom burst out crying but he would not tell her what was really in his mind  and all the while he was eaten up with curiosity to know where ellie went to so that he began not to care for his playmates or for the seapalace or anything else  but perhaps that made matters all the easier for him for he grew so discontented with everything round him that he did not care to stay and did not care where he went  well he said at last i am so miserable here ill go if only you will go with me  ah said ellie i wish i might but the worst of it is that the fairy says that you must go alone if you go at all  now dont poke that poor crab about tom for he was feeling very naughty and mischievous or the fairy will have to punish you  tom was very nearly saying i dont care if she does but he stopped himself in time  i know what she wants me to do he said whining most dolefully she wants me to go after that horrid old grimes  i dont like him thats certain  and if i find him he will turn me into a chimneysweep again i know  thats what i have been afraid of all along  no he wonti know as much as that  nobody can turn water babies into sweeps or hurt them at all as long as they are good  ah said naughty tom i see what you want you are persuading me all along to go because you are tired of me and want to get rid of me  little ellie opened her eyes very wide at that and they were all brimming over with tears  oh tom tom she said very mournfullyand then she cried oh tom where are you  and tom cried oh ellie where are you  for neither of them could see each othernot the least  little ellie vanished quite away and tom heard her voice calling him and growing smaller and smaller and fainter and fainter till all was silent  who was frightened then but tom  he swam up and down among the rocks into all the halls and chambers faster than ever he swam before but could not find her  he shouted after her but she did not answer he asked all the other children but they had not seen her and at last he went up to the top of the water and began crying and screaming for mrs bedonebyasyoudidwhich perhaps was the best thing to dofor she came in a moment  oh said tom  oh dear oh dear  i have been naughty to ellie and i have killed heri know i have killed her  not quite that said the fairy but i have sent her away home and she will not come back again for i do not know how long  and at that tom cried so bitterly that the salt sea was swelled with his tears and the tide was 3954620819 of an inch higher than it had been the day before  but perhaps that was owing to the waxing of the moon  it may have been so but it is considered right in the new philosophy you know to give spiritual causes for physical phenomenaespecially in parlourtables and of course physical causes for spiritual ones like thinking and praying and knowing right from wrong  and so they odds it till it comes even as folks say down in berkshire  how cruel of you to send ellie away sobbed tom  however i will find her again if i go to the worlds end to look for her  the fairy did not slap tom and tell him to hold his tongue  but she took him on her lap very kindly just as her sister would have done and put him in mind how it was not her fault because she was wound up inside like watches and could not help doing things whether she liked or not  and then she told him how he had been in the nursery long enough and must go out now and see the world if he intended ever to be a man and how he must go all alone by himself as every one else that ever was born has to go and see with his own eyes and smell with his own nose and make his own bed and lie on it and burn his own fingers if he put them into the fire  and then she told him how many fine things there were to be seen in the world and what an odd curious pleasant orderly respectable wellmanaged and on the whole successful as indeed might have been expected sort of a place it was if people would only be tolerably brave and honest and good in it and then she told him not to be afraid of anything he met for nothing would harm him if he remembered all his lessons and did what he knew was right  and at last she comforted poor little tom so much that he was quite eager to go and wanted to set out that minute  only he said if i might see ellie once before i went  why do you want that  becausebecause i should be so much happier if i thought she had forgiven me  and in the twinkling of an eye there stood ellie smiling and looking so happy that tom longed to kiss her but was still afraid it would not be respectful because she was a lady born  i am going ellie said tom  i am going if it is to the worlds end  but i dont like going at all and thats the truth  pooh pooh pooh said the fairy  you will like it very well indeed you little rogue and you know that at the bottom of your heart  but if you dont i will make you like it  come here and see what happens to people who do only what is pleasant  and she took out of one of her cupboards she had all sorts of mysterious cupboards in the cracks of the rocks the most wonderful waterproof book full of such photographs as never were seen  for she had found out photography and this is a fact more than 13598000 years before anybody was born and what is more her photographs did not merely represent light and shade as ours do but colour also and all colours as you may see if you look at a blackcocks tail or a butterflys wing or indeed most things that are or can be so to speak  and therefore her photographs were very curious and famous and the children looked with great delight for the opening of the book  and on the titlepage was written the history of the great and famous nation of the doasyoulikes who came away from the country of hardwork because they wanted to play on the jews harp all day long  in the first picture they saw these doasyoulikes living in the land of readymade at the foot of the happygolucky mountains where flapdoodle grows wild and if you want to know what that is you must read peter simple  they lived very much such a life as those jolly old greeks in sicily whom you may see painted on the ancient vases and really there seemed to be great excuses for them for they had no need to work  instead of houses they lived in the beautiful caves of tufa and bathed in the warm springs three times a day and as for clothes it was so warm there that the gentlemen walked about in little beside a cocked hat and a pair of straps or some light summer tackle of that kind and the ladies all gathered gossamer in autumn when they were not too lazy to make their winter dresses  they were very fond of music but it was too much trouble to learn the piano or the violin and as for dancing that would have been too great an exertion  so they sat on anthills all day long and played on the jews harp and if the ants bit them why they just got up and went to the next anthill till they were bitten there likewise  and they sat under the flapdoodletrees and let the flapdoodle drop into their mouths and under the vines and squeezed the grapejuice down their throats and if any little pigs ran about ready roasted crying come and eat me as was their fashion in that country they waited till the pigs ran against their mouths and then took a bite and were content just as so many oysters would have been  they needed no weapons for no enemies ever came near their land and no tools for everything was readymade to their hand and the stern old fairy necessity never came near them to hunt them up and make them use their wits or die  and so on and so on and so on till there were never such comfortable easygoing happygolucky people in the world  well that is a jolly life said tom  you think so said the fairy  do you see that great peaked mountain there behind said the fairy with smoke coming out of its top  yes  and do you see all those ashes and slag and cinders lying about  yes  then turn over the next five hundred years and you will see what happens next  and behold the mountain had blown up like a barrel of gunpowder and then boiled over like a kettle whereby onethird of the doasyoulikes were blown into the air and another third were smothered in ashes so that there was only onethird left  you see said the fairy what comes of living on a burning mountain  oh why did you not warn them said little ellie  i did warn them all that i could  i let the smoke come out of the mountain and wherever there is smoke there is fire  and i laid the ashes and cinders all about and wherever there are cinders cinders may be again  but they did not like to face facts my dears as very few people do and so they invented a cockandbull story which i am sure i never told them that the smoke was the breath of a giant whom some gods or other had buried under the mountain and that the cinders were what the dwarfs roasted the little pigs whole with and other nonsense of that kind  and when folks are in that humour i cannot teach them save by the good old birchrod  and then she turned over the next five hundred years  and there were the remnant of the doasyoulikes doing as they liked as before  they were too lazy to move away from the mountain so they said if it has blown up once that is all the more reason that it should not blow up again  and they were few in number  but they only said the more the merrier but the fewer the better fare however that was not quite true for all the flapdoodletrees were killed by the volcano and they had eaten all the roast pigs who of course could not be expected to have little ones  so they had to live very hard on nuts and roots which they scratched out of the ground with sticks  some of them talked of sowing corn as their ancestors used to do before they came into the land of readymade but they had forgotten how to make ploughs they had forgotten even how to make jews harps by this time and had eaten all the seedcorn which they brought out of the land of hardwork years since and of course it was too much trouble to go away and find more  so they lived miserably on roots and nuts and all the weakly little children had great stomachs and then died  why said tom they are growing no better than savages  and look how ugly they are all getting said ellie  yes when people live on poor vegetables instead of roast beef and plumpudding their jaws grow large and their lips grow coarse like the poor paddies who eat potatoes  and she turned over the next five hundred years  and there they were all living up in trees and making nests to keep off the rain and underneath the trees lions were prowling about  why said ellie the lions seem to have eaten a good many of them for there are very few left now  yes said the fairy you see it was only the strongest and most active ones who could climb the trees and so escape  but what great hulking broadshouldered chaps they are said tom they are a rough lot as ever i saw  yes they are getting very strong now for the ladies will not marry any but the very strongest and fiercest gentlemen who can help them up the trees out of the lions way  and she turned over the next five hundred years  and in that they were fewer still and stronger and fiercer but their feet had changed shape very oddly for they laid hold of the branches with their great toes as if they had been thumbs just as a hindoo tailor uses his toes to thread his needle  the children were very much surprised and asked the fairy whether that was her doing  yes and no she said smiling  it was only those who could use their feet as well as their hands who could get a good living  or indeed get married so that they got the best of everything and starved out all the rest and those who are left keep up a regular breed of toethumbmen as a breed of shorthorns or are skye terriers or fancy pigeons is kept up  but there is a hairy one among them said ellie  ah said the fairy that will be a great man in his time and chief of all the tribe  and when she turned over the next five hundred years it was true  for this hairy chief had had hairy children and they hairier children still and every one wished to marry hairy husbands and have hairy children too for the climate was growing so damp that none but the hairy ones could live  all the rest coughed and sneezed and had sore throats and went into consumptions before they could grow up to be men and women  then the fairy turned over the next five hundred years  and they were fewer still  why there is one on the ground picking up roots said ellie and he cannot walk upright  no more he could for in the same way that the shape of their feet had altered the shape of their backs had altered also  why cried tom i declare they are all apes  something fearfully like it poor foolish creatures said the fairy  they are grown so stupid now that they can hardly think for none of them have used their wits for many hundred years  they have almost forgotten too how to talk  for each stupid child forgot some of the words it heard from its stupid parents and had not wits enough to make fresh words for itself  beside they are grown so fierce and suspicious and brutal that they keep out of each others way and mope and sulk in the dark forests never hearing each others voice till they have forgotten almost what speech is like  i am afraid they will all be apes very soon and all by doing only what they liked  and in the next five hundred years they were all dead and gone by bad food and wild beasts and hunters all except one tremendous old fellow with jaws like a jack who stood full seven feet high and m du chaillu came up to him and shot him as he stood roaring and thumping his breast  and he remembered that his ancestors had once been men and tried to say am i not a man and a brother but had forgotten how to use his tongue and then he had tried to call for a doctor but he had forgotten the word for one  so all he said was ubboboo and died  and that was the end of the great and jolly nation of the doasyoulikes  and when tom and ellie came to the end of the book they looked very sad and solemn and they had good reason so to do for they really fancied that the men were apes and never thought in their simplicity of asking whether the creatures had hippopotamus majors in their brains or not in which case as you have been told already they could not possibly have been apes though they were more apish than the apes of all aperies  but could you not have saved them from becoming apes said little ellie at last  at first my dear if only they would have behaved like men and set to work to do what they did not like  but the longer they waited and behaved like the dumb beasts who only do what they like the stupider and clumsier they grew till at last they were past all cure for they had thrown their own wits away  it is such things as this that help to make me so ugly that i know not when i shall grow fair  and where are they all now asked ellie  exactly where they ought to be my dear  yes said the fairy solemnly half to herself as she closed the wonderful book  folks say now that i can make beasts into men by circumstance and selection and competition and so forth  well perhaps they are right and perhaps again they are wrong  that is one of the seven things which i am forbidden to tell till the coming of the cocqcigrues and at all events it is no concern of theirs  whatever their ancestors were men they are and i advise them to behave as such and act accordingly  but let them recollect this that there are two sides to every question and a downhill as well as an uphill road and if i can turn beasts into men i can by the same laws of circumstance and selection and competition turn men into beasts  you were very near being turned into a beast once or twice little tom  indeed if you had not made up your mind to go on this journey and see the world like an englishman i am not sure but that you would have ended as an eft in a pond  oh dear me said tom sooner than that and be all over slime ill go this minute if it is to the worlds end    chapter vii    and nature the old nurse took the child upon her knee saying here is a story book thy father hath written for thee  come wander with me she said into regions yet untrod and read what is still unread in the manuscripts of god  and he wandered away and away with nature the dear old nurse who sang to him night and day the rhymes of the universe  longfellow   now said tom i am ready be off if its to the worlds end  ah said the fairy that is a brave good boy  but you must go farther than the worlds end if you want to find mr grimes for he is at the otherendofnowhere  you must go to shiny wall and through the white gate that never was opened and then you will come to peacepool and mother careys haven where the good whales go when they die  and there mother carey will tell you the way to the otherendofnowhere and there you will find mr grimes  oh dear said tom  but i do not know my way to shiny wall or where it is at all  little boys must take the trouble to find out things for themselves or they will never grow to be men so that you must ask all the beasts in the sea and the birds in the air and if you have been good to them some of them will tell you the way to shiny wall  well said tom it will be a long journey so i had better start at once  goodbye miss ellie you know i am getting a big boy and i must go out and see the world  i know you must said ellie but you will not forget me tom  i shall wait here till you come  and she shook hands with him and bade him goodbye  tom longed very much again to kiss her but he thought it would not be respectful considering she was a lady born so he promised not to forget her  but his little whirlabout of a head was so full of the notion of going out to see the world that it forgot her in five minutes  however though his head forgot her i am glad to say his heart did not  so he asked all the beasts in the sea and all the birds in the air but none of them knew the way to shiny wall  for why  he was still too far down south  then he met a ship far larger than he had ever seena gallant oceansteamer with a long cloud of smoke trailing behind and he wondered how she went on without sails and swam up to her to see a school of dolphins were running races round and round her going three feet for her one and tom asked them the way to shiny wall but they did not know  then he tried to find out how she moved and at last he saw her screw and was so delighted with it that he played under her quarter all day till he nearly had his nose knocked off by the fans and thought it time to move  then he watched the sailors upon deck and the ladies with their bonnets and parasols  but none of them could see him because their eyes were not openedas indeed most peoples eyes are not  at last there came out into the quartergallery a very pretty lady in deep black widows weeds and in her arms a baby  she leaned over the quartergallery and looked back and back toward england far away and as she looked she sang   i  soft soft wind from out the sweet south sliding waft thy silver cloudwebs athwart the summer sea thin thin threads of mist on dewy fingers twining weave a veil of dappled gauze to shade my babe and me  ii  deep deep love within thine own abyss abiding pour thyself abroad o lord on earth and air and sea worn weary hearts within thy holy temple hiding shield from sorrow sin and shame my helpless babe and me   her voice was so soft and low and the music of the air so sweet that tom could have listened to it all day  but as she held the baby over the gallery rail to show it the dolphins leaping and the water gurgling in the ships wake lo and behold the baby saw tom  he was quite sure of that for when their eyes met the baby smiled and held out his hands and tom smiled and held out his hands too and the baby kicked and leaped as if it wanted to jump overboard to him  what do you see my darling said the lady and her eyes followed the babys till she too caught sight of tom swimming about among the foambeads below  she gave a little shriek and start and then she said quite quietly babies in the sea  well perhaps it is the happiest place for them and waved her hand to tom and cried wait a little darling only a little  and perhaps we shall go with you and be at rest  and at that an old nurse all in black came out and talked to her and drew her in  and tom turned away northward sad and wondering and watched the great steamer slide away into the dusk and the lights on board peep out one by one and die out again and the long bar of smoke fade away into the evening mist till all was out of sight  and he swam northward again day after day till at last he met the king of the herrings with a currycomb growing out of his nose and a sprat in his mouth for a cigar and asked him the way to shiny wall so he bolted his sprat head foremost and said  if i were you young gentleman i should go to the allalonestone and ask the last of the gairfowl  she is of a very ancient clan very nearly as ancient as my own and knows a good deal which these modern upstarts dont as ladies of old houses are likely to do  tom asked his way to her and the king of the herrings told him very kindly for he was a courteous old gentleman of the old school though he was horribly ugly and strangely bedizened too like the old dandies who lounge in the clubhouse windows  but just as tom had thanked him and set off he called after him hi  i say can you fly  i never tried says tom  why  because if you can i should advise you to say nothing to the old lady about it  there take a hint  goodbye  and away tom went for seven days and seven nights due northwest till he came to a great codbank the like of which he never saw before  the great cod lay below in tens of thousands and gobbled shellfish all day long and the blue sharks roved above in hundreds and gobbled them when they came up  so they ate and ate and ate each other as they had done since the making of the world for no man had come here yet to catch them and find out how rich old mother carey is  and there he saw the last of the gairfowl standing up on the allalonestones all alone  and a very grand old lady she was full three feet high and bolt upright like some old highland chieftainess  she had on a black velvet gown and a white pinner and apron and a very high bridge to her nose which is a sure mark of high breeding and a large pair of white spectacles on it which made her look rather odd  but it was the ancient fashion of her house  and instead of wings she had two little feathery arms with which she fanned herself and complained of the dreadful heat and she kept on crooning an old song to herself which she learnt when she was a little babybird long ago    two little birds they sat on a stone one swam away and then there was one with a fallallalady  the other swam after and then there was none and so the poor stone was left all alone with a fallallalady   it was flew away properly and not swam away  but as she could not fly she had a right to alter it  however it was a very fit song for her to sing because she was a lady herself  tom came up to her very humbly and made his bow and the first thing she said was   have you wings  can you fly  oh dear no maam i should not think of such thing said cunning little tom  then i shall have great pleasure in talking to you my dear  it is quite refreshing nowadays to see anything without wings  they must all have wings forsooth now every new upstart sort of bird and fly  what can they want with flying and raising themselves above their proper station in life  in the days of my ancestors no birds ever thought of having wings and did very well without and now they all laugh at me because i keep to the good old fashion why the very marrocks and dovekies have got wings the vulgar creatures and poor little ones enough they are and my own cousins too the razorbills who are gentlefolk born and ought to know better than to ape their inferiors  and so she was running on while tom tried to get in a word edgeways and at last he did when the old lady got out of breath and began fanning herself again and then he asked if she knew the way to shiny wall  shiny wall  who should know better than i  we all came from shiny wall thousands of years ago when it was decently cold and the climate was fit for gentlefolk but now what with the heat and what with these vulgarwinged things who fly up and down and eat everything so that gentlepeoples hunting is all spoilt and one really cannot get ones living or hardly venture off the rock for fear of being flown against by some creature that would not have dared to come within a mile of one a thousand years agowhat was i saying  why we have quite gone down in the world my dear and have nothing left but our honour  and i am the last of my family  a friend of mine and i came and settled on this rock when we were young to be out of the way of low people  once we were a great nation and spread over all the northern isles  but men shot us so and knocked us on the head and took our eggswhy if you will believe it they say that on the coast of labrador the sailors used to lay a plank from the rock on board the thing called their ship and drive us along the plank by hundreds till we tumbled down into the ships waist in heaps and then i suppose they ate us the nasty fellows  wellbutwhat was i saying  at last there were none of us left except on the old gairfowlskerry just off the iceland coast up which no man could climb  even there we had no peace for one day when i was quite a young girl the land rocked and the sea boiled and the sky grew dark and all the air was filled with smoke and dust and down tumbled the old gairfowlskerry into the sea  the dovekies and marrocks of course all flew away but we were too proud to do that  some of us were dashed to pieces and some drowned and those who were left got away to eldey and the dovekies tell me they are all dead now and that another gairfowlskerry has risen out of the sea close to the old one but that it is such a poor flat place that it is not safe to live on  and so here i am left alone  this was the gairfowls story and strange as it may seem it is every word of it true  if you only had had wings said tom then you might all have flown away too  yes young gentleman  and if people are not gentleman and ladies and forget that noblesse oblige they will find it as easy to get on in the world as other people who dont care what they do  why if i had not recollected that noblesse oblige i should not have been all alone now  and the poor old lady sighed  how was that maam  why my dear a gentleman came hither with me and after we had been here some time he wanted to marryin fact he actually proposed to me  well i cant blame him i was young and very handsome then i dont deny  but you see i could not hear of such a thing because he was my deceased sisters husband you see  of course not maam said tom though of course he knew nothing about it  she was very much diseased i suppose  you do not understand me my dear  i mean that being a lady and with right and honourable feelings as our house always has had i felt it my duty to snub him and howk him and peck him continually to keep him at his proper distance and to tell the truth i once pecked him a little too hard poor fellow and he tumbled backwards off the rock andreally it was very unfortunate but it was not my faulta shark coming by saw him flapping and snapped him up and since then i have lived all alone    with a fallallalady   and soon i shall be gone my little dear and nobody will miss me and then the poor stone will be left all alone  but please which is the way to shiny wall said tom  oh you must go my little dearyou must go  let me seei am surethat isreally my poor old brains are getting quite puzzled  do you know my little dear i am afraid if you want to know you must ask some of these vulgar birds about for i have quite forgotten  and the poor old gairfowl began to cry tears of pure oil and tom was quite sorry for her and for himself too for he was at his wits end whom to ask  but by there came a flock of petrels who are mother careys own chickens and tom thought them much prettier than lady gairfowl and so perhaps they were for mother carey had had a great deal of fresh experience between the time that she invented the gairfowl and the time that she invented them  they flitted along like a flock of black swallows and hopped and skipped from wave to wave lifting up their little feet behind them so daintily and whistling to each other so tenderly that tom fell in love with them at once and called them to know the way to shiny wall  shiny wall  do you want shiny wall  then come with us and we will show you  we are mother careys own chickens and she sends us out over all the seas to show the good birds the way home  tom was delighted and swam off to them after he had made his bow to the gairfowl  but she would not return his bow  but held herself bolt upright and wept tears of oil as she sang   and so the poor stone was left all alone with a fallallalady   but she was wrong there for the stone was not left all alone  and the next time that tom goes by it he will see a sight worth seeing  the old gairfowl is gone already  but there are better things come in her place and when tom comes he will see the fishingsmacks anchored there in hundreds from scotland and from ireland and from the orkneys and the shetlands and from all the northern ports full of the children of the old norse vikings the masters of the sea  and the men will be hauling in the great cod by thousands till their hands are sore from the lines and they will be making codliver oil and guano and salting down the fish and there will be a manofwar steamer there to protect them and a lighthouse to show them the way and you and i perhaps shall go some day to the allalonestone to the great summer seafair and dredge strange creatures such as man never saw before and we shall hear the sailors boast that it is not the worst jewel in queen victorias crown for there are eighty miles of codbank and food for all the poor folk in the land  that is what tom will see and perhaps you and i shall see it too  and then we shall not be sorry because we cannot get a gairfowl to stuff much less find gairfowl enough to drive them into stone pens and slaughter them as the old norsemen did or drive them on board along a plank till the ship was victualled with them as the old english and french rovers used to do of whom dear old hakluyt tells  but we shall remember what mr tennyson says  how   the old order changeth giving place to the new and god fulfils himself in many ways   and now tom was all agog to start for shiny wall but the petrels said no  they must go first to allfowlsness and wait there for the great gathering of all the seabirds before they start for their summer breedingplaces far away in the northern isles and there they would be sure to find some birds which were going to shiny wall  but where allfowlsness was he must promise never to tell lest men should go there and shoot the birds and stuff them and put them into stupid museums instead of leaving them to play and breed and work in mother careys watergarden where they ought to be  so where allfowlsness is nobody must know and all that is to be said about it is that tom waited there many days and as he waited he saw a very curious sight  on the rabbit burrows on the shore there gathered hundreds and hundreds of hoodiecrows such as you see in cambridgeshire  and they made such a noise that tom came on shore and went up to see what was the matter  and there he found them holding their great caucus which they hold every year in the north and all their stumporators were speechifying and for a tribune the speaker stood on an old sheeps skull  and they cawed and cawed and boasted of all the clever things they had done how many lambs eyes they had picked out and how many dead bullocks they had eaten and how many young grouse they had swallowed whole and how many grouseeggs they had flown away with stuck on the point of their bills which is the hoodiecrows particularly clever feat of which he is as proud as a gipsy is of doing the hokanybaro and what that is i wont tell you  and at last they brought out the prettiest neatest young ladycrow that ever was seen and set her in the middle and all began abusing and vilifying and rating and bullyragging at her because she had stolen no grouseeggs and had actually dared to say that she would not steal any  so she was to be tried publicly by their laws for the hoodies always try some offenders in their great yearly parliament  and there she stood in the middle in her black gown and gray hood looking as meek and as neat as a quakeress and they all bawled at her at once   and it was in vain that she pleaded    that she did not like grouseeggs that she could get her living very well without them that she was afraid to eat them for fear of the gamekeepers that she had not the heart to eat them because the grouse were such pretty kind jolly birds and a dozen reasons more   for all the other scaulcrows set upon her and pecked her to death there and then before tom could come to help her and then flew away very proud of what they had done  now was not this a scandalous transaction  but they are true republicans these hoodies who do every one just what he likes and make other people do so too so that for any freedom of speech thought or action which is allowed among them they might as well be american citizens of the new school  but the fairies took the good crow and gave her nine new sets of feathers running and turned her at last into the most beautiful bird of paradise with a green velvet suit and a long tail and sent her to eat fruit in the spice islands where cloves and nutmegs grow  and mrs bedonebyasyoudid settled her account with the wicked hoodies  for as they flew away what should they find but a nasty dead dogon which they all set to work peeking and gobbling and cawing and quarrelling to their hearts content  but the moment afterwards they all threw up their bills into the air and gave one screech and then turned head over heels backward and fell down dead one hundred and twentythree of them at once  for why the fairy had told the gamekeeper in a dream to fill the dead dog full of strychnine and so he did  and after a while the birds began to gather at allfowlsness in thousands and tens of thousands blackening all the air swans and brant geese harlequins and eiders harolds and garganeys smews and goosanders divers and loons grebes and dovekies auks and razorbills gannets and petrels skuas and terns with gulls beyond all naming or numbering and they paddled and washed and splashed and combed and brushed themselves on the sand till the shore was white with feathers and they quacked and clucked and gabbled and chattered and screamed and whooped as they talked over matters with their friends and settled where they were to go and breed that summer till you might have heard them ten miles off and lucky it was for them that there was no one to hear them but the old keeper who lived all alone upon the ness in a turf hut thatched with heather and fringed round with great stones slung across the roof by bentropes lest the winter gales should blow the hut right away  but he never minded the birds nor hurt them because they were not in season indeed he minded but two things in the whole world and those were his bible and his grouse for he was as good an old scotchman as ever knit stockings on a winters night  only when all the birds were going he toddled out and took off his cap to them and wished them a merry journey and a safe return and then gathered up all the feathers which they had left and cleaned them to sell down south and make feather beds for stuffy people to lie on  then the petrels asked this bird and that whether they would take tom to shiny wall  but one set was going to sutherland and one to the shetlands and one to norway and one to spitzbergen and one to iceland and one to greenland  but none would go to shiny wall so the goodnatured petrels said that they would show him part of the way themselves but they were only going as far as jan mayens land and after that he must shift for himself  and then all the birds rose up and streamed away in long black lines north and northeast and northwest across the bright blue summer sky and their cry was like ten thousand packs of hounds and ten thousand peals of bells  only the puffins stayed behind and killed the young rabbits and laid their eggs in the rabbitburrows which was rough practice certainly but a man must see to his own family  and as tom and the petrels went northeastward it began to blow right hard for the old gentleman in the gray greatcoat who looks after the big copper boiler in the gulf of mexico had got behindhand with his work so mother carey had sent an electric message to him for more steam and now the steam was coming as much in an hour as ought to have come in a week puffing and roaring and swishing and swirling till you could not see where the sky ended and the sea began  but tom and the petrels never cared for the gale was right abaft and away they went over the crests of the billows as merry as so many flyingfish  and at last they saw an ugly sightthe black side of a great ship waterlogged in the trough of the sea  her funnel and her masts were overboard and swayed and surged under her lee her decks were swept as clean as a barn floor and there was no living soul on board  the petrels flew up to her and wailed round her for they were very sorry indeed and also they expected to find some salt pork and tom scrambled on board of her and looked round frightened and sad  and there in a little cot lashed tight under the bulwark lay a baby fast asleep the very same baby tom saw at once which he had seen in the singing ladys arms  he went up to it and wanted to wake it but behold from under the cot out jumped a little black and tan terrier dog and began barking and snapping at tom and would not let him touch the cot  tom knew the dogs teeth could not hurt him  but at least it could shove him away and did and he and the dog fought and struggled for he wanted to help the baby and did not want to throw the poor dog overboard  but as they were struggling there came a tall green sea and walked in over the weather side of the ship and swept them all into the waves  oh the baby the baby screamed tom  but the next moment he did not scream at all for he saw the cot settling down through the green water with the baby smiling in it fast asleep and he saw the fairies come up from below and carry baby and cradle gently down in their soft arms and then he knew it was all right and that there would be a new waterbaby in st brandans isle  and the poor little dog  why after he had kicked and coughed a little he sneezed so hard that he sneezed himself clean out of his skin and turned into a waterdog and jumped and danced round tom and ran over the crests of the waves and snapped at the jellyfish and the mackerel and followed tom the whole way to the otherendofnowhere  then they went on again till they began to see the peak of jan mayens land standingup like a white sugarloaf two miles above the clouds  and there they fell in with a whole flock of mollymocks who were feeding on a dead whale  these are the fellows to show you the way said mother careys chickens we cannot help you farther north  we dont like to get among the ice pack for fear it should nip our toes  but the mollys dare fly anywhere  so the petrels called to the mollys  but they were so busy and greedy gobbling and peeking and spluttering and fighting over the blubber that they did not take the least notice  come come said the petrels you lazy greedy lubbers this young gentleman is going to mother carey and if you dont attend on him you wont earn your discharge from her you know  greedy we are says a great fat old molly but lazy we aint and as for lubbers were no more lubbers than you  lets have a look at the lad  and he flapped right into toms face and stared at him in the most impudent way for the mollys are audacious fellows as all whalers know and then asked him where he hailed from and what land he sighted last  and when tom told him he seemed pleased and said he was a good plucked one to have got so far  come along lads he said to the rest and give this little chap a cast over the pack for mother careys sake  weve eaten blubber enough for today and well een work out a bit of our time by helping the lad  so the mollys took tom up on their backs and flew off with him laughing and jokingand oh how they did smell of train oil  who are you you jolly birds asked tom  we are the spirits of the old greenland skippers as every sailor knows who hunted here right whales and horsewhales full hundreds of years agone  but because we were saucy and greedy we were all turned into mollys to eat whales blubber all our days but lubbers we are none and could sail a ship now against any man in the north seas though we dont hold with this newfangled steam  and its a shame of those black imps of petrels to call us so but because theyre her graces pets they think they may say anything they like  and who are you asked tom of him for he saw that he was the king of all the birds  my name is hendrick hudson and a right good skipper was i and my name will last to the worlds end in spite of all the wrong i did for i discovered hudson river and i named hudsons bay and many have come in my wake that dared not have shown me the way  but i was a hard man in my time thats truth and stole the poor indians off the coast of maine and sold them for slaves down in virginia and at last i was so cruel to my sailors here in these very seas that they set me adrift in an open boat and i never was heard of more  so now im the king of all mollys till ive worked out my time  and now they came to the edge of the pack and beyond it they could see shiny wall looming through mist and snow and storm  but the pack rolled horribly upon the swell and the ice giants fought and roared and leapt upon each others backs and ground each other to powder so that tom was afraid to venture among them lest he should be ground to powder too  and he was the more afraid when he saw lying among the ice pack the wrecks of many a gallant ship some with masts and yards all standing some with the seamen frozen fast on board  alas alas for them  they were all true english hearts and they came to their end like good knightserrant in searching for the white gate that never was opened yet  but the good mollys took tom and his dog up and flew with them safe over the pack and the roaring ice giants and set them down at the foot of shiny wall  and where is the gate asked tom  there is no gate said the mollys  no gate cried tom aghast  none never a crack of one and thats the whole of the secret as better fellows lad than you have found to their cost and if there had been theyd have killed by now every right whale that swims the sea  what am i to do then  dive under the floe to be sure if you have pluck  ive not come so far to turn now said tom so here goes for a header  a lucky voyage to you lad said the mollys we knew you were one of the right sort  so goodbye  why dont you come too asked tom  but the mollys only wailed sadly we cant go yet we cant go yet and flew away over the pack  so tom dived under the great white gate which never was opened yet and went on in black darkness at the bottom of the sea for seven days and seven nights  and yet he was not a bit frightened  why should he be  he was a brave english lad whose business is to go out and see all the world  and at last he saw the light and clear clear water overhead and up he came a thousand fathoms among clouds of seamoths which fluttered round his head  there were moths with pink heads and wings and opal bodies that flapped about slowly moths with brown wings that flapped about quickly yellow shrimps that hopped and skipped most quickly of all and jellies of all the colours in the world that neither hopped nor skipped but only dawdled and yawned and would not get out of his way  the dog snapped at them till his jaws were tired but tom hardly minded them at all he was so eager to get to the top of the water and see the pool where the good whales go  and a very large pool it was miles and miles across though the air was so clear that the ice cliffs on the opposite side looked as if they were close at hand  all round it the ice cliffs rose in walls and spires and battlements and caves and bridges and stories and galleries in which the icefairies live and drive away the storms and clouds that mother careys pool may lie calm from years end to years end  and the sun acted policeman and walked round outside every day peeping just over the top of the ice wall to see that all went right and now and then he played conjuring tricks or had an exhibition of fireworks to amuse the icefairies  for he would make himself into four or five suns at once or paint the sky with rings and crosses and crescents of white fire and stick himself in the middle of them and wink at the fairies and i daresay they were very much amused for anythings fun in the country  and there the good whales lay the happy sleepy beasts upon the still oily sea  they were all right whales you must know and finners and razorbacks and bottlenoses and spotted sea unicorns with long ivory horns  but the sperm whales are such raging ramping roaring rumbustious fellows that if mother carey let them in there would be no more peace in peacepool  so she packs them away in a great pond by themselves at the south pole two hundred and sixtythree miles southsoutheast of mount erebus the great volcano in the ice and there they butt each other with their ugly noses day and night from years end to years end  but here there were only good quiet beasts lying about like the black hulls of sloops and blowing every now and then jets of white steam or sculling round with their huge mouths open for the sea moths to swim down their throats  there were no threshers there to thresh their poor old backs or swordfish to stab their stomachs or sawfish to rip them up or icesharks to bite lumps out of their sides or whalers to harpoon and lance them  they were quite safe and happy there and all they had to do was to wait quietly in peacepool till mother carey sent for them to make them out of old beasts into new  tom swam up to the nearest whale and asked the way to mother carey  there she sits in the middle said the whale  tom looked but he could see nothing in the middle of the pool but one peaked iceberg  and he said so  thats mother carey said the whale as you will find when you get to her  there she sits making old beasts into new all the year round  how does she do that  thats her concern not mine said the old whale and yawned so wide for he was very large that there swam into his mouth 943 seamoths 13846 jellyfish no bigger than pins heads a string of salpae nine yards long and fortythree little icecrabs who gave each other a parting pinch all round tucked their legs under their stomachs and determined to die decently like julius caesar  i suppose said tom she cuts up a great whale like you into a whole shoal of porpoises  at which the old whale laughed so violently that he coughed up all the creatures who swam away again very thankful at having escaped out of that terrible whalebone net of his from which bourne no traveller returns and tom went on to the iceberg wondering  and when he came near it it took the form of the grandest old lady he had ever seena white marble lady sitting on a white marble throne  and from the foot of the throne there swum away out and out into the sea millions of newborn creatures of more shapes and colours than man ever dreamed  and they were mother careys children whom she makes out of the seawater all day long  he expected of courselike some grown people who ought to know betterto find her snipping piecing fitting stitching cobbling basting filing planing hammering turning polishing moulding measuring chiselling clipping and so forth as men do when they go to work to make anything  but instead of that she sat quite still with her chin upon her hand looking down into the sea with two great grand blue eyes as blue as the sea itself  her hair was as white as the snowfor she was very very oldin fact as old as anything which you are likely to come across except the difference between right and wrong  and when she saw tom she looked at him very kindly  what do you want my little man  it is long since i have seen a waterbaby here  tom told her his errand and asked the way to the otherendof nowhere  you ought to know yourself for you have been there already  have i maam  im sure i forget all about it  then look at me  and as tom looked into her great blue eyes he recollected the way perfectly  now was not that strange  thank you maam said tom  then i wont trouble your ladyship any more i hear you are very busy  i am never more busy than i am now she said without stirring a finger  i heard maam that you were always making new beasts out of old  so people fancy  but i am not going to trouble myself to make things my little dear  i sit here and make them make themselves  you are a clever fairy indeed thought tom  and he was quite right  that is a grand trick of good old mother careys and a grand answer which she has had occasion to make several times to impertinent people  there was once for instance a fairy who was so clever that she found out how to make butterflies  i dont mean sham ones no but real live ones which would fly and eat and lay eggs and do everything that they ought and she was so proud of her skill that she went flying straight off to the north pole to boast to mother carey how she could make butterflies  but mother carey laughed  know silly child she said that any one can make things if they will take time and trouble enough  but it is not every one who like me can make things make themselves  but people do not yet believe that mother carey is as clever as all that comes to and they will not till they too go the journey to the otherendofnowhere  and now my pretty little man said mother carey you are sure you know the way to the otherendofnowhere  tom thought and behold he had forgotten it utterly  that is because you took your eyes off me  tom looked at her again and recollected and then looked away and forgot in an instant  but what am i to do maam  for i cant keep looking at you when i am somewhere else  you must do without me as most people have to do for nine hundred and ninetynine thousandths of their lives and look at the dog instead for he knows the way well enough and will not forget it  besides you may meet some very queertempered people there who will not let you pass without this passport of mine which you must hang round your neck and take care of and of course as the dog will always go behind you you must go the whole way backward  backward cried tom  then i shall not be able to see my way  on the contrary if you look forward you will not see a step before you and be certain to go wrong but if you look behind you and watch carefully whatever you have passed and especially keep your eye on the dog who goes by instinct and therefore cant go wrong then you will know what is coming next as plainly as if you saw it in a lookingglass  tom was very much astonished  but he obeyed her for he had learnt always to believe what the fairies told him  so it is my dear child said mother carey and i will tell you a story which will show you that i am perfectly right as it is my custom to be  once on a time there were two brothers  one was called prometheus because he always looked before him and boasted that he was wise beforehand  the other was called epimetheus because he always looked behind him and did not boast at all but said humbly like the irishman that he had sooner prophesy after the event  well prometheus was a very clever fellow of course and invented all sorts of wonderful things  but unfortunately when they were set to work to work was just what they would not do  wherefore very little has come of them and very little is left of them and now nobody knows what they were save a few archaeological old gentlemen who scratch in queer corners and find little there save ptinum furem blaptem mortisagam acarum horridum and tineam laciniarum  but epimetheus was a very slow fellow certainly and went among men for a clod and a muff and a milksop and a slowcoach and a bloke and a boodle and so forth  and very little he did for many years  but what he did he never had to do over again  and what happened at last  there came to the two brothers the most beautiful creature that ever was seen pandora by name which means all the gifts of the gods  but because she had a strange box in her hand this fanciful forecasting suspicious prudential theoretical deductive prophesying prometheus who was always settling what was going to happen would have nothing to do with pretty pandora and her box  but epimetheus took her and it as he took everything that came and married her for better for worse as every man ought whenever he has even the chance of a good wife  and they opened the box between them of course to see what was inside  for else of what possible use could it have been to them  and out flew all the ills which flesh is heir to all the children of the four great bogies selfwill ignorance fear and dirtfor instance   measles        famines monks          quacks scarlatina     unpaid bills idols          tight stays hoopingcoughs potatoes popes          bad wine wars           despots peacemongers   demagogues and worst of all naughty boys and girls   but one thing remained at the bottom of the box and that was hope  so epimetheus got a great deal of trouble as most men do in this world  but he got the three best things in the world into the bargaina good wife and experience and hope  while prometheus had just as much trouble and a great deal more as you will hear of his own making with nothing beside save fancies spun out of his own brain as a spider spins her web out of her stomach  and prometheus kept on looking before him so far ahead that as he was running about with a box of lucifers which were the only useful things he ever invented and do as much harm as good he trod on his own nose and tumbled down as most deductive philosophers do whereby he set the thames on fire and they have hardly put it out again yet  so he had to be chained to the top of a mountain with a vulture by him to give him a peck whenever he stirred lest he should turn the whole world upside down with his prophecies and his theories  but stupid old epimetheus went working and grubbing on with the help of his wife pandora always looking behind him to see what had happened till he really learnt to know now and then what would happen next and understood so well which side his bread was buttered and which way the cat jumped that he began to make things which would work and go on working too to till and drain the ground and to make looms and ships and railroads and steam ploughs and electric telegraphs and all the things which you see in the great exhibition and to foretell famine and bad weather and the price of stocks and what is hardest of all the next vagary of the great idol whirligig which some call public opinion till at last he grew as rich as a jew and as fat as a farmer and people thought twice before they meddled with him but only once before they asked him to help them for because he earned his money well he could afford to spend it well likewise  and his children are the men of science who get good lasting work done in the world but the children of prometheus are the fanatics and the theorists and the bigots and the bores and the noisy windy people who go telling silly folk what will happen instead of looking to see what has happened already  now was not mother careys a wonderful story  and i am happy to say tom believed it every word  for so it happened to tom likewise  he was very sorely tried for though by keeping the dog to heels or rather to toes for he had to walk backward he could see pretty well which way the dog was hunting yet it was much slower work to go backwards than to go forwards  but what was more trying still no sooner had he got out of peacepool than there came running to him all the conjurors fortunetellers astrologers prophesiers projectors prestigiators as many as were in those parts and there are too many of them everywhere old mother shipton on her broomstick with merlin thomas the rhymer gerbertus rabanus maurus nostradamus zadkiel raphael moore old nixon and a good many in black coats and white ties who might have known better considering in what century they were born all bawling and screaming at him look ahead only look ahead and we will show you what man never saw before and right away to the end of the world  but i am proud to say that though tom had not been to cambridge for if he had he would have certainly been senior wranglerhe was such a little dogged hard gnarly foursquare brick of an english boy that he never turned his head round once all the way from peacepool to the otherendofnowhere  but kept his eye on the dog and let him pick out the scent hot or cold straight or crooked wet or dry up hill or down dale by which means he never made a single mistake and saw all the wonderful and hitherto by nomortalmanimagined things which it is my duty to relate to you in the next chapter    chapter viii and last    come to me o ye children for i hear you at your play and the questions that perplexed me have vanished quite away  ye open the eastern windows that look towards the sun where thoughts are singing swallows and the brooks of morning run        for what are all our contrivings and the wisdom of our books when compared with your caresses and the gladness of your looks  ye are better than all the ballads that ever were sung or said for ye are living poems and all the rest are dead  longfellow   here begins the nevertobetoomuchstudied account of the nine hundredandninetyninth part of the wonderful things which tom saw on his journey to the otherendofnowhere which all good little children are requested to read that if ever they get to the otherendofnowhere as they may very probably do they may not burst out laughing or try to run away or do any other silly vulgar thing which may offend mrs bedonebyasyoudid  now as soon as tom had left peacepool he came to the white lap of the great seamother ten thousand fathoms deep where she makes worldpap all day long for the steamgiants to knead and the firegiants to bake till it has risen and hardened into mountain loaves and islandcakes  and there tom was very near being kneaded up in the worldpap and turned into a fossil waterbaby which would have astonished the geological society of new zealand some hundreds of thousands of years hence  for as he walked along in the silence of the seatwilight on the soft white ocean floor he was aware of a hissing and a roaring and a thumping and a pumping as of all the steamengines in the world at once  and when he came near the water grew boilinghot not that that hurt him in the least  but it also grew as foul as gruel and every moment he stumbled over dead shells and fish and sharks and seals and whales which had been killed by the hot water  and at last he came to the great seaserpent himself lying dead at the bottom and as he was too thick to scramble over tom had to walk round him threequarters of a mile and more which put him out of his path sadly and when he had got round he came to the place called stop  and there he stopped and just in time  for he was on the edge of a vast hole in the bottom of the sea up which was rushing and roaring clear steam enough to work all the engines in the world at once so clear indeed that it was quite light at moments and tom could see almost up to the top of the water above and down below into the pit for nobody knows how far  but as soon as he bent his head over the edge he got such a rap on the nose from pebbles that he jumped back again for the steam as it rushed up rasped away the sides of the hole and hurled it up into the sea in a shower of mud and gravel and ashes and then it spread all around and sank again and covered in the dead fish so fast that before tom had stood there five minutes he was buried in silt up to his ankles and began to be afraid that he should have been buried alive  and perhaps he would have been but that while he was thinking the whole piece of ground on which he stood was torn off and blown upwards and away flew tom a mile up through the sea wondering what was coming next  at last he stoppedthump and found himself tight in the legs of the most wonderful bogy which he had ever seen  it had i dont know how many wings as big as the sails of a windmill and spread out in a ring like them and with them it hovered over the steam which rushed up as a ball hovers over the top of a fountain  and for every wing above it had a leg below with a claw like a comb at the tip and a nostril at the root and in the middle it had no stomach and one eye and as for its mouth that was all on one side as the madreporiform tubercle in a star fish is  well it was a very strange beast but no stranger than some dozens which you may see  what do you want here it cried quite peevishly getting in my way and it tried to drop tom  but he held on tight to its claws thinking himself safer where he was  so tom told him who he was and what his errand was  and the thing winked its one eye and sneered  i am too old to be taken in in that way  you are come after gold i know you are  gold  what is gold  and really tom did not know but the suspicious old bogy would not believe him  but after a while tom began to understand a little  for as the vapours came up out of the hole the bogy smelt them with his nostrils and combed them and sorted them with his combs and then when they steamed up through them against his wings they were changed into showers and streams of metal  from one wing fell golddust and from another silver and from another copper and from another tin and from another lead and so on and sank into the soft mud into veins and cracks and hardened there  whereby it comes to pass that the rocks are full of metal  but all of a sudden somebody shut off the steam below and the hole was left empty in an instant  and then down rushed the water into the hole in such a whirlpool that the bogy spun round and round as fast as a teetotum  but that was all in his days work like a fair fall with the hounds so all he did was to say to tom   now is your time youngster to get down if you are in earnest which i dont believe  youll soon see said tom and away he went as bold as baron munchausen and shot down the rushing cataract like a salmon at ballisodare  and when he got to the bottom he swam till he was washed on shore safe upon the otherendofnowhere and he found it to his surprise as most other people do much more like thisendof somewhere than he had been in the habit of expecting  and first he went through wastepaperland where all the stupid books lie in heaps up hill and down dale like leaves in a winter wood and there he saw people digging and grubbing among them to make worse books out of bad ones and thrashing chaff to save the dust of it and a very good trade they drove thereby especially among children  then he went by the sea of slops to the mountain of messes and the territory of tuck where the ground was very sticky for it was all made of bad toffee not everton toffee of course and full of deep cracks and holes choked with windfallen fruit and green gooseberries and sloes and crabs and whinberries and hips and haws and all the nasty things which little children will eat if they can get them  but the fairies hide them out of the way in that country as fast as they can and very hard work they have and of very little use it is  for as fast as they hide away the old trash foolish and wicked people make fresh trash full of lime and poisonous paints and actually go and steal receipts out of old madame sciences big book to invent poisons for little children and sell them at wakes and fairs and tuckshops  very well  let them go on  dr letheby and dr hassall cannot catch them though they are setting traps for them all day long  but the fairy with the birchrod will catch them all in time and make them begin at one corner of their shops and eat their way out at the other  by which time they will have got such stomachaches as will cure them of poisoning little children  next he saw all the little people in the world writing all the little books in the world about all the other little people in the world probably because they had no great people to write about and if the names of the books were not squeeky nor the pump lighter nor the narrow narrow world nor the hills of the chattermuch nor the childrens twaddeday why then they were something else  and all the rest of the little people in the world read the books and thought themselves each as good as the president and perhaps they were right for every one knows his own business best  but tom thought he would sooner have a jolly good fairy tale about jack the giantkiller or beauty and the beast which taught him something that he didnt know already  and next he came to the centre of creation the hub they call it there which lies in latitude 4221 degrees south and longitude 10856 degrees east  and there he found all the wise people instructing mankind in the science of spiritrapping while their house was burning over their heads  and when tom told them of the fire they held an indignation meeting forthwith and unanimously determined to hang toms dog for coming into their country with gunpowder in his mouth  tom couldnt help saying that though they did fancy they had carried all the wit away with them out of lincolnshire two hundred years ago yet if they had had one such lincolnshire nobleman among them as good old lord yarborough he would have called for the fireengines before he hanged other peoples dogs but it was of no use and the dog was hanged  and tom couldnt even have his carcase for they had abolished the havehiscarcase act in that country for fear lest when rogues fell out honest men should come by their own  and so they would have succeeded perfectly as they always do only that as they also always do they failed in one little particular viz that the dog would not die being a waterdog but bit their fingers so abominably that they were forced to let him go and tom likewise as british subjects  whereon they recommenced rapping for the spirits of their fathers and very much astonished the poor old spirits were when they came and saw how according to the laws of mrs bedonebyasyoudid their descendants had weakened their constitution by hard living  then came tom to the island of polupragmosyne which some call rogues harbour but they are wrong for that is in the middle of bramshill bushes and the county police have cleared it out long ago  there every one knows his neighbours business better than his own and a very noisy place it is as might be expected considering that all the inhabitants are ex officio on the wrong side of the house in the parliament of man and the federation of the world and are always making wry mouths and crying that the fairies grapes were sour  there tom saw ploughs drawing horses nails driving hammers birds nests taking boys books making authors bulls keeping chinashops monkeys shaving cats dead dogs drilling live lions blind brigadiers shelfed as principals of colleges playactors not in the least shelfed as popular preachers and in short every one set to do something which he had not learnt because in what he had learnt or pretended to learn he had failed  there stands the pantheon of the great unsuccessful from the builders of the tower of babel to those of the trafalgar fountains in which politicians lecture on the constitutions which ought to have marched conspirators on the revolutions which ought to have succeeded economists on the schemes which ought to have made every ones fortune and projectors on the discoveries which ought to have set the thames on fire  there cobblers lecture on orthopedy whatsoever that may be because they cannot sell their shoes and poets on aesthetics whatsoever that may be because they cannot sell their poetry  there philosophers demonstrate that england would be the freest and richest country in the world if she would only turn papist again pennyaliners abuse the times because they have not wit enough to get on its staff and young ladies walk about with lockets of charles the firsts hair or of somebody elses when the jews genuine stock is used up inscribed with the neat and appropriate legendwhich indeed is popular through all that land and which i hope you will learn to translate in due time and to perpend likewise   victrix causa diis placuit sed victa puellis   when he got into the middle of the town they all set on him at once to show him his way or rather to show him that he did not know his way for as for asking him what way he wanted to go no one ever thought of that  but one pulled him hither and another poked him thither and a third cried   you mustnt go west i tell you it is destruction to go west  but i am not going west as you may see said tom  and another the east lies here my dear i assure you this is the east  but i dont want to go east said tom  well then at all events whichever way you are going you are going wrong cried they all with one voicewhich was the only thing which they ever agreed about and all pointed at once to all the thirtyandtwo points of the compass till tom thought all the signposts in england had got together and fallen fighting  and whether he would have ever escaped out of the town it is hard to say if the dog had not taken it into his head that they were going to pull his master in pieces and tackled them so sharply about the gastrocnemius muscle that he gave them some business of their own to think of at last and while they were rubbing their bitten calves tom and the dog got safe away  on the borders of that island he found gotham where the wise men live the same who dragged the pond because the moon had fallen into it and planted a hedge round the cuckoo to keep spring all the year  and he found them bricking up the town gate because it was so wide that little folks could not get through  and when he asked why they told him they were expanding their liturgy  so he went on for it was no business of his  only he could not help saying that in his country if the kitten could not get in at the same hole as the cat she might stay outside and mew  but he saw the end of such fellows when he came to the island of the golden asses where nothing but thistles grow  for there they were all turned into mokes with ears a yard long for meddling with matters which they do not understand as lucius did in the story and like him mokes they must remain till by the laws of development the thistles develop into roses  till then they must comfort themselves with the thought that the longer their ears are the thicker their hides and so a good beating dont hurt them  then came tom to the great land of hearsay in which are no less than thirty and odd kings beside half a dozen republics and perhaps more by next mail  and there he fell in with a deep dark deadly and destructive war waged by the princes and potentates of those parts both spiritual and temporal against what do you think  one thing i am sure of  that unless i told you you would never know nor how they waged that war either for all their strategy and art military consisted in the safe and easy process of stopping their ears and screaming oh dont tell us and then running away  so when tom came into that land he found them all high and low man woman and child running for their lives day and night continually and entreating not to be told they didnt know what only the land being an island and they having a dislike to the water being a musty lot for the most part they ran round and round the shore for ever which as the island was exactly of the same circumference as the planet on which we have the honour of living was hard work especially to those who had business to look after  but before them as bandmaster and fugleman ran a gentleman shearing a pig the melodious strains of which animal led them for ever if not to conquest still to flight and kept up their spirits mightily with the thought that they would at least have the pigs wool for their pains  and running after them day and night came such a poor lean seedy hardworked old giant as ought to have been cockered up and had a good dinner given him and a good wife found him and been set to play with little children and then he would have been a very presentable old fellow after all for he had a heart though it was considerably overgrown with brains  he was made up principally of fish bones and parchment put together with wire and canada balsam and smelt strongly of spirits though he never drank anything but water  but spirits he used somehow there was no denying  he had a great pair of spectacles on his nose and a butterflynet in one hand and a geological hammer in the other and was hung all over with pockets full of collecting boxes bottles microscopes telescopes barometers ordnance maps scalpels forceps photographic apparatus and all other tackle for finding out everything about everything and a little more too  and most strange of all he was running not forwards but backwards as fast as he could  away all the good folks ran from him except tom who stood his ground and dodged between his legs and the giant when he had passed him looked down and cried as if he was quite pleased and comforted   what who are you  and you actually dont run away like all the rest  but he had to take his spectacles off tom remarked in order to see him plainly  tom told him who he was and the giant pulled out a bottle and a cork instantly to collect him with  but tom was too sharp for that and dodged between his legs and in front of him and then the giant could not see him at all  no no no said tom ive not been round the world and through the world and up to mother careys haven beside being caught in a net and called a holothurian and a cephalopod to be bottled up by any old giant like you  and when the giant understood what a great traveller tom had been he made a truce with him at once and would have kept him there to this day to pick his brains so delighted was he at finding any one to tell him what he did not know before  ah you lucky little dog said he at last quite simplyfor he was the simplest pleasantest honestest kindliest old dominie sampson of a giant that ever turned the world upside down without intending itah you lucky little dog  if i had only been where you have been to see what you have seen  well said tom if you want to do that you had best put your head under water for a few hours as i did and turn into a water baby or some other baby and then you might have a chance  turn into a baby eh  if i could do that and know what was happening to me for but one hour i should know everything then and be at rest  but i cant i cant be a little child again and i suppose if i could it would be no use because then i should then know nothing about what was happening to me  ah you lucky little dog said the poor old giant  but why do you run after all these poor people said tom who liked the giant very much  my dear its they that have been running after me father and son for hundreds and hundreds of years throwing stones at me till they have knocked off my spectacles fifty times and calling me a malignant and a turbaned turk who beat a venetian and traduced the stategoodness only knows what they mean for i never read poetry and hunting me round and roundthough catch me they cant for every time i go over the same ground i go the faster and grow the bigger  while all i want is to be friends with them and to tell them something to their advantage like mr joseph ady  only somehow they are so strangely afraid of hearing it  but i suppose i am not a man of the world and have no tact  but why dont you turn round and tell them so  because i cant  you see i am one of the sons of epimetheus and must go backwards if i am to go at all  but why dont you stop and let them come up to you  why my dear only think  if i did all the butterflies and cockyolybirds would fly past me and then i should catch no more new species and should grow rusty and mouldy and die  and i dont intend to do that my dear for i have a destiny before me they say  though what it is i dont know and dont care  dont care said tom  no  do the duty which lies nearest you and catch the first beetle you come across is my motto and i have thriven by it for some hundred years  now i must go on  dear me while i have been talking to you at least nine new species have escaped me  and on went the giant behind before like a bull in a chinashop till he ran into the steeple of the great idol temple for they are all idolaters in those parts of course else they would never be afraid of giants and knocked the upper half clean off hurting himself horribly about the small of the back  but little he cared for as soon as the ruins of the steeple were well between his legs he poked and peered among the falling stones and shifted his spectacles and pulled out his pocket magnifier and cried   an entirely new oniscus and three obscure podurellae  besides a moth which m le roi des papillons though he like all frenchmen is given to hasty inductions says is confined to the limits of the glacial drift  this is most important  and down he sat on the nave of the temple not being a man of the world to examine his podurellae  whereon as was to be expected the roof caved in bodily smashing the idols and sending the priests flying out of doors and windows like rabbits out of a burrow when a ferret goes in  but he never heeded for out of the dust flew a bat and the giant had him in a moment  dear me  this is even more important  here is a cognate species to that which macgilliwaukie brown insists is confined to the buddhist temples of little thibet and now when i look at it it may be only a variety produced by difference of climate  and having bagged his bat up he got and on he went while all the people ran being in none the better humour for having their temple smashed for the sake of three obscure species of podurella and a buddhist bat  well thought tom this is a very pretty quarrel with a good deal to be said on both sides  but it is no business of mine  and no more it was because he was a waterbaby and had the original sow by the right ear which you will never have unless you be a baby whether of the water the land or the air matters not provided you can only keep on continually being a baby  so the giant ran round after the people and the people ran round after the giant and they are running unto this day for aught i know or do not know and will run till either he or they or both turn into little children  and then as shakespeare says and therefore it must be true    jack shall have gill nought shall go ill the man shall have his mare again and all go well   then tom came to a very famous island which was called in the days of the great traveller captain gulliver the isle of laputa but mrs bedonebyasyoudid has named it over again the isle of tomtoddies all heads and no bodies  and when tom came near it he heard such a grumbling and grunting and growling and wailing and weeping and whining that he thought people must be ringing little pigs or cropping puppies ears or drowning kittens  but when he came nearer still he began to hear words among the noise which was the tomtoddies song which they sing morning and evening and all night too to their great idol examination    i cant learn my lesson  the examiners coming   and that was the only song which they knew  and when tom got on shore the first thing he saw was a great pillar on one side of which was inscribed playthings not allowed here at which he was so shocked that he would not stay to see what was written on the other side  then he looked round for the people of the island  but instead of men women and children he found nothing but turnips and radishes beet and mangold wurzel without a single green leaf among them and half of them burst and decayed with toadstools growing out of them  those which were left began crying to tom in half a dozen different languages at once and all of them badly spoken i cant learn my lesson do come and help me  and one cried can you show me how to extract this square root  and another can you tell me the distance between alpha lyrae and beta camelopardis  and another what is the latitude and longitude of snooksville in nomans county oregon us  and another what was the name of mutius scaevolas thirteenth cousins grandmothers maids cat  and another how long would it take a schoolinspector of average activity to tumble head over heels from london to york  and another can you tell me the name of a place that nobody ever heard of where nothing ever happened in a country which has not been discovered yet  and another can you show me how to correct this hopelessly corrupt passage of graidiocolosyrtus tabenniticus on the cause why crocodiles have no tongues  and so on and so on and so on till one would have thought they were all trying for tidewaiters places or cornetcies in the heavy dragoons  and what good on earth will it do you if i did tell you quoth tom  well they didnt know that  all they knew was the examiner was coming  then tom stumbled on the hugest and softest nimblecomequick turnip you ever saw filling a hole in a crop of swedes and it cried to him can you tell me anything at all about anything you like  about what says tom  about anything you like for as fast as i learn things i forget them again  so my mamma says that my intellect is not adapted for methodic science and says that i must go in for general information  tom told him that he did not know general information nor any officers in the army only he had a friend once that went for a drummer  but he could tell him a great many strange things which he had seen in his travels  so he told him prettily enough while the poor turnip listened very carefully and the more he listened the more he forgot and the more water ran out of him  tom thought he was crying  but it was only his poor brains running away from being worked so hard and as tom talked the unhappy turnip streamed down all over with juice and split and shrank till nothing was left of him but rind and water whereat tom ran away in a fright for he thought he might be taken up for killing the turnip  but on the contrary the turnips parents were highly delighted and considered him a saint and a martyr and put up a long inscription over his tomb about his wonderful talents early development and unparalleled precocity  were they not a foolish couple  but there was a still more foolish couple next to them who were beating a wretched little radish no bigger than my thumb for sullenness and obstinacy and wilful stupidity and never knew that the reason why it couldnt learn or hardly even speak was that there was a great worm inside it eating out all its brains but even they are no foolisher than some hundred score of papas and mammas who fetch the rod when they ought to fetch a new toy and send to the dark cupboard instead of to the doctor  tom was so puzzled and frightened with all he saw that he was longing to ask the meaning of it and at last he stumbled over a respectable old stick lying half covered with earth  but a very stout and worthy stick it was for it belonged to good roger ascham in old time and had carved on its head king edward the sixth with the bible in his hand  you see said the stick there were as pretty little children once as you could wish to see and might have been so still if they had been only left to grow up like human beings and then handed over to me but their foolish fathers and mothers instead of letting them pick flowers and make dirtpies and get birds nests and dance round the gooseberry bush as little children should kept them always at lessons working working working learning weekday lessons all weekdays and sunday lessons all sunday and weekly examinations every saturday and monthly examinations every month and yearly examinations every year everything seven times over as if once was not enough and enough as good as a feasttill their brains grew big and their bodies grew small and they were all changed into turnips with little but water inside and still their foolish parents actually pick the leaves off them as fast as they grow lest they should have anything green about them  ah said tom if dear mrs doasyouwouldbedoneby knew of it she would send them a lot of tops and balls and marbles and ninepins and make them all as jolly as sandboys  it would be no use said the stick  they cant play now if they tried  dont you see how their legs have turned to roots and grown into the ground by never taking any exercise but sapping and moping always in the same place  but here comes the examiner ofallexaminers  so you had better get away i warn you or he will examine you and your dog into the bargain and set him to examine all the other dogs and you to examine all the other water babies  there is no escaping out of his hands for his nose is nine thousand miles long and can go down chimneys and through keyholes upstairs downstairs in my ladys chamber examining all little boys and the little boys tutors likewise  but when he is thrashedso mrs bedonebyasyoudid has promised mei shall have the thrashing of him  and if i dont lay it on with a will its a pity  tom went off  but rather slowly and surlily for he was somewhat minded to face this same examinerofallexaminers who came striding among the poor turnips binding heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and laying them on little childrens shoulders like the scribes and pharisees of old and not touching the same with one of his fingers for he had plenty of money and a fine house to live in and so forth which was more than the poor little turnips had  but when he got near he looked so big and burly and dictatorial and shouted so loud to tom to come and be examined that tom ran for his life and the dog too  and really it was time for the poor turnips in their hurry and fright crammed themselves so fast to be ready for the examiner that they burst and popped by dozens all round him till the place sounded like aldershot on a field day and tom thought he should be blown into the air dog and all  as he went down to the shore he passed the poor turnips new tomb but mrs bedonebyasyoudid had taken away the epitaph about talents and precocity and development and put up one of her own instead which tom thought much more sensible   instruction sore long time i bore and cramming was in vain till heaven did please my woes to ease with water on the brain   so tom jumped into the sea and swam on his way singing   farewell tomtoddies all i thank my stars that nought i know save those three royal rs reading and riting sure with rithmetick will help a lad of sense through thin and thick   whereby you may see that tom was no poet  but no more was john bunyan though he was as wise a man as you will meet in a month of sundays  and next he came to oldwivesfabledom where the folks were all heathens and worshipped a howling ape  and there he found a little boy sitting in the middle of the road and crying bitterly  what are you crying for said tom  because i am not as frightened as i could wish to be  not frightened  you are a queer little chap  but if you want to be frightened here goesboo  ah said the little boy that is very kind of you but i dont feel that it has made any impression  tom offered to upset him punch him stamp on him fettle him over the head with a brick or anything else whatsoever which would give him the slightest comfort  but he only thanked tom very civilly in fine long words which he had heard other folk use and which therefore he thought were fit and proper to use himself and cried on till his papa and mamma came and sent off for the powwow man immediately  and a very goodnatured gentleman and lady they were though they were heathens and talked quite pleasantly to tom about his travels till the powwow man arrived with his thunderbox under his arm  and a wellfed illfavoured gentleman he was as ever served her majesty at portland  tom was a little frightened at first for he thought it was grimes  but he soon saw his mistake  for grimes always looked a man in the face and this fellow never did  and when he spoke it was fire and smoke and when he sneezed it was squibs and crackers and when he cried which he did whenever it paid him it was boiling pitch and some of it was sure to stick  here we are again cried he like the clown in a pantomime  so you cant feel frightened my little deareh  ill do that for you  ill make an impression on you  yah  boo  whirroo hullabaloo  and he rattled thumped brandished his thunderbox yelled shouted raved roared stamped and danced corrobory like any black fellow and then he touched a spring in the thunderbox and out popped turnipghosts and magiclanthorns and pasteboard bogies and springheeled jacks and sallaballas with such a horrid din clatter clank roll rattle and roar that the little boy turned up the whites of his eyes and fainted right away  and at that his poor heathen papa and mamma were as much delighted as if they had found a gold mine and fell down upon their knees before the powwow man and gave him a palanquin with a pole of solid silver and curtains of cloth of gold and carried him about in it on their own backs  but as soon as they had taken him up the pole stuck to their shoulders and they could not set him down any more but carried him on willynilly as sinbad carried the old man of the sea  which was a pitiable sight to see for the father was a very brave officer and wore two swords and a blue button and the mother was as pretty a lady as ever had pinched feet like a chinese  but you see they had chosen to do a foolish thing just once too often so by the laws of mrs bedonebyasyoudid they had to go on doing it whether they chose or not till the coming of the cocqcigrues  ah dont you wish that some one would go and convert those poor heathens and teach them not to frighten their little children into fits  now then said the powwow man to tom wouldnt you like to be frightened my little dear  for i can see plainly that you are a very wicked naughty graceless reprobate boy  youre another quoth tom very sturdily  and when the man ran at him and cried boo  tom ran at him in return and cried boo likewise right in his face and set the little dog upon him and at his legs the dog went  at which if you will believe it the fellow turned tail thunderbox and all with a woof like an old sow on the common and ran for his life screaming help thieves murder fire  he is going to kill me  i am a ruined man  he will murder me and break burn and destroy my precious and invaluable thunderbox and then you will have no more thundershowers in the land  help help help  at which the papa and mamma and all the people of oldwivesfabledom flew at tom shouting oh the wicked impudent hardhearted graceless boy  beat him kick him shoot him drown him hang him burn him and so forth  but luckily they had nothing to shoot hang or burn him with for the fairies had hid all the killing tackle out of the way a little while before so they could only pelt him with stones and some of the stones went clean through him and came out the other side  but he did not mind that a bit for the holes closed up again as fast as they were made because he was a waterbaby  however he was very glad when he was safe out of the country for the noise there made him all but deaf  then he came to a very quiet place called leaveheavenalone  and there the sun was drawing water out of the sea to make steam threads and the wind was twisting them up to make cloudpatterns till they had worked between them the loveliest wedding veil of chantilly lace and hung it up in their own crystal palace for any one to buy who could afford it while the good old sea never grudged for she knew they would pay her back honestly  so the sun span and the wind wove and all went well with the great steam loom as is likely consideringand consideringand considering   and at last after innumerable adventures each more wonderful than the last he saw before him a huge building much bigger andwhat is most surprisinga little uglier than a certain new lunatic asylum but not built quite of the same materials  none of it at leastor indeed for aught that i ever saw any part of any other building whatsoeveris cased with nineinch brick inside and out and filled up with rubble between the walls in order that any gentleman who has been confined during her majestys pleasure may be unconfined during his own pleasure and take a walk in the neighbouring park to improve his spirits after an hours light and wholesome labour with his dinnerfork or one of the legs of his iron bedstead  no  the walls of this building were built on an entirely different principle which need not be described as it has not yet been discovered  tom walked towards this great building wondering what it was and having a strange fancy that he might find mr grimes inside it till he saw running toward him and shouting stop three or four people who when they came nearer were nothing else than policemens truncheons running along without legs or arms  tom was not astonished  he was long past that  besides he had seen the naviculae in the water move nobody knows how a hundred times without arms or legs or anything to stand in their stead neither was he frightened for he had been doing no harm  so he stopped and when the foremost truncheon came up and asked his business he showed mother careys pass and the truncheon looked at it in the oddest fashion for he had one eye in the middle of his upper end so that when he looked at anything being quite stiff he had to slope himself and poke himself till it was a wonder why he did not tumble over but being quite full of the spirit of justice as all policemen and their truncheons ought to be he was always in a position of stable equilibrium whichever way he put himself  all rightpass on said he at last  and then he added  i had better go with you young man  and tom had no objection for such company was both respectable and safe so the truncheon coiled its thong neatly round its handle to prevent tripping itself upfor the thong had got loose in runningand marched on by toms side  why have you no policeman to carry you asked tom after a while  because we are not like those clumsymade truncheons in the land world which cannot go without having a whole man to carry them about  we do our own work for ourselves and do it very well though i say it who should not  then why have you a thong to your handle asked tom  to hang ourselves up by of course when we are off duty  tom had got his answer and had no more to say till they came up to the great iron door of the prison  and there the truncheon knocked twice with its own head  a wicket in the door opened and out looked a tremendous old brass blunderbuss charged up to the muzzle with slugs who was the porter and tom started back a little at the sight of him  what case is this he asked in a deep voice out of his broad bell mouth  if you please sir it is no case only a young gentleman from her ladyship who wants to see grimes the mastersweep  grimes said the blunderbuss  and he pulled in his muzzle perhaps to look over his prisonlists  grimes is up chimney no 345 he said from inside  so the young gentleman had better go on to the roof  tom looked up at the enormous wall which seemed at least ninety miles high and wondered how he should ever get up  but when he hinted that to the truncheon it settled the matter in a moment for it whisked round and gave him such a shove behind as sent him up to the roof in no time with his little dog under his arm  and there he walked along the leads till he met another truncheon and told him his errand  very good it said  come along  but it will be of no use  he is the most unremorseful hardhearted foulmouthed fellow i have in charge and thinks about nothing but beer and pipes which are not allowed here of course  so they walked along over the leads and very sooty they were and tom thought the chimneys must want sweeping very much  but he was surprised to see that the soot did not stick to his feet or dirty them in the least  neither did the live coals which were lying about in plenty burn him for being a waterbaby his radical humours were of a moist and cold nature as you may read at large in lemnius cardan van helmont and other gentlemen who knew as much as they could and no man can know more  and at last they came to chimney no 345  out of the top of it his head and shoulders just showing stuck poor mr grimes so sooty and bleared and ugly that tom could hardly bear to look at him  and in his mouth was a pipe but it was not alight though he was pulling at it with all his might  attention mr grimes said the truncheon here is a gentleman come to see you  but mr grimes only said bad words and kept grumbling my pipe wont draw  my pipe wont draw  keep a civil tongue and attend said the truncheon and popped up just like punch hitting grimes such a crack over the head with itself that his brains rattled inside like a dried walnut in its shell  he tried to get his hands out and rub the place  but he could not for they were stuck fast in the chimney  now he was forced to attend  hey he said why its tom  i suppose you have come here to laugh at me you spiteful little atomy  tom assured him he had not but only wanted to help him  i dont want anything except beer and that i cant get and a light to this bothering pipe and that i cant get either  ill get you one said tom and he took up a live coal there were plenty lying about and put it to grimes pipe  but it went out instantly  its no use said the truncheon leaning itself up against the chimney and looking on  i tell you it is no use  his heart is so cold that it freezes everything that comes near him  you will see that presently plain enough  oh of course its my fault  everythings always my fault said grimes  now dont go to hit me again for the truncheon started upright and looked very wicked you know if my arms were only free you darent hit me then  the truncheon leant back against the chimney and took no notice of the personal insult like a welltrained policeman as it was though he was ready enough to avenge any transgression against morality or order  but cant i help you in any other way  cant i help you to get out of this chimney said tom  no interposed the truncheon he has come to the place where everybody must help themselves and he will find it out i hope before he has done with me  oh yes said grimes of course its me  did i ask to be brought here into the prison  did i ask to be set to sweep your foul chimneys  did i ask to have lighted straw put under me to make me go up  did i ask to stick fast in the very first chimney of all because it was so shamefully clogged up with soot  did i ask to stay herei dont know how longa hundred years i do believe and never get my pipe nor my beer nor nothing fit for a beast let alone a man  no answered a solemn voice behind  no more did tom when you behaved to him in the very same way  it was mrs bedonebyasyoudid  and when the truncheon saw her it started bolt uprightattentionand made such a low bow that if it had not been full of the spirit of justice it must have tumbled on its end and probably hurt its one eye  and tom made his bow too  oh maam he said dont think about me thats all past and gone and good times and bad times and all times pass over  but may not i help poor mr grimes  maynt i try and get some of these bricks away that he may move his arms  you may try of course she said  so tom pulled and tugged at the bricks  but he could not move one and then he tried to wipe mr grimes face  but the soot would not come off  oh dear he said  i have come all this way through all these terrible places to help you and now i am of no use at all  you had best leave me alone said grimes you are a goodnatured forgiving little chap and thats truth but youd best be off the hails coming on soon and it will beat the eyes out of your little head  what hail  why hail that falls every evening here and till it comes close to me its like so much warm rain  but then it turns to hail over my head and knocks me about like small shot  that hail will never come any more said the strange lady  i have told you before what it was  it was your mothers tears those which she shed when she prayed for you by her bedside but your cold heart froze it into hail  but she is gone to heaven now and will weep no more for her graceless son  then grimes was silent awhile and then he looked very sad  so my old mothers gone and i never there to speak to her  ah a good woman she was and might have been a happy one in her little school there in vendale if it hadnt been for me and my bad ways  did she keep the school in vendale asked tom  and then he told grimes all the story of his going to her house and how she could not abide the sight of a chimneysweep and then how kind she was and how he turned into a waterbaby  ah said grimes good reason she had to hate the sight of a chimneysweep  i ran away from her and took up with the sweeps and never let her know where i was nor sent her a penny to help her and now its too latetoo late said mr grimes  and he began crying and blubbering like a great baby till his pipe dropped out of his mouth and broke all to bits  oh dear if i was but a little chap in vendale again to see the clear beck and the appleorchard and the yewhedge how different i would go on  but its too late now  so you go along you kind little chap and dont stand to look at a man crying thats old enough to be your father and never feared the face of man nor of worse neither  but im beat now and beat i must be  ive made my bed and i must lie on it  foul i would be and foul i am as an irishwoman said to me once and little i heeded it  its all my own fault  but its too late  and he cried so bitterly that tom began crying too  never too late said the fairy in such a strange soft new voice that tom looked up at her and she was so beautiful for the moment that tom half fancied she was her sister  no more was it too late  for as poor grimes cried and blubbered on his own tears did what his mothers could not do and toms could not do and nobodys on earth could do for him for they washed the soot off his face and off his clothes and then they washed the mortar away from between the bricks and the chimney crumbled down and grimes began to get out of it  up jumped the truncheon and was going to hit him on the crown a tremendous thump and drive him down again like a cork into a bottle  but the strange lady put it aside  will you obey me if i give you a chance  as you please maam  youre stronger than methat i know too well and wiser than me i know too well also  and as for being my own master ive fared ill enough with that as yet  so whatever your ladyship pleases to order me for im beat and thats the truth  be it so thenyou may come out  but remember disobey me again and into a worse place still you go  i beg pardon maam but i never disobeyed you that i know of  i never had the honour of setting eyes upon you till i came to these ugly quarters  never saw me  who said to you those that will be foul foul they will be  grimes looked up and tom looked up too for the voice was that of the irishwoman who met them the day that they went out together to harthover  i gave you your warning then  but you gave it yourself a thousand times before and since  every bad word that you saidevery cruel and mean thing that you didevery time that you got tipsyevery day that you went dirtyyou were disobeying me whether you knew it or not  if id only known maam  you knew well enough that you were disobeying something though you did not know it was me  but come out and take your chance perhaps it may be your last  so grimes stepped out of the chimney and really if it had not been for the scars on his face he looked as clean and respectable as a mastersweep need look  take him away said she to the truncheon and give him his ticketofleave  and what is he to do maam  get him to sweep out the crater of etna he will find some very steady men working out their time there who will teach him his business  but mind if that crater gets choked again and there is an earthquake in consequence bring them all to me and i shall investigate the case very severely  so the truncheon marched off mr grimes looking as meek as a drowned worm  and for aught i know or do not know he is sweeping the crater of etna to this very day  and now said the fairy to tom your work here is done  you may as well go back again  i should be glad enough to go said tom but how am i to get up that great hole again now the steam has stopped blowing  i will take you up the backstairs  but i must bandage your eyes first for i never allow anybody to see those backstairs of mine  i am sure i shall not tell anybody about them maam if you bid me not  aha  so you think my little man  but you would soon forget your promise if you got back into the landworld  for if people only once found out that you had been up my backstairs you would have all the fine ladies kneeling to you and the rich men emptying their purses before you and statesmen offering you place and power and young and old rich and poor crying to you only tell us the great backstairs secret and we will be your slaves we will make you lord king emperor bishop archbishop pope if you likeonly tell us the secret of the backstairs  for thousands of years we have been paying and petting and obeying and worshipping quacks who told us they had the key of the backstairs and could smuggle us up them and in spite of all our disappointments we will honour and glorify and adore and beatify and translate and apotheotise you likewise on the chance of your knowing something about the backstairs that we may all go on pilgrimage to it and even if we cannot get up it lie at the foot of it and cry    oh backstairs precious backstairs invaluable backstairs requisite backstairs necessary backstairs goodnatured backstairs cosmopolitan backstairs comprehensive backstairs accommodating backstairs wellbred backstairs commercial backstairs economical backstairs practical backstairs logical backstairs deductive backstairs comfortable backstairs humane backstairs reasonable backstairs longsought backstairs coveted backstairs aristocratic backstairs respectable backstairs gentlenmanlike backstairs ladylike backstairs orthodox backstairs probable backstairs credible backstairs demonstrable backstairs irrefragable backstairs potent backstairs allbutomnipotent backstairs c   save us from the consequences of our own actions and from the cruel fairy mrs bedonebyasyoudid  do not you think that you would be a little tempted then to tell what you know laddie  tom thought so certainly  but why do they want so to know about the backstairs asked he being a little frightened at the long words and not understanding them the least as indeed he was not meant to do or you either  that i shall not tell you  i never put things into little folks heads which are but too likely to come there of themselves  so comenow i must bandage your eyes  so she tied the bandage on his eyes with one hand and with the other she took it off  now she said you are safe up the stairs  tom opened his eyes very wide and his mouth too for he had not as he thought moved a single step  but when he looked round him there could be no doubt that he was safe up the backstairs whatsoever they may be which no man is going to tell you for the plain reason that no man knows  the first thing which tom saw was the black cedars high and sharp against the rosy dawn and st brandans isle reflected double in the still broad silver sea  the wind sang softly in the cedars and the water sang among the eaves  the seabirds sang as they streamed out into the ocean and the landbirds as they built among the boughs and the air was so full of song that it stirred st brandan and his hermits as they slumbered in the shade and they moved their good old lips and sang their morning hymn amid their dreams  but among all the songs one came across the water more sweet and clear than all for it was the song of a young girls voice  and what was the song which she sang  ah my little man i am too old to sing that song and you too young to understand it  but have patience and keep your eye single and your hands clean and you will learn some day to sing it yourself without needing any man to teach you  and as tom neared the island there sat upon a rock the most graceful creature that ever was seen looking down with her chin upon her hand and paddling with her feet in the water  and when they came to her she looked up and behold it was ellie  oh miss ellie said he how you are grown  oh tom said she how you are grown too  and no wonder they were both quite grown uphe into a tall man and she into a beautiful woman  perhaps i may be grown she said  i have had time enough for i have been sitting here waiting for you many a hundred years till i thought you were never coming  many a hundred years thought tom but he had seen so much in his travels that he had quite given up being astonished and indeed he could think of nothing but ellie  so he stood and looked at ellie and ellie looked at him and they liked the employment so much that they stood and looked for seven years more and neither spoke nor stirred  at last they heard the fairy say  attention children  are you never going to look at me again  we have been looking at you all this while they said  and so they thought they had been  then look at me once more said she  they lookedand both of them cried out at once oh who are you after all  you are our dear mrs doasyouwouldbedoneby  no you are good mrs bedonebyasyoudid but you are grown quite beautiful now  to you said the fairy  but look again  you are mother carey said tom in a very low solemn voice for he had found out something which made him very happy and yet frightened him more than all that he had ever seen  but you are grown quite young again  to you said the fairy  look again  you are the irishwoman who met me the day i went to harthover  and when they looked she was neither of them and yet all of them at once  my name is written in my eyes if you have eyes to see it there  and they looked into her great deep soft eyes and they changed again and again into every hue as the light changes in a diamond  now read my name said she at last  and her eyes flashed for one moment clear white blazing light but the children could not read her name for they were dazzled and hid their faces in their hands  not yet young things not yet said she smiling and then she turned to ellie  you may take him home with you now on sundays ellie  he has won his spurs in the great battle and become fit to go with you and be a man because he has done the thing he did not like  so tom went home with ellie on sundays and sometimes on weekdays too and he is now a great man of science and can plan railroads and steamengines and electric telegraphs and rifled guns and so forth and knows everything about everything except why a hens egg dont turn into a crocodile and two or three other little things which no one will know till the coming of the cocqcigrues and all this from what he learnt when he was a waterbaby underneath the sea  and of course tom married ellie  my dear child what a silly notion  dont you know that no one ever marries in a fairy tale under the rank of a prince or a princess  and toms dog  oh you may see him any clear night in july for the old dogstar was so worn out by the last three hot summers that there have been no dogdays since so that they had to take him down and put toms dog up in his place  therefore as new brooms sweep clean we may hope for some warm weather this year  and that is the end of my story    moral    and now my dear little man what should we learn from this parable  we should learn thirtyseven or thirtynine things i am not exactly sure which  but one thing at least we may learn and that is thiswhen we see efts in the pond never to throw stones at them or catch them with crooked pins or put them into vivariums with sticklebacks that the sticklebacks may prick them in their poor little stomachs and make them jump out of the glass into somebodys workbox and so come to a bad end  for these efts are nothing else but the waterbabies who are stupid and dirty and will not learn their lessons and keep themselves clean and therefore as comparative anatomists will tell you fifty years hence though they are not learned enough to tell you now their skulls grow flat their jaws grow out and their brains grow small and their tails grow long and they lose all their ribs which i am sure you would not like to do and their skins grow dirty and spotted and they never get into the clear rivers much less into the great wide sea but hang about in dirty ponds and live in the mud and eat worms as they deserve to do  but that is no reason why you should illuse them  but only why you should pity them and be kind to them and hope that some day they will wake up and be ashamed of their nasty dirty lazy stupid life and try to amend and become something better once more  for perhaps if they do so then after 379423 years nine months thirteen days two hours and twentyone minutes for aught that appears to the contrary if they work very hard and wash very hard all that time their brains may grow bigger and their jaws grow smaller and their ribs come back and their tails wither off and they will turn into waterbabies again and perhaps after that into landbabies and after that perhaps into grown men  you know they wont  very well i daresay you know best  but you see some folks have a great liking for those poor little efts they never did anybody any harm or could if they tried and their only fault is that they do no goodany more than some thousands of their betters  but what with ducks and what with pike and what with sticklebacks and what with waterbeetles and what with naughty boys they are sae sair hadden doun as the scotsmen say that it is a wonder how they live and some folks cant help hoping with good bishop butler that they may have another chance to make things fair and even somewhere somewhen somehow  meanwhile do you learn your lessons and thank god that you have plenty of cold water to wash in and wash in it too like a true englishman  and then if my story is not true something better is and if i am not quite right still you will be as long as you stick to hard work and cold water  but remember always as i told you at first that this is all a fairy tale and only fun and pretence  and therefore you are not to believe a word of it even if it is true
